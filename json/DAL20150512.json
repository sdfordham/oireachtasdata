The Deputy is aware that I am required to review the FEMPI Acts annually.  My next review of the Acts is due to be carried out and a report laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of June this year.

Through the Haddington Road agreement and its predecessor, the Croke Park agreement,\u00a0and through the supporting FEMPI legislation public servants have made a significant contribution to our fiscal recovery, including\u00a0by way of \u00a0direct reductions in pay and pensions.  From 2009 to 2014 the cost to the Exchequer of public service pay was reduced by &euro;3.7 billion, or more than 21%.

I want to make it clear, however, that all public servants from the lowest paid to the highest paid have contributed to our economic recovery.  We designed the cuts imposed in the FEMPI Act I introduced in 2013 to be as progressive as possible.  We protected the core pay of 87% of public servants; that is those who earn less than &euro;65,000.  The Haddington Road agreement reiterates the commitment to give priority to those public servants on salaries of less than &euro;35,000.  The agreement also contains commitments to those who suffered an additional real pay cut in 2013 either through a direct cut in core pay or through the loss of the supervision and substitutions allowance paid to teachers.  The agreement is a collective agreement registered with the Labour Relations Commission and it contains detailed commitments on the restoration of those pay cuts.  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I will respect the terms of the collective agreement I solemnly entered into as should any person who respects the formal industrial relations processes of the State.<\/p>  <p>  My intention is that any agreement reached will maintain and build upon the productivity and other reforms delivered through earlier agreements, including the Haddington Road agreement, and secure an industrial relations framework that will foster and support further productivity and change in the workplace.  Reform is now a constant part of employment for public servants and is a central element of my strategy to deliver a public service that will in turn deliver improved outcomes for all stakeholders, including the business sector and every family in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200009#G00600","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1431438300,"counter":48,"content":"<p>The difficulty with the Minister's reply is that it jabs at an answer.  Previously, he has stood up in the House and given a commitment of sorts that those on lower incomes within the public service, including the Civil Service, would be prioritised.  Ever since he made that commitment, the Minister has studiously rowed back from it.  He says that every public servant has made a contribution.  Yes, they were all captured by the FEMPI legislation.  However, the big scandal in terms of the payment system within the public service is that there is a small minority at the top end who are outrageously overpaid by international standards while there is a set of people further down the chain who do not even earn the living wage.  Some 4,000 of them, in fact, rely on family income supplement.  When the Minister talks about winding back FEMPI and reinstating pay, he should start with that set of workers as a matter of logic as well as decency.

That is the reality and that is my record.  It is not the previous Government's record but my record. <\/p> <p> On pay comparisons, I am sure the Deputy has had an opportunity to look at the comparisons published by the CSO last week.  Up to 2006, the public service, on a pay comparison basis, was paid more than the private sector.  The snapshot of 2010 showed that situation no longer exists and that the public sector and the private sector were less than 1% apart.  However, where they were apart was in respect of the lowest cohort of workers in the public sector who were better paid than comparable workers in the private sector.  The highest half of public service workers were less well paid than their comparators in the private sector.

It makes for shocking reading, presents an appalling vista in terms of what happened at that hospital and raises a range of issues in terms of patient safety and the needless loss of lives of five young children and perhaps others of whom we are not aware.  The report is an extraordinary tribute to the perseverance and persistence of parents who faced obstruction after obstruction in their search for the truth.  Despite the latest attempt by the HSE to suppress this report, we witnessed its publication last week.<\/p>  <p>  It is evident from the report that patient safety was not a priority and that there were failures at local, regional and national level in regard to this issue.  What is extraordinary is the extent of the repeated warnings which time and again were not acted upon.  This morning I received a copy of an e-mail received by one of the parents involved.  This e-mail reveals systemic weaknesses and awareness of those weaknesses by senior people within the HSE.  Alarmingly, these weaknesses were identified not just in Portlaoise, but in almost every other site across the country.  This e-mail was sent by the Chair of the national incident management team, NIMT, to the director of patient safety.  In essence, he said that he knows the director is aware that the high rates of harm alluded to are reflective of what is occurring in other jurisdictions also and that the NIMT is aware of numerous sad and serious cases occurring at all HSE sites.<\/p><p>I will repeat that: \"The NIMT is aware of numerous sad and serious cases occurring at all HSE sites\".  This was known at a very senior level within the HSE.  Was the then Minister aware of the numerous sad and serious cases at the time?  Was the Government aware of what has essentially been revealed as a systemic patient safety issue?  I have repeatedly asked in the D&aacute;il when the national patient safety authority would be established but I have received no reply.<\/p> <p> Portlaoise was a band 3 hospital, which was confirmed by the Minister at an Oireachtas Committee meeting in 2011 and which means it was to be a 24-hour, 7-day, acute surgery, accident and emergency and maternity hospital.  As we know from the HIQA report the investigation team found that the hospital was neither governed, resourced nor equipped to safely deliver this level of clinical services.  Furthermore, in 2012 and 2013 the HSE had specifically identified clinical risks associated with surgery and emergency medicine, going as far as to say that surgical services at the hospital should cease.  Given that all this was known and given the decision of the Government to make it a band 3 hospital, why were the necessary resources for a band 3 hospital not allocated?  Why was the requisite funding that would have gone to other, similar level hospitals, not given?<\/p> <p> Given what we now know from the report that very senior people were aware of the systemic safety issues in Portlaoise, how does the Minister for Health ensure proper accountability and responsibility for the needless loss of so many young lives?  What steps does the Minister intend to take so that we will get accountability?  That is the least the families and parents in this situation deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200017#P01200","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431443400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Martin for his question.  I am sure that on a matter as serious and sensitive as this, nobody wants to make political point-scoring the objective of their questions.  I know that is not what Deputy Martin is doing.  For the families of the five little babies who are no longer with us, Katelyn Keenan-McCarthy, Nathan Molyneaux, Joshua Keyes, Mary Kate Kelly and Mark Molloy, it is obviously a tragedy.  The persistence and dedication of the parents in following this through has brought about a situation where the HIQA report has been made and published.  It is not the first HIQA report - there have been seven on various sensitive issues in the past number of years, such as on the misdiagnosis of breast cancer several years ago and on warnings about inadequacies in maternity services going back as far as 2006.  There will always be occasions when adverse incidents unfortunately arise in hospitals.  That is not confined to this country but happens in hospitals all over the world.  It is imperative that actions are taken to minimise that risk and to learn fully from errors where errors occur.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise the courage and dedication of the families involved in persisting and following through on this until the HIQA report was published.  The publication of the report is welcome and its eight recommendations are all accepted.  This will drive much needed improvements in Portlaoise and will have implications for the standards of local, regional and national services not just in maternity but in other sectors.  The very least the families who have spoken out here deserve is that the tragic legacy of what happened will be dealt with so that, in so far as is humanly possible, it should never happen again.  <\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Martin that this report raises issues of grave concern.  The fact that patients in their greatest hour of need were not treated with compassion, respect and dignity is an indictment of the health service in some locations.  The fact that, at HSE corporate level, patient safety is not given the highest priority is disturbing to put it mildly.  It is a fact that there are accountability and disciplinary procedures in respect of doctors and nurses but not in respect of management and that is why this report is lengthy and complicated and one on whose content the Minister for Health has to reflect very carefully.  At the very least a comprehensive response is required to ensure that a culture of patient safety is evident in the health service as a matter of absolute priority and it is not just a service that pays lip-service to patients and their requirements but one where the patient and the patient's needs are at its centre.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is engaging directly with the HSE directorate to ensure that the very serious findings of this report are addressed and, in accepting the eight recommendations of the report, that they are fully implemented and that other issues arising from it are dealt with appropriately.  Deputy Martin asked about resources and one would expect that.  It is not all about resources but it is in part about resources.  I have dealt with many health issues over the years and for many years there has been a failure to address fundamental questions about the nature, the structure and the kind of service we need for our people nationwide.  The Minister will have to bear this in mind as he looks at national, regional and local services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200018#Q00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1431443400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I am no wiser at the end of the Taoiseach's reply.  My opening question raised a very serious issue, revealed in the e-mail of December 2012 from the national incident management team to the director of patient safety.  It states that, \"The NIMT is aware of numerous sad and serious cases occurring at all HSE sites\".  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Health to come before the D&aacute;il and elaborate on that e-mail?  To what does it refer?  What are the systemic risks in sites across the country?  The public and parents are fed up of waiting three years to get answers, as they had to in the case of the HIQA report.  These are very serious issues.<\/p>  <p>  I am not raising the issue of funding, as one might do.  It was HIQA which raised it.  I quoted earlier from the Health Information and Quality Authority report, which states, \"the hospital is neither governed, resourced nor equipped to safely deliver this level of clinical services\".  Furthermore, the HSE itself, in 2012 and 2013, had specifically identified clinical risks associated with surgery and emergency medicine, going as far as to say that surgical services at the hospital should cease.  At the time of the publication of this report, however, the hospital continues to deliver those services.<\/p><p>In 2011, a Government intervention specified categorically that it was to be at this level at Bantry General Hospital.  However, there was no follow-through in terms of resources, governance or equipment to deliver the level of clinical services it would mean.  This core question must be answered.  What happened?  To what degree were the risks suppressed and why?  People at a very high level are commenting on the numerous sad cases all over the country.  Is it all being kept subterranean?  Were it not for the parents of the five babies concerned, we would never have had the HIQA report.  The e-mail was written five months before Mary Kate Kelly died and before the Portiuncula cases happened.  It is time, not to give the pat or formulaic reply as tends to happen on such occasions, but to use the HIQA report as a catalyst for coming clean on what is happening and calling it appropriately and properly, which has not been done to date.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach seems to be saying, as the Minister has said, that there will be no accountability on the management side.  It is not the classic tragedy.  These deaths should not have happened and could have been prevented had people acted on the concerns identified here.  Regarding prior consideration of these issues the e-mail states, \"on this basis a decision was made not to initiate a service safety review\".  The following question was put in the e-mail: \"Do you now think that a service safety review or a specific review of the overall performance of this service is required?\"  These are the people responsible for safety in the hospital and across the system.  They seem to be at sixes and sevens about what to do next.  This would have also gone elsewhere and others must have known about the very serious concerns that were being raised.  Was the Government aware of how serious the situation was in 2011 and 2012?

New management is in place in Portlaoise and a memorandum of understanding has been signed with the Coombe to establish the country's first managed clinical maternity network in the Dublin midlands hospitals group, which is important.  The quality and patient safety position in the hospital has been filled; risk management has been strengthened; on-site incident reporting has been introduced; 16 additional midwives are in place to reduce the ratio of midwives per baby born; and approval has been given for further midwifery posts to include shift leaders in delivery and posts in diabetics and ultrasonography.  The director of midwifery in place is seconded from the Coombe; a training and needs analysis was undertaken and a training plan has been developed with Athlone Institute of Technology; all midwifery staff have attended cardiotocography, CTG, training, which is important; guidelines are in place for oxytocin administration; and a programme of diagnosis and treatment for neonatal hip dysplasia has been implemented.  The national mandatory reporting of serious patient safety events is in place; an improved patient satisfaction survey completed in 2014 indicated that patients were much happier with the quality of the maternity services they receive in Portlaoise; the maternity service has developed a multidisciplinary communications guideline; and a mandatory multidisciplinary customer care workshop was provided.

I will return to the issue later.<\/p>  <p>  Now, I will deal with the refusal by the Irish banks to cut variable mortgage rates for struggling householders and to pass on the European Central Bank's reduction in interest rates.  On 30 April, the Taoiseach said it was unacceptable, and he has voiced similar sentiments for years.  However, yesterday, in a report to the Department of Finance, the Central Bank said it does not want powers to compel Irish banks to reduce variable mortgage interest rates.  The 300,000 mortgage holders will have received the news with utter dismay.  They know, and the Taoiseach knows, and we should be very clear about what is happening.  Although the ECB reduced its variable interest rates, the Irish banks have refused to pass the reduction on to households but are pocketing the money.  Irish mortgage holders are being ripped off by the banks while the Central Bank is refusing to protect them.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past four years, Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling on the Taoiseach to take action on this.  The Taoiseach must take the opportunity to state very clearly and robustly that he rejects the Central Bank's recommendations.  He must make it very clear that he will ensure the Central Bank takes on these new powers.  Will the Taoiseach assert clearly that he will ensure that mortgage holders who have been denied the benefit of the ECB reductions will, finally, be afforded some relief?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200019#R00900","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1431444600,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I have made it perfectly clear for quite some time that the Government is unhappy and finds it unacceptable that lending banks have not passed on the reduction in rates at which that they borrow to variable rate mortgage holders.

Deputy Gerry Adams is aware that neither the Central Bank nor the Government dictates what variable interest rates should be.  The Minister is returning from Brussels today from a Eurogroup meeting.  The Deputy seems to be quoting from the report in question which I have not received yet.  It has been received in the Department of Finance and I expect the Minister will have an opportunity to go through it this evening.  Obviously, he has made his intention clear of engaging with the banks, following receipt of the report, on variable mortgage interest rates.  Everyone knows that variable rate mortgage holders have struggled and are struggling in a very unfair position where the banks have not passed on rates that were reduced for themselves.  I suggest to the Deputy that it would be only appropriate for the Minister to assess and analyse the report which he asked the Central Bank to provide for him.  We will have an opportunity to discuss the report here in due course.

The State owns most of the banks.  Accordingly, what is required is necessary insolvency legislation to support struggling home owners and provide legal protection for the family home.  Citizens have been waiting for some time for the Government to introduce some proposals to deal with this crisis.  The stress and the anxiety visited on these families are very real.  Compare this with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s willingness to have all-night sittings and develop, under a Labour Party Minister, unprecedented new legislation which will allow the Government to pickpocket people&rsquo;s pensions, welfare benefits and salaries to pay its water taxes.  On the one hand, there is no problem with it bringing forward all of these measures when it comes to ordinary folks.

In addition, cuts to vital services in the educational system, such as the reduction of career guidance counsellors, mean that up to 200 second-level schools cannot provide one-to-one counselling as they did previously.  It was a reasonably good service up to some years ago, but that has now been removed.  This is one of the main reasons why 15,000 young people have dropped out of education and do not sit the leaving certificate examination.  This is happening annually.

By far the most important issue is the talent pool of young people coming through.  That is a combination coming out of the secondary system and engaging with business, institutes of technology or universities.  Firms and investors look at the range of talent of young Irish people who measure up to the highest standards.  I have seen evidence of this in talking to people about challenges in the software, pharma, robotics and electronic engineering sectors.  Young Irish people have introduced innovative changes that affect businesses in so many ways.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also referred to youth services, which are a matter for consideration by Ministers as they prepare for October's budget.

The world ahead is changing rapidly.

It has recently been ascertained that 2,000 students drop out of secondary education after just two years, which is alarming.  It is something we will have to address.  One in five students in the 13 to 15 age group are disengaging from education, so there is a need for corrective action to halt this worrying trend.<\/p>  <p>  Germany and some other continental countries have a scheme to identify problems facing students in the first and second years of secondary education.  Such students can be diverted to training centres to undertake trade apprenticeships while continuing their school education part-time.  The system operates for students who cannot adapt to full-time academic pursuits.  In that way, at 18 years of age, they are trained and available for employers who are seeking such people for the job market.  It is a good example of where Ireland should also be going in order to remedy this situation, particularly as our youth unemployment is exceedingly high.  It is currently one of the highest Europe and has been for some time.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, to the Department of Health with responsibility for drugs.  There is a need for a greater awareness of drug abuse across all age groups, but in particular for our youth.  Kerry Life Education is providing a mobile unit in the county to promote awareness of drug misuse.  The group's professional staff are doing Trojan work in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Kerry diocesan youth services have a mobile unit which visits all corners of the region.  It is essential to bring such technological facilities to remote areas.  The services provided by such mobile units could be replicated around the country.  I ask the Government to provide the necessary support to enable all these organisations to continue operating.<\/p><p>I hope the Cabinet, specifically the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, will approve the necessary funding in the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200021#T00500","speaker":"1050","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431445800,"counter":187,"content":"<p>The Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, knows about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200022#U00200","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1431445800,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Jimmy knows about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200022#U00300","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1431445800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Wanderly Wagon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200022#U00400","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1431445800,"counter":190,"content":"<p>The mandate of the Government was to fix the public finances and get the country back to work.

There are 81 questions of this type placed by Deputies today which were received on a weekly basis since that time and they have gathered on the Order Paper.  I delivered pre-Council and post-Council statements on the December 2014 European Council on 17 December and 27 January 2015, respectively, and pre-Council and post-Council statements on the March 2015 European Council on 11 March and 24 March, respectively.  It has not previously been the case that Deputies have had the opportunity to comment both before and after European Council meetings.  I have dealt with many of the issues raised in the questions today.  However, I am, of course, happy to go over this ground again with Deputies with respect to the questions they wish to ask today.<\/p>  <p>  I attended the European Council meeting on 19 December 2014 and reported to the House on it in my statement on 27 January.  The December European Council did not discuss or adopt conclusions on the Ebola crisis, Palestine, Syria or Egypt, or with regard to refugees from Africa and the Middle East.  There was no discussion about extreme right-wing racist groups or the growth of so-called anti-austerity parties in the European Union either in December or at other recent meetings of the European Council.  I attended the informal meeting of EU Heads of State and Government on 12 February.  The main issues were counter-terrorism, the situation in Ukraine and strengthening Economic and Monetary Union.  I had no formal bilateral meetings on the margins of that meeting; however, I did have an opportunity to engage in informal discussions with a number of colleagues, including the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, who at the time had just recently entered office.  Proposed military action by the United States against ISIS was not discussed at the February meeting.<\/p>  <p>  I attended the European Council on 19 and 20 March and reported to the House on the outcomes of that meeting in my statement on 24 March.  There were no discussions on the situation in Syria or about Israel and Palestine.  The agenda for the March meeting was prepared in the normal way.  President Tusk circulated an annotated draft agenda and draft conclusions which were then considered by COREPER and the General Affairs Council which was attended by the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy.  Ireland's views were contributed at each stage of the process.  I had no formal bilateral meetings at the March European Council, but I did, of course, see and speak to many of my counterpart leaders at the meeting.  There was an extraordinary meeting of the European Council on 23 April which was convened to address the migration crisis in the Mediterranean, which is still of great concern to everybody.  The European Central Bank interest rate was not discussed at the meeting because it was not called for that purpose.<\/p>  <p>  I will respond to questions about specific thematic areas which were recently addressed by the European Council.  I did not meet specifically Italian Prime Minister Renzi about the recent tragic incidents in the Mediterranean.  However, the Prime Minister and I both attended the extraordinary meeting of the European Council on 23 April.  I contributed to that meeting, as would be normal.  The scale of the recent tragic loss of life in the Mediterranean is appalling and shocking and underlines the importance of the European Union acting urgently and as one to address this complex ongoing crisis.  As we are in the House, people are walking from areas of strife and war, heading for borders in the hope they can make their way from Libya across the Mediterranean.  Foreign Ministers met together with Justice and Home Affairs Ministers before the extraordinary European Council and welcomed a ten point plan by the European Commission as the basis for further work in addressing the irregular flow of migration which has such serious consequences for many.  Tomorrow the Commission will publish its European agenda on migration which will propose a comprehensive approach to migration issues, including those highlighted by the European Council.<\/p>  <p>  At the extraordinary European Council I was pleased to be in a position to indicate that Ireland would contribute a naval vessel and crew to take part in humanitarian efforts, subject, of course, to the mandate and other legal issues being clarified.  This morning the Cabinet agreed to a memo from the Minister for Defence to approve this contribution.<\/p><p>The ship and its crew will make their way towards the Mediterranean in accordance with conditions and the understandings arrived at with our European colleagues.  I also indicated at the meeting that we had approved additional funding for the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN Relief and Works Agency.  That brings our total funding to those affected by the Syria crisis to &euro;41 million, which is a considerable allocation from a country of Ireland's size.  The issue of migration was also discussed in the context of the Libyan crisis at the March European Council.<\/p> <p> I was asked a question on the Juncker investment plan.  The December European Council, on which I reported, gave strong political backing to the investment plan put forward by Commission President Juncker and agreed that a European fund for strategic investments, or EFSI, should be established.  I am pleased to report that there has since been strong progress in establishing the EFSI.  Finance Ministers have agreed a general approach on the draft regulation and negotiations with the European Parliament are under way.  The March European Council reinforced its expectation that there will be political agreement on this by June.  I was also asked about the co-ordination of economic policy.  The December European Council reiterated the need for closer co-ordination of economic policies to ensure a smooth functioning of economic and monetary union.  It was agreed that the presidents of the European Council, Commission, ECB and Eurogroup, working together with the member states, will progress work in this area with a view to reporting to the European Council meeting in June.  The informal meeting of Heads of State and Government in February also considered this issue on the basis of an analytical note presented by Commission President Juncker.  A further two follow-up meetings to discuss preparations for the June European Council have been held at senior official level and another meeting will take place later this month.<\/p> <p> On tax, I note that the European Council in December reiterated the urgent need to advance efforts in the fight against tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning at both the EU and wider global level.  It also looked forward to the Commission's proposal on the automatic exchange of information on tax rulings in the EU.  The European Commission has since published its tax transparency package, which includes a legislative proposal on the automatic exchange of information on tax rulings.  Ireland supports the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities as an important tool in the fight against tax fraud and evasion and we look forward to its implementation at EU and global level.  Tax harmonisation was not discussed at the December European Council.  Ireland strongly opposes the harmonisation of tax rates as it would reduce the flexibility of member states, particularly smaller member states, to deploy taxation policy in support of broader economic policies.<\/p> <p> On the questions on energy, ensuring that Europe's citizens and businesses have a reliable, secure, affordable and sustainable supply of energy is one of the five priority strands of the strategic agenda agreed by the European Council in June last year.  The European Council in March discussed a number of concrete and measurable steps to deliver energy union and to ensure affordable, sustainable and secure energy for all member states.  The discussions focused on two key matters; enhancing energy security, and reaping the benefits of the internal energy market.  Diversifying the routes and sources of our energy and putting in place appropriate infrastructure to support that diversification are critical for Ireland.  At my instigation, a specific reference to peripheral regions was included in the section of the European Council conclusions dealing with infrastructure and interconnection in respect of energy.  With regard to implementing the energy union framework, the Commission is in the process of establishing a governance system in consultation with member states and will produce a state of the energy union report at the end of this year.<\/p> <p> The December European Council called on the EU and USA to make all efforts to conclude negotiations on an ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, by the end of 2015.  Since then, there have been two rounds of talks with the USA and a further negotiating round will take place before the summer.  Discussions on a number of areas are continuing and the basic architecture of the agreement is emerging.  During my visit to the USA for St. Patrick's Day, I reaffirmed to both President Obama and US trade representative, Mike Froman, Ireland's commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial and ambitious agreement.  I briefed my counterparts at the March European Council on these discussions on TTIP with US interlocutors.  The European Council discussed the state of play in the negotiations and agreed that the EU and the USA should make every effort to conclude negotiations on an ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial agreement by the end of the year.  The fear is that if the agreement is not concluded this year, it will be difficult to get a conclusion given the movement towards the American primaries and subsequent presidential election.  It was also agreed that member states and the Commission should step up efforts to communicate the benefits of the agreement and enhance dialogue with civil society.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m took part in a well attended seminar on TTIP in Dublin Castle on 27 March where an authoritative economic analysis of the very positive likely impact of an agreement on Ireland was launched.<\/p> <p> I was asked about retrospective capitalisation.  The possible use of the European Stability Mechanism for bank recapitalisation has not been raised at recent European Council meetings or in my contacts with ECB President Mario Draghi.  While direct recapitalisation by the ESM remains an option, I reiterate that it is no longer the only, or necessarily the best, option open to Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200022#U13900","answer":true,"speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431446400,"counter":323,"content":"<p>It was supposed to be seismic in 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200023#V00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1431446400,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Yes, but we have another option now and the Government will make a decision in the best interests of the taxpayers.

I regularly discuss Ireland's economic situation with European Council counterparts and I had the opportunity at the March European Council to outline our progress to date.  We have not discussed the Irish bank guarantee in recent contacts.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to Greece and Greek debt, I note the meeting yesterday on this.  I wrote to Alexis Tsipras in January to congratulate him on his election as Prime Minister of Greece and to wish him and his Government well.  I had a short informal discussion with Prime Minister Tsipras in the margins of the February meeting of Heads of State and Government and again in the margins of the March European Council.  As well as congratulating him again on his election, I indicated that I would be happy to welcome him to Ireland and to have further discussions about how we worked through and successfully emerged from our EU-IMF programme.  The December European Council did not consider the question of a possible change of government in Greece or issues relating to the Greek debt situation.  The informal meeting of the European Council in February received an update from the Eurogroup President on negotiations in relation to the Greek programme.  While the situation in Greece was not on the agenda of the March European Council, Prime Minister Tsipras met informally with the Presidents of the European Council, Commission, ECB and Eurogroup and the leaders of Germany and France to discuss how to make progress in the discussions on Greece's economic and financial situation.  All parties expressed full adherence to the Eurogroup statement of 20 February.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland, together with other euro area member states, understands and empathises with the difficult situation faced by the Greek people.  That is why there has been a willingness to negotiate a way forward which takes account of the realities of the situation in Greece and the political priorities of its new Government, which was elected by the people, while also respecting existing commitments.  Intensive negotiations on the Greek programme have been taking place in the Eurogroup and it is in all our interests that Greece remains in the euro area.  All members of the euro area, including Greece, have obligations and that is why all the parties signed up to the Eurogroup statement of 20 February, including the comprehensive list of reforms.  Progress in the discussions has been slow, however, and needs to be accelerated.<\/p><p>As a consequence, the situation of Greece's finances is very challenging, with immediate financing needs to be addressed now.  Therefore, urgent agreement of the necessary structural reforms is imperative to conclude the fifth review and release the associated disbursement.  As the House is aware, repayments are due in the very near future - this week in fact.  The Greek authorities are currently working with the institutions on the list of reforms.  Greece has committed to making its repayments.  Ireland does not support a writedown or cancellation of Greek debt.  There is, of course, room for manoeuvre in terms of maturity extension and other ways to reduce the burden of debt, which we have done in Ireland, in co-operation with our European partners.<\/p> <p> The situation in Ukraine and EU relations with Russia were discussed at the December European Council and the informal meeting of EU Heads of State and Government in February and again at the March European Council meeting.  The February meeting took place on the same day that agreement was reached in Minsk on a package of measures leading to the current ceasefire.  I joined with my counterparts in the European Council in welcoming this development and recognising the central role played by Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande.  People will have seen the statement from Chancellor Merkel at the recent press conference with President Putin.  Heads of State and Government also confirmed that decisions already taken on sanctions would remain in place.  At the March European Council, we agreed that the Minsk agreement remains the best prospect for the long-term resolution of the conflict in the region.  We decided that the sanctions against Russia should be clearly linked to the full implementation of the agreements and that we would keep this under close review over the coming months.  We will return to the issue at next month's meeting.  Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande set out their positions in their contributions to the meeting of the European Council.  I did not discuss the situation in Ukraine with either leader bilaterally.<\/p> <p> While Syria has not been on the agenda of recent European Council meetings, the March Foreign Affairs Council adopted a comprehensive regional strategy on Syria, Iraq and ISIS.  This sets out the EU's political and humanitarian strategy to address the impact of this conflict and to support conditions for a political framework to end it.<\/p> <p> In the margins of the December European Council and during a subsequent telephone conversation, I raised the issue of ECB support to the banking inquiry with ECB President Mario Draghi.  I also discussed the issue with former ECB President Jean Claude Trichet.  Mr. Draghi subsequently outlined the position of the ECB on his participation in the banking inquiry, which he also set out in a letter to Mr. Matt Carthy MEP in January.  He stated that owing to the ECB's accountability to the European institutions and primarily to the European Parliament, the ECB is not in a position to participate in formal inquiries conducted by national parliaments.  However, Mr. Draghi also confirmed that the ECB stood ready, in liaison with the Irish Parliament, to determine how best to interact on an informal basis, outside the context of the banking inquiry, as has been done with other national parliaments in the past.<\/p> <p> I was happy following the discussion with Mr. Trichet and, as the House is now aware, Mr. Trichet subsequently accepted an invitation to participate in an event in Dublin organised by the Institute for International and European Affairs, which took place in the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham on Thursday, 30 April.  Following a presentation, Mr. Trichet responded to a range of questions posed by members of the banking inquiry committee.<\/p> <p> I am sorry for the lengthy reply, but there were all of these questions which had backed up, some of which we have reported on both before and after European Council meetings since December. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200023#V00700","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431447000,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Four of six Members with questions are present.

N&iacute;l ciall ar bith ann leis seo.  T&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;anamh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht inniu maidir le ceisteanna a chur m&eacute; c&uacute;ig mh&iacute; &oacute; shin.  There needs to be a review of how Questions to the Taoiseach is structured.  This is not the first time this issue has been raised.  I have 20 questions.  Some of them concern events which occurred five months ago.  Things have changed in the meantime and the questions are no longer topical or current.  It is clear that I will not get through the 20 questions which I tabled.  I also had supplementary questions to all of them.  I would like to speak, if I can, and I will be brief as I can, on a number of the questions.<\/p>  <p>  Of huge importance is the Taoiseach's acknowledgment for the first time, to my knowledge, in this Chamber that the issue of bank recapitalisation has not been raised by the Taoiseach or his Government.  That is shocking news.  If the Taoiseach recalls June 2012, it was claimed that a deal hammered out at an EU Council meeting would allow banks to be bailed out directly using the European Stability Mechanism.  It was also claimed that the same measure could be applied retrospectively to this State.  The then T&aacute;naiste said on \"Morning Ireland\" that this news \"changes the game for us as far as bank debt is concerned\" and that the method of breaking that link can now be applied to Ireland.  The Taoiseach described the decision as a \"seismic shift\" in European policy.  I repeat, a seismic shift in European policy.<\/p>  <p>  Almost three years later, there has been no retrospective bank recapitalisation.  We know from correspondence received last August by Mr. Matt Carthy MEP from the managing director of the European Stability Mechanism that it was unlikely that the direct recapitalisation instrument would be used.  Critically, he said that any decision would relate to the circumstances in the requesting ESM member, which does not even arise, as we have made no request.  The issue has, therefore, not even been considered because to avail of this seismic shift and to avail of this game changer our Government would need to make the request.  Today we are told that this has not happened.<\/p>  <p>  We accuse the Taoiseach, at different times, of being compliant, rolling over and accepting the position.  The citizens of this State, who make up less than 1% of the EU population, have been burdened with 43% of the cost of the European banking crisis.  Citizens will be loaded for generations.  When none of us is even a memory, people will still be paying back this legacy of bad decisions made by EU bodies, the previous Fianna F&aacute;il led Government and the Taoiseach's Government.  Is ceist shimpl&iacute; at&aacute; agam.  Is it not true that we have now got clarity from the Taoiseach that he never applied for a retrospective bank recapitalisation and that he never had any intention of doing so?  This was all spin.  This was all soundbites and an attempt to influence public opinion.  Will the Taoiseach face up to that fact today and will he apologise, not least to his own electorate, the Labour Party electorate, the Fine Gael electorate and those people who voted for him, for misleading them on this matter?<\/p>  <p>  I will rest it there but I would like to think I will get to speak on the other two questions which are of huge importance.  These questions concern the Palestinian state and the dreadful plight of the refugees who are drowning daily in the Mediterranean Sea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200024#W00300","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1431447000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I have on many occasions offered the Deputies opposite the opportunity to table a priority question each week if that is what they wish to do-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200024#W00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1431447000,"counter":333,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200024#W00500","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1431447000,"counter":334,"content":"<p>-----rather than have these build up as has happened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200024#W00600","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1431447000,"counter":335,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach should stop talking nonsense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200024#W00700","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1431447000,"counter":336,"content":"<p>As I said in my opening remarks-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200024#W00800","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1431447000,"counter":337,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has said this for four years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200024#W00900","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1431447000,"counter":338,"content":"<p>-----but Deputy Martin never listens, we have reported both before and after the European Council meetings, which never happened before, to allow the Deputies to raise their cases.

As I said, this Government did not put a cent into Anglo Irish Bank - &euro;34 billion gone down the tubes, gone, lost to the taxpayer, to the next generation.  This Government has put in restructuring of &euro;30 billion.  We expect to get all of that back.<\/p>  <p>  There are two options to be considered here.  One is the decision of June of 2012, when the European Council agreed with my proposition that there should be a capacity and a facility for direct recapitalisation for countries like Ireland that were unfortunately first out of that gap.  The banking inquiry is doing its business at the moment in regard to other matters around that.  That position stands.  That decision still stands and has not been changed or altered in any way.  In fact, to use a phrase of the Deputy's own, I might say: \"It hasn't gone away, you know.\"  It is still there.  So, the question for the Government, Deputy Adams, is what is the best thing to do here in the interests of the Irish taxpayer.  The &euro;34 billion squandered by the previous Administration is dead, gone, washed away.  So, on behalf of the taxpayer in restructuring the banks - not for the banks' comfort, but for their customers' futures - that money was invested.  We expect to get all of that money back.<\/p>  <p>  So, what is the best thing to do?  We have put money into Bank of Ireland.  We have got back in excess of what was put in and we still own, on behalf of the people, a proportion of that bank.  The same applies in respect of the ownership of the vast majority of Allied Irish Banks.  The PTSB had its valuation at about &euro;2 billion recently.  The Minister for Finance is very clear that the Irish taxpayer will be able to recover all of that money, and possibly more, in the time ahead, so the question for the Government is what is the best option to choose here.  Is it to go the route of recapitalisation, which was made by the European Council on my proposition back in June of 2012, or is it to see what the valuations of the banks are and how those might be progressed in the interests of the Irish taxpayer?  So, instead of having one option, we now have two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200025#X01100","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1431447600,"counter":350,"content":"<p>What about retrospective recapitalisation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200025#X01200","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1431447600,"counter":351,"content":"<p>That is the point of the decision of June 2012, and that position is still unaltered.

It must be addressed.  These questions relate to Europe and I take the point about European statements, post and pre, but a backlog in questions to the Taoiseach is constantly building.  More time needs to be allowed for them and we should be allowed to asked topical questions to avoid a backlog building.  If the Taoiseach is committed to the democratic and political reform about which the Government promised so much, he should take this point on board.<\/p>  <p>  Is it not the case that Europe and European leaders are sleepwalking towards the possible break-up of the EU?  If that happens, responsibility will lie entirely with the EU's leaders and authorities, given their blind commitment to a failed and, in the case of Greece, vindictive policy of inflicting austerity on the most vulnerable and least well-off sectors of society.  The belligerence of the EU in wanting to continue inflicting these discredited policies on the Greek people, to the point of millions of ordinary Greeks experiencing extraordinary suffering, and the failure of the policy being self-evident mean that we are at the brink of the dominos within the EU falling.  Despite this, there is an utter complacency, behind which seems to be what cannot be described as anything other than a politically motivated vindictiveness towards any group of people who refuse, even in the smallest way, to accept crushing austerity.<\/p>  <p>  The issue that has brought us to the brink is the EU's determination to have Greece cut pensions, make it easier to fire workers and refuse to rehire workers into a public sector that has been slashed to pieces.  These are the points of conflict in doing a deal, with the EU saying \"No, no, no\" to a country that has been savaged, where the levels of suicide and poverty have gone through the roof and homelessness and despair are at extraordinary levels.  The EU says that, on top of this, Greece must cut pensions and under no circumstances restore jobs in the public sector.  This is appalling and has brought us to the brink.<\/p>  <p>  Is it not time for the Taoiseach to raise his voice against the madness of the central institutions and European leaders being singlehandedly responsible for beginning the break-up of the EU?<\/p><p>The other worrying feature, evident in Greece and now in Britain, is that different forms of disillusionment with and alienation from the centralised, autocratic and failed economic policies of the European Union are now leading to a very worrying rise in racism across Europe.  If in Greece the Syriza Government fails and is driven out and if there is a further economic collapse there, the beneficiary will be Golden Dawn.  That is not a pretty prospect.  In Britain, the beneficiary, to some extent at least, has been the vile UK Independence Party, UKIP.  I am glad it did not win as many seats as it had hoped.  These are people who have traded on racism and anti-immigrant sentiment.  Prime Minister Cameron, in order to try to see off the threat of UKIP, has moved in the direction of that sort of anti-immigrant rhetoric.  That is dangerous.  It is dangerously reminiscent of what happened in the 1930s and 1940s when economic crisis led to the rise of racism and xenophobia, with disastrous consequences.  Is the Taoiseach not worried that the policy failures in the European Union and the blind commitment to austerity could possibly break up the Union and lead to a worrying rise in racism?<\/p> <p> Mr. Ibrahim Halawa's sisters are in the Visitors Gallery.  I believe Deputy Paul Murphy has brought them in today.  As they are here, I wish to ask the Taoiseach, as I am sure will Deputy Murphy, what he is doing to secure the release of Ibrahim Halawa, an Irish citizen who is being tortured in Egyptian prisons and who has been framed, essentially in a politically trumped-up case against him, for doing nothing more than engaging in peaceful protest against what is a brutal and despotic regime, led by President el-Sisi.<\/p> <p> Films have been made about the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six and Irish citizens who languished in prison in Britain having been framed for political purposes although they committed no crimes.  Since we are all appalled that this would have been done to our citizens in the past, why are we, including the Taoiseach, not much more vocal and robust in demanding the release of Ibrahim Halawa and the lifting of the charges, which are clearly trumped up?  Mr. Halawa, along with hundreds of ordinary Egyptians, has been framed by a despotic, nasty government that is now in power in Egypt.  What is the Taoiseach doing about this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200025#X02900","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431448200,"counter":369,"content":"<p>The Deputy mentioned raising Topical Issue matters.  I have already said I am happy to take Priority Questions from Members if they want to submit them on a weekly basis and deal with others afterwards.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned the break-up of the European Union.  Clearly, this is a matter of very serious concern to leaders.  Prime Minister Tsipras has said that Greece does not want to leave the euro group and will not default on its responsibilities.  Given his statements in this regard, it is clear that the Government of Greece is now working with the institutions - I saw Mr. Dijsselbloem's comments yesterday - to arrive at a position where Greece can continue to be a valued member of the euro group and European Union and find a way of moving out of the very severe difficulties it faces.  I have mentioned the extension of maturity dates and a variety of other developments that could make it possible for it to do that.<\/p>  <p>  At the European Council meeting, in the presence of the Greek Prime Minister, there was very strong support for the view that every facility should be given to Greece to allow it to make its way.  The Deputy should remember that other taxpayers would be very heavily exposed if there were to be a write-down of Greek debt, as the Deputy is very well aware.  That is very clear from comments made by other leaders.  There is exceptional exposure, and I am not talking about Germany in this case.  In that sense, given the conviction and determination by Prime Minister Tsipras for Greece to succeed and play its part, I hope, based on the discussions that took place yesterday, arising from which there was a statement from the group last evening, that progress has been made.  The position is still very fragile and I hope an accommodation can be reached whereby Greece can continue to find a way to accept its responsibilities and play its part.  Every one of the other 27 states, whether in the euro group or eurozone or not, wants this to happen.  I have no doubt about the effect of the detailed discussions taking place at the official meetings.  I note that some changes have been made by the Greek Prime Minister himself and his negotiating team.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, the decision of the British people was not foreseen by political commentators, pollsters or those who know all the answers before they are decided.  The people made their decision.  For the first time in many years, they elected a Conservative Government with a majority vote.  I am sure there will be considerable analysis by pundits as to why people voted as they did.  I spoke to Prime Minister Cameron at the weekend and congratulated him on winning his election.  He had made a strong case at the European Council on many occasions regarding the unprecedented numbers of jobs created, the unprecedented scale of the opportunity for people in Britain to have a job of sustainable stature and make their way forward.  However, both the Prime Minister and I, in addition to all the other leaders, are very clear that freedom of movement is one of the central pillars or tenets of the European Union.  That has always been the way and it will continue.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to discussions that Prime Minister Cameron will have with President Junker, who has welcomed his re-election and who has said he will engage constructively with him, there is a very clear understanding from the European leaders of the importance of holding this Union together and reorganising it in a way that makes for efficiency of business, a true Singe Market, a single energy market and all of those other factors that have been the subject of discussion for a very long time but in respect of which a conclusion has not been reached in many cases.  Many, although not all, of the recommendations for improved efficiency, the elimination of red tape and more effective administration put forward by Prime Minister Cameron have strong support around the table.  To make this happen is the issue.  Freedom of movement is one of the central pillars and will remain so.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked about progress in respect of the Halawa case.  The objectives in this case are very clear.  The first is to see Mr. Halawa released by the Egyptian authorities so he can return to his family and studies here in Ireland.  The second is to provide consular support to secure his welfare while he remains in detention.  The considered approach and sustained action undertaken consistently by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, and his officials in this case have been such as to further those two objectives and, more important, avoid any action that could be counter-productive or detrimental to Mr. Halawa&rsquo;s best interests.  Having spoken to the Minister on many occasions about this, I fully support that approach.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to bear in mind the role of the Irish Government when citizens are imprisoned abroad.  Irrespective of any views regarding the fairness or appropriateness of any arrest abroad, the reality is that where an Irish citizen is charged with an offence under the law of a foreign country and is imprisoned in that country, it is the foreign law that applies and the relevant foreign court that decides on matters, such as bail and release.<\/p><p>The decision to release Mr. Halawa either on bail or any other basis will be made solely by the Egyptian authorities.  Since he was detained originally in August 2013 he has received consular visits on 37 occasions.  I can confirm that the Government has formally supported both the application of his lawyers for his release and return to Ireland under the November presidential decree and the more recent application for his release on bail.  Unfortunately, the application for his release on bail was rejected at the most recent hearing of his case.  Our officials support for his release has been duly committed to the Egyptian authorities in formal diplomatic notes that have been included in the documentation submitted to the court and the authorities by his lawyer.  The Minister has had continuous personal contract with his Egyptian counterpart.  <\/p> <p> The trial has started, with the next hearing scheduled for 3 June.  All of the information we have received indicates that it is highly unlikely there will be any decision on Mr. Halawa's release until the court makes its decisions.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to review the approach and actions in this case and the Government is guided, at all times, by the two central objectives set out.  Given that the trial has commenced, we have to exercise restraint in our public comment, as I do now.  This is entirely consistent with our approach to other consular cases, in line with our objective in this case and what we firmly believe to be in Mr. Halawa's best interests as a young man and what is most likely to contribute to a positive outcome for him.  All actions taken in the case are considered in the light of the objectives I have mentioned.  At this stage, while there is a specific application for Mr. Halawa's release on bail being considered by the judge, any inappropriate escalation of political intervention could well be counterproductive in pursuing our objectives in the case and Mr. Halawa's best interests in the achievement of a positive outcome.  We keep matters under review at all times.  It should also be noted that in none of the other cases involving foreign nationals was any individual released either on bail or otherwise while the original trial was being conducted.  We might bear this in mind.  <\/p> <p> I am happy with the approach the Minister is taking and the continuous actions both he and his officials are taking in Dublin and Cairo.  I can confirm for the House that no other consular case is receiving greater attention in the Department at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200026#Y00200","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431448800,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding what has been done - I accept that the officials are working very hard - it might be no harm if the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, flew to Cairo and met the Administration because these regimes act on a state-by-state basis.  I agree with other Deputies who have poured scorn on the quality and integrity of the judicial system that it operates.  We know this from even a cursory look at what has been going on in terms of the trial of opponents of the regime and so on.  This is a young Irish man and the length of time he has been left there is intolerable.  Direct political contact in the form of a direct visit could yield some results.  I make this suggestion to be constructive.<\/p>  <p>  I was struck by the Taoiseach's comments on recapitalisation because one gets the sense that we were told a load of lies for quite some time, although I am not making that accusation.  I recall that in 2012 - I remember it well - we and the nation were told that there had been a major breakthrough and it was not about the separation of bank and sovereign debt alone.  It was Mario Monti, the then Italian Prime Minister, who drove the deal at the time; it had nothing to do with the Taoiseach.  In fact, the then T&aacute;naiste had left the meeting, but on hearing something had happened went on \"Morning Ireland\" to say breathlessly that we had achieved a great breakthrough - \"a seismic shift\" was the phrase used, with game changer.  The phrase \"retrospective recapitalisation\" was also used.  The Ministers, Deputies Michael Noonan and Brendan Howlin said we could expect billions in return.  They said this giddily at a press conference at the time and I think the figure of &euro;6 billion might have been mentioned.  The Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, said he could not talk about how much specifically was involved and mentioned some fair he had experience of going to and that one never revealed one's hand.  It has now been truly revealed because it has been revealed that we did not ask for anything.  We never asked for retrospective recapitalisation.<\/p>  <p>  I will give the Government credit for spin, camouflage and rewriting the narrative as if what went before never happened and was a dream we all had.  However, the reality is that selling the banks was an option in 2012.  Selling AIB and our shares in the Bank of Ireland was always an option by definition.  The Taoiseach knew this, as did the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  The Taoiseach knew this when he called the decision in 2012 by the European Council a game changer and a seismic shift.  The likelihood was that in time, as the banks recovered, these two banks would wipe their faces.  However, the Taoiseach chose to take a political route and say this was fantastic, that it was a new world and that there would be retrospective recapitalisation, but we never asked for it.  The new story of the Government is that it did recapitalise AIB and Bank of Ireland, but the reality is that the Government honoured up to &euro;20 billion of both unsecured and unguaranteed bonds.  There was the famous episode when Mr.Trichet said to the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, that a bomb would go off, not in Brussels but in Dublin if he were to proceed to burn the bondholders.  Essentially, the Taoiseach made political claims in 2012 which were untrue, so much so that he never pursued them.  I have been asking about this for two and a half years and all I get is mumbo jumbo.  The Taoiseach confirmed in the past two to three months that he never asked for direct or retrospective recapitalisation and he is not asking for it now either.  That is the level of dishonesty and untruth at which he has come at this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I was struck by the Taoiseach's comment that he had spoken to the Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Tsipras, and explained to him how we had come through our recovery.

The Taoiseach says that sovereign and bank debt were separated in 2012 but they were not.  The ESM fund is nowhere near sufficient to deal with any similar bank crisis if it happened in the next ten years.  It is the best that could be achieved through compromise and negotiation but it is at negligible levels in terms of what would be required if there was a systemic financial and banking collapse of the kind we experienced across Europe five to six years ago.  It is not at all clear that, if in the morning a similar collapse happened at European level, the sovereign would not be called upon again, if the truth be told.  That is borne out by the disappointing figures for the funds that have been provided through the ESM and has been acknowledged by most commentators.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach must acknowledge that what he and the then T&aacute;naiste said in 2012 was not the truth.  There was no game-changer or seismic shift in terms of what was to happen to Ireland's debt position and getting retrospective recapitalisation.  The IMF, a former participant in those negotiations, is now saying that the position of Europe and of the ECB with regard to Ireland was not fair and that Ireland is entitled to some recapitalisation.  A number of key individuals who were involved at that time are now making that point.  I would not take too much credit for my intervention having brought Mr. Trichet to the Irish Institute of European Affairs.  That was not the Banking Inquiry.  The idea that parliamentarians would go along, sit in the audience and ask a few questions and be nice boys and girls was farcical in many respects.  Mr. Trichet should have appeared before the inquiry.  Just because he sees the European Parliament as the body to which he is accountable is no reason for him - or even Mr. Draghi - not coming before a sworn inquiry to answer fundamental questions about the eurozone system, how it works and its future, in terms of what went wrong at a regulatory and supervisory level as well as the whole idea of banking union.

Ireland has made clear on a number of occasions our continued concerns about the human rights situation in Egypt in general.  We intervened at the UN Human Rights Council to express these concerns in September 2014, indicating our continued concerns over arbitrary detention, selective justice and respect for the rule of law, impunity in cases of civilian deaths at the hands of the security forces, sexual abuse and violence against prisoners as well as proposed new measures to restrict the freedom of civil society.  Many of these issues were also raised in the separate EU statement delivered during the same debate.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, has raised our concerns directly with his Egyptian counterpart Mr. Shoukry, stressing the importance that we attach to upholding basic rights like freedom of expression and the rights of a free press.  He also set out in numerous statements the Government's strong concerns in respect of the case of Ibrahim Halawa, including on Monday, 27 April 2015.  There have been calls for me to intervene in this case directly.  I keep in very close contact with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan about the matter and am very conscious of the need not to escalate this in the wrong way.  People have referred to the interventions of the Australian and Canadian Prime Ministers leading to the release of their citizens but we must be very careful about making comparisons with other cases which are based on very different facts.  Irrespective of any action taken by the Australian Prime Minister or the Canadian Government, none of the al-Jazeera journalists were released while their cases were still pending before the Egyptian courts.  They had all been sentenced before their release.  <\/p>  <p>  References have been made to moving Ibrahim Halawa from the current area of the prison in which he is being kept.  Ensuring Ibrahim Halawa's welfare while in detention is clearly an issue of concern to us here.  The Irish embassy in Cairo is in very regular contact with the Egyptian authorities and as I said already, there have been 37 visits to Ibrahim.  At a recent meeting between the Minister, Deputy Flanagan and Mr. Shoukry the latter emphasised that the matter was currently before the Egyptian courts.  He said that he is conscious of the Irish Government's concerns over Ibrahim Halawa's welfare and the conditions of his ongoing detention and undertook to pursue directly the Irish Government's concerns with the appropriate Egyptian authorities.  Both Ministers agreed that this should continue.  <\/p>  <p>  In respect of Mr. Halawa's bail application, all bail applications were refused and a decision was taken that all defendants would remain in custody until the end of the trial.  It is important for the House to know that according to information recently received by the embassy from Ibrahim Halawa's legal team, not all of the defendants are facing identical charges as was originally believed to be the case and which was a key cause of concern.  It now appears that there are different charges against different defendants within the group trial and that Ibrahim Halawa is one of a relatively large group of defendants facing more preliminary charges related to events at the al-Fatah mosque, namely, presence inside the mosque at the time of arrest; refusal to leave the mosque when requested to do so and when offered safe passage by military police; travelling from a different part of the city with the intention of getting involved in a protest; and assisting in locking and barricading the mosque from the inside, according to photograph and video evidence.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister are seeking clarification of the exact charges against Ibrahim and examining what this change may mean.  In the meantime, and on the face of it, the new information would seem to be a somewhat positive development.  This is being very carefully monitored by the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  I will now respond to Deputy Martin's final comments about direct recapitalisation.<\/p><p>Deputy Martin makes the point that one gets the sense of this being a major breakthrough.  I was at the meeting until 5 a.m. and eventually there was no objection to the decision taken by the European Council with Ireland named specifically in there.

The report into the unnecessary death of babies in Portlaoise hospital, which the HSE strenuously sought to suppress, makes for grim and depressing reading.  It is another damning investigation of our health service which reveals repeated failures and non-compliance in national health care standards by the hospital in question and the HSE.  This represents a failure on the part of the Government.  The big responsibility may rest with the HSE but the Government failed to take account of HIQA recommendations in a series of reports, as well as in questions I put to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health regarding a letter I received from HIQA.  The Minister rightly indicated that he intends to grant additional powers to HIQA by amending the health Acts.

Under the Agreement the British Government has committed to completing the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into law in the North and to introducing safeguards so that the Assembly and public authorities in the North cannot infringe on the convention.  Other safeguards also apply to policing.  Is the Taoiseach aware of this issue and did he raise it with Mr. Cameron given that the proposal is clearly in breach of the Agreement and the international treaty underpinning it?

That takes into account all of the issues in respect of devolution for Scotland and Wales, the situation for English MPs and the consequences for Northern Ireland.

I thank the families for their courage in pursuing the matter and RTE for having highlighted in on \"Prime Time\".  If the families had not been so strong and brave, we would not be here having this debate and HIQA would not have produced its report.

Much of this could have been avoided if the red flags that were raised on numerous occasions had been addressed.  These were not red flags but alarm bells over governance issues ringing continually.<\/p><p>The executive summary of the report states:<blockquote>This current investigation found that the HSE &ndash; as the provider of healthcare services &ndash; failed to take decisive action on defining the role of Portlaoise hospital and its model of care in the context of the findings of previous investigations.  Corporately Portlaoise hospital viewed itself as a model-3 hospital and was not included in the national smaller hospitals framework.  Similar to a model-3 hospital, Portlaoise provided a full range of acute services to patients presenting with all manner of injury and illness, including life support.  However, at the time of this investigation, the HSE had failed to resource the hospital sufficiently and to ensure that the governance arrangements in place could safely deliver such a model of care to patients.  For example, up until July 2014 the emergency department at the hospital &ndash; which was open 24 hours a day seven days a week &ndash; only had a consultant in emergency medicine on site for six hours, four days a week.<\/blockquote>Earlier, I raised issues about accountability and who is ultimately responsible for this with the Taoiseach.  I do not want to point the finger at or cast aspersions on any one individual.  However, it seems there was an alarming problem with governance at local, regional and national level.  The issue of accountability has to be addressed.  We cannot talk consistently about systems failure.  If we do not have accountability at senior management level, then we will have systems failure consistently because there will be no sanction for people who are simply not doing their job.  I do not want to scapegoat any individual but there is an obligation on us to ensure accountability is part and parcel of the remunerative packages of people in charge and to ensure compliance with good governance.<\/p><p>Again, I extend my sympathies to the families who bravely challenged the HSE on this issue.  I will have much more to say about this at the health committee over the next several weeks, as well as on the inability of the HSE to support the families and to be up front with the flow of information to families in times of bereavement and tragedy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200034#GG00200","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1431452700,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this matter.  I want to begin by recognising the courage and fortitude of the patients and families who shared their stories.  I want to thank them for bringing their experiences into the public domain.  I hope the publication of this report brings them some small comfort.  They have provided us with the opportunity to learn from the past and put things right for the future.  This time I want to ensure the opportunity will not be missed.<\/p>  <p>  Many aspects of the HIQA report disturb me.  I am appalled that patients in the hour of their greatest need were not treated with respect, care and compassion.  Patients and families were treated dreadfully and, at times, inhumanely.  It is not all about resources.  It costs nothing to care.  Honesty costs nothing, neither does compassion.  These patients and families needed to be supported.  They needed to know that they mattered.  They needed comfort.  Instead, they got the cold shoulder.  That to me is very unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  The fact that at HSE corporate level, patient safety and quality was not given the highest priority is also concerning.  Patient safety and quality must be core to all we are and all we do.  The report highlights an urgent need to embed a patient safety culture right through the health service.  I accept the HIQA report in full and thank the investigation team for its work.  The four recommendations made to my Department will be implemented.  The HSE has confirmed that it too will implement the four recommendations made to it.  I expect the HSE to implement an action plan to address the findings of the report without delay, certainly by the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  Improvements have been and will continue to be made at the hospital.  New management and governance structures, both clinical and operational, are in place, including a new hospital manager and a director of midwifery for the first time, as well as an on-site risk manager.  Since I have come into office, my priority has been to strengthen the hospital and address ongoing patient safety issues.<\/p>  <p>  Appointments have been made to key posts in both the maternity and general services.  This includes additional consultants in anaesthetics, surgery, emergency medicine, paediatrics and obstetrics.  Up to 16 additional midwives have been appointed and approval has been given for further midwifery posts to include shift leaders and posts in diabetics and ultra-sonography.  An ambulance bypass protocol is in place for serious paediatric cases.<\/p>  <p>  Structural change has begun with Portlaoise now forming part of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  Any change to services in the hospital will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner.  This will take account of existing patient flows, demands in other hospitals and the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise in the context of overall service reorganisation within the group.  Services that are viable will be safety-assured and adequately resourced.  We will need to make sure services currently provided by the hospital that are not viable, due to insufficient case load or inability to recruit senior staff, are discontinued.  Governance of the maternity service will transfer to the Coombe in line with the memorandum of understanding agreed already.  I will also implement a national women and infants health programme modelled on the successful national cancer care programme, NCCP, to modernise our maternity services.<\/p>  <p>  I will do everything in my power to ensure the recommendations in this report are implemented without delay.  While we cannot undo the loss that patients and families have suffered, we can ensure lessons are learned and health services improved for all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200034#GG00300","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1431452700,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s reply and accept his sincerity.

Between now and the end of the year, there will be 1,500 to 1,700 births at Portlaoise hospital.  I do not think the Minister can say to those patients that by next year there will be a safe system in place.  We need greater urgency than talking about the end of the year.  Whoever is needed to come from the Coombe to the hospital, needs to be brought in now, not at the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the culture of HSE senior management at national level, if there is ever problem, it goes out to protect the organisation.  Everything else is secondary.  When recruiting for an operations director for the region some time ago, the Public Appointments Service specifically stated the director will be fully accountable and responsible for all services.  The Taoiseach said something different here today.  The terms and conditions of senior management need to have that stitched in to them.  The Minister has an obligation to ensure that is done for all future recruitments into senior posts in the HSE, if it is not already the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200034#GG00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1431452700,"counter":485,"content":"<p>The report stated:  &quot;The continued absence of a national maternity strategy as recommended by the authority in 2013 makes it difficult to assess and compare maternity services in Ireland&quot;.

As we have pointed out, there will be between 1,500 and 1,800 births between now and the end of the year at Portlaoise hospital.<\/p><p>The report also stated:<blockquote>The pivotal appointment of a director of midwifery to a maternity department located within a general hospital is unique to Portlaoise hospital.

I do not think anybody waited for a report to do this.  As the Deputy will be aware, actions have been ongoing for the best part of a year.  The ones that may take a few months to complete include the establishment of an independent patient advocacy service which might have to be put out to tender.  Legal status for the hospital groups will also take a few months to achieve.<\/p>  <p>  We need greater personal accountability in the health service.  It is not good enough to talk about a systems failure, which is an inadequate excuse.  We need greater personal accountability.  We also need to acknowledge where there are failures in the system.  As things stand, two referrals have been made to the Medical Council concerning two doctors.  There have been two referrals to the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland concerning two nurses.  There is an internal disciplinary process for HSE managers, although what is under consideration is appointing somebody from overseas to undertake disciplinary investigations of managers in the HSE because people may not have faith in an internal HSE disciplinary procedure.  The point the Taoiseach made was that there were external disciplinary procedures for nurses, midwives and doctors but only internal procedures for managers.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out that it is certainly not all about resources.  Today I looked at hospital budgets.  For example, the budget for the hospital in Portlaoise is within 10% of the budget for Naas hospital which covers a much bigger catchment area.  Therefore, it is not all about budgets.  Services were understaffed in certain areas, but to make them safe and bring them up to specialist standard, often no amount of resources will be enough because an adequate case load is needed to ensure clinicians are not de-skilled.  One also needs to be able to attract specialists and senior staff, which is sometimes difficult.  Up to now, where it has not been possible to attract specialists and senior staff, we have staffed services with expensive, often transient and not always very well qualified, locums and agency staff.  That is happening all over the country.  In the coming months and years we will need to consider seriously whether services that cannot attract specialists and senior staff should continue, not just in Portlaoise but also in many other hospitals all over the country.  We need to face up to this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The national maternity strategy group has been asked to report by October or November this year.  One of the actions mentioned in the HIQA report is that a director of midwifery be appointed as midwifery services leader in every maternity unit.  That will be done by the HSE.  Notwithstanding the enormous financial pressure the State has been under and despite tough time, the number of midwives employed in the public health service is now 1,425.  When the Government took office, it was 1,178.  The number of consultant obstetricians and gynaecologists is at a record high.  Despite the cutbacks made in recent years, therefore, we now have record numbers of midwives and consultants, even though the birth rate is falling.  This shows that the Government takes the matter much more seriously than previous Governments, but we still have a long way to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200035#HH00100","speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"English Language Training Organisations","time":1431453300,"counter":487,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200035#HH00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1431453300,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I am sure the Minister for Education and Skills is well aware of the position on English language schools which is an ongoing issue.

To date, 14 English language schools in Dublin alone have closed their doors, placing a huge financial burden on the students involved.  The most recent case involves the International Education Academy and it is estimated that the students will lose in the region of &euro;2,000 each.  They include 100 prospective students who have registered and paid their fees but who will not be able to start their courses as the college is set to close.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has proposed a three pillar solution.  A task force was established and one of its recommendations was that an accommodatin scheme be put in place to enable students to transfer to other colleges, including private colleges, to complete their courses at a discounted rate.  This shows a lack of understanding by the Department in dealing with such students, many of whom are living in poverty and do not have the money to switch courses, even at a discounted rate.

Students chose and trusted the schools in question because they were included in the lists approved by the State.  They had paid their fees, travelled to Ireland and kept their part of the deal.  However, they arrived to find a sector which was entirely unregulated.  When a school goes out of business, students find that, in effect, the State washes its hands of them.   One student described the State's response in revealing terms, that it was like being surrounded by stone walls.  Will the Government pursue this matter on behalf of the students involved?

Deputy Jonathan O'Brien has said 14 such schools have closed, but according to my figures, there have been 16 confirmed private English language school closures since April 2014 and approximately 5,000, mainly non-EEA, students have been affected.  There was a disturbing level of immigration abuse in this sector and it is clear that a number of institutions were operating a business model that was based on little more than facilitating the economic migration of those seeking to come and work in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The first priority of my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality in response was to find reasonable accommodation for genuinely affected students.  A task force was established to co-ordinate efforts to ensure the provision of alternative courses for those who wished to continue their studies.  For others, assurance of their immigration status was sufficient.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the work of the task force, a number of robust regulatory reforms in the international education sector were announced jointly by me and the Minister for Justice and Equality in September 2014.  The reforms included the creation of a more restricted list of eligible programmes for immigration purposes to replace the existing internationalisation register of courses.  The new list of programmes, referred to as the interim list of eligible programmes, was due to come into force on 1 January 2015.  However, a legal challenge by two colleges to some aspects of the reforms relating to the language sector was upheld by the High Court.  As a result, while certain reforms relating to the student work concession, under which non-EEA students have access to the labour market, were introduced as planned from 1 January, implementation of the interim list was temporarily deferred pending consideration of the High Court judgment.  The two Departments have now produced a package of reforms, consistent with the High Court's judgment, under the student immigration system for international education which will be brought to the Government for its approval shortly.  That will occur in the very near future.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's immigration regime for non-EEA students is a generous one.  It comprises the right to live and study in Ireland and provides access to the labour market.<\/p><p>While Ireland needs to compete internationally in this market and the immigration regime is an essential part of the package, in order to justify the granting of such permission, three essential conditions at a policy level must be satisfied.  First, there must be confidence that the industry is operating to an acceptable standard and that the students are immigration-compliant.  There is no room for so-called visa factories in the Irish educational sector.  Second, the programmes must be of a type that reflects Ireland's strategic priorities in international education.  Ireland's international education strategy and its marketing is founded on the quality of Irish higher education and our strong track record in delivering quality-assured English language programmes to overseas students.  Third, the immigration regime offered to students must be consistent with both immigration policy in general and good labour market management.  This package of reforms, when approved by the Government, will ensure that overarching and comprehensive immigration and quality assurance processes are in place for the delivery of international education in the State.  They will significantly contribute to maintaining and enhancing Ireland's reputation as a high-quality destination for international students.<\/p> <p> Deputy McDonald mentioned the Department's approval process.

It has been stated that 42 public water supplies in Ireland tested in the latest Environmental Protection Agency inspections had lead levels that exceeded the safety thresholds that came into effect in December last year.  Dublin city alone is known to have several thousand homes still with internal lead pipes, and that situation is replicated across the country.  Ireland is not alone in this regard with having legacy issues of lead pipes, as the problem is also prevalent in England, Scotland and France.<\/p>  <p>  Public health specialist Dr. Anthony Breslin has recently stated that the full impact of lead exposure was serious and could cause neurological disease.  He urged householders with any doubts to have their pipes checked.  He also indicated that public awareness about the dangers of lead was high when it started to be removed from paint and petrol but in the 20 to 30 years since, people may have become complacent about the presence of lead.<\/p>  <p>  A constituent contacted me last week to express his concern and anxiety regarding what he described as a potentially lethal problem.  He has a nine-year-old daughter and he is very worried that the lead in his water supply could cause her health issues in future.  There is great concern in St. Anne's estate in Raheny in my constituency about the presence of lead pipes in the water supply network in this estate, comprising approximately 700 homes.  St. Anne's estate was built by Dublin Corporation, as it was, and completed in 1954 as an estate to house families qualifying for a local authority loan to purchase a home.  At that time, the people had to be either existing corporation tenants or corporation housing applicants to qualify for the loan.  The design of the estate is similar to other Dublin Corporation estates of the period, and that design continued up to the 1970s.  The current problem with lead water supply pipes is manifesting particularly in St. Anne's estate and it is a cause of concern to the residents.<\/p>  <p>  I am told representatives of Irish Water are currently liaising with the Environmental Protection Agency to finalise a national strategy to address the issue of lead water pipes.  Irish Water has also indicated that property owners are responsible for the water distribution on their own properties, including all domestic internal plumbing.  In Scotland, for example, there are grants for private householders to replace pipes with plastic or other alternatives.<\/p><p>There are no grant incentive schemes here at present.  A grant-aided scheme to remove harmful lead pipes from the drinking water infrastructure would provide jobs as well as eliminating a public health risk, which would be welcome.  I call on the Minister to consider this strategy.

I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to outline the position in regard to this matter.<\/p><p>With effect from 1 January 2014, Irish Water is responsible for public water services.  Suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied complies with the chemical and microbiological parameters set out in the European Union (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The maximum allowable value for lead is 10 microgrammes per litre, which limit came into effect on 25 December 2013.  The Environmental Protection Agency is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water's compliance with the drinking water regulations.  In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in the regulations, the water supplier will investigate the cause in consultation with the EPA and, where a potential risk to human health exists, with the Health Service Executive to ensure that appropriate remedial action is taken.  A case-by-case approach will be considered by Irish Water in line with its statutory responsibilities and in recognition of the statutory responsibilities of the HSE and the EPA to develop local responses to issues which arise in particular locations.<\/p><p>Irish Water has informed the Department of the Environment <i>, <\/i>Community and Local Government that of its estimated 60,000 km distribution system, it has identified a very small proportion - approximately 2 km of water-mains - as possibly containing lead.  As such, Irish Water has commenced a programme of verification and removal that will be completed in 2015.  However, there are a significant number of lead service pipes between the water mains and the customer stopcock or water meter.  Irish Water is identifying the location of such lead service connections during the metering installation programme.  It is currently identified that approximately 5% of houses are affected, but this is expected to be higher in town centre areas.  Irish Water also estimates that there may be a further 30,000 to 40,000 houses with shared lead backyard service connections.  Irish Water has informed the Department that it intends to invest in public lead pipe replacement schemes, primarily communications pipes, with a view to eliminating lead mains, including shared backyard service connections, over the next ten years.  This is probably the issue that most concerns the Deputy.  Irish Water is also reviewing its water treatment processes to ensure they mitigate the risk in the short term.<\/p><p>The Water Services Act 2007 provides that the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the internal water distribution system.  Responsibility for replacing lead pipes from the mains stopcock to a house and within the house rests, therefore, with the house owner.  In a joint position paper on lead published by the EPA and HSE in 2013, it was recommended that all lead pipes and plumbing in public and private ownership should be replaced over time.<\/p><p>With regard to the proposal for a grants scheme, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is developing a national strategy for lead which it is discussing with the Department of Health, Irish Water, the HSE and the EPA to map the scale of the problem and identify measures to mitigate any risk posed to human health by lead in drinking water.  I understand that the Government was informed at the Cabinet meeting this morning that the strategy will be completed and published in the next month.

She also said that backyard lead piping will be dealt with by Irish Water.  She said there were between 30,000 and 40,000 houses in that situation.

Farmers are receiving the forms to fill in and there is huge discontent in suckler areas.  When one looks at the terms and conditions, it is clear that one has to sign up to a six-year contract.  If something goes wrong within five years, one will be in trouble and have to pay back the money.<\/p>  <p>  I note the 60% issue in regard to genotyping.  It is costing &euro;30 to do each one.  Most farmers in the scheme will have to have a planner to deal with carbon and the grazing season, which is causing problems.  One big thing that is emerging from both the breeders of bulls and the farmers themselves involves the four and five star ratings.  In reality, a one or two star bull may produce as good an animal and better than a four or five star one.  An animal that may have five stars after three years could be brought down to two stars by a heifer or other progeny produced out of it down the road.  We have seen this in looking at the bulls that have been produced in Ireland down through the years.<\/p>  <p>  There is huge concern and it is not scare-mongering.  Many farmers, especially the smaller ones, are throwing the forms in the fire they are so afraid to go into the scheme.  It needs to be addressed.  The farming organisations are holding meetings over the next week so extensive is concern on the ground.  I have had a lot of farmers into my constituency office and they have said they are walking away from the scheme.  The other issue is that if one increases or decreases from the 2014 figures, one does not comply with the terms of the scheme.  I ask the Minister to look at and change the terms and conditions.<\/p><p> I know that the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, has worked with the Minister on this scheme but there is a huge difference between what I am hearing on the ground and what is being pushed.  At the moment a person can bring a bull from England, but it could take two years before the person has a five star bull.  Farmers have been doing it for years and there is a course available as well.  These farmers have been involved in suckler farming for years and we need to keep them up and running.<\/p> <p> This funding is like an apple which is high up in the tree.  Everyone welcomes the funding which the Minister is making available and no one is taking from that fact.  However, I am expressing the genuine discontent on the ground and the genuine fear farmers have of going into the scheme.  It must be rejigged and we need to work with farmers and bull breeders to get it right.  I have seen the stark consequence, which is widespread, especially in the west where many suckler farmers are based.  Farmers are not going into the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200037#KK00600","speaker":"1198","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431455100,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fitzmaurice for raising this issue.  He will get a written response which will include further details but I will try to address some of the issues he is raising now.  Some of the concerns are about something that is not proposed.  It is true that this is quite a complex scheme.  We are committing &euro;300 million to the suckler herd.  I want to give a strong statement from Government in the rural development programme that the suckler herd really matters.  Tens of thousands of farm families, in every constituency and parish in the country, are deriving an income from suckler beef and we want to keep them there.<\/p><p>We also want to use the supports that we will be giving through this scheme to ensure that we improve the genetics and breeding performance of the herd.  We also want to improve the quality of the herd so that animals grow faster, have better confirmation and improve their ease of calving and temperament and so on.  We will be making a positive contribution from an emissions and climate change point of view because animals will be growing faster and producing meat more efficiently.  We will also be helping farmers to become more profitable by producing better bred beef.<\/p><p>I am sure there are examples of a two star bull that has had a better progeny than a four star bull.  However, on average, the more stars a bull has, the better the progeny that comes from that animal.  That is the point of a star rating system.  The same applies to suckler cows.  The better the genetics, the increased likelihood of producing better animals from that herd.  This is the purpose of the scheme.  <\/p><p>There is a reason for asking people to sign up to a six year contract.  This is an area based scheme under the rural development programme.  Farmers are required to buy into the scheme for a certain number of years, as is the case when joining the GLAS scheme, and there are consequences if they pull out.  The reason we need a six year commitment is that if we are going to collect DNA data in the first couple of years, it will only be in the second half of the scheme that we will see the genetic improvements that come from the collected data.<\/p><p>This is not a scheme that is simply pumping &euro;95 per calved cow, for the first ten, and &euro;80 per animal after that to support suckler farm income.  It does that, but there are requirements and these requirements are not overly expensive.  The carbon calculator that is being asked of farmers as part of the terms and conditions and the training that farmers need to undertake to understand how they can best use the genomic information that they get back from ICBF will both be paid for separately.  The &euro;30 that it costs to take a genomic sample last year is likely to be significantly cheaper this year because the numbers involved will be significantly higher, we will benefit from economies of scale and we will have a competitive process to get the price down further from where it was last year.  <\/p><p>Farmers have nothing of which to be frightened in this scheme.  If something dramatic happens on the farm and a farmer is forced out of the scheme during the six year period, the rules around <i>force majeure<\/i>will apply.  If someone dies on the farm or something like that, we will take that into account.  However, we need this to be a six year commitment by farmers.  We are contributing more than &euro;53 million a year into the suckler beef sector.  That is &euro;300 million in total, of which more than half is being paid by the European Union.  This is being done on the basis of a climate change measure, so that we can produce suckler beef more efficiently and so that there will be a lower carbon footprint in our beef herd.  It will also mean more profitable beef production.<\/p><p>All of the things we have designed in this scheme are concerned with helping farmers to become more efficient and profitable and to produce better herds based on better breeding programmes.  We are training farmers to use the scientific genomic data that we will collect from their herds, matched with the performance data farmers will provide, to help them do that.  This is a win-win situation for everyone.  It is not an attempt to capture farmers or tie them into things that they do not want to do.  It is about working with farmers, getting information from them and giving it back to them in a form that with training results in better breeding programmes in our suckler beef herd.<\/p><p>If there is one thing I know since becoming Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine it is that the difference between the top performing suckler herds and the bottom performing suckler herds is an absolute chasm at the moment.  Deputies who understand agriculture will understand this fact.  We must help everyone move into a more efficient way of producing beef, which is more profitable for them and which is more climate efficient for us in terms of the targets we have to meet in agriculture.  This is the purpose of the scheme.  We will pay people to be part of that journey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200038#LL00200","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1431455100,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt the Minister but I must ask him to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200038#LL00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1431455100,"counter":508,"content":"<p>If there are any other questions, I will be happy to answer them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200038#LL00400","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1431455100,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

At least one stock bull on the holding on 30 June 2019, which is four years from now, must be a bull that has been geno-typed four or five star on either the terminal or replacement index or a similar four or five star bull must be retained on the holding until 30 June 2020.  In other words, the farmer can lease the bull.  We are trying to give a signal to farmers that they need to plan to improve the bulls with which they will be breeding their animals and that they have four years to do it.  That is why this is a six year commitment and not a year-on-year commitment.  If someone decides to go into this scheme next year, gets the payments and then decides to pull out, it is of no value to anyone apart from the cash value to the farmer concerned.<\/p><p>However, if one makes a commitment for the six years, one gets payments for the full six years and is on a journey, from contributing information at the start and taking training for which one will be paid, on top of the beef genomic payment, to using the training and scientific information one has been given to have better breeding towards the end of the six years.  This is so that, by the end of that period, we will have a better suckler herd, which is something from which everyone benefits.<br\/><br\/>If someone is forced out of the scheme because something dramatic happens or so on, we will consider the question of <i>force majeure<\/i>, as we do when farmers are forced out of other schemes.  We understand that such things happen, but we want a medium-term, six-year commitment from farmers.  This is not simply an annual cash payment for having a suckler herd.  It is a programme that has some complexity to it but that farmers understand.<br\/><br\/>The six-year commitment involves generous payments throughout and will achieve exciting results for the farmer.  This is why we have it.  If we just have a year-on-year payment and farmers can opt in or out, those who leave early will have given all of the information but received none of the benefits.  The Commission would not approve a programme that took five or six years to accrue benefits and for which we paid &euro;300 million without getting a commitment that farmers would see it through.  This is the issue.  I hope that farmers understand.<br\/><br\/>I have been open and honest with farming organisations about it during the scheme's design.  I hope that everyone will understand what we are doing, namely, ensuring it is a win-win for everyone by improving incomes for beef farmers while improving the quality of their breeding herds over a six-year period.
