All of these are to be noted and published.<\/p> <p>  Regarding No. 3C, the documents for today's meeting, at 9 p.m. last night, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, wrote to the committee and presented 41 documents running to hundreds of pages, which relate to the NAMA Northern Ireland advisory committee and the interaction between the Ministers here and in Northern Ireland dealing with the NAMA issues.  The clerk to the committee received no advance notice that such information was being made available.  The release of the information on the eve of the committee meeting with NAMA and, more important, with the chairman of a delegation from the Northern Ireland finance committee, is deeply frustrating and works against all principles of good accountability.  I am sure the members would not have had the opportunity to review the documents, which is a pity, given that we are entering public session and the documents are laid before us.

The experience to date has reflected the fact that the Minister has been markedly reluctant to give a full account and to answer questions on all the issues pertaining to NAMA and, more specifically, to the Northern loan book, Project Eagle.  In order to be helpful, the documents would have had to have been published earlier this week.  It might have proved helpful.  They have been published, and I have had the opportunity only to scan them.  This leads us to a position in which we must invite the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and his officials to come before the committee at the earliest opportunity so we can examine and question the contents of the documents they have put into the public domain.<\/p> <p>  Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, Mr. Martin McGuinness, MLA, has been in contact with the clerk to the committee seeking the earliest opportunity to come and give evidence, which would be useful.  After this meeting, we are to deal with the issue of Mr. Bryson, and we can deal with it then.  We also need to consider hearing evidence from Mr. Sammy Wilson, former finance minister in the North, Mr. Simon Hamilton and the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, MLA.  For the purposes of this jurisdiction, it is unthinkable, having released the documentation at the 11th hour, that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, would not very promptly make himself available to the committee, along with his officials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#C01800","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I agree with most of what Deputy McDonald said.  It is shocking and extraordinary that the documents should be issued when it is almost impossible to digest them, and they are deliberately and nakedly politically divisive and provide a distraction to what is happening today.  I can only conclude that it is deliberate on a day when we are doing important work and when we have invited the MLAs from Northern Ireland here.  It contrasts very starkly with the extraordinary decision by NAMA, with the Minister's support, not to co-operate with the inquiry in Northern Ireland.  There is a paradox and contradiction in what the Minister is doing by releasing the information at this time, just before this committee meeting, given that he could have released it any time since 2 September and he is not encouraging NAMA, a semi-State agency, to provide any evidence to help the inquiry in Northern Ireland.  We should make this point clear to the Minister and NAMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#C01900","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Given that it came late last night, it is obviously too short notice for the members to deal with it adequately.

That was very constructive and the right approach to take.  What happened this morning in private session is that we were cautioned as to how we conduct our business.  As I said then and repeat now, I believe that every member of this committee has acted responsibly, is aware of Standing Order 163 and understands full well the extent to which we can go with these inquiries.  The caution that we received this morning might well have been given to others outside this committee because I consider that to be an effort to frustrate the committee.  The releasing of documentation like this, before the hearing today, is nothing short of interference with the work of the committee.  We now have those 41 documents as well as an e-mail which has been given to me by the clerk, which I will read:<\/p><blockquote>I am writing on behalf of Martin McGuinness, MLA.  Following disclosure from the Department of Finance of papers to the Public Accounts Committee, Martin McGuinness would like to appear before the PAC at the earliest opportunity.  Please contact me by return e-mail to arrange same.  <\/blockquote> <p>We are now faced with these papers being in the public domain and a number of individuals have now asked to come before us.  We have been cautioned this morning about that and we need to make a decision on it.

We must be honest about the fact that politicians often get briefs with very little notice.  It is not in any way unreasonable to expect, given the backup provided to all of the parties here, that we could scan the documentation enough to know what is contained therein.  I totally resent the accusation of outside interference by the Minister.  We do not want to pre-judge the outcome of the meeting with an inference that information has been provided in order to interfere with today's proceedings.  That is far from the case.  I was Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts for over two years and laid great emphasis on the importance of impartiality.  We are here to investigate the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Obviously there are limitations on the role of the committee which have been in place since the foundation of the State.  There is no point in pre-empting the debate that will take place.  The fact that there are witnesses who are prepared to come from Northern Ireland is entirely at their discretion.  Nobody who has been asked to come before the committee has declined to do so.  We must look at this in the context of the matter before us.  The allegations that are being made relate entirely to the Northern Ireland jurisdiction.

At this very moment, 600 residents in Longboat Quay are threatened with evacuation.<\/p><p>It is something that we on this committee dealt with before.  Some 12 months ago the matter came to our attention and it was mentioned at that time that there was a serious fire safety issue.  The DDDA undertook to look into that matter and I understand it put in a sum in the region of &euro;1 million towards remedying the situation.  Other issues have developed since then that have shown this to be far more serious, with the results that the 600 plus residents in 300 apartments may have to be evacuated if the faults are not rectified.  The initial work was carried out by the DDDA, which was the planning authority.  The question now is who will take care of the &euro;4 million that is required.<\/p><p> The Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, is about to become part of Dublin City Council.  Quite clearly Dublin City Council is at risk from the charge.<\/p><p> The property belonged to Bernard McNamara who went into receivership.  It is incredible that somebody can walk away.  It would be similar to what happened in the case of Priory Hall.  The person who is responsible for the damage caused is now one of the people who will probably not have to pay to have it rectified.  I wonder if NAMA has a role, given that NAMA would have taken over those properties when Bernard McNamara went bust.  I wonder whether it would be appropriate to ask NAMA some questions on this at a later stage.  In the first instance I propose that we deal with NAMA in respect of it.  <\/p><p> Second, the flaws have only appeared in this property which was built in 2006, some nine years ago.

One of the recurrent items to which I am drawing attention is instances of material non-compliance with procurement rules.  It is something to which attention has been drawn previously.  I know it is a matter that continues to be of interest to the committee.  I also draw attention to cases where there have been significant control failures that are explained in the statements of internal financial control at the front of each of the Appropriation Accounts.

I am quite hoarse as I was up late reading documents last night.  I welcome this opportunity to present to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I believe this informal engagement between representatives of our two committees will be a timely and viable opportunity to explore how we might work collaboratively on our respective inquiries into the NAMA Project Eagle sale.<\/p><p>In addressing you formally I will refer to our respective areas of focus and I will outline the activities and outputs from my committee&rsquo;s work to date.  I shall talk about the next steps and suggest some ways in which we might collaborate in a practical way.  Clearly both committees have different areas of focus; the PAC&rsquo;s specific interest is in investigating whether the Project Eagle sale provided value for money for taxpayers in the South while the Assembly committee is to examine the role of Stormont&rsquo;s Department of Finance and Personnel, the DFP, in NAMA&rsquo;s operations in the North.  This includes the relationship with the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee in the context of Project Eagle.  However, I believe there are key areas where our interests cross over and where a co-ordinated action could offer mutual benefit.  I have some specific suggestions in this regard to which I will return.<\/p><p>Shortly after the Northern Assembly finance committee initiated its review in early July, the PSNI announced its investigation.  In order to minimise the risk of prejudicing this or future court proceedings the committee developed terms of reference for its work which was informed by a meeting with investigators and by independent legal advice.  Investigators held another useful meeting with senior National Crime Agency personnel last week.  The committee has collated a growing body of written and oral evidence which is published on its website.  This includes written communications with NAMA including questions and answers; correspondence with DFP; written submissions from other key players including Cerberus and Mr. Cushnahan; Hansard reports of the five oral hearings to date; and the papers released last night from the finance department.<\/p><p> Despite the significant public interest in the review, the efforts of the committee have been frustrated by some key witnesses.  The continued reluctance of NAMA to appear before the committee is very much regretted.  As its reason for not travelling to the North, NAMA has said that the appropriate forum to which it should account for its activities is the Oireachtas, and to committees established by the Oireachtas.  This point is not disputed by my committee but greater co-operation from NAMA will be crucial if we are to fully understand its relationship with the Northern Assembly's Department of Finance and Personnel since 2009, including the role of the department in making nominations to the NI advisory committee.  While NAMA has agreed to answer questions in writing, I believe there is increased onus to appear before the committee out of pure courtesy and respect for the institutions in the North.  While critical of NAMA on this point I acknowledge that it has been more forthcoming than some witnesses who continue to cite the criminal investigation as a reason for not providing further written or oral evidence to the committee.  I believe this position is becoming more untenable by the day.<\/p><p> Although the committee&rsquo;s review is still at a relatively early stage I can report some tangible outputs already.  It is beginning to establish a public record of key documents, including records of meetings and written submissions from key players.  The committee has also prepared a comprehensive timeline of events that is updated as and when evidence and documentation is received.  The oral testimony received to date is also highlighting the differing accounts of events which raises further questions and areas for scrutiny.  Moreover, the publication of this emerging body of evidence has also informed the wider public discourse including in the media.<\/p><p> The committee is in the process of formulating and issuing further written questions to a range of witnesses and these include NAMA, Pimco, Cerberus and Mr. Frank Cushnahan.  Invitations to oral hearings have been issued to the First Minister, former finance Ministers Simon Hamilton and Sammy Wilson, former permanent secretaries, former special advisers in the Department of Finance and Personnel and members of the NI advisory committee.  The finance committee is expecting that all of these witnesses will make themselves available willingly and co-operate fully with the review.  However, it will keep open the option of using its powers to compel persons and papers should that become necessary.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I wish to suggest some potential areas of common interest and practical measures which we might take to support our respective efforts and to assist each other in adding pieces to this complicated jigsaw.  A key concern for both committees should be to investigate the information flow between NAMA and its northern advisory committee.  In its written response to the committee on the 4 September, NAMA stated and I quote: \"No specific information relating to debtors or assets was ever provided to external members of the NIAC\".  However, a question remains of precisely what information was shared.  We know from the minutes of advisory committee meetings that commercial and confidential matters were discussed in some detail.  Indeed, NAMA has redacted parts of the minutes which it has provided to the committee.  It would be interesting to have an explanation for those redactions.  It was also highlighted in the advisory committee minutes that section 202 of the NAMA Act which deals with the handling of confidential information also applies to the advisory committee including external members.  Presumably that provision exists for a purposes.<\/p><p>We also know there was a crossover of membership between the NAMA board and the advisory committee.  On 7 October 2013 at Tughans' offices in Belfast, the advisory committee discussed the unsolicited bid by Pimco and feedback was sought from the external members in order to inform the NAMA board&rsquo;s consideration on 10 October 2013.  We need therefore to establish the full facts on this relationship, not just in terms of the formal exchange of information but also the opportunities which individuals may have had to develop commercial intelligence on NAMA's assets and operations in the North.<\/p><p> A further area in which both committees may be able to support each other will be in getting to the bottom of the nominations and appointments of the external members to the advisory committee.  A number of questions remain unanswered including where the responsibility rested for due diligence.  In practical terms I believe that, as the inquiries progress, we could consider sharing information and papers as applicable.  There is also scope for our respective committees to provide each other with suggested areas for questioning of witnesses whose oral evidence is of mutual interest.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for this opportunity to address the committee and I welcome continued engagement.  I am happy to respond to any questions that members may have and I look forward to hearing their views or suggestions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#E01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daith&iacute; McKay","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McKay for his statement.

When the chief executive and I appeared before the committee in July, we spoke at length about the Project Eagle sales process.  There has been much coverage of various aspects of the transaction over the past three months, much of it related to what may or may not have happened on the purchase side of the transaction and particularly in Northern Ireland, but the key points that we made to the committee in July are still valid and I want to reiterate them.<br\/><br\/>If there was wrongdoing on the part of some parties involved on the purchase side of the transaction in Northern Ireland, including those who acted as professional advisers to potential purchasers, we in NAMA have no more knowledge of that than what has been publicly disclosed to date.  The facts, as they pertain to those individuals and their activities, are a matter for the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland and other jurisdictions to establish.  If an alleged payment involving Tughans did find its way to an account in the Isle of Man, as has been alleged, it did not<b><\/b>emanate from the sales proceeds that were due to NAMA and to Irish taxpayers.<\/p><p>When NAMA became aware of a concern surrounding the participation of one of the bidders for Eagle, we immediately, and without hesitation, took steps to ensure that potential bidder withdrew from the loan sale process.<\/p><p> The chief executive and I met the UK's National Crime Agency some weeks ago and provided it with an overview of NAMA and the chronology of the sale of Eagle.  It is our clear understanding, based on that engagement, that its investigation is not in any way concerned with the NAMA sale side of the transaction.  Its focus appears to be very much on the purchase side and what may or may not have taken place in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> The loan sales process for Eagle was well-managed and competitive.  The sale was conducted in line with best international practice, independently overseen by Lazard, and NAMA took care at all stages to ensure the integrity of the process was fully protected.  The implication of many of the allegations is that parties in Belfast either had influence over NAMA's decision-making on Project Eagle and\/or had access to confidential NAMA information that could have afforded certain bidders a competitive advantage in the sales process.  On the first point, let me make it very clear that no pressure from any source, North or South, political or otherwise, influenced NAMA in regard to the commercial decision to sell the loans of NAMA's Northern Ireland debtors or influenced the decision to accept the winning bid from Cerberus.  All decisions were made, as is correct and proper, by the NAMA board.<\/p><p> Let me also reiterate that members of the Northern Ireland advisory committee had no access to confidential NAMA information.  In fact, all bidders had equal access to all of the information on the loans and the underlying security once they entered a controlled data room.  No bidder could have had a competitive advantage over another because all bidders were given full and equal access to all relevant information held by NAMA.  We have no knowledge of what third parties on the purchase side were allegedly saying in Northern Ireland but we can state categorically that they had no influence over NAMA's decision making, no access to NAMA confidential information and were in no position to confer an unfair competitive advantage on any of the bidders in the process.<\/p><p> I have little doubt that the commercial decision taken by the NAMA board to dispose of the Northern Ireland loan portfolio was the right one.  The board took the view that the sale would provide the best financial outcome for Irish taxpayers, taking into account the quality of assets in the portfolio, the lack of liquidity in the Northern Ireland property market, the availability of a number of investors with the capacity to bid competitively on the portfolio and NAMA's need to focus on its assets in the Republic and London, which were more likely to gain from intensive asset management attention.  NAMA set a reserve price based on the aggregate value of the assets securing the portfolio and NAMA achieved that price.  I will address later in this statement the hearsay claim that the portfolio was sold for less than what it was worth.<\/p><p> There has been an attempt to suggest &ndash; without evidence - that Cerberus has made a huge profit on the Eagle transaction.  Based on its own submission to the Northern Ireland Committee for Finance and Personnel, by letter dated 16 September 2015 which is publicly available, Cerberus stated it expected to write off a cumulative &pound;2.8 billion of debt.  That implies a realisation of &pound;1.5 billion on a portfolio for which it paid &pound;1.3 billion.  On the assumption that funding, loan servicing and other costs will amount to 8% over an assumed workout period of 30 months, Cerberus would be left with a profit of approximately 7% to 8%.  While clearly Cerberus invested in the portfolio with a view to generating a profit, the data provided by it to the Northern Ireland committee hardly suggest that the Irish taxpayer was robbed, as has recently been suggested by some of the more excitable commentary.  There is no certainty that this projected profit will be achieved ultimately, given the difficulty of predicting the performance of markets and of economies.  In essence, we were faced with a choice of taking a certain &pound;1.3 billion in cash upfront or taking the very substantial risk of holding on for a potential upside of another 7% to 8% and putting this &pound;1.3 billion at risk for a limited additional gain that may or may not be generated over a three to four-year period.  Knowing what we know about this portfolio, this is a risk NAMA was not prepared to take.<\/p><p> There were also claims that the value of the Eagle portfolio increased by 20% in the 15 months since the sale was concluded.  Based on independent data available to us, this claim is without foundation.  The most reliable data that we have been able to obtain suggests that Northern Ireland commercial property prices increased by 2.3% for the 2014 calendar year.  No reliable updated data is yet available for 2015.  I should point out though that the estimated 2.3% price growth was largely based on an investment portfolio of prime retail, office and industrial income-producing assets.  By contrast, Project Eagle contained a significant proportion of lower-quality land and development assets and other assets that would not fit institutions' investment criteria.  It is reasonable to assume that price recovery for this asset class would lag that of the better quality assets typically measured by price indices.  Based on this, we have concluded that, at best, Eagle assets may have increased in price by a maximum of 2% to 3%, not the 20% claimed in some media reports.  When account is taken of funding and management costs, NAMA could have made little or no gain from retaining the portfolio and working it out as far as 2020 by comparison with the option of selling it, as we did, in early 2014.<\/p><p> It is also important to point out that Cerberus has more flexibility in its ability to manage the portfolio than NAMA had.  This is because section 172 of the NAMA Act prohibits NAMA from selling assets back to defaulting debtors.  While we have no way of knowing the ultimate impact of section 172, one can speculate that, in some cases at least, debtors would be willing to outbid third parties, with the support of third-party financing, in order to ensure that they obtained control over their assets, given they had the best knowledge of them.<\/p><p> I now turn to a number of additional allegations which were made last week under D&aacute;il privilege by Deputy Wallace.  Deputy Wallace claimed that Cerberus or some \"fixers\" went to some of the major Northern Ireland debtors prior to the sale of the portfolio and offered to sell them back their loans for 50p in the pound.  He goes on to imply that, having bought the loans from NAMA at 27p in the pound, Cerberus was then able to sell the loans at twice what they paid for them.  This is a serious misrepresentation of the facts.  Cerberus bought the Eagle portfolio at a price which corresponded to an average of 27% of its par value.  The price that we achieved was based on the aggregate value of the properties securing the portfolio.  Neither Cerberus nor any other bidder would ever pay the par value for the loans unless the underlying assets were worth at least as much as the loan par value.  Nor would they pay more than what the aggregate underlying assets were worth, which was 27% of par value at the time of sale following open marketing of the portfolio.<\/p><p> It may well have been the case that the loan portfolios of certain individual debtors were priced at 50% of the par value because the properties securing them were better than the average.  If that were the case, it would have made sense for Cerberus and the particular debtors involved to agree a buyout price at or about 50%.  But it is utterly disingenuous to suggest that the whole portfolio could have been sold for 50% of par value.  The price we agreed was based on our own valuations of the loans.  We were fully aware that some loans were worth 50p in the pound, and some were worth far less; perhaps as little as 5p in the pound.  The blended average across the portfolio as a whole represented 27% of par value.  That is the highest that any bidder - out of nine major investment groups approached - was prepared to pay for the portfolio as a whole and the highest that could be achieved.<\/p><p> It stretches credulity to suggest that Northern Irish, or indeed any other debtors, and their new investors or bankers would have paid 50p to buy back assets which were worth only 27p.  Some of the commentary over the past week has been written by commentators who have been silent on this point but know very well how implausible it is or, at the very least, ought to know.<\/p><p>Deputy Wallace then goes on to ask why NAMA could not have negotiated with debtors to secure 50% of the loans&rsquo; par value, which, as he claims, was achieved by Cerberus.  Aside from the implausibility of the claim that Cerberus was in a position to sell its whole Eagle portfolio at 50% of par value, there was nothing to prevent Cerberus or any other buyer, once they had bought the portfolio, negotiating deals with debtors, which would have involved the debtors buying the loans at a discount to par.  Some loans may have been worth 50% of par value but many others were worth much less.  The Deputy asks why NAMA could not negotiate such deals.  The answer is straightforward: section 172 of the National Asset Management Agency Act prohibits it from doing so.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Wallace states that because the price paid by Cerberus was 27% of par value, taxpayers in the Republic had to cover the shortfall relative to par.  The Deputy&rsquo;s implication is that if NAMA were to retain this portfolio for long enough, it would eventually recover par value.  This is a totally unrealistic view of what is achievable within any reasonable timespan.  If par value were ever to be realised from this portfolio, a realistic timetable for realising it runs into decades, not years.  As we indicated to this committee in July, NAMA bought the portfolio at a heavy discount and then we had to impair it further after acquisition due to further property price declines and economic stagnation in Northern Ireland.  The key point to bear in mind about the Eagle portfolio is the fact that five Irish banks advanced ST&pound;4.5 billion to Northern Ireland debtors for the purchase of assets which were generally of mediocre or poor quality and which subsequently lost, in aggregate, over two-thirds of their value.  Blaming NAMA for that is akin to blaming the fire brigade for a major fire which was set off by an arsonist.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Wallace states that some &euro;45 million has been paid in what he describes as &quot;fixers&rsquo; fees&quot;.  As the Deputy did not provide any detail as to what these fees represent, it is very difficult to comment in any detail on this point.  I am aware, however, that it is normal practice for debtors to pay fees to new lenders when refinancing or buying back their loans and it is possible that this is what the Deputy has in mind.  I understand that these fees &ndash; commonly referred to as arrangements fees - are typically charged at about 1% of buyout value, and this is normal banking practice.  Even if 1% fees were paid on the whole portfolio, the total fee payment would amount to &pound;13 million, not the &euro;45 million as claimed.  It is also possible that the Deputy is referring to fees which debtors might have paid to accountants, lawyers and corporate finance advisers to assist them in their engagement with Cerberus.  However, in the absence of any further information about the fees involved, it is difficult for me to offer the committee any insight as to what the Deputy might have had in mind.<br\/><br\/>I can state categorically that these supposed &quot;fixers' fees&quot; do not in any way relate to NAMA.  We have already disclosed that the fees incurred by NAMA in relation to this transaction were &euro;9 million, which is about 0.6% of the sales price, and that they were principally fees paid to Lazard as our loan sale adviser and to a number of legal firms.  We have no difficulty in publishing the full list of service providers and the fees paid to them by us as part of the Eagle sales process if that is required or useful.  We have nothing to hide on this.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On a more general note, it is difficult for NAMA or indeed any organisation to properly address allegations where such allegations are vague or implausible and where no evidence is produced to support them.  It is unfortunate to say the least that in some cases those making the allegations appear unconcerned about the reputational or commercial damage their unsubstantiated allegations may cause to the organisation concerned or to any individuals they may name.  Often there are no consequences for them if their allegations prove to be without foundation whereas the reputational damage to the organisation or the individual may well be impossible to reverse.<br\/><br\/>If those making such allegations genuinely believe that the information that has been passed on to them is accurate and reliable, we would again urge that they pass it on to us or to the appropriate authorities so that it can be objectively investigated.  The committee will be aware that if a criminal act is alleged to have been committed, the individual making the allegation is obliged to report such matters to the Garda under section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011.<br\/><br\/>NAMA is well on its way towards achieving its primary objective of redeeming close to &euro;32 billion of senior and subordinated debt.  In addition, we hope to generate a surplus, the upper range of which is currently estimated at &euro;1.75 billion.<br\/><br\/>To put all this into context, we paid, as required by statutory regulations, &euro;5.6 billion of State aid as part of the acquisition price of our loan portfolio, in effect &euro;5.6 billion more than a private purchaser would have paid for this portfolio.  We have also had to take a cumulative impairment provision of &euro;3.5 billion.  Against that strong headwind, I believe that repayment of senior and sub debt, and generating a surplus will be recognised in time as a significant achievement in very difficult circumstances.<br\/><br\/>In time also, I believe that the intensive planning and preparatory work that we are currently carrying out will make a major contribution to the development of the Dublin docklands, as will the funding we are providing towards delivery of private and social housing, particularly in the Dublin area, where housing need is most acute, and the chief executive will elaborate on those plans in his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#K02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Daly.

I also propose to comment on a number of NAMA related issues which are currently receiving media attention, not least the content of statements recently submitted to the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Certain contentions made in these statements have been given widespread publicity and, if left unchallenged, could damage taxpayers&rsquo; confidence in NAMA&rsquo;s capacity to carry out its work in an objective, commercial and professional manner.  I will discuss this later in my statement.<br\/><br\/>With regard to progress on key targets, we have circulated to the committee a presentation which summarises our performance across a number of key areas on which I will highlight a number of points.<br\/><br\/>Last year, 2014, was an exceptionally strong year for NAMA.  We reported after-tax profits of &euro;458 million, an increase of 115% on 2013.<br\/><br\/>Cash inflows of &euro;8.6 billion in 2014 enabled us to redeem &euro;9.1 billion in senior bonds, almost a third of the senior bonds originally issued.<br\/><br\/>Yesterday, we submitted to the Minister for Finance our financial statements for the first six months of 2015 and I am pleased to say that the profit for the first six months of 2015 exceeded the full-year profit figure for 2014.  We expect that the half-year 30 June results will be published by the Minister over the coming weeks.<br\/><br\/>Since the end of 2014, we have redeemed an additional &euro;4.5 billion of senior bonds, including &euro;1.75 billion redeemed yesterday. This brings our cumulative redemption to &euro;21.1 billion or 70%<b><i><\/i><\/b>of the total of the &euro;30.2 billion originally issued.  It leaves us well placed to achieve our end-2016 target of 80% debt redemptions of &euro;24 billion, and our ultimate aim is to have all our senior debt redeemed by 2018.<br\/><br\/>Based on our 30 June 2015 impairment review, we have increased our projected terminal surplus from &euro;1 billion, which was estimated at the end of 2014, to &euro;1.75 billion.  We will undertake a further review at the end of 2015.<br\/><br\/>We are firmly on course to deliver 5,000 residential units by the end of 2016.  This will exceed our 4,500 unit target.  We will also deliver, and this is crucially important, 2,000 social housing units by the end of 2015.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>In terms of our accelerated disposals strategy,<b><\/b>total cash inflows since inception have now reached &euro;29 billion.  It is worth bearing in mind that, as recently as February 2013, the contingent liability on Irish taxpayers from Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, and NAMA was in excess of &euro;40 billion, which corresponded to about 24% of gross domestic product.  Today, it is &euro;9 billion or less than 5% of gross domestic product, which is a reduction of over 75% in the past 18 months.<\/p><p>There have been some criticisms of NAMA's accelerated deleveraging strategy and, in particular, there have been suggestions that we would have been better off waiting, holding all our assets until the market had improved further.  Let me make a number of points on this.  First, NAMA is accountable under the NAMA Act to the Minister for Finance, to the Government and to the Oireachtas.  We were asked by the Minister, following his section 227 review of NAMA in July 2014, to take full advantage, subject to commercial criteria, of the strong investor interest in Irish assets and to maintain a flexible approach with a view to accelerating disposals and senior debt redemptions beyond the 80% target that we had set for the end of 2016.  That is what we have done and it reflects the agreed strategy.<\/p><p> The Minister, in requesting that we accelerate disposals to the greatest extent commercially feasible, was conscious of the wider positive impact of such deleveraging and, in particular, the impact that it had, and continues to have, in terms of reducing the State&rsquo;s contingent liability.  The reduction in the contingent liability has been a major factor quoted by a number of credit rating agencies following their upgrades of Ireland's sovereign credit rating over the past year.  These upgrades have had the effect of widening the pool of investors who may hold Ireland's sovereign bonds and, ultimately, they have contributed to a reduction in Ireland's borrowing and debt servicing costs.  Reduced debt servicing costs on the national debt &ndash; currently over 100% of GDP - mean that Exchequer funds are available for other, more productive, purposes in the economy.<\/p><p> Second, as a major participant in the Irish property market NAMA did not have the luxury of taking a back seat in terms of instigating market recovery.  To get activity going and then to consolidate market recovery, NAMA had to ensure that a flow of transactions was released to the market, not least to sustain emerging interest from investors.  NAMA's market activity and deleveraging have contributed to the strong inflows of foreign capital which have been committed to the Irish commercial property market over recent years.  Without this capital, and given that the domestic banking system has been slow to recover, it is arguable that there would have been no property market recovery and that the overall recovery of the Irish economy would have been much more subdued.<\/p><p> The property market recovery has led to increased development activity and to job creation.  It is entirely unrealistic to suggest that recovery would have happened if NAMA and other major participants had stayed on the sidelines.  If we had not acted to instigate market activity, I can well imagine that we would have been subject to severe criticism from this committee and from others.  Sitting on our hands, waiting for something to turn up, was not an option.<\/p><p> More generally, if one was to listen to some of the commentary over recent months, one would get the impression that some pundits hold the view that NAMA should only sell assets if it was absolutely certain that the assets concerned would never appreciate in price after their sale.  This is a bizarre perspective and it would mean, in effect, that we would never sell anything.  Why would any professional investor, mainly pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and investment funds, commit their clients' money to Ireland if they did not believe they could make a return on their investment?<\/p><p> The reality is that NAMA has been faced from the beginning with managing numerous objectives and stakeholder interests, namely, the public interest imperatives of reducing the State's contingent liability and facilitating the provision of housing and office accommodation where they are needed and the commercial imperative of optimising the disposal value of the assets under our control and the need to ensure that we manage, in a professional manner, our engagement with our debtors, receivers, investors and members of the public who have an interest in, or are otherwise affected by, assets under our control.  What we have tried to do is to manage these potentially competing objectives and interests as professionally as possible while recognising that we cannot hope to satisfy all of them all the time.  We have been crystal clear and open about our strategies.<\/p><p> As regards docklands and residential initiatives, NAMA has an interest in 14 of the development blocks in the SDZ and detailed strategies have now been developed for most of those sites.  Construction activity has begun on one of the sites, 8 Hanover Quay, in which NAMA holds a minority interest as part of a qualifying investor alternative investment fund.  The development is pre-let.  Planning permission has been granted for three other sites, including the Boland's Mill site which is expected to deliver office, residential, cultural and retail accommodation totalling almost 400,000 sq. ft.  Planning applications have been submitted to Dublin City Council on a further five sites.  These include a site at 72-80 North Wall Quay for which Oxley Holdings Limited acquired a long leasehold interest from NAMA with the right to develop, manage and realise the site.  NAMA retains the freehold interest and will receive a secure income stream in addition to a percentage of any future sales proceeds.  It also includes a site in Point Village where the proposed development will consist of Dublin&rsquo;s tallest office tower, comprising over 200,000 sq. ft.<\/p><p> Of the remaining five sites, it is expected that planning applications will be lodged for one of them in the third quarter of 2015 with two more to follow in early 2016.  In addition, it is expected that a planning application will be lodged for a planned new north-south road serving the Point Village area.  Much progress, therefore, is being made in facilitating the delivery of new commercial and residential development in the docklands area.  Based on appraisal work carried out to date, it is estimated that up to 3.8 million sq. ft. of gross commercial space and 2,000 apartments could potentially be delivered if all the sites in which NAMA has an interest were to be fully developed over the lifetime of the SDZ.  Regarding the 3.8 million sq. ft. of office space, our asset management team has worked, over the past 15 months, towards securing planning permission for over 2 million sq. ft. of this.  This development will support the expansion of the financial services sector and the development of new FDI business and technology hubs in the docklands area.<\/p><p> As regards residential delivery, we made a commitment in late 2013 to fund the delivery of 4,500 residential units in the Dublin area by the end of 2016.  Some 1,900 units have been completed to date and planning permission has been secured for another 6,350 units, 1,600 of which are under construction.  With a total of 40 NAMA-funded sites now active, we are confident that the end-2016 target will be achieved.  In addition to the units already delivered and the units for which planning permission has been obtained, planning permission has been sought or will be sought by mid-2016 for another estimated 7,200 units.  We have sold, to a range of private sector buyers, sites that could potentially deliver over 11,000 units; only 900 units have been completed or are under construction on these sites to date.<\/p><p> As I mentioned earlier, NAMA&rsquo;s engagement with debtors has recently received considerable media attention, largely arising from certain witness evidence submitted to the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis and associated debtor engagement with the media.  We have written to the joint committee and have provided it with a detailed and comprehensive rebuttal of many of the contentions put forward in witness evidence.  It is possible that the joint committee may approve publication of our detailed rebuttal and indeed we would be keen that they put the facts on the public record.  As of now, however, the joint committee has advised us that we cannot publish our statement to it and, indeed, that we are prohibited from making any comment to the Committee of Public Accounts or any other public forum about specific witness evidence.  Therefore, in the comments that follow, I must confine myself to observations about our engagement with debtors in general.<\/p><p> While debtors are free to discuss their engagement with NAMA, we, on the other hand, are constrained by law - particularly by sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act enacted by the Oireachtas - from disclosing details concerning our engagement with debtors.  Let me state emphatically that NAMA deals with debtors objectively, commercially and professionally.  There is no question of any bias in favour of, or against, particular debtors.  NAMA deals with its debtors, regardless of their public profile or the particulars of any case, in a consistent and reasonable manner having regard to its statutory mandate.  Any suggestion that NAMA had some kind of unwritten agenda to damage debtors is utterly without foundation.  In fact, it is risible, not least given the considerable financial support that NAMA has provided over the past five years to a total of 265 debtors, large and small.<\/p><p> In its engagement with larger debtors in particular, NAMA adopted an approach which was far more patient, protracted and intensive than private investors would have been willing to adopt.  However, at some point in any protracted process of negotiation, agreement has to be reached and debtors must start delivering on debt reduction targets.  Engagement with debtors and their professional advisors can be robust on both sides as each side negotiates to enhance its commercial position.  That is entirely to be expected.  I would rather hear debtors complaining about our toughness than to hear that NAMA is being accused of being a pushover and not doing enough to extract the best return for taxpayers.<\/p><p> Did NAMA press its debtors to sell property in order to pay back some of their debt so that NAMA could reduce the State's massive contingent liability and thereby contribute to Ireland's exit from the troika programme?  We certainly did, and we make no apology for that.  Many of our debtors made it clear to us since 2010 that they wanted to sit tight, retain their assets and wait for years for prices to recover to pre-crisis levels.  This was not an option, not least because Ireland had entered into a programme of financial support in the form of the troika bailout with the EU, the ECB and the IMF and it was clear from our engagement with the troika that they regarded NAMA's commitment to redeem 25% of its senior debt by the end of 2013 as a major milestone that had to be achieved if Ireland was to successfully exit the programme.  Furthermore, it was unacceptable to us, and I expect that it would have been unacceptable to the Government and to members of the Oireachtas, that NAMA debtors should enjoy long debt repayment holidays at a time when almost 100,000 personal borrowers with distressed mortgages, and indeed many others who were making huge personal sacrifices, were being placed under pressure to make their monthly debt repayments.  Many of these personal debtors lost their jobs or had their incomes cut.  Many may certainly legitimately feel that they bear no responsibility for the financial and property crisis that engulfed this country.<\/p><p> NAMA is still working consensually with 70%, by value, of its debtors.  I will not suggest that all of these engagements are amicable; there has to be an inherent tension and robustness in a situation where NAMA is seeking to optimise the ultimate return for the Irish taxpayer and debtors want to optimise their own position.  Some will look to repay as little as possible; in fairness, others will seek to repay to their full capacity.  Needless to say, in those cases where it emerged that illegal attempts were made to put assets beyond our reach, we had to take appropriate action in the courts.  That would certainly have coloured our view of the claims made by certain debtors that they were willing to work with us to maximise the ultimate return for the Irish taxpayer.<\/p><p>We have recovered more than &euro;800 million from these debtors.<\/p><p> It should be clear to everyone at this stage that NAMA debtors do not consider NAMA to be a cosy bailout.  We make no apology for being rigorous, professional and fair.  It has been suggested recently that NAMA staff lack the requisite experience in finance and property.  That is untrue.  From the outset of its operation, NAMA, through the NTMA, recruited staff with a diverse range of skills and experience in disciplines, including banking, finance, law, insolvency, property development, asset management, architecture, engineering, surveying, planning and construction.  Indeed, an important rationale for the establishment of a single asset management entity in Ireland was the requirement for specialist skills, particularly specialist real estate skills, which had not been available in the banks responsible for the pre-crash lending.<\/p><p> We do not expect to receive eulogies from our debtors, but more objective commentators, such as the IMF, EU, ECB, World Bank, credit rating agencies, the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and many of the witnesses before the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis, have all stated that they considered that NAMA was carrying out its mandate successfully.<\/p><p> I commend the professional staff who work in NAMA and the NAMA board.  They have a difficult job to do in often difficult circumstances and they perform it to the best of their abilities in the interest of taxpayers.  I thank the committee for its time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McDonagh.

What becomes evident from the minutes is that there was a full discussion of Project Eagle.  I am sure that Mr. Daly is familiar with these minutes.  The sales process was discussed.  Mr. Daly provided an outline of that.  The approach from Pimco was discussed in some detail.  The discussion included external member feedback on the proposed approach.  Mr. Daly sought that approach and wanted it for a subsequent meeting on 10 October.  According to these minutes, Mr. Daly reminded members that this matter was politically sensitive and that absolute confidentiality was required.  This is just a sketch of what transpired at the meeting, but it does not read like the substance of a meeting at which members of the Northern committee were precluded from confidential NAMA information.

Brian Rowntree, the other advisory committee external member, was chairman of the housing executive so he had made a room available to us there.  When Mr. Rowntree resigned from that post, the NIHE was no longer available to us so Mr. Cushnahan said, \"I will get you a room in Tughans\", and we accepted.

The total cost that we paid to Tughans since the inception of NAMA is &euro;223,000 and that is for work in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#R00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":301,"content":"<p>The difficulty arises, Mr. Daly-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#R00200","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443690000,"counter":302,"content":"<p>And-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":303,"content":"<p>As Mr. Daly well knows, a member of his advisory committee - Mr. Daly is in charge of this operation, as is the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan in his role in the Government-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#R00400","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443690000,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Well, sorry, there is a board of NAMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Yes, and Mr. Daly is the chairman.

I will keep an eye on the clock, Cathaoirleach.  <\/p> <p>  The well managed competitive process involved the first preferred bidder, PIMCO, with Mr. Cushnahan in tow, being excluded from the process because PIMCO came forward, let us give it credit for it, to blow the whistle and to tell NAMA that there was funny business going on and there were requests for \"payola\", to use that term.

Cerberus, who finally succeeded in this regard, has surprise, surprise, the same cast of characters around it - Brown Rudnick, Tughans, etc. - advising it.

All of threads sort of come together.<\/p> <p>  Let us take it from the point at which NAMA decided.  It came to Mr. Daly's attention that there were difficulties with PIMCO, not least because of Mr. Cushnahan said they need to be excluded.  Mr. Daly communicated that to the Minister.  Mr. Daly has told us that he took the view that NAMA should motor on and the Minister agreed.  That was a crazy decision but none the less it is the decision that Mr. Daly took.  Mr Daly said thereafter that there was what he called a \"competitive tension\" that remained in the process.

Perhaps Mr. McDonagh might clarify that.  He referred to 6,500, and that 4,500 were refused.  If that is the case, it is an incredible statistic.  Mr. McDonagh might indicate how many local authorities were involved.  He might indicate how many were sites and how many were units of accommodation, and whether there was planning granted for these units.  In the middle of a housing crisis when Dublin City Council is looking for 20 sites on which to place modular housing to get some units in place before Christmas, I am amazed that a local authority would refuse any offer of a site.  Was it that NAMA was putting an exorbitant price on these units?  Was NAMA simply giving them back?  In the present circumstances with the shortage of housing, with the shortage accommodation and with people homeless, how could the local authorities have refused all of that?  Mr. McDonagh might clarify that for us and then indicate how many units still remain.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McDonagh indicated in his original contribution that 11,000 units had already been made available.  As he put it, \"We have sold to a range of private sector buyers sites that could potentially deliver over 11,000 units\".  Does that include the units that the local authorities have refused?  He further states, \"only 900 units have been completed or are under construction\".  If the local authorities declined to accept the units, why sell them on the open market when the construction sector is simply not building?  The sector has only built 900 to date.  Over what period of time are we referring to?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#Y00200","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443690000,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.

A resolution has to be found because the people living there are deeply affected by these problems.  Nobody should be put at risk in this day and age in my view.

When the other six were gone and when PIMCO pulled out or NAMA let it be known to PIMCO that is should pull out, we were down to two.  Considering that Fortress has made an underbid to the reserve, and had made that clear at a relatively early stage, as I understand, was it prudent to press ahead with the sale even though it reached the reserve by just &pound;1.241 million?  In those circumstances, there could be a question mark as to whether this was a prudent move, considering all the circumstances and the reason NAMA had to get a commitment by Cerberus that it had not paid any fees and so on and that it had indicated that might compromise the situation.

We have moved away from a bargain basement market in Ireland where it was very hard to attract any investors.  Clearly, NAMA has been successful in the recovery that has taken place.  There is no doubt about the fact that it has given a base to the market through the property which has attracted foreign investment.  Is it not the right time to do a complete review of NAMA's operations in the context of going forward on the basis of what it is doing in the docklands, which is a special development zone, where it is jointly involved with the developers and where there is planning for the future as distinct from simply an issue of the sale of properties?  NAMA owns 75% of the debt that is there and there should be long-term investment and long-term engagement by NAMA rather than to simply dispose of property as has largely been the approach to date.

Unless that is done, there will still be a very serious contingent liability on the backs of Irish taxpayers, even after the repayment today of another &euro;1.75 billion and the fact that there is now approximately &euro;9 billion left of senior debt.  That is an extraordinary performance because if we had been in here three or four years ago or even less where we had paid off &euro;21 billion with &euro;9 billion left, people would have laughed at us had we predicted anything like that.  The reality would have been that we would have been lucky to have had &euro;9 billion paid off and only &euro;21 billion left.  We have actually reversed it.  I believe, and I think the Minister also believes, that the key objective of repaying all of that debt should not be compromised for all of the reasons outlined in the chief executive's statement.  There are bigger issues there for Ireland about our credibility in the markets and with rating agencies and with access to finance.<\/p> <p>  The other two strands we are involved in very firmly include the SDZ.  Nobody is saying that NAMA will shut up shop in a year or two and abandon the SDZ.  We have always indicated that however long that takes, we will be involved in it.  It is similarly the case with residential development.  We are committed to 4,500 houses at the end of next year and the social housing we talked about earlier.  We are doing a great deal of work on planning and infrastructure issues around housing.  There will be a long-term deliverable from NAMA in relation to that whether it be in planning, infrastructure or whatever.  We will stay there for as long as that takes.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's other issue is whether we should suddenly slow down and stop selling, which is what I presume he means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#AA01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Well, not just to move-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#AA01400","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443690000,"counter":516,"content":"<p>If we do that, it will undoubtedly compromise our capacity to repay our debt and to be involved in housing and the SDZ.

Nobody is suggesting it has been involved, or complicit, in anything like that.  It is important for people to realise that.  What is significant about what Mr. Daly has been saying here today, however, is that it may well have been utterly incompetent in what happened and got a very bad deal as a result of swimming with sharks or, possibly, due to naivety or incompetence.  It appears that something is very badly wrong with this particular episode and that NAMA has certainly had an important role to play in it.  That is where I differ with the witnesses so strongly about NAMA going to Northern Ireland.  The excuse that NAMA is publicly accountable to us, which is absolutely true, does not merit its refusal to co-operate fully with the inquiry being carried out by the Northern Ireland finance committee.<\/p><p>Could Mr. Daly explain to us why he is prepared to give written, and not verbal, replies?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#AA01700","speaker":"953","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443690000,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the acknowledgement at the beginning of his intervention that there is no suggestion of any malfeasance by NAMA.

The Deputy said we had refused to co-operate fully with the Northern Ireland committee.  We certainly have not refused to co-operate.  The issue is around whether we go to the Northern Ireland finance committee in Stormont and present ourselves there as witnesses.  While I do not want to go back over old ground, our view is that we present ourselves here to the members of this committee as witnesses.  There has never been any suggestion that we are not accountable to this committee, although that has been said in the D&aacute;il, which was wrong; we are accountable to the committee.  There has never been any suggestion that the questioning that happens in the committee is not rigorous enough to get from NAMA any information it wants.<\/p> <p>  We have co-operated extensively with the committee in Northern Ireland.

We told our executives to return to PIMCO and indicate that, in the circumstances, we did not believe it could continue in the process and either they should leave the process or we would take steps to ensure they were not entertained any further.

There was great sensitivity actually around that.  During discussions with the then Minister, Mr. Lenihan, in 2009, it was agreed that part of the response to this would be to create a Northern Ireland advisory committee with no decision-making powers, but which would advise the NAMA board on broad strategic issues around Northern Ireland.

When I was here in July I told the committee that I had briefed the Northern Ireland committee in October 2013 that there had been an expression of interest from PIMCO.  That was all.  So that was the first indication we had.  After a period of a couple years of almost stagnation where there was very little interest in the Northern Ireland assets or very little interest, by the way, in somebody from Northern Ireland coming to us and proposing that we might invest or do this, that and the other.<\/p> <p>  Then one gets an indication that there is.  Here is a very credible international investment fund that is interested.  Of course we looked at it and we assessed it, and decided - against the wishes of PIMCO by the way - that we would go for an open-market transparent process, and that is what we did.  Initially we decided, I think, at a board meeting in October that we would pursue the thing with PIMCO and see how seriously they are interested - is this a try-on?  Then when we determined that they were, we decided to go with an open-market process.  In the December 2013 board meeting we decided to go with the open-marketed process.  In January we appointed Lazard as the loan sales broker, which is what we would do.  It is quite normal in a lot of large portfolio sales.  That was the process.<\/p> <p>  We did, obviously, look at whether there were other options.  What would the other options be?  Sell it in smaller lots; sell each asset; wait in Northern Ireland until 2020 or whatever.  What was the opportunity cost of that?  I mentioned that to Deputy Costello.  The opportunity cost is we were going to be tied up in those individual assets - not great assets in an economy that was, at the time, pretty stagnant - there was no great interest in them - with greater opportunities elsewhere for NAMA to manage its assets and invest in its assets; opportunities here and opportunities in London.  All of that was taken into account in the decision to pursue a single sale with a reserve price, which was the one we calculated was the minimum value we would take for this and which was reached in the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#CC02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Daly to enlighten me on reserve prices.

I am even astonished by the assertion made by Deputy Ross regarding integrity and his assertion that the taxpayer did not get a deal.  I think NAMA has been extraordinarily successful, even this week with the sale of Project Jewel.  The stabilisation of and the level of growth in the economy would be quite different without this.  People are always looking at issues retrospectively, but when we look at the portfolio of properties in Northern Ireland and their location, we know there would be another question asked here today if those properties had not been sold.<\/p> <p>  The point has not been made clear here in regard to section 172 of the National Asset Management Agency Act.  Deputy Ross is very much aware that this legislation embodies protocols regarding the sale of assets.  We should consider the job opportunities, the redevelopment of the Docklands, the return from sales and the bond redemption.  Could Mr. Daly explain what has been achieved?  I believe what NAMA has achieved is extraordinary.  I have been in the Oireachtas a long number of years and was here at the time of NAMA's formation under the former Minister, Brian Lenihan.  We should look now at the return to the Exchequer and the profit that was projected by 2018.  It is very easy to evaluate property now, but nobody knew the value in 2008 and 2009 when these were all unsecured bad debts.  <\/p> <p>  It is very easy to cherry-pick, or for Deputy Wallace to come in and cherry-pick a property that might double its value, but he is not looking at the properties that might be getting a 5% gain.  Will Mr. Daly give us a run through of the aggregate?  It is more about the net profit overall rather than the amount of profit on every item.  We have to take into account the whole bag of the mixed portfolio that was handed over to NAMA.  I am very disappointed by the unfounded allegations made by a Deputy who is not prepared to attend any committee as a witness but who could throw out a statement that, seemingly, Sinn F&eacute;in wants to use as a political statement in the Northern Ireland Executive.  It does not surprise me that many of the institutions of the North are not fully functioning with Sinn F&eacute;in's style of operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#EE02400","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443690000,"counter":682,"content":"<p>I do not think I will get into the political debate, North or South, on this.<\/p> <p>  On the overall figures, the CEO is probably better placed to deal with this, as he outlined in his statement this morning.<\/p><p>Today we have the extraordinary situation in which we have repaid &euro;21 billion and there is just over &euro;9 billion left of debt.  A few years ago, if we were before the committee we would have felt lucky to be able to say &euro;9 billion had been paid and only &euro;20 billion or &euro;21 billion was left.  The situation has been totally reversed.<\/p><p> The docklands investment by NAMA will certainly be well over &euro;1 billion and probably between &euro;1 billion and &euro;2 billion over a period of years.  The investment by NAMA in housing will be in the billions as well and all of that is facilitated by good and clever management of assets and cash generation.  Members referenced Project Jewel and we got a very good price for that.  We would not have got as good a price if, during the process of managing that asset, some of the very bright people in NAMA had not suggested to the board that it needed to tidy up the loan, the asset, because there were loans within the portfolio held by KBC and Ulster Bank and it would, therefore, be a good move by NAMA to buy them out so that NAMA held the whole portfolio.  <\/p><p> There were other clever asset management activities during the period so that when we put a portfolio on the market it was clean, intact and easy for investment houses to understand.  That happens all the time in NAMA, in big portfolios, small portfolios and assets and it is something we should highlight a bit more.  I do not know if the CEO wishes to come in on that but that is where we are.  All of the portfolio sales, including Project Eagle, from which we got &euro;1.3 billion, have contributed to the developments and the investments and to the bond repayment NAMA has been able to make.

NAMA has reasonably sold its loans as a job lot in order to do a deal and to get its cheque within a short timeframe.  Let us be honest, people buy them for a return on their investment.  The consolidation of NAMA's role by Lazard has been skipped over.  It provided an independent valuation and due diligence on the properties and, while people can say a firm may have doubled its money on a property, many would not be sold otherwise.<\/p> <p>  It is regrettable that alarmist reports have emanated without foundation.  This damages Ireland.  We are a country with the biggest property conglomerate in the world, with a huge portfolio of property in Ireland, the UK and the US.  With section 172 in place, where would one find the people with the capacity to do these deals?  The integrity of the board, which includes a former chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, is being brought into question by some remarks made today but I am not impressed with them at all because the figures speak for themselves.  NAMA has sold difficult properties in bad locations without title but NAMA and Ireland Inc. are damaged by unfounded allegations against the board, whatever it does in Northern Ireland.  If somebody is selling a product that person is not responsible for the purchaser or if they are it is something new that I do not understand.

I think NAMA played no small part in this because of its strategic decisions around investment and divestment in the Irish market.

The answer is, as has been alluded to by Deputy Perry, because of section 172.  We cannot do it.  We are not allowed to do it.  I presume Deputy Wallace knows that.  He is a Member of the Legislature that deals with the National Asset Management Agency Act and that is in the Act.  Those are the type of allegations that are damaging and they are totally without foundation.  The most recent allegation is that &euro;45 million has been paid as fixer fees.

He will understand when I make clear what I am coming at.  When NAMA was being set up, approximately &euro;70 billion of loans were transferred to it at whatever figure.  There was approximately 50% of a discount, and there were different levels of discounts depending on the particular bank.  From recollection, and Mr. McDonagh will appreciate I have not looked at this recently, NAMA had a much bigger write-down in respect of the Anglo Irish Bank loans.  They came at a bigger discount whereas the Bank of Ireland loans that came to NAMA were probably a little better.  Of the loans transferred to NAMA, the taxpayer knows the banks from which they came.  It is only right at the end of the process, and Mr. McDonagh said NAMA is nearly there, or at least 70% there, that we would like to know the outcome with regard to those.  Mr. McDonagh is saying that in his handling of it he could have had a debtor who had loans across the institutions.  That is fine, but I am putting Mr. McDonagh on notice, in the interest of accountability and transparency, that we would like to see the outcome in terms of the way those loans of financial institutions actually worked at the end of the day because that will tell us how much Anglo Irish Bank, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB or whoever cost us.<\/p> <p>  However, if Mr. McDonagh is telling us that at the end of that process the loans NAMA took in from Anglo, for example, book debts of &euro;20 billion, we need to know at the end of NAMA's work what we got back out of that &euro;20 billion.  Did we get &euro;25 billion or &euro;12 billion?  Mr. McDonagh seems to be telling me now that in terms of that line of accountability and traceability with regard to what happened the biggest financial institution and property management company in the State, it is possible we might lose that.  I am saying we cannot lose it.  The Irish taxpayer will want to know that final breakdown.  We know what we gave NAMA.  The Irish taxpayers know the write-down in terms of what went in.  They are entitled to know what came out at the bottom end for those relevant institutions.

I note this committee co-operated with the Public Accounts Committee in Northern Ireland on another issue and in that regard, I found that to be highly beneficial to the whole process of understanding where the money went, how it all functioned and so on.  It was a worthwhile exercise for this committee and it showed how the two different jurisdictions can function well in the interests of the taxpayer.  I am of the view that I believe NAMA's representatives should attend the Northern committee.  The witnesses have heard that echoed around this meeting room today and I encourage NAMA to reconsider its position.  I do not see what it has to lose and can only view what is to be gained by NAMA's attendance, even in respect of the optics of so doing, which is important.  Mention again was made about damage to NAMA, perception and all the rest.  Sometimes, the little things one does or does not do cause more harm and in this instance, I consider that to be a minor detail in terms of how NAMA presents what story it has to tell.  It is like its appearance here today, some members thought NAMA was under attack or whatever.  I look at it differently and perceive its attendance here today to be an opportunity for NAMA to clarify all the issues that have been raised and to deal with the public concern that exists.  That exchange within this Parliament is hugely positive and equally, in acknowledging the Northern Ireland Assembly and what it is attempting to do, it would be equally as important for NAMA to attend there.  It would remove the perception down here there must be something odd going on in NAMA if it did not follow through to another Government committee or committee of the Assembly in Northern Ireland.

I wish to ask the witnesses about Project Eagle.  It is an important question because of what has happened since regarding the reputation of NAMA and the potential damage to public trust in NAMA as this matter has continued.  Mr. Daly has made clear that when the agency found out that Mr. Cushnahan was to have taken a fee, it stepped in quickly, I think Mr. Daly said within a day and a half, and it considered the exit of PIMCO and consulted Lazards.  I take it from this that Mr. Daly felt that the integrity of NAMA's process was still intact and that it should continue.  In hindsight, was that a bad decision and has that caused damage to NAMA, to NAMA's reputation and how the agency is perceived?  Mr. Daly himself talked about Cicero's quote, \"who benefits?\", and about the people who tried to damage NAMA by leaking information such as failed bidders or underbidders.  However, it is not only people who leak information to damage NAMA who are involved in this regard; it also is NAMA's decision-making process and this must be thought about.  Should NAMA have considered this in greater depth at the time?  Did NAMA discuss it sufficiently?  Should it have stepped out of this process?  Having given some thought to that question at this point, one journalist framed this issue by suggesting NAMA has lost the narrative and there may be some truth to that.  However, it stems from the decision made to continue with the process after NAMA found out the individual in question was taking a fee.  Consequently, it comes back to Mr. Daly and the decisions he has made or rather, not him personally but the decisions NAMA's board has made.  Was that a mistake and in hindsight, was its correct to proceed with this or should NAMA have stopped the process when it had the chance?  Have the witnesses considered this point in the interim?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#NN02700","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443690000,"counter":924,"content":"<p>First, we always consider these things at the time and we continue to consider them.  There has been a lot of consideration of this issue in NAMA.  The damage, if there is damage, has been driven quite a bit by the conflation of issues that have emerged after the sale with the actual sale process itself.  There has been huge conflation of issues in this regard and if the Deputy considers what the Northern committee is investigating, it by and large is focused on issues that arose after the sale on the purchase or the buying side.  Once the word \"NAMA\" is mentioned anywhere in a narrative, certainly down here, the message or narrative gets a little garbled and misunderstood.  I accept that point.  As to whether damage has been done to NAMA, there are different constituencies out there.  As for NAMA's standing with the investor community, the markets, the rating agencies or with many of those people who think through these things and look behind the headlines, I do not believe NAMA's reputation has been damaged and I do not think it has in any way compromised our capacity and ability to do our job.  I do not wish to go back over the entire narrative or discussion on the decision-making process at the time.<\/p><p>It was not something we did not consider - whether we should just abort the sale.  We weighed up the pros and cons and, in essence, we still had two competitive bidders in there for this.  We had exited the one of which we thought there would be reputational or perceptional damage if it had continued.  We still got our reserve price.  We still believe we got a very good deal on this.<\/p><p> We always would examine our decisions both with hindsight and at the time.  One thing we did learn from this, and one change we have made, is that we now always ask for a declaration from whoever is buying any portfolio that there is no success fee or any money payable to anybody connected with NAMA.  We pitch that very widely, whether it be a board member, an advisory committee member or a member of the executive or staff.  We get declarations from them.<\/p><p> I do not think I mentioned that this morning, although it has been mentioned before, that when Cerberus bought the Northern Ireland portfolio, it gave us such a declaration because we insisted on that after the PIMCO issue.  Cerberus has assured us then and since, in terms of any payments it made as a result of the Project Eagle sale, that it stands over those payments as being legitimate and that it is not in any way in contravention of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the states, which is something it takes very seriously as a US-based company.  Cerberus stands over that very strongly to this day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#NN02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":926,"content":"<p>I have to ask Mr. Daly one very small, constituent question while he is here.

In addressing the five presidents' report, numbers crop up a lot, along with the four unions they mention and the varying degrees to which they are being achieved.  These are economic, financial, fiscal and political union.  We can go through them and see if these are real objectives or just objectives in a report that will not really go anywhere.<\/p> <p>  We can class economic union as being aspirational.  This deals with what countries should do.  For example, countries should put more emphasis on competitiveness and watch their macroeconomic indicators, but there is no specification of what countries should engage in doing.  There is very little specific policy under economic union and it is more about having economies that are similar rather than forcing through this process.<\/p> <p>  The one actual union where progress has been made is financial union, particularly through the banking union, the single supervisory mechanism under the ECB and an agreed mechanism for a banking resolution.  Under that is capital markets union and we are still not sure whether that will progress.  There is emphasis on this at the EU level to allow small and medium enterprises, for example, to fund themselves and have risk sharing across borders.<\/p> <p>  Fiscal union in the report is largely notional and there will not be a fiscal union.  The report explicitly rules out cross-border transfers, so with fiscal union, they are just looking for a degree of integration without actually undertaking any fiscal union.  We can classify political union as being temporal.  It is a matter of greater timing integration between parliaments in terms of how things are done, such as budgets, and how documents are produced and analysed.  It is a case of every country going at something at the same time rather than being more closely politically integrated.<\/p> <p>  We can compare it with the four presidents' report of a couple of years ago - the President of the European Parliament has been added to get us up to five presidents - and see a number of significant elements that are gone.  Fiscal integration is gone.  There were fiscal transfers in the previous report from 2012 but that element is no longer there.  They speak about fiscal union now in more general rather than the specific terms of the previous report.  From an Irish perspective, we also see that debt mutualisation is gone and there will be no EU issuing of debt on an aggregate basis.  Those elements from the previous report are gone.<\/p> <p>  We can consider what has been added since the previous report.  From fiscal union we have gone to fiscal stabilisation, and the report does not seem to be sure about what that means.  They speak about some class of fund but it is emphasised that there would be no permanent cross-border transfers.  So if there are fiscal crises in country, it is not clear that there is any mechanism for dealing with them as of yet.  With banking, there are of course moves to have common deposit insurance and if banks get into trouble, it would be at an agreed international level.  There would still be some national deposit insurance but they are just looking for funds at an aggregate level if the difficulties exceed what a national fund can provide.<\/p> <p>  I should emphasise that they are not really looking for fiscal integration but the report proposes a European fiscal advisory board.  I imagine that could be something similar to a fiscal advisory council that we have at the national level.  Perhaps, as we know in Ireland, there are limited powers in a fiscal advisory board, particularly here.  In some countries, the fiscal advisory council can set the macroeconomic projections that the government must use.  In Ireland, all the Fiscal Advisory Council does is approve the projections if they are in a certain range.<\/p> <p>  We can consider what should be in the report or what is missing.  It is clear there is no focus on having a eurozone fiscal stance, with fiscal integration hugely reduced.  Issues like counter-cyclical policy do not appear at all.  In Ireland we know the value of that.  The eurozone has been going through a recession for the past five or six years but at an aggregate level, little has been done to integrate the policies.  Some countries, primarily Germany, had greater scope for fiscal expansion but others did not.  It would benefit the EU and the eurozone if it had such a stance but it is not there.<\/p> <p>  The European Central Bank, which is probably the most important European institution now, is also missing from the report, with very little mention of monetary policy, such as how it is set, how transparent it is and what are the objectives of monetary policy.  Currently, we are down to inflation but what about employment output and the stabilisation of the economy?  If we are not going to do it with fiscal policy, what are we going to do it with?  That is how I view the four unions.  The economic union is largely aspirational and asks that something should be done.  The financial union is actually happening.  Fiscal union is notional and there does not seem to be much to back it up.  Political union is more about timing and the temporal perspective.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude on how the five presidents' report might impact national parliaments and whether they will have a diminished role with the enhanced oversight from an EU level.  This depends on what a national parliament wishes to do.  If blame is to be passed to somebody else, a national parliament should have a diminished role.  So if we want to say the ECB allowed Irish banks to explode their bank lending or we adhered to the fiscal rules in the run-up to the crisis and it is all Europe's fault, there is bound to be a response from Europe to tighten regulations and say that blame cannot be passed to it any more.  At a national level, we should take enhanced responsibility for what we do.<\/p> <p>  Fiscal rules set out the overall space in which we operate but we must make the decisions ourselves.  The fiscal rules are like a speed limit but, in a sense, we decide how we are going to drive.  When following the speed limit, one must take into account the conditions of the road or the environment.  If a person is going downhill, he or she might not press the accelerator.  The Irish economy currently seems to be improving and we seem to be trying to push fiscal rules to the extreme.  Perhaps we should take a bit of responsibility ourselves so as not to get the maximum amount of taxing and spending from the rules but instead look to what is best for ourselves.  The rules are a guideline but we are free to do as we wish.<\/p> <p>  Pushing the rules to the extreme for the upcoming budget gives us a package of &euro;1.5 billion but that does not necessarily have to be split between tax cuts and expenditure increases.  We could have a budget with &euro;3 billion of tax increases, allowing for &euro;4.5 billion in expenditure increases.  Where we want to go is largely up to ourselves, although EU rules set overall guidelines.  There is a certain amount of responsibility that can lie at the domestic level as to how these rules are applied.  The behaviour and action should reflect our preferences rather than just the rules.<\/p> <p>  Bank resolution is happening at an EU level but that does not mean there is diminished responsibility at the national level.  If a bank gets into difficulty, there is now an agreed way for how that bank can be put into resolution, including what creditors would bear costs and so on.  At national level, one could still decide to rescue a bank and decide it is of national importance while bailing it out.  The first approach still happens here.  If we decide not to rescue it, we know the path as to what creditors would bear losses.<\/p><p>However, the ultimate responsibility still lies domestically.  It is not a case of someone forcing one to bail out one's banks.  One chooses to do it.  If one chooses not to, they can be resolved in an orderly fashion.<\/p><p> Finally, on the European semester and timing, is there a limited role for body such as this in the overall European semester?  By and large, many of the documents either come from our Government or Europe and are addressed or assessed here.  It may be, however, that there could be a increased role in the drafting or approval of the documents.  Every year, Ireland submits a stability programme update and a national reform plan.  Essentially, these come from the Department of Finance and only get as far as the Oireachtas after they have been submitted.  Could we not have a draft of those documents here in order that we might discover what is the focus in them and see if they are agreed?  When the reply comes back from Europe, it is based on what is in the documents.  Perhaps we could have a greater emphasis on what happens and what is included in them.  If there was some element of drafting here, there might be a greater sense of ownership over what actually goes into them rather than having these things coming down from on high.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015100100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443704400,"counter":980,"content":"<p>I apologise to all present - particularly a speaker such as Seamus Coffey - that I was detained in another meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015100100002#C00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443704400,"counter":981,"content":"<p>Good afternoon.  Like Seamus Coffey, I will say a couple of words on the five presidents' report.  As Mr. Coffey noted, this is the third such major document since the onset of the financial crisis, the previous two being the four presidents' report of December 2012 and the European Commission's blueprint of one month earlier.  There is continuity and evolution when one compares the 2012 document and the 2015 document.  The easiest way to confirm that is to look at the authors, two of whom from 2012 - Jean-Claude Juncker and Mario Draghi - are also authors of this year's report.  In a way, that is evidence of continuity and yet there is evolution.  I notice that the President of the European Parliament was not a co-author of the 2012 report whereas he is a co-author of the 2015 version.  That bespeaks a certain rise to prominence of the EU's only directly-elected institution - Parliament.  I also note that Donald Tusk is an author of this year's report not in his capacity as President of the European Council but rather in his role as President of the European Summit, the body that brings together the Heads of State and Government of the eurozone states alone.  It is a kind of subgroup, if one likes, of the European Council, and it informally began life in 2008 before having its existence formalised in the fiscal stability treaty in 2013.  It has met three times this year, largely due to the Greek crisis.  That bespeaks evolution.  In other words, one signatory of the 2015 report represents a major institution that did not even formally exist three years ago.  It gives us some idea of how rapidly the eurozone is developing.  Changes have occurred as individual, step-by-step reactions necessary to facilitate the survival of the eurozone through a period of crisis and change has been piecemeal.  It nonetheless has been astonishingly rapid, at least in institutional terms.<\/p> <p>  The eurozone's efforts to confront its challenges are leading it to become the new European Union.  What I mean by that is that the 19-member subgroup of EU member states is now beginning to occupy a role formerly occupied by the European Union as the centre of European economic and political integration for the foreseeable future.  That is significant.  The report only contains 21 pages, albeit of small print, but it is too long a document for me to go through in detail.  However, I note a few points I found of interest in the introduction.  We are told that European economic and monetary union, EMU, today is like a house that was built over decades but was only partially finished when the storm hit.  Its walls and roof then had to be stabilised quickly.  Now, we are told, it is time to reinforce its foundations.  That reminds us that the \"M\" in EMU is far better developed than the \"E\", or the economic side of things.  It is that which must be rebalanced somewhat.  Furthermore, the aim of the five presidents' report is to see the rather patchwork foundations rendered more coherent.  In other words, it is to see rules that are presently in intergovernmental treaties and documents such as the Euro Plus Pact - soft law documents - rendered part of the European Union legal framework.  That is significant.<\/p> <p>  A second striking observation in the report is that it sees the common destiny of eurozone members as requiring solidarity in times of crisis and respect for commonly agreed rules from all members.  There is a balance between the two of those.  That is the basic bargain underlying EMU in this document - adherence to the rules on the one hand in exchange for solidarity on the other.  Seamus Coffey has already gone through the four fronts on which progress is sought - economic union, financial union, fiscal union and political union - and I do not need to mention that again.  Another point I find significant is that it is envisaged in the document that there will be further sovereignty sharing within common institutions.  That relates to the bargain I have just mentioned.  Finally, an idea of the stages for when all this is supposed to happen is set out.  Nothing much is happening until 2017.  Very little is planned other than to build on existing instruments and make the best possible use of the existing treaties.  Stage 2 from mid-2017 onwards envisages concrete measures and commonly agreed benchmarks for convergence that could be given a legal nature.  It envisages legal intervention at that stage.  There is an undated stage 3, which shows the political difficulty on getting agreement on all this however systemically necessary it is.<\/p> <p>  In the remaining time open to me, I want to look in greater detail at chapter 5 of the report entitled \"Democratic Accountability, Legitimacy and Institutional Strengthening\".  What that means exactly is unfortunately not really spelled out.  We are told that greater responsibility and integration at EU and eurozone level should go hand in hand with greater democratic accountability, legitimacy and institutional strengthening.  Like love and marriage, one is not supposed to have one without the other, as the song says.  We are told in the vaguest of terms that we need better sharing of new powers, greater transparency about who decides what, more dialogue, more trust and more capacity to act.  All the same, those concepts give us an idea of the direction the report wants to go in.  Also, it is interesting that accountability, legitimacy and institutional strengthening are associated with the community method.  There is, in effect, an apology in the report for having chosen intergovernmental solutions in the past.  Beyond that, however, we are given just a number of concrete proposed reforms.<\/p> <p>  We will have a very quick look at those reforms as that is what they are going to be aiming at in this regard.  The first is a key role for the European Parliament and national parliaments.  That is a stage 1 proposal, in other words something that is supposed to be of immediate interest.  It relates to democratic accountability and is really the only one of the five proposals that has to do with that.  There are five elements to what the five presidents recommend - that is, five sub-proposals, if I could call them that.  The first two are linked to a proposal made elsewhere in the report to restructure the European semester into two successive stages, distinguishing more clearly between the European stage and the national stage.  Sub-proposal 1 then is that the European Commission could engage with the European Parliament at a plenary debate before the annual growth survey is presented.  Sub-proposal 2 is that another debate would be held on the presentation by the Commission of country-specific recommendations.  That is democratically interesting although it is not so interesting for national parliaments.  It is really a European Parliament matter.  Sub-proposal 3 is of interest to national parliaments.  It is that Commission and Council representatives would participate in inter-parliamentary meetings, in particular although apparently not exclusively, during the European parliamentary week.  As such, the Commission and the Council want to have a bigger role in there.  As national parliaments take part in that particular week, the proposal is of interest to them.<\/p> <p>  Sub-proposal 4 is perhaps the most pregnant with possibility for national parliaments, if I can put it that way.  It proposes that the European Commission should work out model arrangements to make the interaction with national parliaments more efficient.  It is proposed that such interactions should apply to national parliamentary debates both on country-specific recommendations addressed to individual member states and within the annual budgetary procedure.  That is a really interesting idea because certain national parliaments are notoriously sensitive about being told what to do, which explains why the language in Article 12 of the Treaty on European Union is so vague.  The original draft of article 12 provided that national parliaments \"shall\" contribute actively to the good functioning of the European Union.  The scrutiny committee of the House of Commons objected to that and it was watered down to the current version that national parliaments \"contribute\".  In other words, no obligation is imposed.  It is merely a noticing of what they do.  However, the reality is that national parliaments need to learn from each other how to cope with common challenges.  While bodies such as COSAC can play a useful role, the Commission proposes, in effect, another strengthened learning process and model arrangements as to how national parliaments could confront the task of dealing with country-specific recommendations.<\/p><p>It is difficult to object to an idea such as that.  Obviously, the model arrangements themselves will not be binding.  It will be up to national parliaments to decide whether they want to adopt them, and yet they will exert a certain peer pressure on national parliaments to up their game - a kind of standard by which parliaments will be able to judge each other.  The Oireachtas, notwithstanding positive recent reforms in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il, does not number among those EU countries which give the most powers to their parliament and it can only gain from this particular initiative.  Of course, we will have to see what the model arrangements will be, but we should watch this space for interesting developments.<\/p><p> Proposal 5 is that national parliaments should make more use of the right recognised in the two-pack legislation to convene a Commissioner.  It is not commonly known that this right exists, but it does, first for presentation of the Commission's opinion on a draft budgetary plan under Article 7.3 of Regulation 473\/2013, and second for presentation of the Commission's recommendation to a member state in the excessive deficit procedure under Article 11.2 of the same regulation.  They are simply encouraging more use of that possibility where one has a legal entitlement to get a Commissioner in before national parliaments.<\/p><p> The remaining proposals are largely about institutional strengthening and maybe legitimacy rather than democratic accountability.  I can go through them rapidly.  Proposal 2 is consolidating the external representation of the euro, and that is intended to be both in stage 1 and stage 2, in other words, now and from mid-2017 onwards.  It is a proposal that is directed more at institutional strengthening than democratic accountability and legitimacy.  The idea is that the EU and the euro area are still not represented as one in international financial institutions, and that fragmented voice means the EU is punching below its political and economic weight.  The Commission points out that that is particularly true in the case of the IMF.  It is obviously desirable that the eurozone and the EU would punch with the maximum amount of weight in this regard.  These meetings do count for an awful lot.  If I mention former United States Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Timothy Geithner, the G7 meeting and the word \"bailout\" all in the same sentence, one will see the important of these meetings and strong representation at them.<\/p><p> The third recommendation is integrating intergovernmental solutions within the EU legal framework.  That is something that is envisaged from mid-2017 onwards.  That also has to do with institutional strengthening and perhaps legitimacy.  The shortcomings of the EU's architecture were patched up by a series of intergovernmental treaties and soft law arrangements.  We had the fiscal treaty, the European Stability Mechanism, the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Single Resolution Fund and the Euro Plus Pact.  All these solutions were taken as an alternative to amending the treaties.  Ideally, such developments should have seen treaty developments at this stage but the member states did not want to have treaties, and the Commission is proposing that.  I do not know how enthusiastic the member states will be about doing that.  We will have to wait and see.  It is something, certainly, that the Commission would like to see.<\/p><p> A central steer by the Eurogroup also seems to be a stage 1 and stage 2 proposal.  It also has to do with institutional strengthening.  While he Eurogroup is provided for in two articles in Protocol 14 to the treaties, it is under-provided for.  In reality, it is becoming an increasingly important body.  Gradually, it is eclipsing ECOFIN at this stage.  That is not reflected in the treaty provisions and the Commission wants to see that amended.  Ultimately, it wants to see something like a full-time president, such as the European Council President, introduced there.<\/p><p> A euro area treasury is mentioned.  That seems to be a stage 3, undated proposal.  That has to do with institutional strengthening.  The idea is that a genuine fiscal union will need more joint decision-making on fiscal policy.  As the euro area continues to evolve, some decisions will increasingly need to be made collectively.  As for the kind of model, it is not a new idea.  The French Minister, Mr. Macron, and academics such as Jean-Claude Piris have put forward similar ideas.  For example, I have seen the idea of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy put forward as a model, in other words, that one co-ordinates the various policies that are scattered among various institutions and officials at present and puts them under one roof, so to speak.  In the longer term, if one wants to see a more federal structure emerging and a shift to the idea of a federal budget, however limited, that would be the beginnings of such an idea.<\/p><p> Those are the ideas that are put forward in this document.  How long it will take to see them put into force is not so much up to the Commission as it is up to the member states, but I think we will see movement in that general direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015100100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Gavin Barrett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443704400,"counter":983,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Barrett.  I will kick off by following up on his last point of the governance in the eurozone area.  The British referendum on membership is approaching.  In the Bloomberg speech in 2013, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, listed five areas about which he would be concerned and on which he would like to see progress, one of which is fairness whereby any country that is outside the eurozone should have equality with those countries that are within the eurozone in terms of the procedures that are put in place.  Would Professor Barrett see anything in this document that might make it more difficult for the British Prime Minister to make the case for the United Kingdom to stay in Europe?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the proposed competitiveness authority.  The document states that these authorities will look at such matters as the wage rates in countries and comparing them with those prevalent in other countries that are trading partners, presumably countries such as China and the United States.  Will that competitiveness authority in Ireland, when it is set up, be in conflict with the Low Pay Commission that we have just set up?  How will those two organisations balance each other out?<\/p> <p>  On Professor Barrett's comments about the role of national parliaments and the European Parliament, he would be aware that Article 13 of the fiscal compact recommends two meetings per year between national parliaments and the European Parliament and others.  The next one is in a few weeks time in Brussels.  Could that be strengthened further in order that we can increase the role of national parliaments, specifically in the semester, and achieve our involvement at an earlier stage?<\/p> <p>  My final question concerns COSAC.  It is working and continues to improve.  National parliaments are coming together in a range of areas, such as proposals to improve the use of the yellow card and to pilot the use of the new green card.

I have some general questions.  A quite fascinating debate is taking place, and a fascinating debate is taking place elsewhere, such as that on the rise of nationalism in Spain.  Catalonia may want to break away and there is conflict with central government.  Britain is taking a certain route and there are worries about the British Labour Party under its new leader, whose support for the Union is questionable.  Collectively, we are trying to strengthen the institutions, yet there is in the ether nationalistic turmoil of all sorts that will probably only grow.  In this regard, one should consider what is happening in north Italy.  These phenomena are evident, yet we are trying to strengthen the institutions.  In trying to do so, we are talking about sovereignty.  A major point concerning the British is the lack of sovereignty and their fear of ceding more sovereignty to the centre.  In fact, they are trying to claw it back.<\/p> <p>  We are backbenchers.  Somebody congratulated the Government on some sort of reform.  We have reduced the number of seats in the Parliament by eight, or thereabouts.  This is the committee responsible for EU affairs.  There are up to five of us present, but there are 166 Members of the Parliament.  How do the delegates believe the complexities spoken about by my colleague from Fianna F&aacute;il can be relayed to the lad with the pint in his hand in the pub?  It is a massively complex arena and there is considerable conflict.  There is growth in certain areas of euroscepticism.<\/p> <p>  I should qualify my position and say I am a fanatical supporter of the concept of strengthening Europe.  However, this raises very challenging questions.  Somebody mentioned the House of Commons but we know that in England, the House of Lords is specially structured to deal with the EU issues.  It does substantial work and produces mammoth documents.  In the interest of democratic accountability, how should this national Parliament structure itself to engage more seriously in this debate, which is ultimately about us, as politicians, relaying what is occurring and evolving to the fellow with the pint in his hand?  That is the major challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015100100002#E00300","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443704400,"counter":990,"content":"<p>I thank the members for the questions.  On the United Kingdom's position in the European Union, as mentioned by two Deputies, we must recognise that many of the difficulties created over the past couple of years may have arisen largely because of the United Kingdom's reluctance to become directly involved in solving the crisis.  Therefore, there are intergovernmental agreements.  Since all 28 member states, or 27 at the time, could not agree, there was approval by 25.  Therefore, the treaty on stability, competition, governance and growth is essentially an intergovernmental agreement simply because the United Kingdom decided to opt out of it.  That creates difficulties.  There are certain elements that one now wants to formalise, as Professor Barrett mentioned, for inclusion in the treaties.  The United Kingdom is seeking to have different elements changed.  Therefore, there is conflict over putting what we have in place in a formal setting.  The United Kingdom is seeking to change much of what is in place already.  It is hard to see how an agreement could be reached.  Both parties could come to the table, but both have somewhat different objectives.  With regard to whether the European Union is viewed as being fair or unfair in the United Kingdom, I always find those in the United Kingdom speak out of both sides of their mouths given the rebate negotiated by Margaret Thatcher.  It is not that the United Kingdom is doing poorly from the European Union in the financial sense.  Its contribution could be much larger without the rebate being in place.  There is little doubt it will remain.  If it were to go, it would further strengthen the argument for leaving the European Union.  There are difficulties.  It is not so much a question of the negotiations Mr. David Cameron will have with the European Union that matter.  What will matter is what he actually says to the UK people.  It is up to him state whether he has gained something.  That will be crucial in the referendum.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the National Competitiveness Council, there may be conflict with the Low Pay Commission.  From an economic perspective, there may be a difference between the trading and non-trading economy.  The trading economy involves exports and imports and dealing with other countries whereas a non-trading economy, by contrast, is largely domestic.  In the main, a body such as the Low Pay Commission deals with the non-trading economy, the retail sector and domestic sector.  The envisaged competitiveness council is looking more towards exports and how that sector can be driven.  In the main, the exporting sector tends to be a high-paying sector, particularly in Ireland given the industries our exports come from.  I would imagine that there would not be much conflict with bodies such as the Low Pay Commission.  I believe there is scope for incorporation.  One could become a sub-body of the other, but I believe they are examining different issues.  I refer in particular to some of the countries that got into trouble during the crisis because of problems with their balances of payments.  They have more money going out than coming in.  In such cases, one must determine what is going wrong domestically in the economy such that exports are not being driven.  That is not really a problem we have here.  The two can interact and they are dealing with different problems.<\/p> <p>  Consider the objectives removed from the report, as referred to by Deputy Kyne.  In the main, they were removed because of political objections, especially from what we call the creditor countries.  They did not want to see them being permanent transfers such that there would be an increase in the income of other countries from giving them money, with the consequence that the German economy would be subsidising the poorer economies in the European Union.  Alternatively, if countries were running into difficulties with their debt and financial markets would not lend to them, they could simply come to this aggregate EU body and continue to spend in a manner that the creditor countries might consider profligate and other countries might consider imprudent.  In the main, the objectives are gone for political reasons.  The crisis has stabilised to certain extent, so perhaps the objectives are not as necessary as they were.  However, if one wants full European monetary integration, one has to get the monetary side right but there must equally be a fiscal role, which appears to have been pushed back.  Again, one might say the national parliaments want sovereignty over what they do within their domestic economies but it means that if a country hits a crisis, one will not have unemployment benefit, for example, coming in from a European federal fund.  If, for example, Florida goes through a crisis in the United States, there is an increase in payments to Florida from federal funds, and that can balance out what is happening.<\/p><p>Then another state hits a crisis and funds come in again.  While there are merits to it, people want a view.  In the US, the payment rates are the same across all the 50 states, whereas in Europe we must ask whether our unemployment benefits will be funded by money from France and Germany, and whether we should increase the rate given that the money is coming from elsewhere.  There are legitimate concerns and it is very difficult to have equal rates across the 28 countries.<\/p><p> I do not see a major role for the European Fiscal Advisory Council.  It can offer somebody to tell us the fiscal stance of the euro area as a whole.  If 18 countries are changing their taxes and Government expenditures, what impact is it having on the currency bloc as a whole?  Do we have a contractionary fiscal stance?  Are we in a recession?  Are we increasing taxes and cutting expenditure too much, or do we have an expansionary fiscal stance in aggregate?  We have the individual fiscal boards in each country to ask whether countries are adhering individually to the fiscal rules.  Maybe it would be appropriate to ask what we are doing collectively.  It has no enforcement capacity, given that the fiscal rules do not apply at the aggregate level.  Maybe they should, and we should be encouraging certain countries that have space to use it.  While it is largely for window dressing, in future the idea of fiscal union could come back into the five presidents' report and maybe, by then, we will have six or seven presidents all contributing to the document.  It could come back in as greater integration happens.<\/p><p> How can national parliaments get more involved?  The two questions tie over in terms of economic and financial supervision and the clash between sovereignty and the increasing role of nationalism.  National parliaments could get more involved in the drafting of documents that we submit as part of the European semester.  By and large, reams of paper are produced at official level, and some of the recommendations are discussed here.  The Parliament could discuss our priorities and identify our problems.  The country-specific recommendations, by and large, are based on what is submitted at national level.  Does our Parliament have sufficient input into what we submit?  Do we just get the stability programme update and simply accept it, with country-specific recommendations coming from it and from the national reform programme?  This could be revised not only in Ireland but throughout the EU.  National parliaments could be more involved in the European semester.  Now it is a case of hearing that the European semester is on and asking what the parliaments think.  We could get them involved from the ground up.  Driving it at national level would solve some of the nationalism issues.  This is where most of it must come from.  This is the national Parliament.  It should determine what we do, not receive documents and be told what to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015100100002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443704400,"counter":992,"content":"<p>There was concern about fairness for non-eurozone states, such as the UK, and whether what is indicated in the five presidents' report would make the case more difficult for Britain staying in.  Being outside the eurozone puts countries at a disadvantage compared to the states that are inside.  Either one is at the table and participating in the negotiations or one is not.  Although the UK is fighting a great rearguard action seeking justice and equality for the states outside the eurozone, if one is not at the table, it is very difficult to defend one's own interests.  For example, the Eurogroup meets the day before the ECOFIN council.  A 19-member subgroup of a 28-member European Union is well capable of deciding in advance what is going to happen at the ECOFIN council.  Britain is, and will continue to be, disadvantaged.  As the eurozone continues to integrate, Britain will be more disadvantaged as time goes on.<\/p> <p>  In so far as we relate it to the Brexit debate, the question is whether the UK will be more disadvantaged outside the EU, and the answer is that it will.  There is no ideal position.  Would a European system of competition authorities and a low wage commission pull in different directions?  The first point is that these would be advisory bodies.  While it is possible that they would pull, to some extent, in different directions, we definitely need to pay attention to both competitiveness concerns and low-wage concerns.  There are concerns about both and it is vital that they both have a voice in our political spaces.  At the end of the day, it is up to the Government to balance the concerns.<\/p> <p>  Could COSAC have a more powerful role in the European semester process?  Returning to the debates that occurred before the constitutional treaty, although the opportunity was there for national parliaments to achieve a stronger collective role, they did not want it.  As a result, COSAC is largely a networking opportunity.  I have heard it said that the most useful aspect of COSAC was the dinners that were held afterwards.  That was not meant in a cynical way, but to point out that it was useful for members to get together, talk with each other and compare the problems they were all facing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015100100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Gavin Barrett"},{"type":"speech","time":1443704400,"counter":993,"content":"<p>I continue to make this point about COSAC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015100100002#F00300","speaker":"976"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443704400,"counter":994,"content":"<p>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443704400,"counter":995,"content":"<p>It is useful.

It could do more in some areas - for example, a more significant role in the European early warning system would be very welcome.  However, that is not today&rsquo;s topic.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Crowe asked if I could tell him about country-specific recommendations.  He is no longer in the room.  This is provided for in EU Regulation No. 473\/2013.  No procedure is set out.  The Commission is entitled, under Article 7, to adopt an opinion on draft budgetary plans and can then adopt an opinion on revised draft budgetary plans.  Its opinion is made public and given to the Eurogroup, namely, the finance ministers of the 19 eurozone countries.  Thereafter, at the request of the parliament of the member state concerned or the European Parliament, the Commission shall present its opinion to the parliament making the request.  This seems to indicate that, no matter where in the parliament the request comes from, it can be accommodated.  Either the finance committee or the European Union affairs committee could facilitate it.  Article 11(2) sets out a similar procedure in the case of a risk of non-compliance with a deadline to correct an excessive deficit.  The Commission makes recommendations, presents them to the economic and financial committee and, at the request of the member state's parliament, can be brought in to explain its position.  This is a very important power that national parliaments have and it is up to them to decide how to use it.  The regulations are no more prescriptive than saying that national parliaments have these powers.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Dooley asked how we can make issues more relevant and pointed out that if something is not being discussed in the Oireachtas bar, it is difficult to interest the media in it.  It is a fair point which needs to be considered.  A centrally important question is how the Oireachtas relates to the European semester process.  In due course, with the model arrangements, we will receive some advice from Europe.  We must pay attention to timelines.  The European semester process is bounded by short timelines.  Once one gets hold of national reform programmes, country-specific recommendations, etc., committees should get their responses in on time.  The context of mainstreaming must be borne in mind.  Which committee should deal with the European semester process?  It seems it will be the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  Would the committee need to farm out particular aspects of the issues to other committees, and how would this be accommodated?<\/p> <p>  An issue that has occurred to me is that there is, on the one hand, the Department of Finance, with all of its experts, economists and resources, and on the other hand, the Oireachtas committees, with a comparative dearth of resources to compete.  How can national parliaments cope with this?  This overlaps with what we were saying.  Perhaps having hearings and inviting in members of civil society so they can express their views on country-specific recommendations and national reform programmes in particular might be a way of compensating for the inequality of arms between the Executive and national parliaments and perform a useful role that will matter to people.  The budgetary decisions matter to people, and various interest groups would be interested in coming here and making their voices heard regarding the European semester process.<\/p><p> Deputy Eric Byrne correctly raised the issue that on the one hand, we have all these crises fuelled to a certain extent by nationalism.  In addition to the ones he mentioned in Catalonia, there are matters like Brexit, the Greek issue and the immigration crisis.  At the same time, we have this report proposing further integration, so how does one balance the two of those?  That dilemma is very much reflected in this particular document.  Systemically what is needed is relatively clear but, on the other hand, as regards making that acceptable to the member states, it is fairly clear that we need to put much of this into the treaties.  Matters like the Euro Plus pact do not belong in soft law but in the actual intergovernmental treaties.  Getting member states to accept that, however, is a different thing.  The failure to specify deadlines, the vagueness which Mr. Seamus Coffey referred to earlier on in relation to this whole document, very much reflect the difficulty that the Commission and the EU as a whole face in this regard.  <\/p><p> I suppose there is nothing more to be said about it.  It is a difficult dilemma and, like the Deputy, I believe very much in the process of European integration.  All they can do is to continue along the gradualist route they have adopted and, hopefully, get there in the end.<\/p><p> As regards how to keep citizens engaged and how a national parliament should structure itself, various approaches are now possible.  One can have document-based scrutiny, get Ministers in and engage in political dialogue under the Barroso initiative.  There is the subsidiarity early-warning mechanism and contributing to the debates in a House of Lords style, coming up with serious heavy-duty reports on various areas of EU integration.  There is, therefore, a variety of ways in which national parliaments can engage in the process.  To a certain extent, a choice has to be made.  One cannot be good at everything and one cannot do all of these activities at the end of the day.<\/p><p> For instance, if one looks at the latest reports on political dialogue, one will notice that two committees, the Danish committee and the one in the Finnish Eduskunta, are commonly reputed to be the best and strongest committees on EU affairs.  They have hardly produced any reports at all concerning the political dialogue, however, which means not that they are unable to do so - because they are quite obviously able to do it - but that they have chosen to funnel their energies in a different direction.  They are funnelling their efforts in the direction of the mandating system they have in those countries - in other words, keeping control on Danish Ministers negotiating issues.  <\/p><p> In recent years, since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, a whole panoply of options has opened up for national parliaments.  Like every other EU parliament, the Oireachtas has choices to make as to how it wants to engage.  To my mind, however, engaging itself in the European semester would be a very good way of expending its energies.  That is something that matters to people and is vitally important to them.  It could be a way of bridging the gap between what is going on in this room and what is going on out there on the street.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015100100002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Gavin Barrett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443704400,"counter":997,"content":"<p>I would like to thank Professor Barrett and Mr. Coffey for their engagement with the committee on this matter.

There were 67,347 births in 2014 and it is projected there will be 65,473 for 2015.  Since 2012, there have been several reports on maternity services and lessons have been learned, informing how maternity services are now delivered.  In line with the HSE accountability framework 2015, the acute hospital division has established governance and management arrangements to support the ongoing monitoring and measuring of the implementation of recommendations from all reports.<\/p> <p>  The imminent maternity strategy will provide the platform for how maternity services are delivered to have a world class maternity service.  Since 2014, a number of maternity staff have been recruited who will improve maternity care, including additional midwives to Portiuncula Hospital, Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar and Wexford General Hospital.  A maternity anti-microbial pharmacist has been put in place in each hospitals group.  Funding for six additional obstetricians in 2015 for Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, Wexford Hospital, Waterford University Hospital, Letterkenny General Hospital and Sligo General Hospital has been made available and these posts are currently being progressed.  The requirement for additional midwifery staffing nationally will be informed by the outcome of the HSE commissioned national midwifery workforce planning review, Birthrate Plus, and the 2016 Estimates has made provision for additional midwifery staff as an immediate requirement.<\/p> <p>  Clinical networks are an important element of our strategy for increasing evidence-based practice and improving models of care.  Hospitals groups provide better opportunities for building effective networks to provide direct support which goes beyond oversight and planning and into direct hands of responsibility for solving problems.  Planning commenced at the beginning of 2015 for the integration of the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital and the women and infant service in Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  The process of establishing the first clinical network is a model which will provide a framework for all groups.  This hub-and-spoke model of obstetrics is intended to deliver the Coombe services on two sites according to agreed pathways and policies.  In March 2015, the Coombe board and the HSE Dublin Midlands Hospitals Group signed a memorandum of understanding to achieve this goal, contingent on well-planned integration.  A senior obstetrician from the Coombe was appointed as the director of integration and is on site in Portlaoise.  The Coombe-Portlaoise implementation planning is proceeding well.  There have been joint multidisciplinary workshops defining the pathways according to HSE national policies and the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, better health care standards.  Recommendations from the ongoing maternity strategy will be integrated.  My colleague, Dr. Susan O&rsquo;Reilly, can provide further detail and answer any questions.<\/p> <p>  In addition, Wexford General Hospital and Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar are developing closer links with the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, as part of the Ireland East Hospitals Group.  These links will strengthen clinical governance arrangements and will involve the review of maternity services medical manpower needs.  The RCSI Hospitals Group has appointed a clinical director for women&rsquo;s and children services who is leading on the development of the maternity clinical network to include Cavan General Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  My colleague, Dr. Alan Finan, can answer any questions on this.  In the South-South West Hospitals Group, a review of maternity services is under way which includes the establishment of a maternity clinical network with Cork University Maternity Hospital as the hub.<\/p> <p>  The Saolta University Health Care Group has in place a clinical director and group director of midwifery for women and children&rsquo;s directorate across the group and the clinical network is being established.  To support the networks, the national neonatal transport programme is now a 24-7 service for the retrieval, stabilisation and transfer of critically ill neonates up to the age of six weeks from maternity units outside of Dublin to one of the neonatal intensive care or paediatric intensive care units in one of the children hospitals.<\/p> <p>  The establishment of managed clinical networks will promote consistency and quality of service throughout the care pathway.  The HSE considers more needs to be done at a national level to ensure appropriate oversight and clinical leadership and to drive necessary reform and reconfiguration in maternity services.  Looking to the system for precedents of successful organisational reform, the National Cancer Control Programme stands as a model which has significantly improved cancer services and patient outcomes.<\/p> <p>  A programmatic approach to maternity services will underpin the provision of quality and safe, patient-centred, sustainable maternity care.  The programme will provide the necessary governance, integration and leadership to drive reform and standardise care across all units.  Such a dedicated structure will also ensure learning from adverse incidents is applied in a comprehensive and consistent manner and promote a national approach to consistent, evidenced-based practice in maternity care.  This approach will support staff and enhance the opportunity for optimal clinical outcomes for mother and baby through the integration of the best research evidence, clinical expertise and patient values into the decision-making process for patient care.<\/p> <p>  A charter for maternity care is being developed in partnership with the clinical programme for obstetrics and gynaecology.  The charter will outline a set of principles which describe what matters to women and their partners when engaging with and using maternity services.  It aims to inform and empower women to actively look after their own health and the health of the unborn baby, while influencing the quality of maternity care.  The work will be completed once the maternity strategy is finalised as the key components of the strategy need to be reflected in the charter.<\/p><p>The MN-CMS is an electronic health record, EHR, for all women and babies who access the maternity services in Ireland.  This system will provide accurate and up-to-date information to all those involved in the care of mothers and babies in maternity units.  The vision is to continue to develop the system to meet the ongoing changes within maternity services and to work closely with other national systems and initiatives to capture and provide key information.  This system, when implemented, will provide a seamless, complete and reliable source of all the information clinicians require to quickly and accurately make care decisions for the health and well-being of mothers and babies within Ireland.  Phase 1 of this project is focused on the initial roll-out to the following four hospitals in 2016: Cork University Hospital; the Rotunda Hospital; Kerry General Hospital; and the National Maternity Hospital.  This system will then be deployed to the remaining 15 maternity hospitals from 2016 onwards.<\/p><p> Moving on to the Irish maternity patient safety statement, a key concern for patients is that they receive safe and appropriate care.  The CMO Portlaoise report sets out the requirement for a maternity patient safety statement.  The maternity patient safety statement will provide up-to-date information for management and clinicians in maternity units on key patient safety issues.  It will have the advantage of creating a source of information that is much more accessible and transparent for the purposes of external scrutiny, including by the public.  The information within the statement will support local and hospital group management to identify trends, to target quality improvement measures and support ongoing risk assessment.  It is expected these statements will be published online on a monthly basis commencing with August 2015 data published in early October 2015.<\/p><p> As you may be aware, Chair, yesterday the HSE published on its website two reports that were undertaken as part of our internal review of maternity services by David Flory.  We can also address those, if required by the committee, or refer to them at a future date.  That concludes my opening statement and I look forward to taking members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443688200,"counter":1010,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Woods.

I thank him for his opening statement.  I am going to address the issues, largely from a more parochial point of view, and I give notice to Dr. Finan that I will concentrate more on the Flory report, as published yesterday, and on how it reflects on Cavan General Hospital.  I ask his indulgence in that respect because it is of considerable importance to the people who have entrusted me with the responsibility to represent them here.  It gives me great comfort and assurance to reflect on the positive report that has been published by David Flory.  It is most welcome that we had sight of the report in advance of today's engagement with our guests.<\/p> <p>  I wish to reflect on a number of points from the report.  Mr. Flory makes some general statements, not just in respect of Cavan or Clonmel - that will be of interest to my colleague, Deputy Seamus Healy - but he also makes a number of very important points.  He refers, for example, to cuts and the fact that they are still having a significant impact on day-to-day service delivery.  We are all - people who work at the coalface and those of us who are in roles of political responsibility - are very conscious of that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Flory also reflects, very correctly, on the fact that the absence of a clear and understood strategy for maternity services has given rise to speculation and suspicion and creates a negative environment that absorbs the energy which, in his words, \"can be better used focussing on day to day service delivery.  I recognise that to be the case and I welcome that it is spelt out in clear and unequivocal terms.<\/p> <p>  In the context of other matters, there is a perception about smaller units.  I suppose Clonmel would fall into that category and Cavan, at which there were approximately 1,800 births last year, would also come into that general sense of scale.  There is a shared perception that they are at the back of the queue when it comes to access to funding for capital works.  We have had that suspicion reflected before the committee previously.  We have known it with regard to other situations, namely, that someone, somewhere is planning to downgrade the sites or, even worse, to recommend closure.  There is no such recommendation in this report.  If anything, this is a report that substantively supports the retention and development of these sites.  I hope that message would come clearly from today&rsquo;s meeting.  There needs to be a scotching of that fear.  People should not be concerned about group relationships, as in any way undermining or impacting deleteriously in relation to existing provision.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Cavan in particular, and knowing many of the personalities involved, it is only right to reflect what Mr. Flory speaks of, namely, that it is a much greater number but, in terms of the core management of the hospital, he speaks of a small number of key individuals working beyond their contractual commitments and carrying a much broader range of responsibilities than their job titles entail.  There has been a change of personnel at the hospital and the general manager with whom Mr. Flory engaged has moved on to other responsibilities.  It is only fair that it would be reflected here this morning Mr. Flory's statement to the effect that Bridget Clarke sets a tone by her example of leadership, which is based on care and compassion.  Ms Clarke deserves to have that highlighted in the public arena because it is absolutely the case.<\/p> <p>  The other post to which Mr. Flory refers is the clinical director with responsibility for women and children&rsquo;s services.  I understand that is Dr. Finan.  Mr. Flory says of Ms Clarke and Dr. Finan that they are both are highly capable and that senior colleagues in the hospital have great confidence in them.  As a service user in the Cavan and Monaghan area, as father of five children and as someone who has had the occasion to present before Dr. Finan - in his capacity as a paediatrician - I acknowledge that is absolutely the case and I would even add much more to it.  I thank him for the professionalism and courtesy he always displays.  I know that to be the shared experience of those who have presented for his professional advice and intervention through the years.  I wish Dr. Finan well.  Staff going beyond the call of duty is something which Mr. Flory reports.  Again, that comment is deserved because it is absolutely and unquestionably the case.<\/p> <p>  There is much more in this report to which I could refer.  However, I wish to get to a couple of critical points because the backdrop to all of this is the series of very unfortunate, adverse outcomes in respect of births which date back to November 2012.  The reports on those cases have not yet been presented.  That has in its own way given rise to increased upset and concern in the absence of clarity.  I hope that where reports are available for publication, the greater number would be so published.  I understand, however, that parents in any given situation may be reticent about such a course.  A number of the parents concerned wish that the reports would be published and I support them in that.  It would be a critical part of the journey to the restoration of full confidence across the board and the scotching of any concerns that may obtain.<\/p> <p>  I note that a number of initiatives have been taken at Cavan General Hospital to address what were perceived as areas that required further attention.  I would like to ask a number of questions of Dr. Finan, if I may.  Do we have strict compliance now with the national obstetric programme of clinical guidelines?<\/p><p> We had a practice development officer appointed last month, as of 21 September.  Is that appointment RCSI Hospital Group-based or is it dedicated to Cavan hospital?<\/p><p>I also note that, in the preparation of the budgetary requirements for 2016, Cavan General Hospital has sought a number of additional posts, including an increase in the number of consultant obstetricians at the hospital.  We currently have four approved, of which there are only three filled.  In fact, only one is permanently filled.  I understand two are locums.  Perhaps the officials can clarify that.  However, we have three, where we should have four, trying to provide cover 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  It is not tenable.  What is the position with regard to the filling of the fourth vacancy?  I note that the hospital is seeking approval for the appointment of a fifth consultant obstetrician in 2016, which the birth numbers would justify and which is most important.  I also note that there is an application for an increased number of midwifery posts included in the proposals for the estimate for 2016.<\/p><p> There was much public concern - I will conclude on this, and I appreciate the Chair's indulgence - that the first report on the tragic outcome in November 2012 was suppressed by a decision of the High Court.  Of course there were recommendations, but the entirety of the report, by the decision of the courts, was suppressed.  It is important that there is public realisation that whatever may have been entailed in the recommendations would have been picked up in any event from a number of other reports and from the general exercise in the preparation of that report, and would have been acted upon.  Could the officials comment?  Have the published reports - including HIQA's Galway report and HIQA's Portlaoise report, which are in the public domain - informed improvements in Cavan General Hospital?  Will the witnesses avail of the opportunity to outline some of the improvements and the additional steps that have been taken in order to ensure that, where it is at all humanly possible, we will not see a further tragic adverse outcome in the maternity services at Cavan General Hospital?<\/p><p> I will conclude with this one remark.  My youngest was born in Cavan General Hospital.  At my age, I am not in the business of intending to return with my wife to Cavan General Hospital, but I would say to those whom I know so well across the dependent population that I would have no hesitation in using its services in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#E00300","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443688200,"counter":1013,"content":"<p>I welcome our visitors and thank Mr. Woods for his presentation.<\/p><p>I will deal almost exclusively with the report on South Tipperary General Hospital.  Obviously, I have a particular interest in it as I am elected in Tipperary South, but I am also a former employee of the South Eastern Health Board and I was manager of the hospital for quite a number of years.<\/p><p>First, I welcome the report.  I believe it is a positive report.  It gives the unit a clean bill of health.  It paints a picture of good staff working well together, good facilities and good outcomes.  There is a paragraph in the report which is worth repeating because it gives a sense of the unit at the hospital, and probably gives a sense of the strength of units such as this throughout the country.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>The sense of strong team working is palpable in the unit.  The broader Midwifery leadership team is energetic and positive and just gets on with things.  This too adds to the resilience.  A large proportion of the staff are local people who have a huge personal commitment to the hospital which means that they frequently turn up to work outside their contracted hours when things are busy.  This is such a strength and should not be underestimated or taken for granted.<\/blockquote> <p>That final sentence is important, &quot;This is such a strength and should not be underestimated or taken for granted.&quot;  That has always been a feature of South Tipperary General Hospital, and, indeed, its maternity unit, and, to a large extent, general hospitals right throughout the country.  I compliment and thank the staff, generally in the hospital, and particularly in the maternity unit, for the work, service and commitment to the unit that they have shown down the years.<\/p><p>I welcome also that Mr. Flory identified issues that need to be dealt with within the unit in the future.  To some extent, Mr. Flory is confirming the policy of grouping the hospitals, which has been accepted and which, as we speak, is being implemented in the south-west grouping.  The report simply confirms that position.<\/p><p>There are issues that Mr. Flory raises in the report, and it is important that we get some clarification from the HSE, because there is a fear out there among all smaller units and general hospitals that the view behind all such reports is that downgrading or closure is only a step away.  Of course, that fear has been strengthened by the conduct of the HSE over the past number of years.  I refer, in our case, to a strong and determined approach by the HSE to transferring services from the hospitals to other areas in the south east a few years ago.  Indeed, it took 15,000 people on the streets of Clonmel to stop that development.  The HSE has a particular responsibility to make it very clear that it supports units such as the South Tipperary General Hospital unit and wants to see such units continue in existence in the future, providing a good-quality service for the people of south Tipperary.<\/p><p>Specifically, in the report, Mr. Flory speaks about staffing deficiencies.  With regard to consultant staff, he makes it clear that at least a fourth consultant is required for the unit.  I want to know what the situation is in that regard.  Mr. Flory also highlights the issues of governance and management, and the lack of a significant number of management staff within the hospital and the unit.  I also want to know what proposal the HSE has for dealing with that situation.  I accept that to some extent the whole governance area is in transition because of the hospital group situation.  We have a situation in which the structures may not be fully in place, but there are strong professionals with leadership qualities who to some extent at this stage would be compensating for the lack of formed structures.<\/p><p>Will the HSE representatives outline their proposals for strengthening the management system within South Tipperary General Hospital?  While Mr. Flory indicates that midwifery numbers are at a ratio of 1:32 deliveries, he goes on to say that this level does not provide enough staff to provide leadership on a 24-hour basis.  He states:<\/p><blockquote>The midwife to births ratio is a healthy 1:32 following the addition of five new posts in the last few months.  Whilst this is positive the unit still cannot operate 24\/7 shift leaders.<\/blockquote><p>What proposals does the HSE have for dealing with that situation?<br\/><br\/>Another issue is the question of the development of the group.  It seems to be developing very slowly.  Mr. Flory refers to that in the report.  My understanding is that the boards of the groups have not been appointed as yet.  Again there are gaps in the filling of posts within the groups.  That whole area needs to be developed.<br\/><br\/>In the case of South Tipperary General Hospital, Mr. Flory refers to a number of specific areas which he feels must be upgraded.  We have been asking for that for quite some time.  The Minister visited the hospital in July of this year and I, as chairperson of the hospital action committee, put this point to him.  The phase 2 development plan, which has been in existence for quite some time, effectively means the upgrading of the old hospital building.  This is the former workhouse dating from 1846 and that part needs to be urgently upgraded.  Has funding for this development been put in place and when will see work on this second phase?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#F00200","speaker":"960","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443688200,"counter":1015,"content":"<p>I am a bit sceptical about the report because report after report has been issued over the past 15 years.  One can go back to the Hanly report of 2003, which I raised at last week's meeting, which sets out that we would 170 consultants by 2012.  We currently have whole-time equivalents of 114 consultants.  The proposal in this report is for another six consultants for the various hospitals.  What about the ratios of deliveries to the number of consultants in the bigger hospitals in Dublin and Cork?  We have not even started to look at that issue.  At present, quite a number of staff in maternity units are agency staff.  We have done nothing to try to deal with the challenge of junior doctors not finding it attractive to work in maternity units.  That has not been dealt with in the report.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of adverse events, the idea is that, in such instances, parents would get answers in the fastest possible time.  I know a review group has been set up to look at adverse events, but 18 months later no final report is available.  In some cases a team has been set up to examine adverse events which seems to be under significant pressure and does not always get the necessary backup to ensure all the issues related to adverse events are dealt with.  I am not clear whether there are proper structures set up in each unit to deal with adverse events.  I would like some explanation as there is nothing in the report as to how we are dealing with this issue.  This is the major issue leading to litigation.  When people still do not have answers after 12 months, they consider the litigation route.  That is when things seem to close up.  The impression is being created that when adverse cases arise, all the information will be given out as soon as possible, but that is not what is happening.<\/p> <p>  Last week, I raised the issue of stress levels for staff arising from adverse events.  Have we sufficient support for staff when an adverse events occurs?  I also raised the issue of the level of support for staff when a matter goes to litigation.  I have heard of cases where staff were told about an event a week before the case relating to it came for hearing, and no real support was provided to them.  I know of staff who have left the service because they felt they did not get that support when they needed it.  What are we doing about that?  We have some great staff in all units but they are at the coalface.  It is fine for management to say this is how we will deal with adverse events but they do not have to deal with it in the core system or in the public domain afterwards.  We are not doing enough for the staff who have to deal with these issues.  We need answers on the issues I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#G00200","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1443688200,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Woods for his opening statement.

From discussing the issues, people believe that agency nurses pick and chose what they will do.  This is what gives rise to the inability to recruit staff to do certain jobs in hospitals.

Forgive me if I sound browbeaten at this stage.  I have been harping for 22 years since I came back to this country about the absolutely mediocre health system.  People talk about it being a Third World service, but anybody who has worked in a Third World hospital will know it is not.  However, we have a strictly mediocre health system and obstetrics is the tip of the spear.  This is all to do with the way the service is run and the absolute treacle-like ability of the bureaucracy to thwart any attempt to fix things.<\/p><p>In Ireland, the number of obstetricians per 100,000 people is 4.8; the next lowest in Europe is the Netherlands, which has a lower birth rate, at 7.6.; Turkey, 9.1; Poland 13.5; and Switzerland, 17.  It is a question of cause and effect.  Appalling cancer survival figures came out last week, and for all the guff we have heard about our brilliant attempt to tackle the cancer problem, we are just one notch ahead of the British, who are by far the worst of the western countries.  We set our bar low and compare ourselves to a British yardstick.  The British health system is also strictly mediocre and, in quality terms, pales in comparison to the other good socialised medical systems of Europe, the German, Scandinavian, Belgian and French.  It is bad on all the metrics.  However, we insist on bringing over British administrators to do our inspections.<\/p><p> I do not know why I am even bothering to speak.  At the time of the Savita Halappanavar tragedy, I pointed out that the region with the fewest obstetricians, in the country with the fewest obstetricians in the OECD, could expect disasters related to insufficient senior, on-site presence, 24 hours with continuity of care of senior specialists, and too much delegation to trainees.  I said it then, I say it now, and I see no evidence that it will change.<\/p><p> Ireland has no excellent obstetric centres.  I say it very advisedly.  Some five months ago, my beautiful wife gave me a beautiful son, who was delivered with wonderful skill by the obstetric staff of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, and the great backup of the midwifery and other staff.  However, given the hospital's facilities, we cannot call it a centre of excellence.  It does not have a full ICU.  There is limited surgical backup for other surgical emergencies that occur.  It does not have the full range of medical specialties on site, such that very sick adult patients have to be sent to other institutions.  This is not the way to do modern obstetrics.  While we can delude ourselves all we want about being the best in the world, we are not.  We set the bar very low.  I mean no disrespect to my obstetric colleagues, who do a heroic job and are incredibly well trained.  We probably have the best trained cohort of obstetricians of any country in the western world, most of whom have trained in international centres of excellence.  Dr. Peter McParland, who delivered my baby, James, is a wonderful, internationally reputed obstetrician, but look at the circumstances in which he is forced to work and the backup he has.  Maybe the Department is prepared to fix it, maybe there is going to be a road to Damascus moment for the health service.  I do not see it coming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#G00400","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443688200,"counter":1019,"content":"<p>I apologise, but I have read the report and I am glad there was a meeting last night about the National Maternity Hospital moving from Holles Street to St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital.

Yesterday, I was at a committee meeting here with the Ombudsman, who said a protocol had been worked out with the hospitals around complaints and procedures.  The last time we had a meeting about it, we did not hear there was a procedure.  We heard that in the hospitals there was some kind of complaints procedure and a management board.

It is my responsibility to report to the Department of Health and the chief medical officer on the recommendations of the Portlaoise report.  I have a process under way to do it, we are working on it and the recommendations are being implemented on the ground across the country.  We can discuss it in more detail another time if it is helpful.  We also have recommendations on the back of the two reports we have just been discussing that need to be implemented locally.  Those reports are being used by all the hospitals and groups to review what may be required across the 19 units.  This assessment will come back to me.  We have a process in place for it.  We have examined all previous HIQA recommendations - there are more than 270 - to be sure we are implementing them effectively, where required.

As the number of inquiries, investigations or reviews we have to undertake grows, there is a challenge in the system regarding capacity to provide speedy reports.  While it is a requirement and is part of what we must do, it is also a concern for us.  We are seeking ways to accelerate it and Mr. Lynch may talk about it later.  We recognise that faster access to senior clinical review may help in certain circumstances without any lengthy delays, and we are evaluating it.<\/p> <p>  Regarding stress on staff, I am aware of cases in which midwives who have attended a coroner's court have struggled to return to work.  There have been cases in the High Court.  Obstetrics is an area of high litigation.  The committee is aware from previous dialogue that more than 50% of claims dealt with by the State Claims Agency are related to obstetrics.  It is very litigious and very demanding and stressful on staff.  Our staff surveys indicate that there is a high degree of stress.  Actions that have been taken previously in that regard would relate to use of employee assistance programmes at a local level.  There is a wider challenge to us to say how we support people and what revised national policies we might need to put in place for it, given that there are issues, both before and after incidents, with which we need to support our staff.<\/p><p>Practice in this regard varies across the country.

They are much appreciated.  We are two people in clinical-management positions who have the support of a very strong but, as indicated by Mr. Flory, very small management team without whom we could not do the work we do.  We also have a very committed team of midwives and doctors in the maternity service who work very hard and who produce very positive outcomes, a fact also commented on by Mr. Flory.  Mr. Flory's report specifically states that the outcomes in the maternity service in Cavan Monaghan Hospital are positive and the key performance indicators for Cavan Monaghan Hospital maternity service are good, both by Irish standards and by international standards.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised the issue of the publication of reports and I agree with him that the delay in the publication of reports is a significant problem for families.  While this report is positive, we are very mindful of that fact that a number of families who have attended our maternity service did not have a positive experience.  I wish to reassure those families who have received reports relating to their care or that of their infant, or are expecting to receive reports, that we will pursue the recommendations in those reports with the energy that is required to make sure they are implemented.  There are five outstanding reports on infant deaths over the past number of years in Cavan.  Two of them have been completed and have been provided to the families concerned.  Two are at final draft stage and are being circulated to the staff involved for feedback and commentary and one of the five is still at a fairly early stage.<\/p> <p>  We were asked about the speed with which reports or reviews of adverse incidents are dealt.  A very robust system is in place to identify and manage adverse events in the maternity service in Cavan Monaghan Hospital, when they occur.  I am confident that the process recognises adverse events at an early stage and examines and identifies what needs to be done about them.  In many cases, reviews are required and I believe the internal system is sufficiently robust for many such reports and that an internal review is the quickest way to achieve a report on adverse incidents.  However, in a number of incidents, the complexity will require a level of external expertise, so a review will ideally be conducted externally in these cases.  In a number of cases, families themselves request that reports are conducted externally to achieve the level of objectivity that they perceive to be necessary.  When an external review is requested, however, it takes a significant length of time and that is a problem the system needs to address and improve on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alan Finan"},{"type":"speech","time":1443688200,"counter":1029,"content":"<p>What is the reason for these reviews taking an extended length of time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#J00500","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443688200,"counter":1030,"content":"<p>As Mr. Woods said, it is largely because we need to get the clinical expertise on board.  As already identified, the system is understaffed with senior and expert clinicians as all of them are very busy and it can be very difficult for them to free up time to conduct these reviews, which take an enormous length of time and energy.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in also made inquiries about compliance with our obstetrics and gynaecology programme guidelines.  To date, the programme has issued approximately 40 clinical guidelines and in Cavan Monaghan Hospital, there is a clinical governance committee.  Part of its role is to examine each of the guidelines as they issue and as they come off the production line to identify where we may have difficulty in achieving compliance with the guidelines.  That system works very well and we are largely - in fact, in the majority of cases - compliant with all the national guidelines.  <\/p> <p>  There are some areas with which we are struggling, namely, those relating to the necessity for networked care, an issue to which the Flory report also refers.  Mr. Flory talks about networked care being particularly important in the case of high-risk pregnancies and foetal anomaly scanning.  Hospitals the size of and, indeed, bigger than Cavan will always have difficulty with those areas and the only solution is networked care.  I was very pleased that Mr. Flory emphasised that.  The RCSI hospital group, whose three maternity units are Cavan Monaghan, Drogheda and the Rotunda, has done significant work in the past five or six years to progress networked care.  We have developed a Dublin north east neonatal network which ensures that prematurely-born babies are delivered in the best location and at the right time.  We have also made significant progress in developing a regional perinatal pathology service so that when babies unfortunately die, they get the expert perinatal post mortem that is required for their parents to be given clear, unambiguous and open information on the cause of the baby's death.<\/p> <p>  Foetal medicine is an area we have not adequately networked to date.  However, a proposal is in place for this and there is a plan for staff recruitment in order to deliver it.  We have had significant difficulty with that recruitment over the past 12 months and we have not been able to progress the plan for that reason.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in also asked about the practice development officer who has been appointed.  A part-time practice development officer has been in place for a significant number of years and she has made an enormous contribution to the service and the quality of care provided.  Recently, we appointed a full-time practice officer and she is a dedicated practice development officer for Cavan Monaghan Hospital who does not hold sessions in any other hospital.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in also inquired about staff expansion.  We have approval for four full-time consultant obstetricians in Cavan Monaghan Hospital.  The only factual inaccuracy in Mr. Flory's report was to state that there was only one full-time person in place.  Three full-time people are currently in post but we are having difficulty recruiting a locum for the fourth post, which is currently vacant.  The Deputy is correct that three people are currently doing the work of four at consultant level.  While we are doing our best to address that, there is a national difficulty in the recruitment of consultant obstetricians - it is not something unique to Cavan.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Woods spoke about midwifery staffing.  The Birthrate Plus recommendation of 1:37 is based on a UK model published a number of years ago.  A number of years ago, HSE north east, comprising Cavan and Drogheda maternity services, set a target ratio of one midwife for every 37 deliveries.<\/p><p>We reached that for a brief period a number of years ago, but it slipped as the financial climate deteriorated.  In the Cavan-Monaghan situation, the staffing ratio slipped to 1:44 or perhaps 1:45.  We are currently at 1:40, so the situation has improved over the last couple of years.  Our target remains 1:37.  As we have said, submissions have been made as part of the 2016 Estimates process to make sure we get to 1:37.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in also asked about certain recommendations that are specific to reports that were completed previously.  All of the recommendations coming from any reports are entered into a system with which maternity departments and clinical governance structures work constantly - week in, week out.  There is a constant review of the report recommendations that are outstanding.  Machinery is in place to make sure we are constantly aiming to implement all of the recommendations that are outstanding.  That includes all reviews that have been done over the years.<\/p><p> I would say the same thing regarding the HIQA reports on Portlaoise and Galway.  All HIQA recommendations are dealt with through the same internal departmental machinery.  Anything that is not manageable internally is escalated to local management and, if necessary, to regional or national management.  I believe we are making very significant progress in addressing all of the HIQA recommendations on maternity services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alan Finan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443688200,"counter":1032,"content":"<p>I might ask my colleague Mr. Lynch to address the follow-on question about the ombudsman that was asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443688200,"counter":1033,"content":"<p>A couple of things arise in this context.  As I am conscious that there are often many new faces from the HSE around the table, I might help the committee by briefly explaining my role.  As part of its service plan for this year, the HSE has introduced a new accountability framework, part of which involves a restructuring of our quality and patient safety function at a national level.  My role has been established this year with a slightly more independent input in the organisation in terms of looking at quality and safety and seeking to provide assurance through audit.  That is one of the reasons the Flory reports were commissioned.  When people come to our health services, they expect at the very minimum that they will be safe, that they will be treated with compassion and that we will care for them when they cross our doors.<\/p> <p>  I know that the committee had a considerable discussion on adverse events at a recent meeting.  I suppose it is something we really need to have a greater focus on.  It has been our experience, and certainly my experience, that when people experience something going wrong in the health service, they look for a few things.  First, they want to ensure the services are as safe as possible so that what happened does not happen again.  They certainly do not want it to happen to somebody else.  Second, they want answers for themselves.  This year, we have introduced a new system whereby we record what we call serious reportable events.  There is a mandatory requirement to report on all of these events when they occur, with a requirement now across the organisation that they be investigated within 120 days.  From the August performance report, we will now be reporting on the number of serious reportable events for each month and we will be tracking the progress being made with the implementation of that target for investigation and review timeframes.  I have to say we are nowhere near that yet, but that is the intention.<\/p> <p>  Following on from what Dr. Finan said, there is a struggle at times with professional staff, particularly busy clinicians, being made available.  We work closely with the forum of postgraduate training bodies to identify clinicians.  The forum is enormously helpful in that regard.  Part of the 2016 programme will involve determining how we can do this more effectively, particularly in certain areas.  We know there are groupings of events at certain hospitals, including Portiuncula Hospital.  We need to do that more efficiently, so that is a programme of work.<\/p> <p>  Reference has been made to complaints.  The ombudsman has met the committee.  Members will be aware that a report on the complaints management system in the acute hospitals sector was produced and threw up a number of issues.  My office is working very closely with the ombudsman.  The report in question is now, in effect, the implementation plan for the development of our complaints management system, which will now be led from my office.  The system in question will apply across hospital and community services.  For the first time, we now have people at national level in each of the service divisions within the hospital groups and the community health care organisations who are responsible for complaints management in their service areas.  We recently published on our website a full list of complaints officers across all our services across the country.  There is a significant amount of additional work to be done there.  In any industry, complaints are the lifeblood of understanding what is going on in the service.  If we are not in a position to invite, hear and respond to concerns as they arise, we will never develop a greater focus on quality.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that at the last meeting there was some discussion about the sharing of data with the State Claims Agency.  As a result of the way the legislation was set up, State claims relate to individual hospitals.  We now have agreement from most of the hospitals that the relevant data will be released.  This means we will soon be in a position, for the first time, to have intelligence at national level and hospital group level around what is actually going wrong, where it is going wrong and what needs to be done to address it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1443688200,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>If our staffing levels are inadequate, for whatever reason, the issue of adverse incidents could arise again, perhaps more regularly than we would like.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#K00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443688200,"counter":1035,"content":"<p>The staffing of the complaints process is an environment that we are rationalising in system terms.

While there is staff growth, the underlying number of hours may or may not be changing, depending on what is happening and on the actual agency spend.  It is correct to say that increases in the pressure on and demand for the service are leading to staff pressures.  There is another thing to watch when talking about midwives and midwife numbers at Cork University Hospital.  It is important to understand that midwives do things that are not necessarily obstetrics.  When we count these numbers, one of the challenges we face is to be clear about what midwives are actually doing.  If we do not count appropriately, we could get a false base.

I recently came across a case of a GP who was employed in a hospital to provide a particular service but because six months into the job he had not been paid he resigned.  That is not the way to about trying to retain staff.  The second issue relates to agency staff and the reason some hospitals are experiencing difficulty getting staff on other than the normal HSE contract.  Has there been any analysis of what would make this more attractive? While issues such as pay and so on, as per the guidelines, are being adhered to, courses for junior doctors have been cut back.  It is important these issues are addressed if we are to retain junior doctors.  Many of our interns are emigrating to Australia, New Zealand and Canada because we are doing nothing in terms of making it attractive for them to remain here, particularly in the area of maternity services.<\/p> <p>  I would like to make a point in regard to maternity services in another country.

I appeal today to Mr. Woods to please note, in the context of the hospital's presentation for the 2016 Estimate, it is imperative that approval be granted for the fifth consultant obstetrician and that the additional midwifery posts that are also included in the Estimate for 2016 are approved at HSE national level.

We have seen evidence of this.  We have also seen some good progress in that area.  I was recently in Letterkenny hospital where a great deal of progress in terms of training has been made.

There is, of course, strong international competition in this area, of which members will be aware.  The private market has been a significant incentive in terms of sign-on to particular grades, including nursing.  We have had some success in this area recently, which we need to build on.  My own dialogue with nursing organisations would indicate strongly that training is a key driver.  In terms of where we go, it is right to say that while we still spend significantly on training, most of that is now what is required by regulation and law rather than additional training.  That is a point of focus.<\/p> <p>  The other point that is relevant is that the creation of groups affords opportunities to deploy clinical staff across multiple care environments.  This gives staff opportunities to work in different types of environment and conditions, which would not have been possible in stand-alone units be they large or small.  That is an opportunity that has to be grasped by the groups.  It is a way of securing the role of all units.  It is already visible through some of the interaction of the groups that this is going to bring benefit, and has to some extent already.<\/p> <p> On the point of the on the Estimates, we have already approved the posts mentioned into our Estimates.  I understand the Deputy's point around them coming back out of the Estimates.  His point is well made and I get it.  The points on the availability of staff and our capacity to continue to provide safe services and to expand that capacity as we face increasing demographic pressure, which we do, are also points well made.  The underlying point about recruiting and retaining staff is probably, in my own experience of interacting with the acute environment, one of our top priorities.  We have to find ways to do that.  Members will be aware that we are engaged internationally to support staff recruitment.  We need to do the same on an ongoing basis locally.  I will ask Dr. O'Reilly to now make a brief comment from a group perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443688200,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>I am the recently appointed group CEO of the Dublin Midlands Group having previously been the lead for the cancer control programme in the country.  It has been my observation since taking up this role that the major benefit that the groups can deliver will be clinical networks where we can strengthen services in smaller services and integrate a number of services with the larger ones.  This is the way of the future.<\/p> <p>  I have had a lot of learning as a consequence of having Portlaoise and The Coombe as our two maternity centres within our network.  Portlaoise has been, of course, in the eye of the storm.  One of the challenges for all of us, including the staff there, is to ensure the provision of safe and compassionate care to patients.  We are endeavouring to plan for the future.  We also have to deal with the review of the past and be fair to people who have had either serious adverse events or concerns or deaths that need to be evaluated.  All of these things are going on simultaneously.  <\/p> <p>  Although I do not always agree with Senator Crown, I agree with him in this circumstance.  One of my biggest concerns is recruitment and retention of high quality permanent staff, whether it be in consultant posts, junior hospital doctor posts, which preferentially should be training posts, midwifery, nursing, quasi-safety manager posts or a whole panoply of allied health staff.  We have to get there incrementally, coming out of one of the worst possible recessions and a blunt instrument of a moratorium that has constrained management  in terms of planning for the future.  We are now in a position whereby resources will begin to improve but getting the staff back is going to be biggest challenge.  <\/p> <p>  From my observation, it has been very helpful to be able to recruit nurses and midwives on permanent posts or term contracts rather than agency staff.  I could not agree more that this is better than having a revolving door of people from agencies, whom, even if good people, because they are new to the site and the patients, make hand-overs very difficult.  That is not an ideal solution, rather it is a very expensive and somewhat disjointed band-aid for the circumstances that arise in clinical care.  From my observation, it has been reasonably straightforward to recruit a good cohort of midwives into Portlaoise Hospital.<\/p><p>It is somewhat attractive, the cost of living is lower once one gets outside the big cities and people have been very willing to come.

One of the issues for midwifery is having the positions ready at the times people are coming out of the programmes and not making the role so unattractive because of all the difficulties and emotional experience for staff in dealing with tragic events for patients and some of the fallout from that.  There is a huge morale issue around recruitment into midwifery.  However, we have been very successful in Portlaoise in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Obstetricians and junior hospital doctors are looking for a career path that will sustain them and there are multiple elements involved.  They have to be working in a collegial environment in a good location, so facilities matter.  They have to be well supported, with access to the resources they need to do the job well.  They need to feel that they will be compensated at a rate comparative to some of the other circumstances, and often to have opportunities for research teaching and other elements of care.  Therefore, it is very much multi-factorial.<\/p> <p>  In terms of where we have gone since the HIQA report on Portlaoise - and, in fact, well before that - there is a clinical network between Portlaoise and the Coombe, which had already begun to evolve some time ago.  This network operates well.  Women with complex medical problems will be referred to the Coombe from Portlaoise.  Women who are in premature labour or at risk of premature labour are referred for an opinion.  They may or may not choose to deliver them there.  We have infant transportation for children who need intensive care and that works extremely well on a 24-7 basis throughout the country.  That network certainly works well.<\/p> <p>  As regards the journey we are on now with the Coombe, we are in the process of doing a legal integration of governance and management where the hospital will run its services on two sites.  To that end, there has been a huge amount of work done.  First of all, we have been approved for more recruitment of obstetricians and neonatologists.  However, we have been very careful to plan to advertise these as joint appointments next January.  The next cohort of trainees will become available 180 days later.  The sense was that if we advertised as Portlaoise posts on their own, they would not be as attractive as joint posts.  We also planned the timing to match the output of people coming along.  There are two obstetrical posts which will be joint and two neonatal posts which will be joint.  These will be advertised in January as a result of both the timing issue and the likelihood of success.<\/p> <p>  There is a director of clinical integration on site - Dr. Michael O'Connell from the Coombe - who has worked out all of the clinical pathways through a series of workshops with both hospitals across the entire spectrum of maternity, delivery, outpatients, neonatology and dealing with grief and bereavement.  These will now go out to patients as well as staff to say \"Was my journey like that in these hospitals and has it worked for me?  Can I give input?\".  That work is ongoing.<\/p> <p>  We have been examining how we build an integrated information technology between the two hospitals.  The Coombe has an old one, Portlaoise has none.  We need that for clinical audit, to see how we are doing every step along the way.  There is clinical audit but it should be automated to make sure we know what is going on.  The direction of travel is that I anticipate that at some point in 2016 we will have formal governance and management from the Coombe.  Building success, however, must be based on these steps along the way.  Management is critical: there is a need for clinical leadership, a lead obstetrician, a strong general manager for the service and there must be quality and safety.  There must also be complaints management within the system.  Joint reviews of adverse events that are noted and integration with Mr. Patrick Lynch's programme to ensure we are very careful to evaluate why, for example, a baby died.  Sometimes a death is not preventable, while on other occasions it might be.<\/p> <p>  It is really important that we engage with patients.  I know that Mr. Woods is setting up a programme of patient engagement for the groups that we can roll out across the country and Portlaoise will be one of the lead groups there.<\/p> <p>  I would be happy to take any further questions on any of those elements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Susan O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1443688200,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>Okay, thank you.

Mr. Paul Cullen quotes the HSE's response to Mr. David Flory's report, in that it provides &quot;important insights&quot; into quality standards in safety.  With the greatest respect, we have the accumulated wisdom of more than ten years of reports and reviews, but a paralysis in terms of meaningful action.<br\/><br\/>I wish to offer my sympathies to all who have suffered loss or serious injury in our maternity services.  As a doctor, I am only too well aware of the harrowing consequences that adverse outcomes have on mothers, fathers, babies and families.  I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to share with it some of my experiences of working in the Irish maternity service over many years.<br\/><br\/>As a clinician who has worked as a consultant in a busy tertiary referral women and infants university hospital for almost 20 years, seven of which were as master, I cannot overemphasise the importance of the responsibility that politicians, most particularly those in government, have for the planning, resourcing, provision and regulation of effective health services on a national basis.  In the context and ethos of open disclosure, clinicians have a responsibility to explain and apologise to patients and their families honestly and transparently when their care falls short of appropriate clinical standards.  Although health service managers are now being investigated in respect of their individual and corporate performances, even the most rudimentary root cause analysis will reveal, in the context of the Irish maternity service, that critical strategic decisions made on prioritisation and funding at the highest levels of political authority have had a significant impact on clinical outcomes in hospitals.  Often, hospitals have been run into the ground by chronic underinvestment over many years.<br\/><br\/>It is important that what I have stated should not in any way be interpreted or misconstrued to excuse poor individual professional performance or negligent clinical care.  If we are to gain a full understanding of what went wrong, however, it is important to scrutinise why a service that is designated to look after our most precious and vulnerable resource - mothers and babies - never became a political priority until such time as a series of adverse clinical outcomes hit the headlines of our newspapers and news bulletins on successive occasions in the recent past.  During the boom years, there was little, if any, investment directed into maternity services and when the bust happened, they were exposed to systematic cutbacks while absorbing unprecedented levels of clinical activity, complexity and demographic change.  The fact that the overall clinical outcomes for mothers and babies in this country still indicate, by international comparison, a high level of clinical performance is a testament to the dedication and professionalism of clinical and support staff, local managers and other health care officials, who often felt, and were at many times, abandoned by the political system over successive Administrations.  Despite the overall reassurance of our national clinical results, there were outcomes that undoubtedly should not have happened and near misses that turned out better than expected.<br\/><br\/>The succession of problems that has come to the attention of the public in recent years and that has been the subject of simultaneous and sequential investigations has arisen in a particular context.  The warning signs were there for a long time and were raised by many within the system.  Unfortunately, they were mainly ignored and, when acknowledged, merely became the subject of reviews and reports, which often cost considerable amounts of money and, when completed, were mostly not implemented in any meaningful sense.<br\/><br\/>In 2011, as master of the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital, I established and chaired a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and health care managers from the Coombe, Portlaoise and Mullingar hospitals.  Having highlighted a number of significant clinical risks across this network of hospitals, we identified a number of important posts that were required to manage these risks.<\/p><p>Conscious of budgetary constraints, we developed a comprehensively funded innovative strategy that involved piloting these posts with strict performance indicators as well as a long-term savings potential.  Despite several modifications of the proposal and presentations at the highest levels of authority and at a national forum, there was no response.  These risks were also highlighted in the risk register of the hospital that was submitted to the HSE on numerous occasions over this period.  It is noteworthy that this model of tertiary and secondary hospitals, working in close co-operation, emerged some years later as the appropriate strategic response to certain clinical incidents that occurred in Portlaoise Hospital and also as the model for the alignment of maternity services within hospital groups.  It is the model that have been endorsed by the Flory report.  It is also of concern that many of the risks highlighted in the 2011 tri-hospital submission are still present throughout the country. <\/p><p> If the current maternity strategy is to have any credibility, and if it is to bring about a sea-change in the way that maternity services are funded, organised and run in this country, then it must be more than a cut and paste exercise of generalisations, as many previous reports have been.  It must have specifics in regard to models of care, staffing levels and infrastructural development.  To do this it must have a methodology of implementation and a ring-fenced budget.  Most importantly, it must be a political priority with a life expectancy beyond the next election.<\/p><p> The national cancer control programme is an example of how political prioritisation improves clinical outcomes.  Accordingly, I believe that the Minister for Health should establish a national women and infants programme in order to drive change and clinical excellence.  He must act decisively to restore confidence in this service otherwise there will be more critical incidents, more traumatised mothers, fathers, babies and families, while ever fewer school leavers and graduates will choose to become midwives or obstetricians in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Chris Fitzpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443688200,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>I wish to especially welcome Dr. Fitzpatrick and apologise to him for the poor attendance at this point in time.  We have been in session since 9.30 a.m. and unfortunately we have lost some colleagues for this later session.  However, it is important that Dr. Fitzpatrick knows that the content of his contribution and the engagement that we will have will be recorded and noted by all of the members.  His contribution does matter and I wanted to reassure him about that.<\/p><p>I thank Dr. Fitzpatrick for his opening remarks.  They reflect on some of what we have already discussed here this morning.  He said that decisions made on prioritisation and funding at the highest levels of political authority have had a significant impact on clinical outcomes in hospitals.  He also briefly referred to the Flory report which is very much a focus of this morning's newspaper reports.  I note that he referred to Mr. Paul Cullen, who wrote a front page report on the Flory report for this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, a newspaper that I am happy to purchase every day.  I would like to say for Mr. Cullen's benefit that if I were a Dublin Deputy speaking about maternity services in Dublin, the matter would never be referred to as a parochial issue.  As I am a Cavan-Monaghan Deputy referring to Cavan-Monaghan maternity issues it is no more a parochial issue.  From Mr. Cullen's tweets, I am sure that he will note my comment.  <\/p><p>Dr. Fitzpatrick said that during the boom years, there was little, if any, investment directed into maternity services.  That is absolutely the case.  This is an historic problem that dates back a critical number of years.  It is not only reflective of the cuts that have only added even deeper to the problems that existed historically.  The maternity services were exposed to systematic cutbacks.  That is a fact of life that has been borne out again in the Flory report and other reports and it concerns the under-provision of staffing.  The Portlaoise report very definitely exposed the fact that there was serious and significant under-provision of staffing for maternity services at Portlaoise where Dr. Fitzpatrick has a particular interest because of the connection now between the Coombe and Portlaoise.  <\/p><p>Dr. Fitzpatrick spoke about the current maternity strategy.  We do not have one and that is the nub of the problem.  We need a new maternity strategy to be fast-tracked.  The absence of same is giving rise to a significant lack of confidence and certainty.  It has also impacted on the staff at many of the smaller entities rather than at the major Dublin based maternity units.  Many of the staff at the other smaller entities, which are spread across the 19 maternity settings located across the country, are fearful for their futures because there is no certainty.  We have encouraged and urged the Minister and his Department to move towards the delivery of a national maternity strategy that will give us certainty going forward.  <\/p><p>I ask Dr. Fitzpatrick to elaborate what he meant when he said that he believes the Minister for Health should establish a national women and infants programme in order to drive change and clinical excellence.  Where would a national women and infants programme fit into the jigsaw of the overall governance of health care delivery in this country?  How does Dr. Fitzpatrick envisage its make-up in terms of personnel and accountability?  To whom would it report?  I ask him to give us a sense of his vision for such a structure and to outline where it would fit into the overall circumstance today.  <\/p><p>I have a few questions for Dr. Fitzpatrick that relate to his time as master of the Coombe.  Had there been, traditionally, a relationship between the Coombe and any of the other maternity settings across the country?  Did he feel, in his role as master, that he was listened to when he brought forward particular proposals and points of relevance?  Did he feel that his expertise and knowledge was properly acknowledged and respected?  In terms of the system - I refer not only to the political system but also the permanent government in terms of the Civil Service - was he given an ear?  Was there follow-through in terms of actions on the recommendations made by him during his years of service in that post?  <\/p><p>I thank Dr. Fitzpatrick again for his contribution and I look forward to his responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#P00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1443688200,"counter":1059,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Fitzpatrick for his presentation.  I also thank him for his long years of service in the obstetrics and gynaecological area and as master of the Coombe.  I know that the hospital was run very efficiently and in a good manner.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Fitzpatrick has raised a few issues, in particular an issue that I have raised at all of the presentations we have had here and I refer to the Hanly report of 2003.  In terms of the recommendation, at the time we had 93 consultants.  I understand we now have 114 wholetime equivalents while there are 133 consultants on the books.  What happened between 2003 and 2010 because no progress was made?  Where did things stall during that period in terms of the change that has been clearly identified?  I ask Dr. Fitzpatrick to outline how the birthrate changed in 2003.  The figure rose to 75,000 births but I am not sure in what we year we reached that figure.  Why did the health care system not respond to  growing  demand?<\/p> <p>  We have focused on maternity services here.  It was highlighted by one of the people who made a presentation here last week that the issue is not just maternity services but also gynaecological services.  In the overall discussion we seem to have lost sight of the fact that a range of services are provided.<\/p><p>We have not been given the numbers being dealt with in the gynaecologist services where the same people are working in both areas.  It would be interesting to know the figures Dr. Fitzpatrick is talking about in regard to surgical procedures and all the rest of what is being done in that area.<\/p><p> On the employment of consultants, Dr. Fitzpatrick might advise the current ratio of the number of deliveries per consultant in the Coombe hospital.  I am referring to whole-time equivalents.  How does that compare to the ratio that would be the normal requirement in, say, an equivalent health service in the UK?<\/p><p>  The second issue I wish to raise relates to agency staff and the availability of junior doctors and nurses.  Does Dr. Fitzpatrick have figures for the number of doctors employed on an agency basis in the Dublin hospitals?  How would he address that issue to make it attractive for people to work within the HSE contract system?<\/p><p> I understand the issues are not related to salary but to the conditions and issues such as training and funding for training.  Dr. Fitzpatrick might touch on a number of the issues that make that system unattractive.  I recently spoke to a UCC graduate who did an intern year in Ireland and is now working in Perth in Australia.  I understand a core of students from UCC who graduated in 2014 are now all working in Perth.  What do we need to do to reverse that trend in the context of the hospital systems in Ireland and, in particular, in regard to maternity services?  If Dr. Fitzpatrick was in charge of that area in the morning what three or four elements he would change to make that difference?  People want to go abroad to get experience, and rightly so, but people seem to be leaving.  I conducted my own survey in 2012 of those who graduated in 2012 and it clearly identified that more than 60% of them had decided, even before they had graduated, that they would leave the country once they had completed their intern year.  What changes would Dr. Fitzpatrick bring about in that respect?<\/p><p> In fairness to all the Dublin hospitals, they are not confined to looking after patients in the Dublin or the Portlaoise area but take in patients from other parts of the country where necessary.  Dr. Fitzpatrick might indicate the numbers who are referred to those hospitals from throughout the country.  What percentages do they make up?  Are they a very small percentage?  The three Dublin hospitals and Cork University Hospital provide very specialised services where genuine problems arise.  What number of patients are referred to those hospitals from outside their immediate catchment areas?

In response to his questions, I would point out that maternity services suffered during what was a period of reckless spending in that they were ignored.  Ghost estates were built and hospitals were not built and during the austerity years a blind eye was turned to the requirements of the maternity services despite consistent advocacy, as I said, at the very highest level with authorities in both the HSE and the Department.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the strategy, we do not know what is in it and we expect it will be delivered this year but there are a number of things that can happen now in advance of the strategy being published.  The current and I think the previous session addressed issues in terms of the networking of secondary and tertiary hospitals.  In our context, the Coombe hospital is being networked with Portlaoise hospital and there will be a transfer of governance of Portlaoise maternity services to the Coombe hospital and it will come under the auspices of both the clinical and corporate governance of the Coombe hospital.  That is a dramatic change.  A hospital that was run by the HSE in terms of its maternity services is now being transferred into the governance of a voluntary hospital, not a HSE-run hospital.  There are issues that can be addressed in regard to making that more effectively completed.  <\/p> <p>  Number one, there are deficits and that does not just pertain to the Coombe hospital.  I was master of the hospital up to 2012 but I am not involved in the current negotiations on the transfer of governance.  That issue relates to the Coombe hospital, Holles Street hospital and the Rotunda hospital.  These are voluntary hospitals and they are now expected to assume corporate and clinical responsibility for maternity services that were run by the HSE.  These hospitals are currently all running big deficits and I would imagine those deficits need to be cleared.  These hospitals all made submissions for increasing staffing numbers and they need to be addressed.  Although the Minister has announced, and it is very welcome, that maternity hospitals will be located - and I sit on the project team for the relocation of Holles Street to the St. Vincent's campus, of which I have been highly supportive - this will take a while to happen.  <\/p> <p>  There are current deficits within the infrastructure of our hospitals that need to be addressed as a matter of priority.  It may not be attractive, in the run up to an election, to say that we will clear the deficits of maternity hospitals that are now assuming responsibility for erstwhile HSE-run hospitals, that we will deal with the critical staffing issues in these hospitals in terms of patient safety and that we will deal with equipment and infrastructural issues as a trade off for these hospitals assuming responsibility for hospitals that were previously run by the HSE.  A maternity strategy is not required to do that.  That could be done very quickly at the stroke of a pen because we are led to believe there is money within the system.  That would put the networking of hospitals on a really secure footing.  My concern is that big hospitals that are cash-strapped are now being asked to take responsibility for smaller hospitals that have in fact been run into the ground over a period.  The maternity strategy is welcome.  There is an accumulation of reviews and reports going back to 2005 and one can cut and paste comments that were made in 2005 about the organisation of maternity services in Dublin.  John Higgins wrote an excellent report, which was commissioned by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and funded by the Department of Health, on the networking of big and small hospitals.  That was in 2006.  The Flory report endorses that type of arrangement.  We went to the Department in 2011 with regard to the issue of big and small hospitals working together on cross-institutional appointments, training and audit.  Nothing was done about it.<\/p> <p>  We do not need a strategy to address the critical issue of perinatal pathology services within the country and within our networks.  One of the big motivations to undertake the recent series of reviews, and also to undertake the recent maternity strategy, has been a critical number of instances involving mainly perinatal deaths but also maternal death with regard to maternity services.  Currently, we are undertaking a significant number of historic reviews of cases, and that needs to be done in respect of bereaved parents, but we do not have a system in the country to appropriately investigate the deaths of babies.  There are up to 300 stillbirths in the country every year.  There are up to 140 early neonatal deaths.  If there are risk management issues or patterns of clinical activity or professionalism that need to be addressed, this is the most rigorous way of doing that.  We do not need a maternity strategy to do that; we could do that in advance.  <\/p> <p>  The maternity strategy is welcome.  My concern is that it would be a broad brush stroke and that it would not address some of the critical issues.  The Minister could address the networking of hospitals by clearing deficits and dealing with infrastructural and critical staffing issues.  There are bigger issues in terms of the building of hospitals.  That is important.  We recognise that this needs to be done, and we also support co-location.  There are issues regarding the rebalancing of community and hospital services so that mothers at lower risk in terms of obstetric care can access that care closer to home in community settings.<\/p><p>The rebalancing of hospitals and communities, which we all support, takes a much longer period of time.  However, there are things that have been consistently addressed since 2005-06 but which have not happened.  Others have happened.  Cancer and cardiac services were prioritised.  In the case of maternity services, the fact is that globally our figures stack up in terms of perinatal morbidity, perinatal mortality, serious maternal morbidity and maternal mortality.  Our figures are comparable in an international sense to those for good performing countries in the OECD.  However, they could be better.  The Taoiseach's ambition is that this should be the best small country in which to do business.  My ambition is that it should be the best country, big or small, in the OECD in which to have a baby, both for the mother and the baby.<\/p><p> Dublin is the home of obstetrics.  Obstetric practice developed historically in Dublin.  It is the home of audit services, clinical research and so forth; therefore, we have the capacity.  We have, however, lost a phenomenal amount of intellectual property in terms of our graduates.  In my generation people went away, worked in the best centres abroad and then returned.  Now, they either do not take up obstetric posts or when they go away, they do not return.<\/p><p> Regarding our relationship with Portlaoise hospital, we were within a funding group with it.  Dublin\/mid-Leinster was a financial arrangement of hospitals when I was master.  Portlaoise, Mullingar and the Coombe hospitals were all within the same funding matrix.  We were aware of the fact that the Government was moving towards hospital groups.  As a group of clinicians across three hospitals where we were aware of the fact that there were ongoing risks, proactively we decided - midwives, doctors, anaesthetists and health care managers - to sit down together to identify where the risks were and put together a package to deal with them.  The tragic irony is that the package we put together in terms of the jobs we critically required was the model that emerged in 2014 regarding certain critical instances that happened in Portlaoise.  In 2006 there was an opportunity to do it.  In 2011 there was also an opportunity to do it.  Now we have the Flory report of 2014 saying the same thing.  There has been paralysis of action in respect of maternity services.<\/p><p> I have consistently advocated for the women and infants programme.  Dr. Susan O'Reilly has appeared before the committee.  She headed up the cancer programme.  Professor Tom Keane headed it prior to that.  A political decision was made at the highest levels of authority that we would focus on it, not other things, and it worked.  Professor John Crown is an expert on this.  Having breast cancer in this country, difficult and problematic as the experience is, in this day and age is a very different prospect from what it was ten years ago.  One hears of patients who have access to rapid diagnostics; they have multidisciplinary team, MDT, meetings and the best quality of care is provided by a team.  We do not have that in a maternity hospital.  What we require is one person in charge of maternity services.  One can access the HSE in many offices through many personnel to find out what is happening in maternity services, but there is no single person whom one can call on the telephone to ask what is happening in maternity services because nobody has control.  This should not be a bureaucratic monster.  It requires one person at the top whom I believe should have significant administrative and management experience, as well as clinical experience.  There are issues that must be dealt with that have a significant clinical resonance that have been ignored by those with little or no clinical experience.  It should have a small cabinet; one could draw up the list of people in this country with the expertise to do it.  Most importantly, it should have a ring-fenced budget.  The danger of hospital groups, as has been the experience in Cork, is that if women and infant services are not independently budgeted, the budget will drift into being used to support general services.  In the stand-alone maternity hospitals we can at least protect beds and our budget.  We know what our budget is and it is not lost in the amorphous mass of a budget that must support general surgical and medical services and so forth.  There must be a ring-fenced budget which must protect women and infants.  The person in charge of it should report directly to the Minister.  This must be a constant political agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Chris Fitzpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443688200,"counter":1063,"content":"<p>Does that not happen already in the allocation of resources to the HSE by the Minister?

It is a tragic irony that we are here this morning following the publication of yet another report.

I am not referring to the Flory report, but we have used KPMG.  We had experts in 2011 which cost a fortune and much of what emerged from KPMG is now superfluous in terms of the way forward.  The intellectual property to run the service is within the country.  As I said previously, we know what the problem is.

The issues pertaining to Portlaoise hospital and the solution were brought to the attention of the highest level of authority in the Department and the HSE in one week in September 2011.  Three years later the model that was ignored and sidelined is, in fact, the one that suddenly was magicked up at a time when critical incidents were publicised in the newspapers.<\/p> <p>  Bereaved parents need to know that there is a different narrative regarding clinicians and health care managers over a consistent period of time.  I have the greatest of respect for the many managers I worked with in the HSE, as well as officials in the Department, who came to the assistance of hospitals and did their best to squeeze out what resources were available.  Knowledge of what to do was there in advance, but it was not a political priority.  It frustrated many when they came forward with an idea.  We went with a creative idea.  We also know that investing in women and infant services is not only the right thing to do, but it is also the correct medical thing to do.  Investment will improve outcomes, quality of care, experience and save money not just in terms of the &euro;60 million we pay out every year in obstetric litigation but also in terms of the care of children who, unfortunately, sustain serious adverse cerebral events in pregnancy or labour.  It saves money and makes sense to make that type of investment, but it did not happen.<\/p> <p>  I would take a leaf out of the Minister's book.  He went on the airwaves after incidents had been reported in the media regarding Portlaoise hospital and said he felt ashamed, as a Minister and a doctor, that patients had not been treated with compassion and respect.  As a health care clinician who advocated consistently at the highest level of authority in the HSE and the Department, I felt ashamed of how politicians and the political system had treated maternity services.  Women and infants are our most valuable and precious resource, but they were treated with a lack of compassion, respect and care.<\/p><p>We are not slow learners but are slow in action, and I hope that at this stage of our experience we will do something now.  Action speaks louder than words.  Announcing new hospitals is fantastic; it is futuristic at present.  I spent two years of my time building an imaginary hospital in Tallaght that never actually happened.  I would like the Minister to do a number of things.  First, he should clear the deficits of hospitals that are taking responsibility for the HSE services that are now being transferred into them.  Across those hospitals, we need to deal with critical staff requirements, equipment requirements and capital developments that need to be done now.  If the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital is to be relocated on to the St. James's campus in five or ten years, certain things need to be done now.  If the Rotunda Hospital is moving to Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown, certain things need to be done now.  However, that does not sound as appealing in the run-up to an election as a promise to spend &euro;150 million building a new hospital.<\/p><p> Senator Burke asked what happened between 2003 and 2010.  In consultant appointments, we fell far behind other specialties.  That happened because decisions were made.  It was not as though jobs were not going into the equivalent of the consultant appointments unit there, but other jobs were being prioritised.  I know from my involvement that in 2005, the old Eastern Regional Health Authority published a report on the three Dublin hospitals and addressed critical manpower issues in terms of consultant appointments, midwifery-neonatal appointments, etc., but none of those were addressed.  From 2005 up to the present, submissions were made for posts.  Maternity services were not being prioritised.  In addition, our morbidity and mortality figures stacked up in international terms.  So at a very superficial level we seemed to be doing all right, but in fact we were not.<\/p><p> On top of that, we had the tsunami of deliveries.  In Dublin the hospitals are up to 9,000 or 10,000 deliveries while being resourced to deliver about 3,500 fewer babies.  We were skating on thin ice.  We were constantly appealing for additional resources.  We had the chaos of voluntary redundancy schemes and early retirement schemes.  Our revenue was cut back every year.  We had the collapse of the private sector and patients coming in from private hospitals with no insurance, accessing care, as they are entitled to do and as we wanted to provide.  We had huge issues in terms of interpretation services.  The hospitals were providing interpretation services that they found themselves, rather than doing it centrally.<\/p><p> A member mentioned gynaecology, which is very important.  The cancer programme has had a significant impact on gynaecology services.  The hospitals have importantly prioritised women's cancer, and the results and services are better.  The patients with benign disease, among whom will be some patients with cancer, are coming into the maternity hospitals.  So the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital would inherit a very significant cohort of benign gynaecology from St. James's Hospital, and we are not resourced to do that.  In addition, the emergency rooms we provide in the standalone maternity hospitals are not resourced as emergency departments.  So we do not form part of the audit of trolleys - and there are no trolleys.  However, we are not resourced.  We are providing emergency gynaecology services and elective gynaecology services out of a budget that is stretched beyond belief in terms of obstetric services.<\/p><p> The use of agency staff is not an issue in Dublin, in that all the consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors in the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital are non-agency people.  They all have standard HSE appointments.  Outside Dublin, it is a major issue.  It is also an issue in regard to training and networking.  In terms of consistency of care, it is not possible to run a hospital on agency staff where the people dropping into and out of the hospital do not necessarily have loyalty to it.  There is no continuity of care, and a patient sees whomever is in carrying the bleeper at the time.  The way to address that is through networking of hospitals, cross-hospital appointments, and also the provision by the universities that are part of the groups of academic leadership and an academic context, as has been the case recently, so that someone working in a small hospital will get valuable training and will also get exposure to an appropriate academic context.<\/p><p> I believe that about 15% to 20% of women and babies in hospital at any one time have come through referral from other units.  The money does not follow the patient at present.  In one sense, the HSE managers who are responsible for the income and expenditure of hospitals might be asking why the hospitals are overspending.  It may be because we have taken four babies from another hospital, including babies weighing less than 1,500 g, which cost a phenomenal amount of money because of the resources they require.<\/p><p> I addressed this issue at the highest level of authority in the HSE and the Department of Health and asked for more support in this regard.  That transfer of funding needs to happen.  There are issues the Minister can address that would give a major impetus and really drive the momentum for change in the maternity services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Chris Fitzpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443688200,"counter":1068,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Fitzpatrick.  That was a fantastic, passionate presentation.  I have seldom been as impressed by or as proud of a professional colleague sitting in that chair as I am of him right now, calling it as it is.  However, I am not overly confident that all the things he has said will actually percolate through to the decision-making process, such is my level of cynicism about that process since I became a Senator.<\/p> <p>  With respect, everything Dr. Fitzpatrick said about the multitude of usually ignored reports rings true.  When I came back to the country 22 years ago I set out to point out the incredible deficiencies not just in cancer services but in the health services in general.  In particular, since I became a Senator, I have repeatedly beaten the drum to the point of appearing very tedious to my colleagues.  I would have prepared the report for free - it would not have been necessary to pay HIQA or any external person.  The quality of obstetrical services in Ireland is mediocre.  We have great doctors and very well trained nurses who work in unbelievably under-resourced, underfinanced, understaffed, irrationally led systems, and as a result the output is not all that good.  It is not awful, but it is mediocre.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Fitzpatrick is right.  People have wrapped themselves in the cloak of relatively favourable outcome statistics, not realising that obstetrics is different.  If a country's cancer survival rate is 3% lower than in other countries, that might indicate room for improvement.  If we have two unnecessary maternal deaths here, that is a tragedy.  We should have zero tolerance for any maternal deaths and for any unnecessary paediatric long-term brain injuries, etc.  It is not good enough for us to wrap ourselves in the cloak of being in the top 15 of 29 of the most economically developed countries in the world.<\/p> <p>  While I hate to personalise it, I must mention the tragedy in Galway a few years ago.  People kept missing the point, which I kept repeating here.  This is the region in Ireland that has the lowest number of obstetricians per head of population.  Ireland has the smallest number of obstetricians per head of population in the world.  One can join the dots and come to the right conclusion about the care of individual patients that is delivered by a number of rotating junior doctors over a three- to four-day period.  The palliative mix there was pretty obvious to me and it did not relate to improving the management structures or anything like that - it was about bringing in more doctors.<\/p> <p>  This brings me back to the cancer programme.  If the entire bureaucracy of the National Cancer Control Programme were dismantled tomorrow, it would not have a major negative impact on cancer outcomes.  Cancer survival improved about 15 years ago as a result of one intervention that was made by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan.  I jokingly tell him that he gently plagiarised a speech I had made stating that there are hospitals in the country that I would not let any relative of mine with cancer go into.  On his first day as Minister for Health he said the same thing and said he was going to appoint more cancer specialists.  I was the fourth oncologist in the country when I came back.  I was often in the elevator in the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center with more Irish oncologists than there were in Ireland at the time I came back.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, just set about appointing a larger number of oncologists, and suddenly multidisciplinary care became available to people before there was any bureaucracy.  I believe that is what made the big difference.<\/p> <p>  While I have sympathy with Dr. Fitzpatrick's view that there should be an obstetrics tsar, the absolute first priority is not more reports, but an attempt to double or treble the number of consultant obstetricians so that everyone in the country who is going through any phase of obstetrical care is not being looked after by a trainee, which is what junior doctors are.<\/p><p>They are trainees.  Take out the words \"senior house officer\", SHO, \"registrar\" and \"specialist registrar\", insert the word \"trainee\" and see how rational many of the things we say on a day to day basis in Irish hospitals would sound, for example, &ldquo;My precious young daughter went into the hospital and the trainee surgeon saw her and conferred with the trainee anaesthetist who said the trainee in intensive care hd said this was their opinion.&rdquo;  We would never accept this in any trade, never mind medicine. <\/p><p> I have a few specific questions for Dr. Fitzpatrick.  This is a hard one: in Portlaoise hospital there are 2,000 births a year.  If we were flush with money and had an adequately resourced health service and were not operating under economic constraints, would 2,000 births a year be enough to justify keeping open a modern obstetric unit?  My suspicion is that it would and that our decisions about Portlaoise hospital are based on the fact that we are not prepared to resource it the way it needs to be resourced in order that it will be more cost-efficient.  Perhaps there are professional reasons to roll it in to something else.<\/p><p> How critical are these numbers as one of the metrics on which the relative failure of our obstetric services is based: in Ireland there are 4.8 obstetricians per 100,000 of the population; in the Netherlands which has a lower birth rate there are 7.6, while in Switzerland there are 17?  I had this argument with somebody last week about cancer outcomes.  We saw figures last year which showed that Ireland had pretty dismal cancer outcomes, despite all the tosh we heard about the national cancer control programme.  There is an emerging story that if as a society we deny people cancer drugs, we will have inferior cancer survival rates.  I have a beautiful five month old baby.  My lovely wife Orla presented me with a gorgeous child and she was beautifully looked after in difficult circumstances in Holles Street.  In my heart I believe, in respect of many of the tragedies about which we read every couple of years and the awful pictures of children in wheelchairs outside the High Court, that if there had been a real senior person making all of the decisions all the way through those pregnancies and deliveries, those tragedies would not have happened.  I would like Dr. Fitzpatrick&rsquo;s input and thank him for a very inspiring presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#S00300","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443688200,"counter":1070,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Fitzpatrick for his presentation.  What are his feelings and views about the development of the new national children&rsquo;s hospital on the St. James&rsquo;s Hospital campus?  Senator John Crown said Dr. Fitzpatrick had made some very passionate remarks, but I saw only frustration and anger at some stages.  In hindsight, if funding was the only problem in the health service, perhaps we could fix it in the long run.  As somebody who served on the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the south western area health board, I believe that after the ERHA was broken up, there were too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  Management was overcrowded and while people were making decisions, there was nobody doing the work.  There were more managers after the break-up of the ERHA than in the English football league at one stage.<\/p> <p>  I agree 100% about people who lose their children and those whose children are brain damaged because of things that went wrong when they gave birth.  One of my biggest hang-ups is the lack of transparency and why it takes between ten and 16 years for people to go to court to be heard and compensated for having to live with a child who will never be able feed himself or herself, walk or do anything else.  That is partly due to a system in which there is a lack of compassion. <\/p> <p>  I was interested in what Dr. Fitzpatrick said about going away when he was younger and doing what he had to do when he came back.  I believe the new generation does not feel the same way about coming back to their homeland because those going away are better educated and they want a little more, perhaps not for all the right reasons.  I have talked to several people who have left, who were in the medical business, doctors and nurses, and they go not only for education but also to upskill and see how emergency services are managed in other countries.  Money and quality of life issues are also involved.  A doctor friend of mine recently went to Australia because he wanted to become a consultant.  If he had stayed here, he probably would not have been made a consultant before he was well into his sixties.  Taxation is another issue which explains why some people will not come back. <\/p> <p>  I welcome the announcement through the capital funding plan that the Coombe Hospital will be relocated to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  That is a step in the right direction.  Having been many times in the Coombe Hospital as a parent and a grandparent, I believe it has moved well past its sell-by date.  I do not refer to the staff but to the building.  We can keep on adding to places, but that does not make for better practice in the long run.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#T00200","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443688200,"counter":1071,"content":"<p>I thank Senator John Crown for his comments.  I absolutely agree with him, there is no acceptable level of maternal or perinatal morbidity or mortality.  My ambition for the country is that rather than being &ldquo;the best little country in which to do business&rdquo; it should be the best country in the world in which to have a baby, both in terms of maternal safety and paediatric outcomes.  There is the capacity to achieve this.<\/p> <p>  I hope the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is in the same mould as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and a person who is able to make up his mind about what needs to be done.  I agree absolutely that there is a critical need to appoint more consultants.  The problem is that in my day when one went for a consultant interview, there were 20 people being interviewed against me, now there might be only one.  We have lost a generation of graduates who competed, who wanted and were inspired to work in obstetrics, went away and got the best jobs and pursued fellowships in North America, Australia and Britain and came back here to work.  Some of them have not taken up the speciality and some of them do not want to come back for a variety of reasons.  There is demoralisation about what they see here. <\/p> <p>  There are things that can be done immediately: we should clear deficits in order that voluntary hospitals would not be under a financial burden.  Most of the creativity in the health service has happened in the voluntary sector.  With the greatest of respect, if the three Dublin hospitals had been run by the HSE during the years of austerity, they would not be standing today because having people give of their expertise in a voluntary capacity to try to make a hospital work was hugely advantageous to us.  The deficits need to be cleared.  We need to appoint consultants in Portlaoise, the Coombe Hospital and the Rotunda Hopsital and all other units.  That will take time because there are not necessarily the people available and we need to appoint the best people.  We do not only need obstetricians.  Neonatologists are run off their feet looking after babies with the highest risk in the country of dying, serious morbidity and mortality.  They are grossly understaffed.  On top of this, we need perinatal psychiatrists.  We passed legislation on the protection of life in pregnancy and emphasised the importance of dealing with the issue of suicide.  We do not have enough perinatal psychiatrists to deal with the referrals we are seeing.  A sign of the disconnectedness in one person being in charge is that we do not have a mother and baby home in the State to look after mothers with a serious mental illness in pregnancy or afterwards.  We cannot accommodate them appropriately.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the cancer programme, we do not want to create a bureaucracy.  The appointment of critical staff is far more important.  I agree with Deputy Catherine Byrne that it is possible to have a system that is overburdened with management.  It needs to be at a level of priority that perhaps only comes with that type of designated programme.<\/p><p> On the sustainability of Portlaoise hospital, by international standards, there are many units in the developed world which deliver 2,000 babies very effectively.  It cannot be a stand-alone facility, it needs to be networked into a tertiary hospital.  Cross-institutional appointments, cross-institutional training, cross-institutional audit, cross-institutional research and dedicated transfer pathways would work extremely well.  <\/p><p> Approximately 15% of cerebral palsy is due to intrapartum events.  In the other 85% of cases, we are not certain in the context of the aetiology.  Obviously, there is a strong obstetric factor to it but 15% of instances of cerebral palsy occur during pregnancy.  The unfortunate scenarios that we see at present - the Kafkaesque-type scenarios - where parents and children are dragged through the courts in order that they might obtain adequate compensation is something most of us find absolutely reprehensible.  In terms of open disclosure, if something goes wrong then this could be clearly identified.  There are opportunities to mediate and to try to deal with the issue very early on at source.  Parents are often forced to go to court in order to secure the long-term well-being of their children because there is nothing else.  In terms of children who have a long-term disability from neurological injury or other conditions, one need only to speak to people at the Jack and Jill Foundation to find out what level of care is available in the community.  These families need to have the security of long-term care for their children.  That will not necessarily remove from them their right to go to court in relation to litigation if something happened that should not have happened.  I agree with Senator Crown that the more consultants and the better-trained individuals one has looking after mothers and babies, particularly at critical periods, the better will be the outcomes.  <\/p><p> Deputy Catherine Byrne asked about locating the new national children's hospital at James's Hospital.  We are fully supportive of this proposal.  My only regret is that it did not submit an application for a maternity hospital at the time.  Given the delays relating to the last decision, there would have been plenty of opportunity to submit such an application.  The nightmare scenario would be that planning permission to build a children's hospital will be granted and then for some reason there will be a problem with having the tri-located entity.  I hope the project proceeds.  In terms of the Coombe, I hope we will relocate on to the St. James's campus.  I think there was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, given the delays, to actually put the whole package together.  The Deputy is correct - the Coombe Hospital needs to be redeveloped.  We need a new hospital.  The Rotunda needs a new hospital.  This is a reflection of how non-partisan are obstetricians.  I am doing my best, working on the project team to relocate the National Maternity Hospital on St. Vincent's Hospital.  Our loyalty is to patients, not to institutions.  Those days of trying to promote one's institution, at the expense of another institution, are gone.  The three Dublin hospitals work very well together as a network in terms of a joint committee.  We also work with the hospitals with which we are networked, in our case, Portlaoise hospital.<\/p><p> The Coombe, the Rotunda and Limerick need a national maternity hospital.  We need interim development.  The things that need to be fixed must be fixed now, namely, in the context that the hospitals will be rebuilt.  That is why I am appealing to the Minister.  If there is one message to come out of this, it is to appoint the consultants, the obstetricians, the midwives, the neonatologists, the perinatal psychiatrists, the perinatal pathologists and deal with the equipment and the infrastructural issues that need to be dealt with in the short-term, build the hospitals and then look at community care.  There is a way of doing it and we do not need to wait for a programme to tell us what we all know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Chris Fitzpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443688200,"counter":1073,"content":"<p>Dr. Fitzpatrick mentioned appointing all these specialists.

We can attract people but not necessarily Irish graduates.  What we want are top-class graduates coming back to work as doctors, midwives, neonatologists, etc., in our country but we also need to plan.  I teach medical students.  What I sense is a disillusionment regarding the medical area.  There are really bright people that one would want to be working in one's hospital ten years from now but they say to me that they will work in North America, Canada and so on.  We need to inspire them.  There is an opportunity to do so now.  We have a Minister who speaks his mind and I would like him to do so in respect of this issue.  In coming forward, I have taken a leaf out of his book because I have been ashamed at the way the political system has actually turned its back on what should be our most precious resource.  In that context, next year we are celebrating 100 years since the founding Proclamation of the State.  We have done many things in terms of our independence but there is a legacy of not looking after mothers and babies.  Whether it was in the context of the mother and baby homes, the Magdalen laundries, the industrial schools or whatever, there is a legacy of not looking after our most precious resource - our mothers and babies.  Let us hope that we can actually make the decision but quick action and long-term planning are required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#U00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Chris Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1443688200,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Fitzpatrick for attending, for the contribution he made and for his ongoing commitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#U00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1443688200,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>I thank him for his forthrightness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100100002#U00700","speaker":"969"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1443688200,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 4.15 p.m. until 4.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 6 October 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
