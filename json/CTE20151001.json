All of these are to be noted and published.<\/p> <p>  Regarding No. 3C, the documents for today's meeting, at 9 p.m. last night, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, wrote to the committee and presented 41 documents running to hundreds of pages, which relate to the NAMA Northern Ireland advisory committee and the interaction between the Ministers here and in Northern Ireland dealing with the NAMA issues.  The clerk to the committee received no advance notice that such information was being made available.  The release of the information on the eve of the committee meeting with NAMA and, more important, with the chairman of a delegation from the Northern Ireland finance committee, is deeply frustrating and works against all principles of good accountability.  I am sure the members would not have had the opportunity to review the documents, which is a pity, given that we are entering public session and the documents are laid before us.

The experience to date has reflected the fact that the Minister has been markedly reluctant to give a full account and to answer questions on all the issues pertaining to NAMA and, more specifically, to the Northern loan book, Project Eagle.  In order to be helpful, the documents would have had to have been published earlier this week.  It might have proved helpful.  They have been published, and I have had the opportunity only to scan them.  This leads us to a position in which we must invite the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and his officials to come before the committee at the earliest opportunity so we can examine and question the contents of the documents they have put into the public domain.<\/p> <p>  Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, Mr. Martin McGuinness, MLA, has been in contact with the clerk to the committee seeking the earliest opportunity to come and give evidence, which would be useful.  After this meeting, we are to deal with the issue of Mr. Bryson, and we can deal with it then.  We also need to consider hearing evidence from Mr. Sammy Wilson, former finance minister in the North, Mr. Simon Hamilton and the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, MLA.  For the purposes of this jurisdiction, it is unthinkable, having released the documentation at the 11th hour, that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, would not very promptly make himself available to the committee, along with his officials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#C01800","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I agree with most of what Deputy McDonald said.  It is shocking and extraordinary that the documents should be issued when it is almost impossible to digest them, and they are deliberately and nakedly politically divisive and provide a distraction to what is happening today.  I can only conclude that it is deliberate on a day when we are doing important work and when we have invited the MLAs from Northern Ireland here.  It contrasts very starkly with the extraordinary decision by NAMA, with the Minister's support, not to co-operate with the inquiry in Northern Ireland.  There is a paradox and contradiction in what the Minister is doing by releasing the information at this time, just before this committee meeting, given that he could have released it any time since 2 September and he is not encouraging NAMA, a semi-State agency, to provide any evidence to help the inquiry in Northern Ireland.  We should make this point clear to the Minister and NAMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#C01900","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Given that it came late last night, it is obviously too short notice for the members to deal with it adequately.

That was very constructive and the right approach to take.  What happened this morning in private session is that we were cautioned as to how we conduct our business.  As I said then and repeat now, I believe that every member of this committee has acted responsibly, is aware of Standing Order 163 and understands full well the extent to which we can go with these inquiries.  The caution that we received this morning might well have been given to others outside this committee because I consider that to be an effort to frustrate the committee.  The releasing of documentation like this, before the hearing today, is nothing short of interference with the work of the committee.  We now have those 41 documents as well as an e-mail which has been given to me by the clerk, which I will read:<\/p><blockquote>I am writing on behalf of Martin McGuinness, MLA.  Following disclosure from the Department of Finance of papers to the Public Accounts Committee, Martin McGuinness would like to appear before the PAC at the earliest opportunity.  Please contact me by return e-mail to arrange same.  <\/blockquote> <p>We are now faced with these papers being in the public domain and a number of individuals have now asked to come before us.  We have been cautioned this morning about that and we need to make a decision on it.

We must be honest about the fact that politicians often get briefs with very little notice.  It is not in any way unreasonable to expect, given the backup provided to all of the parties here, that we could scan the documentation enough to know what is contained therein.  I totally resent the accusation of outside interference by the Minister.  We do not want to pre-judge the outcome of the meeting with an inference that information has been provided in order to interfere with today's proceedings.  That is far from the case.  I was Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts for over two years and laid great emphasis on the importance of impartiality.  We are here to investigate the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Obviously there are limitations on the role of the committee which have been in place since the foundation of the State.  There is no point in pre-empting the debate that will take place.  The fact that there are witnesses who are prepared to come from Northern Ireland is entirely at their discretion.  Nobody who has been asked to come before the committee has declined to do so.  We must look at this in the context of the matter before us.  The allegations that are being made relate entirely to the Northern Ireland jurisdiction.

At this very moment, 600 residents in Longboat Quay are threatened with evacuation.<\/p><p>It is something that we on this committee dealt with before.  Some 12 months ago the matter came to our attention and it was mentioned at that time that there was a serious fire safety issue.  The DDDA undertook to look into that matter and I understand it put in a sum in the region of &euro;1 million towards remedying the situation.  Other issues have developed since then that have shown this to be far more serious, with the results that the 600 plus residents in 300 apartments may have to be evacuated if the faults are not rectified.  The initial work was carried out by the DDDA, which was the planning authority.  The question now is who will take care of the &euro;4 million that is required.<\/p><p> The Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, is about to become part of Dublin City Council.  Quite clearly Dublin City Council is at risk from the charge.<\/p><p> The property belonged to Bernard McNamara who went into receivership.  It is incredible that somebody can walk away.  It would be similar to what happened in the case of Priory Hall.  The person who is responsible for the damage caused is now one of the people who will probably not have to pay to have it rectified.  I wonder if NAMA has a role, given that NAMA would have taken over those properties when Bernard McNamara went bust.  I wonder whether it would be appropriate to ask NAMA some questions on this at a later stage.  In the first instance I propose that we deal with NAMA in respect of it.  <\/p><p> Second, the flaws have only appeared in this property which was built in 2006, some nine years ago.

One of the recurrent items to which I am drawing attention is instances of material non-compliance with procurement rules.  It is something to which attention has been drawn previously.  I know it is a matter that continues to be of interest to the committee.  I also draw attention to cases where there have been significant control failures that are explained in the statements of internal financial control at the front of each of the Appropriation Accounts.

I am quite hoarse as I was up late reading documents last night.  I welcome this opportunity to present to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I believe this informal engagement between representatives of our two committees will be a timely and viable opportunity to explore how we might work collaboratively on our respective inquiries into the NAMA Project Eagle sale.<\/p><p>In addressing you formally I will refer to our respective areas of focus and I will outline the activities and outputs from my committee&rsquo;s work to date.  I shall talk about the next steps and suggest some ways in which we might collaborate in a practical way.  Clearly both committees have different areas of focus; the PAC&rsquo;s specific interest is in investigating whether the Project Eagle sale provided value for money for taxpayers in the South while the Assembly committee is to examine the role of Stormont&rsquo;s Department of Finance and Personnel, the DFP, in NAMA&rsquo;s operations in the North.  This includes the relationship with the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee in the context of Project Eagle.  However, I believe there are key areas where our interests cross over and where a co-ordinated action could offer mutual benefit.  I have some specific suggestions in this regard to which I will return.<\/p><p>Shortly after the Northern Assembly finance committee initiated its review in early July, the PSNI announced its investigation.  In order to minimise the risk of prejudicing this or future court proceedings the committee developed terms of reference for its work which was informed by a meeting with investigators and by independent legal advice.  Investigators held another useful meeting with senior National Crime Agency personnel last week.  The committee has collated a growing body of written and oral evidence which is published on its website.  This includes written communications with NAMA including questions and answers; correspondence with DFP; written submissions from other key players including Cerberus and Mr. Cushnahan; Hansard reports of the five oral hearings to date; and the papers released last night from the finance department.<\/p><p> Despite the significant public interest in the review, the efforts of the committee have been frustrated by some key witnesses.  The continued reluctance of NAMA to appear before the committee is very much regretted.  As its reason for not travelling to the North, NAMA has said that the appropriate forum to which it should account for its activities is the Oireachtas, and to committees established by the Oireachtas.  This point is not disputed by my committee but greater co-operation from NAMA will be crucial if we are to fully understand its relationship with the Northern Assembly's Department of Finance and Personnel since 2009, including the role of the department in making nominations to the NI advisory committee.  While NAMA has agreed to answer questions in writing, I believe there is increased onus to appear before the committee out of pure courtesy and respect for the institutions in the North.  While critical of NAMA on this point I acknowledge that it has been more forthcoming than some witnesses who continue to cite the criminal investigation as a reason for not providing further written or oral evidence to the committee.  I believe this position is becoming more untenable by the day.<\/p><p> Although the committee&rsquo;s review is still at a relatively early stage I can report some tangible outputs already.  It is beginning to establish a public record of key documents, including records of meetings and written submissions from key players.  The committee has also prepared a comprehensive timeline of events that is updated as and when evidence and documentation is received.  The oral testimony received to date is also highlighting the differing accounts of events which raises further questions and areas for scrutiny.  Moreover, the publication of this emerging body of evidence has also informed the wider public discourse including in the media.<\/p><p> The committee is in the process of formulating and issuing further written questions to a range of witnesses and these include NAMA, Pimco, Cerberus and Mr. Frank Cushnahan.  Invitations to oral hearings have been issued to the First Minister, former finance Ministers Simon Hamilton and Sammy Wilson, former permanent secretaries, former special advisers in the Department of Finance and Personnel and members of the NI advisory committee.  The finance committee is expecting that all of these witnesses will make themselves available willingly and co-operate fully with the review.  However, it will keep open the option of using its powers to compel persons and papers should that become necessary.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I wish to suggest some potential areas of common interest and practical measures which we might take to support our respective efforts and to assist each other in adding pieces to this complicated jigsaw.  A key concern for both committees should be to investigate the information flow between NAMA and its northern advisory committee.  In its written response to the committee on the 4 September, NAMA stated and I quote: \"No specific information relating to debtors or assets was ever provided to external members of the NIAC\".  However, a question remains of precisely what information was shared.  We know from the minutes of advisory committee meetings that commercial and confidential matters were discussed in some detail.  Indeed, NAMA has redacted parts of the minutes which it has provided to the committee.  It would be interesting to have an explanation for those redactions.  It was also highlighted in the advisory committee minutes that section 202 of the NAMA Act which deals with the handling of confidential information also applies to the advisory committee including external members.  Presumably that provision exists for a purposes.<\/p><p>We also know there was a crossover of membership between the NAMA board and the advisory committee.  On 7 October 2013 at Tughans' offices in Belfast, the advisory committee discussed the unsolicited bid by Pimco and feedback was sought from the external members in order to inform the NAMA board&rsquo;s consideration on 10 October 2013.  We need therefore to establish the full facts on this relationship, not just in terms of the formal exchange of information but also the opportunities which individuals may have had to develop commercial intelligence on NAMA's assets and operations in the North.<\/p><p> A further area in which both committees may be able to support each other will be in getting to the bottom of the nominations and appointments of the external members to the advisory committee.  A number of questions remain unanswered including where the responsibility rested for due diligence.  In practical terms I believe that, as the inquiries progress, we could consider sharing information and papers as applicable.  There is also scope for our respective committees to provide each other with suggested areas for questioning of witnesses whose oral evidence is of mutual interest.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for this opportunity to address the committee and I welcome continued engagement.  I am happy to respond to any questions that members may have and I look forward to hearing their views or suggestions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#E01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daith&iacute; McKay","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McKay for his statement.

When the chief executive and I appeared before the committee in July, we spoke at length about the Project Eagle sales process.  There has been much coverage of various aspects of the transaction over the past three months, much of it related to what may or may not have happened on the purchase side of the transaction and particularly in Northern Ireland, but the key points that we made to the committee in July are still valid and I want to reiterate them.<br\/><br\/>If there was wrongdoing on the part of some parties involved on the purchase side of the transaction in Northern Ireland, including those who acted as professional advisers to potential purchasers, we in NAMA have no more knowledge of that than what has been publicly disclosed to date.  The facts, as they pertain to those individuals and their activities, are a matter for the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland and other jurisdictions to establish.  If an alleged payment involving Tughans did find its way to an account in the Isle of Man, as has been alleged, it did not<b><\/b>emanate from the sales proceeds that were due to NAMA and to Irish taxpayers.<\/p><p>When NAMA became aware of a concern surrounding the participation of one of the bidders for Eagle, we immediately, and without hesitation, took steps to ensure that potential bidder withdrew from the loan sale process.<\/p><p> The chief executive and I met the UK's National Crime Agency some weeks ago and provided it with an overview of NAMA and the chronology of the sale of Eagle.  It is our clear understanding, based on that engagement, that its investigation is not in any way concerned with the NAMA sale side of the transaction.  Its focus appears to be very much on the purchase side and what may or may not have taken place in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> The loan sales process for Eagle was well-managed and competitive.  The sale was conducted in line with best international practice, independently overseen by Lazard, and NAMA took care at all stages to ensure the integrity of the process was fully protected.  The implication of many of the allegations is that parties in Belfast either had influence over NAMA's decision-making on Project Eagle and\/or had access to confidential NAMA information that could have afforded certain bidders a competitive advantage in the sales process.  On the first point, let me make it very clear that no pressure from any source, North or South, political or otherwise, influenced NAMA in regard to the commercial decision to sell the loans of NAMA's Northern Ireland debtors or influenced the decision to accept the winning bid from Cerberus.  All decisions were made, as is correct and proper, by the NAMA board.<\/p><p> Let me also reiterate that members of the Northern Ireland advisory committee had no access to confidential NAMA information.  In fact, all bidders had equal access to all of the information on the loans and the underlying security once they entered a controlled data room.  No bidder could have had a competitive advantage over another because all bidders were given full and equal access to all relevant information held by NAMA.  We have no knowledge of what third parties on the purchase side were allegedly saying in Northern Ireland but we can state categorically that they had no influence over NAMA's decision making, no access to NAMA confidential information and were in no position to confer an unfair competitive advantage on any of the bidders in the process.<\/p><p> I have little doubt that the commercial decision taken by the NAMA board to dispose of the Northern Ireland loan portfolio was the right one.  The board took the view that the sale would provide the best financial outcome for Irish taxpayers, taking into account the quality of assets in the portfolio, the lack of liquidity in the Northern Ireland property market, the availability of a number of investors with the capacity to bid competitively on the portfolio and NAMA's need to focus on its assets in the Republic and London, which were more likely to gain from intensive asset management attention.  NAMA set a reserve price based on the aggregate value of the assets securing the portfolio and NAMA achieved that price.  I will address later in this statement the hearsay claim that the portfolio was sold for less than what it was worth.<\/p><p> There has been an attempt to suggest &ndash; without evidence - that Cerberus has made a huge profit on the Eagle transaction.  Based on its own submission to the Northern Ireland Committee for Finance and Personnel, by letter dated 16 September 2015 which is publicly available, Cerberus stated it expected to write off a cumulative &pound;2.8 billion of debt.  That implies a realisation of &pound;1.5 billion on a portfolio for which it paid &pound;1.3 billion.  On the assumption that funding, loan servicing and other costs will amount to 8% over an assumed workout period of 30 months, Cerberus would be left with a profit of approximately 7% to 8%.  While clearly Cerberus invested in the portfolio with a view to generating a profit, the data provided by it to the Northern Ireland committee hardly suggest that the Irish taxpayer was robbed, as has recently been suggested by some of the more excitable commentary.  There is no certainty that this projected profit will be achieved ultimately, given the difficulty of predicting the performance of markets and of economies.  In essence, we were faced with a choice of taking a certain &pound;1.3 billion in cash upfront or taking the very substantial risk of holding on for a potential upside of another 7% to 8% and putting this &pound;1.3 billion at risk for a limited additional gain that may or may not be generated over a three to four-year period.  Knowing what we know about this portfolio, this is a risk NAMA was not prepared to take.<\/p><p> There were also claims that the value of the Eagle portfolio increased by 20% in the 15 months since the sale was concluded.  Based on independent data available to us, this claim is without foundation.  The most reliable data that we have been able to obtain suggests that Northern Ireland commercial property prices increased by 2.3% for the 2014 calendar year.  No reliable updated data is yet available for 2015.  I should point out though that the estimated 2.3% price growth was largely based on an investment portfolio of prime retail, office and industrial income-producing assets.  By contrast, Project Eagle contained a significant proportion of lower-quality land and development assets and other assets that would not fit institutions' investment criteria.  It is reasonable to assume that price recovery for this asset class would lag that of the better quality assets typically measured by price indices.  Based on this, we have concluded that, at best, Eagle assets may have increased in price by a maximum of 2% to 3%, not the 20% claimed in some media reports.  When account is taken of funding and management costs, NAMA could have made little or no gain from retaining the portfolio and working it out as far as 2020 by comparison with the option of selling it, as we did, in early 2014.<\/p><p> It is also important to point out that Cerberus has more flexibility in its ability to manage the portfolio than NAMA had.  This is because section 172 of the NAMA Act prohibits NAMA from selling assets back to defaulting debtors.  While we have no way of knowing the ultimate impact of section 172, one can speculate that, in some cases at least, debtors would be willing to outbid third parties, with the support of third-party financing, in order to ensure that they obtained control over their assets, given they had the best knowledge of them.<\/p><p> I now turn to a number of additional allegations which were made last week under D&aacute;il privilege by Deputy Wallace.  Deputy Wallace claimed that Cerberus or some \"fixers\" went to some of the major Northern Ireland debtors prior to the sale of the portfolio and offered to sell them back their loans for 50p in the pound.  He goes on to imply that, having bought the loans from NAMA at 27p in the pound, Cerberus was then able to sell the loans at twice what they paid for them.  This is a serious misrepresentation of the facts.  Cerberus bought the Eagle portfolio at a price which corresponded to an average of 27% of its par value.  The price that we achieved was based on the aggregate value of the properties securing the portfolio.  Neither Cerberus nor any other bidder would ever pay the par value for the loans unless the underlying assets were worth at least as much as the loan par value.  Nor would they pay more than what the aggregate underlying assets were worth, which was 27% of par value at the time of sale following open marketing of the portfolio.<\/p><p> It may well have been the case that the loan portfolios of certain individual debtors were priced at 50% of the par value because the properties securing them were better than the average.  If that were the case, it would have made sense for Cerberus and the particular debtors involved to agree a buyout price at or about 50%.  But it is utterly disingenuous to suggest that the whole portfolio could have been sold for 50% of par value.  The price we agreed was based on our own valuations of the loans.  We were fully aware that some loans were worth 50p in the pound, and some were worth far less; perhaps as little as 5p in the pound.  The blended average across the portfolio as a whole represented 27% of par value.  That is the highest that any bidder - out of nine major investment groups approached - was prepared to pay for the portfolio as a whole and the highest that could be achieved.<\/p><p> It stretches credulity to suggest that Northern Irish, or indeed any other debtors, and their new investors or bankers would have paid 50p to buy back assets which were worth only 27p.  Some of the commentary over the past week has been written by commentators who have been silent on this point but know very well how implausible it is or, at the very least, ought to know.<\/p><p>Deputy Wallace then goes on to ask why NAMA could not have negotiated with debtors to secure 50% of the loans&rsquo; par value, which, as he claims, was achieved by Cerberus.  Aside from the implausibility of the claim that Cerberus was in a position to sell its whole Eagle portfolio at 50% of par value, there was nothing to prevent Cerberus or any other buyer, once they had bought the portfolio, negotiating deals with debtors, which would have involved the debtors buying the loans at a discount to par.  Some loans may have been worth 50% of par value but many others were worth much less.  The Deputy asks why NAMA could not negotiate such deals.  The answer is straightforward: section 172 of the National Asset Management Agency Act prohibits it from doing so.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Wallace states that because the price paid by Cerberus was 27% of par value, taxpayers in the Republic had to cover the shortfall relative to par.  The Deputy&rsquo;s implication is that if NAMA were to retain this portfolio for long enough, it would eventually recover par value.  This is a totally unrealistic view of what is achievable within any reasonable timespan.  If par value were ever to be realised from this portfolio, a realistic timetable for realising it runs into decades, not years.  As we indicated to this committee in July, NAMA bought the portfolio at a heavy discount and then we had to impair it further after acquisition due to further property price declines and economic stagnation in Northern Ireland.  The key point to bear in mind about the Eagle portfolio is the fact that five Irish banks advanced ST&pound;4.5 billion to Northern Ireland debtors for the purchase of assets which were generally of mediocre or poor quality and which subsequently lost, in aggregate, over two-thirds of their value.  Blaming NAMA for that is akin to blaming the fire brigade for a major fire which was set off by an arsonist.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Wallace states that some &euro;45 million has been paid in what he describes as &quot;fixers&rsquo; fees&quot;.  As the Deputy did not provide any detail as to what these fees represent, it is very difficult to comment in any detail on this point.  I am aware, however, that it is normal practice for debtors to pay fees to new lenders when refinancing or buying back their loans and it is possible that this is what the Deputy has in mind.  I understand that these fees &ndash; commonly referred to as arrangements fees - are typically charged at about 1% of buyout value, and this is normal banking practice.  Even if 1% fees were paid on the whole portfolio, the total fee payment would amount to &pound;13 million, not the &euro;45 million as claimed.  It is also possible that the Deputy is referring to fees which debtors might have paid to accountants, lawyers and corporate finance advisers to assist them in their engagement with Cerberus.  However, in the absence of any further information about the fees involved, it is difficult for me to offer the committee any insight as to what the Deputy might have had in mind.<br\/><br\/>I can state categorically that these supposed &quot;fixers' fees&quot; do not in any way relate to NAMA.  We have already disclosed that the fees incurred by NAMA in relation to this transaction were &euro;9 million, which is about 0.6% of the sales price, and that they were principally fees paid to Lazard as our loan sale adviser and to a number of legal firms.  We have no difficulty in publishing the full list of service providers and the fees paid to them by us as part of the Eagle sales process if that is required or useful.  We have nothing to hide on this.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On a more general note, it is difficult for NAMA or indeed any organisation to properly address allegations where such allegations are vague or implausible and where no evidence is produced to support them.  It is unfortunate to say the least that in some cases those making the allegations appear unconcerned about the reputational or commercial damage their unsubstantiated allegations may cause to the organisation concerned or to any individuals they may name.  Often there are no consequences for them if their allegations prove to be without foundation whereas the reputational damage to the organisation or the individual may well be impossible to reverse.<br\/><br\/>If those making such allegations genuinely believe that the information that has been passed on to them is accurate and reliable, we would again urge that they pass it on to us or to the appropriate authorities so that it can be objectively investigated.  The committee will be aware that if a criminal act is alleged to have been committed, the individual making the allegation is obliged to report such matters to the Garda under section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011.<br\/><br\/>NAMA is well on its way towards achieving its primary objective of redeeming close to &euro;32 billion of senior and subordinated debt.  In addition, we hope to generate a surplus, the upper range of which is currently estimated at &euro;1.75 billion.<br\/><br\/>To put all this into context, we paid, as required by statutory regulations, &euro;5.6 billion of State aid as part of the acquisition price of our loan portfolio, in effect &euro;5.6 billion more than a private purchaser would have paid for this portfolio.  We have also had to take a cumulative impairment provision of &euro;3.5 billion.  Against that strong headwind, I believe that repayment of senior and sub debt, and generating a surplus will be recognised in time as a significant achievement in very difficult circumstances.<br\/><br\/>In time also, I believe that the intensive planning and preparatory work that we are currently carrying out will make a major contribution to the development of the Dublin docklands, as will the funding we are providing towards delivery of private and social housing, particularly in the Dublin area, where housing need is most acute, and the chief executive will elaborate on those plans in his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#K02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Daly.

I also propose to comment on a number of NAMA related issues which are currently receiving media attention, not least the content of statements recently submitted to the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Certain contentions made in these statements have been given widespread publicity and, if left unchallenged, could damage taxpayers&rsquo; confidence in NAMA&rsquo;s capacity to carry out its work in an objective, commercial and professional manner.  I will discuss this later in my statement.<br\/><br\/>With regard to progress on key targets, we have circulated to the committee a presentation which summarises our performance across a number of key areas on which I will highlight a number of points.<br\/><br\/>Last year, 2014, was an exceptionally strong year for NAMA.  We reported after-tax profits of &euro;458 million, an increase of 115% on 2013.<br\/><br\/>Cash inflows of &euro;8.6 billion in 2014 enabled us to redeem &euro;9.1 billion in senior bonds, almost a third of the senior bonds originally issued.<br\/><br\/>Yesterday, we submitted to the Minister for Finance our financial statements for the first six months of 2015 and I am pleased to say that the profit for the first six months of 2015 exceeded the full-year profit figure for 2014.  We expect that the half-year 30 June results will be published by the Minister over the coming weeks.<br\/><br\/>Since the end of 2014, we have redeemed an additional &euro;4.5 billion of senior bonds, including &euro;1.75 billion redeemed yesterday. This brings our cumulative redemption to &euro;21.1 billion or 70%<b><i><\/i><\/b>of the total of the &euro;30.2 billion originally issued.  It leaves us well placed to achieve our end-2016 target of 80% debt redemptions of &euro;24 billion, and our ultimate aim is to have all our senior debt redeemed by 2018.<br\/><br\/>Based on our 30 June 2015 impairment review, we have increased our projected terminal surplus from &euro;1 billion, which was estimated at the end of 2014, to &euro;1.75 billion.  We will undertake a further review at the end of 2015.<br\/><br\/>We are firmly on course to deliver 5,000 residential units by the end of 2016.  This will exceed our 4,500 unit target.  We will also deliver, and this is crucially important, 2,000 social housing units by the end of 2015.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>In terms of our accelerated disposals strategy,<b><\/b>total cash inflows since inception have now reached &euro;29 billion.  It is worth bearing in mind that, as recently as February 2013, the contingent liability on Irish taxpayers from Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, and NAMA was in excess of &euro;40 billion, which corresponded to about 24% of gross domestic product.  Today, it is &euro;9 billion or less than 5% of gross domestic product, which is a reduction of over 75% in the past 18 months.<\/p><p>There have been some criticisms of NAMA's accelerated deleveraging strategy and, in particular, there have been suggestions that we would have been better off waiting, holding all our assets until the market had improved further.  Let me make a number of points on this.  First, NAMA is accountable under the NAMA Act to the Minister for Finance, to the Government and to the Oireachtas.  We were asked by the Minister, following his section 227 review of NAMA in July 2014, to take full advantage, subject to commercial criteria, of the strong investor interest in Irish assets and to maintain a flexible approach with a view to accelerating disposals and senior debt redemptions beyond the 80% target that we had set for the end of 2016.  That is what we have done and it reflects the agreed strategy.<\/p><p> The Minister, in requesting that we accelerate disposals to the greatest extent commercially feasible, was conscious of the wider positive impact of such deleveraging and, in particular, the impact that it had, and continues to have, in terms of reducing the State&rsquo;s contingent liability.  The reduction in the contingent liability has been a major factor quoted by a number of credit rating agencies following their upgrades of Ireland's sovereign credit rating over the past year.  These upgrades have had the effect of widening the pool of investors who may hold Ireland's sovereign bonds and, ultimately, they have contributed to a reduction in Ireland's borrowing and debt servicing costs.  Reduced debt servicing costs on the national debt &ndash; currently over 100% of GDP - mean that Exchequer funds are available for other, more productive, purposes in the economy.<\/p><p> Second, as a major participant in the Irish property market NAMA did not have the luxury of taking a back seat in terms of instigating market recovery.  To get activity going and then to consolidate market recovery, NAMA had to ensure that a flow of transactions was released to the market, not least to sustain emerging interest from investors.  NAMA's market activity and deleveraging have contributed to the strong inflows of foreign capital which have been committed to the Irish commercial property market over recent years.  Without this capital, and given that the domestic banking system has been slow to recover, it is arguable that there would have been no property market recovery and that the overall recovery of the Irish economy would have been much more subdued.<\/p><p> The property market recovery has led to increased development activity and to job creation.  It is entirely unrealistic to suggest that recovery would have happened if NAMA and other major participants had stayed on the sidelines.  If we had not acted to instigate market activity, I can well imagine that we would have been subject to severe criticism from this committee and from others.  Sitting on our hands, waiting for something to turn up, was not an option.<\/p><p> More generally, if one was to listen to some of the commentary over recent months, one would get the impression that some pundits hold the view that NAMA should only sell assets if it was absolutely certain that the assets concerned would never appreciate in price after their sale.  This is a bizarre perspective and it would mean, in effect, that we would never sell anything.  Why would any professional investor, mainly pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and investment funds, commit their clients' money to Ireland if they did not believe they could make a return on their investment?<\/p><p> The reality is that NAMA has been faced from the beginning with managing numerous objectives and stakeholder interests, namely, the public interest imperatives of reducing the State's contingent liability and facilitating the provision of housing and office accommodation where they are needed and the commercial imperative of optimising the disposal value of the assets under our control and the need to ensure that we manage, in a professional manner, our engagement with our debtors, receivers, investors and members of the public who have an interest in, or are otherwise affected by, assets under our control.  What we have tried to do is to manage these potentially competing objectives and interests as professionally as possible while recognising that we cannot hope to satisfy all of them all the time.  We have been crystal clear and open about our strategies.<\/p><p> As regards docklands and residential initiatives, NAMA has an interest in 14 of the development blocks in the SDZ and detailed strategies have now been developed for most of those sites.  Construction activity has begun on one of the sites, 8 Hanover Quay, in which NAMA holds a minority interest as part of a qualifying investor alternative investment fund.  The development is pre-let.  Planning permission has been granted for three other sites, including the Boland's Mill site which is expected to deliver office, residential, cultural and retail accommodation totalling almost 400,000 sq. ft.  Planning applications have been submitted to Dublin City Council on a further five sites.  These include a site at 72-80 North Wall Quay for which Oxley Holdings Limited acquired a long leasehold interest from NAMA with the right to develop, manage and realise the site.  NAMA retains the freehold interest and will receive a secure income stream in addition to a percentage of any future sales proceeds.  It also includes a site in Point Village where the proposed development will consist of Dublin&rsquo;s tallest office tower, comprising over 200,000 sq. ft.<\/p><p> Of the remaining five sites, it is expected that planning applications will be lodged for one of them in the third quarter of 2015 with two more to follow in early 2016.  In addition, it is expected that a planning application will be lodged for a planned new north-south road serving the Point Village area.  Much progress, therefore, is being made in facilitating the delivery of new commercial and residential development in the docklands area.  Based on appraisal work carried out to date, it is estimated that up to 3.8 million sq. ft. of gross commercial space and 2,000 apartments could potentially be delivered if all the sites in which NAMA has an interest were to be fully developed over the lifetime of the SDZ.  Regarding the 3.8 million sq. ft. of office space, our asset management team has worked, over the past 15 months, towards securing planning permission for over 2 million sq. ft. of this.  This development will support the expansion of the financial services sector and the development of new FDI business and technology hubs in the docklands area.<\/p><p> As regards residential delivery, we made a commitment in late 2013 to fund the delivery of 4,500 residential units in the Dublin area by the end of 2016.  Some 1,900 units have been completed to date and planning permission has been secured for another 6,350 units, 1,600 of which are under construction.  With a total of 40 NAMA-funded sites now active, we are confident that the end-2016 target will be achieved.  In addition to the units already delivered and the units for which planning permission has been obtained, planning permission has been sought or will be sought by mid-2016 for another estimated 7,200 units.  We have sold, to a range of private sector buyers, sites that could potentially deliver over 11,000 units; only 900 units have been completed or are under construction on these sites to date.<\/p><p> As I mentioned earlier, NAMA&rsquo;s engagement with debtors has recently received considerable media attention, largely arising from certain witness evidence submitted to the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis and associated debtor engagement with the media.  We have written to the joint committee and have provided it with a detailed and comprehensive rebuttal of many of the contentions put forward in witness evidence.  It is possible that the joint committee may approve publication of our detailed rebuttal and indeed we would be keen that they put the facts on the public record.  As of now, however, the joint committee has advised us that we cannot publish our statement to it and, indeed, that we are prohibited from making any comment to the Committee of Public Accounts or any other public forum about specific witness evidence.  Therefore, in the comments that follow, I must confine myself to observations about our engagement with debtors in general.<\/p><p> While debtors are free to discuss their engagement with NAMA, we, on the other hand, are constrained by law - particularly by sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act enacted by the Oireachtas - from disclosing details concerning our engagement with debtors.  Let me state emphatically that NAMA deals with debtors objectively, commercially and professionally.  There is no question of any bias in favour of, or against, particular debtors.  NAMA deals with its debtors, regardless of their public profile or the particulars of any case, in a consistent and reasonable manner having regard to its statutory mandate.  Any suggestion that NAMA had some kind of unwritten agenda to damage debtors is utterly without foundation.  In fact, it is risible, not least given the considerable financial support that NAMA has provided over the past five years to a total of 265 debtors, large and small.<\/p><p> In its engagement with larger debtors in particular, NAMA adopted an approach which was far more patient, protracted and intensive than private investors would have been willing to adopt.  However, at some point in any protracted process of negotiation, agreement has to be reached and debtors must start delivering on debt reduction targets.  Engagement with debtors and their professional advisors can be robust on both sides as each side negotiates to enhance its commercial position.  That is entirely to be expected.  I would rather hear debtors complaining about our toughness than to hear that NAMA is being accused of being a pushover and not doing enough to extract the best return for taxpayers.<\/p><p> Did NAMA press its debtors to sell property in order to pay back some of their debt so that NAMA could reduce the State's massive contingent liability and thereby contribute to Ireland's exit from the troika programme?  We certainly did, and we make no apology for that.  Many of our debtors made it clear to us since 2010 that they wanted to sit tight, retain their assets and wait for years for prices to recover to pre-crisis levels.  This was not an option, not least because Ireland had entered into a programme of financial support in the form of the troika bailout with the EU, the ECB and the IMF and it was clear from our engagement with the troika that they regarded NAMA's commitment to redeem 25% of its senior debt by the end of 2013 as a major milestone that had to be achieved if Ireland was to successfully exit the programme.  Furthermore, it was unacceptable to us, and I expect that it would have been unacceptable to the Government and to members of the Oireachtas, that NAMA debtors should enjoy long debt repayment holidays at a time when almost 100,000 personal borrowers with distressed mortgages, and indeed many others who were making huge personal sacrifices, were being placed under pressure to make their monthly debt repayments.  Many of these personal debtors lost their jobs or had their incomes cut.  Many may certainly legitimately feel that they bear no responsibility for the financial and property crisis that engulfed this country.<\/p><p> NAMA is still working consensually with 70%, by value, of its debtors.  I will not suggest that all of these engagements are amicable; there has to be an inherent tension and robustness in a situation where NAMA is seeking to optimise the ultimate return for the Irish taxpayer and debtors want to optimise their own position.  Some will look to repay as little as possible; in fairness, others will seek to repay to their full capacity.  Needless to say, in those cases where it emerged that illegal attempts were made to put assets beyond our reach, we had to take appropriate action in the courts.  That would certainly have coloured our view of the claims made by certain debtors that they were willing to work with us to maximise the ultimate return for the Irish taxpayer.<\/p><p>We have recovered more than &euro;800 million from these debtors.<\/p><p> It should be clear to everyone at this stage that NAMA debtors do not consider NAMA to be a cosy bailout.  We make no apology for being rigorous, professional and fair.  It has been suggested recently that NAMA staff lack the requisite experience in finance and property.  That is untrue.  From the outset of its operation, NAMA, through the NTMA, recruited staff with a diverse range of skills and experience in disciplines, including banking, finance, law, insolvency, property development, asset management, architecture, engineering, surveying, planning and construction.  Indeed, an important rationale for the establishment of a single asset management entity in Ireland was the requirement for specialist skills, particularly specialist real estate skills, which had not been available in the banks responsible for the pre-crash lending.<\/p><p> We do not expect to receive eulogies from our debtors, but more objective commentators, such as the IMF, EU, ECB, World Bank, credit rating agencies, the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and many of the witnesses before the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis, have all stated that they considered that NAMA was carrying out its mandate successfully.<\/p><p> I commend the professional staff who work in NAMA and the NAMA board.  They have a difficult job to do in often difficult circumstances and they perform it to the best of their abilities in the interest of taxpayers.  I thank the committee for its time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McDonagh.

What becomes evident from the minutes is that there was a full discussion of Project Eagle.  I am sure that Mr. Daly is familiar with these minutes.  The sales process was discussed.  Mr. Daly provided an outline of that.  The approach from Pimco was discussed in some detail.  The discussion included external member feedback on the proposed approach.  Mr. Daly sought that approach and wanted it for a subsequent meeting on 10 October.  According to these minutes, Mr. Daly reminded members that this matter was politically sensitive and that absolute confidentiality was required.  This is just a sketch of what transpired at the meeting, but it does not read like the substance of a meeting at which members of the Northern committee were precluded from confidential NAMA information.

Brian Rowntree, the other advisory committee external member, was chairman of the housing executive so he had made a room available to us there.  When Mr. Rowntree resigned from that post, the NIHE was no longer available to us so Mr. Cushnahan said, \"I will get you a room in Tughans\", and we accepted.

The total cost that we paid to Tughans since the inception of NAMA is &euro;223,000 and that is for work in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#R00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":301,"content":"<p>The difficulty arises, Mr. Daly-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#R00200","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443690000,"counter":302,"content":"<p>And-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":303,"content":"<p>As Mr. Daly well knows, a member of his advisory committee - Mr. Daly is in charge of this operation, as is the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan in his role in the Government-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#R00400","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443690000,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Well, sorry, there is a board of NAMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Yes, and Mr. Daly is the chairman.

I will keep an eye on the clock, Cathaoirleach.  <\/p> <p>  The well managed competitive process involved the first preferred bidder, PIMCO, with Mr. Cushnahan in tow, being excluded from the process because PIMCO came forward, let us give it credit for it, to blow the whistle and to tell NAMA that there was funny business going on and there were requests for \"payola\", to use that term.

Cerberus, who finally succeeded in this regard, has surprise, surprise, the same cast of characters around it - Brown Rudnick, Tughans, etc. - advising it.

All of threads sort of come together.<\/p> <p>  Let us take it from the point at which NAMA decided.  It came to Mr. Daly's attention that there were difficulties with PIMCO, not least because of Mr. Cushnahan said they need to be excluded.  Mr. Daly communicated that to the Minister.  Mr. Daly has told us that he took the view that NAMA should motor on and the Minister agreed.  That was a crazy decision but none the less it is the decision that Mr. Daly took.  Mr Daly said thereafter that there was what he called a \"competitive tension\" that remained in the process.

Perhaps Mr. McDonagh might clarify that.  He referred to 6,500, and that 4,500 were refused.  If that is the case, it is an incredible statistic.  Mr. McDonagh might indicate how many local authorities were involved.  He might indicate how many were sites and how many were units of accommodation, and whether there was planning granted for these units.  In the middle of a housing crisis when Dublin City Council is looking for 20 sites on which to place modular housing to get some units in place before Christmas, I am amazed that a local authority would refuse any offer of a site.  Was it that NAMA was putting an exorbitant price on these units?  Was NAMA simply giving them back?  In the present circumstances with the shortage of housing, with the shortage accommodation and with people homeless, how could the local authorities have refused all of that?  Mr. McDonagh might clarify that for us and then indicate how many units still remain.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McDonagh indicated in his original contribution that 11,000 units had already been made available.  As he put it, \"We have sold to a range of private sector buyers sites that could potentially deliver over 11,000 units\".  Does that include the units that the local authorities have refused?  He further states, \"only 900 units have been completed or are under construction\".  If the local authorities declined to accept the units, why sell them on the open market when the construction sector is simply not building?  The sector has only built 900 to date.  Over what period of time are we referring to?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#Y00200","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443690000,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.

A resolution has to be found because the people living there are deeply affected by these problems.  Nobody should be put at risk in this day and age in my view.

When the other six were gone and when PIMCO pulled out or NAMA let it be known to PIMCO that is should pull out, we were down to two.  Considering that Fortress has made an underbid to the reserve, and had made that clear at a relatively early stage, as I understand, was it prudent to press ahead with the sale even though it reached the reserve by just &pound;1.241 million?  In those circumstances, there could be a question mark as to whether this was a prudent move, considering all the circumstances and the reason NAMA had to get a commitment by Cerberus that it had not paid any fees and so on and that it had indicated that might compromise the situation.

We have moved away from a bargain basement market in Ireland where it was very hard to attract any investors.  Clearly, NAMA has been successful in the recovery that has taken place.  There is no doubt about the fact that it has given a base to the market through the property which has attracted foreign investment.  Is it not the right time to do a complete review of NAMA's operations in the context of going forward on the basis of what it is doing in the docklands, which is a special development zone, where it is jointly involved with the developers and where there is planning for the future as distinct from simply an issue of the sale of properties?  NAMA owns 75% of the debt that is there and there should be long-term investment and long-term engagement by NAMA rather than to simply dispose of property as has largely been the approach to date.

Unless that is done, there will still be a very serious contingent liability on the backs of Irish taxpayers, even after the repayment today of another &euro;1.75 billion and the fact that there is now approximately &euro;9 billion left of senior debt.  That is an extraordinary performance because if we had been in here three or four years ago or even less where we had paid off &euro;21 billion with &euro;9 billion left, people would have laughed at us had we predicted anything like that.  The reality would have been that we would have been lucky to have had &euro;9 billion paid off and only &euro;21 billion left.  We have actually reversed it.  I believe, and I think the Minister also believes, that the key objective of repaying all of that debt should not be compromised for all of the reasons outlined in the chief executive's statement.  There are bigger issues there for Ireland about our credibility in the markets and with rating agencies and with access to finance.<\/p> <p>  The other two strands we are involved in very firmly include the SDZ.  Nobody is saying that NAMA will shut up shop in a year or two and abandon the SDZ.  We have always indicated that however long that takes, we will be involved in it.  It is similarly the case with residential development.  We are committed to 4,500 houses at the end of next year and the social housing we talked about earlier.  We are doing a great deal of work on planning and infrastructure issues around housing.  There will be a long-term deliverable from NAMA in relation to that whether it be in planning, infrastructure or whatever.  We will stay there for as long as that takes.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's other issue is whether we should suddenly slow down and stop selling, which is what I presume he means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#AA01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Well, not just to move-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#AA01400","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443690000,"counter":516,"content":"<p>If we do that, it will undoubtedly compromise our capacity to repay our debt and to be involved in housing and the SDZ.

Nobody is suggesting it has been involved, or complicit, in anything like that.  It is important for people to realise that.  What is significant about what Mr. Daly has been saying here today, however, is that it may well have been utterly incompetent in what happened and got a very bad deal as a result of swimming with sharks or, possibly, due to naivety or incompetence.  It appears that something is very badly wrong with this particular episode and that NAMA has certainly had an important role to play in it.  That is where I differ with the witnesses so strongly about NAMA going to Northern Ireland.  The excuse that NAMA is publicly accountable to us, which is absolutely true, does not merit its refusal to co-operate fully with the inquiry being carried out by the Northern Ireland finance committee.<\/p><p>Could Mr. Daly explain to us why he is prepared to give written, and not verbal, replies?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#AA01700","speaker":"953","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443690000,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the acknowledgement at the beginning of his intervention that there is no suggestion of any malfeasance by NAMA.

The Deputy said we had refused to co-operate fully with the Northern Ireland committee.  We certainly have not refused to co-operate.  The issue is around whether we go to the Northern Ireland finance committee in Stormont and present ourselves there as witnesses.  While I do not want to go back over old ground, our view is that we present ourselves here to the members of this committee as witnesses.  There has never been any suggestion that we are not accountable to this committee, although that has been said in the D&aacute;il, which was wrong; we are accountable to the committee.  There has never been any suggestion that the questioning that happens in the committee is not rigorous enough to get from NAMA any information it wants.<\/p> <p>  We have co-operated extensively with the committee in Northern Ireland.

We told our executives to return to PIMCO and indicate that, in the circumstances, we did not believe it could continue in the process and either they should leave the process or we would take steps to ensure they were not entertained any further.

There was great sensitivity actually around that.  During discussions with the then Minister, Mr. Lenihan, in 2009, it was agreed that part of the response to this would be to create a Northern Ireland advisory committee with no decision-making powers, but which would advise the NAMA board on broad strategic issues around Northern Ireland.

When I was here in July I told the committee that I had briefed the Northern Ireland committee in October 2013 that there had been an expression of interest from PIMCO.  That was all.  So that was the first indication we had.  After a period of a couple years of almost stagnation where there was very little interest in the Northern Ireland assets or very little interest, by the way, in somebody from Northern Ireland coming to us and proposing that we might invest or do this, that and the other.<\/p> <p>  Then one gets an indication that there is.  Here is a very credible international investment fund that is interested.  Of course we looked at it and we assessed it, and decided - against the wishes of PIMCO by the way - that we would go for an open-market transparent process, and that is what we did.  Initially we decided, I think, at a board meeting in October that we would pursue the thing with PIMCO and see how seriously they are interested - is this a try-on?  Then when we determined that they were, we decided to go with an open-market process.  In the December 2013 board meeting we decided to go with the open-marketed process.  In January we appointed Lazard as the loan sales broker, which is what we would do.  It is quite normal in a lot of large portfolio sales.  That was the process.<\/p> <p>  We did, obviously, look at whether there were other options.  What would the other options be?  Sell it in smaller lots; sell each asset; wait in Northern Ireland until 2020 or whatever.  What was the opportunity cost of that?  I mentioned that to Deputy Costello.  The opportunity cost is we were going to be tied up in those individual assets - not great assets in an economy that was, at the time, pretty stagnant - there was no great interest in them - with greater opportunities elsewhere for NAMA to manage its assets and invest in its assets; opportunities here and opportunities in London.  All of that was taken into account in the decision to pursue a single sale with a reserve price, which was the one we calculated was the minimum value we would take for this and which was reached in the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#CC02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Daly to enlighten me on reserve prices.

I am even astonished by the assertion made by Deputy Ross regarding integrity and his assertion that the taxpayer did not get a deal.  I think NAMA has been extraordinarily successful, even this week with the sale of Project Jewel.  The stabilisation of and the level of growth in the economy would be quite different without this.  People are always looking at issues retrospectively, but when we look at the portfolio of properties in Northern Ireland and their location, we know there would be another question asked here today if those properties had not been sold.<\/p> <p>  The point has not been made clear here in regard to section 172 of the National Asset Management Agency Act.  Deputy Ross is very much aware that this legislation embodies protocols regarding the sale of assets.  We should consider the job opportunities, the redevelopment of the Docklands, the return from sales and the bond redemption.  Could Mr. Daly explain what has been achieved?  I believe what NAMA has achieved is extraordinary.  I have been in the Oireachtas a long number of years and was here at the time of NAMA's formation under the former Minister, Brian Lenihan.  We should look now at the return to the Exchequer and the profit that was projected by 2018.  It is very easy to evaluate property now, but nobody knew the value in 2008 and 2009 when these were all unsecured bad debts.  <\/p> <p>  It is very easy to cherry-pick, or for Deputy Wallace to come in and cherry-pick a property that might double its value, but he is not looking at the properties that might be getting a 5% gain.  Will Mr. Daly give us a run through of the aggregate?  It is more about the net profit overall rather than the amount of profit on every item.  We have to take into account the whole bag of the mixed portfolio that was handed over to NAMA.  I am very disappointed by the unfounded allegations made by a Deputy who is not prepared to attend any committee as a witness but who could throw out a statement that, seemingly, Sinn F&eacute;in wants to use as a political statement in the Northern Ireland Executive.  It does not surprise me that many of the institutions of the North are not fully functioning with Sinn F&eacute;in's style of operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#EE02400","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443690000,"counter":682,"content":"<p>I do not think I will get into the political debate, North or South, on this.<\/p> <p>  On the overall figures, the CEO is probably better placed to deal with this, as he outlined in his statement this morning.<\/p><p>Today we have the extraordinary situation in which we have repaid &euro;21 billion and there is just over &euro;9 billion left of debt.  A few years ago, if we were before the committee we would have felt lucky to be able to say &euro;9 billion had been paid and only &euro;20 billion or &euro;21 billion was left.  The situation has been totally reversed.<\/p><p> The docklands investment by NAMA will certainly be well over &euro;1 billion and probably between &euro;1 billion and &euro;2 billion over a period of years.  The investment by NAMA in housing will be in the billions as well and all of that is facilitated by good and clever management of assets and cash generation.  Members referenced Project Jewel and we got a very good price for that.  We would not have got as good a price if, during the process of managing that asset, some of the very bright people in NAMA had not suggested to the board that it needed to tidy up the loan, the asset, because there were loans within the portfolio held by KBC and Ulster Bank and it would, therefore, be a good move by NAMA to buy them out so that NAMA held the whole portfolio.  <\/p><p> There were other clever asset management activities during the period so that when we put a portfolio on the market it was clean, intact and easy for investment houses to understand.  That happens all the time in NAMA, in big portfolios, small portfolios and assets and it is something we should highlight a bit more.  I do not know if the CEO wishes to come in on that but that is where we are.  All of the portfolio sales, including Project Eagle, from which we got &euro;1.3 billion, have contributed to the developments and the investments and to the bond repayment NAMA has been able to make.

NAMA has reasonably sold its loans as a job lot in order to do a deal and to get its cheque within a short timeframe.  Let us be honest, people buy them for a return on their investment.  The consolidation of NAMA's role by Lazard has been skipped over.  It provided an independent valuation and due diligence on the properties and, while people can say a firm may have doubled its money on a property, many would not be sold otherwise.<\/p> <p>  It is regrettable that alarmist reports have emanated without foundation.  This damages Ireland.  We are a country with the biggest property conglomerate in the world, with a huge portfolio of property in Ireland, the UK and the US.  With section 172 in place, where would one find the people with the capacity to do these deals?  The integrity of the board, which includes a former chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, is being brought into question by some remarks made today but I am not impressed with them at all because the figures speak for themselves.  NAMA has sold difficult properties in bad locations without title but NAMA and Ireland Inc. are damaged by unfounded allegations against the board, whatever it does in Northern Ireland.  If somebody is selling a product that person is not responsible for the purchaser or if they are it is something new that I do not understand.

I think NAMA played no small part in this because of its strategic decisions around investment and divestment in the Irish market.

The answer is, as has been alluded to by Deputy Perry, because of section 172.  We cannot do it.  We are not allowed to do it.  I presume Deputy Wallace knows that.  He is a Member of the Legislature that deals with the National Asset Management Agency Act and that is in the Act.  Those are the type of allegations that are damaging and they are totally without foundation.  The most recent allegation is that &euro;45 million has been paid as fixer fees.

He will understand when I make clear what I am coming at.  When NAMA was being set up, approximately &euro;70 billion of loans were transferred to it at whatever figure.  There was approximately 50% of a discount, and there were different levels of discounts depending on the particular bank.  From recollection, and Mr. McDonagh will appreciate I have not looked at this recently, NAMA had a much bigger write-down in respect of the Anglo Irish Bank loans.  They came at a bigger discount whereas the Bank of Ireland loans that came to NAMA were probably a little better.  Of the loans transferred to NAMA, the taxpayer knows the banks from which they came.  It is only right at the end of the process, and Mr. McDonagh said NAMA is nearly there, or at least 70% there, that we would like to know the outcome with regard to those.  Mr. McDonagh is saying that in his handling of it he could have had a debtor who had loans across the institutions.  That is fine, but I am putting Mr. McDonagh on notice, in the interest of accountability and transparency, that we would like to see the outcome in terms of the way those loans of financial institutions actually worked at the end of the day because that will tell us how much Anglo Irish Bank, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB or whoever cost us.<\/p> <p>  However, if Mr. McDonagh is telling us that at the end of that process the loans NAMA took in from Anglo, for example, book debts of &euro;20 billion, we need to know at the end of NAMA's work what we got back out of that &euro;20 billion.  Did we get &euro;25 billion or &euro;12 billion?  Mr. McDonagh seems to be telling me now that in terms of that line of accountability and traceability with regard to what happened the biggest financial institution and property management company in the State, it is possible we might lose that.  I am saying we cannot lose it.  The Irish taxpayer will want to know that final breakdown.  We know what we gave NAMA.  The Irish taxpayers know the write-down in terms of what went in.  They are entitled to know what came out at the bottom end for those relevant institutions.

I note this committee co-operated with the Public Accounts Committee in Northern Ireland on another issue and in that regard, I found that to be highly beneficial to the whole process of understanding where the money went, how it all functioned and so on.  It was a worthwhile exercise for this committee and it showed how the two different jurisdictions can function well in the interests of the taxpayer.  I am of the view that I believe NAMA's representatives should attend the Northern committee.  The witnesses have heard that echoed around this meeting room today and I encourage NAMA to reconsider its position.  I do not see what it has to lose and can only view what is to be gained by NAMA's attendance, even in respect of the optics of so doing, which is important.  Mention again was made about damage to NAMA, perception and all the rest.  Sometimes, the little things one does or does not do cause more harm and in this instance, I consider that to be a minor detail in terms of how NAMA presents what story it has to tell.  It is like its appearance here today, some members thought NAMA was under attack or whatever.  I look at it differently and perceive its attendance here today to be an opportunity for NAMA to clarify all the issues that have been raised and to deal with the public concern that exists.  That exchange within this Parliament is hugely positive and equally, in acknowledging the Northern Ireland Assembly and what it is attempting to do, it would be equally as important for NAMA to attend there.  It would remove the perception down here there must be something odd going on in NAMA if it did not follow through to another Government committee or committee of the Assembly in Northern Ireland.

I wish to ask the witnesses about Project Eagle.  It is an important question because of what has happened since regarding the reputation of NAMA and the potential damage to public trust in NAMA as this matter has continued.  Mr. Daly has made clear that when the agency found out that Mr. Cushnahan was to have taken a fee, it stepped in quickly, I think Mr. Daly said within a day and a half, and it considered the exit of PIMCO and consulted Lazards.  I take it from this that Mr. Daly felt that the integrity of NAMA's process was still intact and that it should continue.  In hindsight, was that a bad decision and has that caused damage to NAMA, to NAMA's reputation and how the agency is perceived?  Mr. Daly himself talked about Cicero's quote, \"who benefits?\", and about the people who tried to damage NAMA by leaking information such as failed bidders or underbidders.  However, it is not only people who leak information to damage NAMA who are involved in this regard; it also is NAMA's decision-making process and this must be thought about.  Should NAMA have considered this in greater depth at the time?  Did NAMA discuss it sufficiently?  Should it have stepped out of this process?  Having given some thought to that question at this point, one journalist framed this issue by suggesting NAMA has lost the narrative and there may be some truth to that.  However, it stems from the decision made to continue with the process after NAMA found out the individual in question was taking a fee.  Consequently, it comes back to Mr. Daly and the decisions he has made or rather, not him personally but the decisions NAMA's board has made.  Was that a mistake and in hindsight, was its correct to proceed with this or should NAMA have stopped the process when it had the chance?  Have the witnesses considered this point in the interim?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#NN02700","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1443690000,"counter":924,"content":"<p>First, we always consider these things at the time and we continue to consider them.  There has been a lot of consideration of this issue in NAMA.  The damage, if there is damage, has been driven quite a bit by the conflation of issues that have emerged after the sale with the actual sale process itself.  There has been huge conflation of issues in this regard and if the Deputy considers what the Northern committee is investigating, it by and large is focused on issues that arose after the sale on the purchase or the buying side.  Once the word \"NAMA\" is mentioned anywhere in a narrative, certainly down here, the message or narrative gets a little garbled and misunderstood.  I accept that point.  As to whether damage has been done to NAMA, there are different constituencies out there.  As for NAMA's standing with the investor community, the markets, the rating agencies or with many of those people who think through these things and look behind the headlines, I do not believe NAMA's reputation has been damaged and I do not think it has in any way compromised our capacity and ability to do our job.  I do not wish to go back over the entire narrative or discussion on the decision-making process at the time.<\/p><p>It was not something we did not consider - whether we should just abort the sale.  We weighed up the pros and cons and, in essence, we still had two competitive bidders in there for this.  We had exited the one of which we thought there would be reputational or perceptional damage if it had continued.  We still got our reserve price.  We still believe we got a very good deal on this.<\/p><p> We always would examine our decisions both with hindsight and at the time.  One thing we did learn from this, and one change we have made, is that we now always ask for a declaration from whoever is buying any portfolio that there is no success fee or any money payable to anybody connected with NAMA.  We pitch that very widely, whether it be a board member, an advisory committee member or a member of the executive or staff.  We get declarations from them.<\/p><p> I do not think I mentioned that this morning, although it has been mentioned before, that when Cerberus bought the Northern Ireland portfolio, it gave us such a declaration because we insisted on that after the PIMCO issue.  Cerberus has assured us then and since, in terms of any payments it made as a result of the Project Eagle sale, that it stands over those payments as being legitimate and that it is not in any way in contravention of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the states, which is something it takes very seriously as a US-based company.  Cerberus stands over that very strongly to this day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015100100002#NN02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1443690000,"counter":926,"content":"<p>I have to ask Mr. Daly one very small, constituent question while he is here.
