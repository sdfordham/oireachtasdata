It is something that the Minister for Finance will keep under close consideration but it is based on the consultation process.  We have engaged with stakeholders in regard to the benefit of SARP to the Irish economy.  It was not something introduced simply for the sake of doing so, rather it has been introduced to attract people with specific employment skills and people who may not otherwise come to the State.  The Minister is cognisant of the consultation process which suggested that a removal of the upper limit could attract more people and, therefore, it is something we are going to try out in this Finance Bill.

What SARP allows for at this time is for an upper limit of &euro;0.5 million.  For employees who earn up to &euro;0.5 million, 30% of their income can be written off for taxation purposes and the lower limit is &euro;75,000.  Currently, the available amount of income is &euro;425,000 but the Government suggests that could increase to &euro;1 million, &euro;1.5 million or &euro;2 million - there is no limit in terms of what portion of one's income can be written off for tax purposes.  There would be a loss of tax revenue in regard to this provision.  Given the low level take up of SARP, from where is the demand coming?  The take up of it has been tiny even though it has been in operation for a number of years and is a hugely generous package covering not only income tax, but flights back to one's mother country and children's private education which can be claimed against one's income tax.  Are people earning &euro;1 million saying they need us to be more generous, that allowing them to have 30% of the &euro;425,000 exempted from tax is not enough and that they want us to allow the whole &euro;925,000 to included for this calculation?  Is there that type of demand?  I suggest there is not, given the low level of uptake of SARP.  If there is that demand, I assume it is coming from one or two individuals.<\/p><p>  We have a few pages dealing with these amendments in respect of these very highly paid individuals.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, talked about the squeezed middle Ireland yesterday but these people are not squeezed.  The Minister is legislating for people who are coming to this State and earning above &euro;0.5 million but no Irish person can avail of this measure.  This is a hugely generous package which allows such individuals to write hundreds of thousands of euro off their tax bill.  I understand the priorities of the Government are to reward the most wealthy in society.  There is clearly a way of doing that.  Why is this being done?  From where is the demand coming?  Why does the Minister of State believe that at a time when there is a massive crisis across the board in certain areas that people who earn above &euro;0.5 million should get more of their tax written off than any other person who earns below that level right down to the level of the minimum wage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900003#B01100","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1416391200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>The Deputy has raised a number of points.  First, it is not the priority of the Government to reward the better off, but I am sure that is a debate we will continue to have during the consideration of this Finance Bill and it is one the Deputy had with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, last night.  I do not accept that there is a loss of tax revenue to the State from this measure.  The Deputy is correct that these are high paid individuals, but they are also very mobile.  They can decide where they wish to locate.  That is an issue that is mentioned when we talk to the IDA about trying to attract some of the most senior managers into the country.  We want to get senior managers and executives to come here which will create more jobs and help the people the Minister, Deputy Noonan, spoke about when he used the phrase the \"squeezed middle\".<\/p><p>  I will give the Deputy an example.  If somebody on a salary of &euro;500,000 decides to locate here under the new regime, they will have an effective tax rate of 35.37%.  They will end up paying &euro;177,000 in taxes that we would not otherwise get.  I would take the Deputy's point if he was presuming those people are here anyway, but considering the SARP is trying to attract people here who are mobile, who can choose to go to other countries, they would not necessarily come here otherwise.  The SARP is trying to attract high paid individuals to come here.  The State can benefit from the tax revenue they pay here that they would not otherwise pay.  This is something IDA Ireland and such bodies note when they try to attract talent into the country.  We want to help the IDA convert its strong pipeline of potential investments into a reality.  I think that is something to which we can all subscribe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900003#B01200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416391200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>The Minister of State gave effective tax rate figures.

I must bring the Deputy back to the point that we are comparing apples and oranges here because these people are not necessarily people who are in Ireland and the Government is saying to them that it will give them a tax break.

The issue of jobs and job creation underpins all these measures and is only justifiable if there is a clear and tangible link between the executive coming to Ireland and job creation.  This was the original intention of SARP.  It is not a measure with which anyone is terribly comfortable but if it provides a greater economic gain for the country, then it can be justified.

Budget 2015 was the first step in an attempt to alleviate some of those burdens.  This relief is an attempt to attract key decision-makers into boardrooms in Ireland.  Let us be realistic.  There are massive companies with headquarters in various parts of the world with key crucial and influential personnel sitting in their boardrooms.  This country must make a decision as to whether we want to attract those people to come here.  They are very mobile, and they are not paying any tax in Ireland because they are not living here.  If we can get them to come here, they will be paying tax, albeit less tax than they would be paying without SARP, but I contend they would not be here without SARP.  In addition and much more important than the tax contribution they make to the State, they are bringing influence to Dublin, to Cork, to Ireland.  They are bringing decision-making capacity to this country and they have the opportunity to see what this country has to offer in terms of locating a new product or a new element of their business.  <\/p><p> Deputy McGrath asked what other countries have such schemes and how these schemes operate.  I have information on the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Luxembourg and Switzerland.  I can provide the Deputy with that information if he wishes.  The report is available on the Department's website.  The Netherlands has a scheme commonly known as the 30% rule.<\/p> <p>This scheme provides an exemption from tax on 30% of the salary for up to ten years for qualifying assignees.  France provides a special exemption scheme for expatriates who have not been tax resident in France for the previous five years.  The scheme is available for a maximum of five years and exemptions are capped at 50%.  Switzerland has quite a complex tax system.  Its tax is charged at federal and canton level.  While each of its 26 cantons has its own tax rates, local tax rates can be negotiated individually and principally for companies as cantons compete with each other to attract multinationals and individuals.  There is no national rule in Switzerland.  However, most cantons give assignees some level of preferred tax treatment.<\/p><p> In terms of what these changes will cost, the Government does not have a specific target for the number of people who will avail of the relief.  It is not possible to anticipate accurately how many will do so.  The IDA and others promoting Ireland around the world and trying to attract key decision-makers here, some of whom I had an opportunity to meet when in London last week, are the people looking for such measures to be put in place.  <\/p><p> Deputies Michael McGrath, Richard Boyd Barrett, Pearse Doherty and Brian Walsh asked about loss of tax.  I dispute the way that is presented because I would contend that these individuals are not coming here for SARP.  On the number of employees, we do not have the 2013 confirmed figures.  However, I can give the provisional figures.  The number of employees who availed of the scheme in 2013 is 36; the number of employers with employees availing of the scheme in Ireland is 31; the amount of income in respect of which tax was not deducted is &euro;46,276; the amount of tax forgone is &euro;18,973; and the total figure in respect of the amount of tax forgone in 2012 is &euro;111,721.60.  The provisional figure for 2013 in respect of the number of jobs created and retained is 25 and 4, respectively.  While this is about jobs and individual job numbers, it is also about having the capacity in Ireland for it to be considered as a location for further expansion.  The international financial services companies based here want people, when making a decision about expansion or a new product, to consider locating here.  <\/p><p> This scheme is time limited.  Also, it is important to point out that there is no exemption in relation to USC or PRSI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900004#C03000","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416392400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>In regard to the scheme as currently constructed, will IDA Ireland advise if it is not working efficiently?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900005#D00200","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1416392400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>There was a consultation process, the report of which is on the Department of Finance's website.

The latter change was made to align the changes made in the Employment Permits (Amendment) Act 2014 published by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The Act provides for a new category of employment permit, an intra-company transfer employment permit, which allows for the temporary transfer of employees between affiliated foreign and Irish companies.  Under the terms of this permit, an employee must have been employed by the employer for a minimum of six months.

Is there documentation to show that the Government believed that each of these individuals would create jobs?  The tax relief is very generous and what may have convinced the Government to introduce such a generous scheme for people overseas to come to Ireland and have their tax bill written down is that they may have been sold the idea that each one of these individuals would created 50 jobs.  I assume that is the case.  I assume the T&aacute;naiste did not take to the floor of the D&aacute;il in 2012 and deliberately mislead the D&aacute;il.  The point I am putting to the Minister of State is that the rationale for introducing such a scheme - which has been enhanced in this Finance Bill, by removing the upper limit of &euro;500,000 - has not fulfilled its stated intention to create jobs.  The original form that had to be provided has to include the number of jobs generated.  There is no actual supervision in regard to that but it is pitiful what has been generated as a result of this tax relief.  This relief has cost thousands of euro yet 25 jobs have been created.

There is a jobs benefit in terms of attracting these people and every job that is created is to be welcomed.  I have given members the figures.  The creation of 25 jobs is not something to be sneered at, but it is about getting the key decision makers into Ireland.  These people are highly mobile and very well paid, but not by the taxpayer, and it is about getting them to locate in Ireland rather than them going to the Netherlands, France, Luxembourg, Switzerland or London, which I visited last week.  We are in a very competitive environment.  I have responsibility for the IFSC and our rankings in the IFSC have fallen through the floor.  What has been a great success since 1987 clearly now needs a shake-up and a review.  We are putting in place a new international financial services strategy.<\/p><p>  This relief is not open-ended.  It was originally for a period of three years and after the review that was carried out and published on the Department's website, it has now been extended for another three years.  It is too early to say what will happen.  It has only been announced that the Government is extending it for another three years, who knows what will happen into the future.  Government has a very open mind on it.  I personally have a very open mind on it.  I know the Minister for Finance has an open mind on it.  We need to see the tangible results.  The Deputy is correct that we need to look at other metrics for measuring its success and that is something I will be doing in the context of the new financial services strategy. <\/p><p>  I see the point that Deputy Doherty is making.  We are coming at it from a different perspective.  I do not see this as lost revenue to the State.  I see it as additional revenue to the State, so does the Government, so does the Minister for Finance.  I listen to the people from the IDA.  When I am sick, I may have an idea of what is wrong with me but I go to a doctor.  When I want to know what it takes to attract new jobs, I might have a few suggestions but I listen to the experts.  The IDA, the Global Irish Economic Forum and the wider consultation process is all pointing that we should look at this as an initiative to keep our competitiveness.  In response to Deputy McGrath, I have listed examples of what other countries are doing.  That is not to say that the Government is not keeping an open mind.  I do not see what we have to lose by trying this for another three years in an enhanced way based on the suggestions from the consultation we have undertaken.  I believe it is worth a try.<\/p><p>  Deputy Doherty alluded to the 25 jobs to which I had referred, there was 25 jobs created in 2013 on the provisional figures.  The amount of tax foregone was &euro;18,973.16.  It is not an insignificant development for 25 jobs to be created with a further potential to have decision-makers based in Ireland.  I will keep a watching eye on it.  The Minister for Finance is definitely going to retain it.

It seems to be a measure to impose penalties on principal contractors who make payments to subcontractors where those subcontractors, or the principal contractors themselves, are not fully tax compliant.  I very much welcome the measure.<\/p><p>  This morning I was up very early, at 5.30 a.m. I was on a picket line in Lucan because a number of bricklayers are picketing a site where a school is being constructed by a principal and large contractor.  The bricklayers allege, and some of the stories are quite hair-raising, that across the construction industry the business model being pursued is one where principal contractors are knowingly engaged in situations where payments are being made to people who are purportedly subcontractors but in fact are not subcontractors at all.  The allegations need to be investigated.  Some of the allegations are hair-raising and there are claims people have been told to meet in pubs where they were handed brown envelopes stuffed full of cash but no proper payslips and Revenue documentation were involved.  There are allegations of people who sign on in the North coming across the Border to get paid cash for work done here.  If any of these allegations are true then the situation is very serious.  Building workers in the industry have made the allegation that such things are happening all over the place.  They argue that it is now the business model of some of the biggest contractors in the country and is the reason they are able to submit lower bids for public contracts.  If the allegations are even close to the truth then the situation is very serious.  <\/p><p>  It is against that background that I welcome the amendment which stipulates there should be penalties imposed if money is handed from a principal contractor to a subcontractor where there is not full compliance.  What exactly is happening?  How is compliance established?  What is the criteria around compliance?  Something can look okay on paper but in reality can be easy to get around.  I want the Minister of State to convince me that the legislation will do the job that it seems to set out to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900008#G01300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1416394200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>For three years I have tried to convince the Deputy to agree with me on an issue so let us give it a go.  Much of what the Deputy referenced relates more to the Construction Contracts Act than to the tax side and, therefore, it would be important to get that Act implemented.  Responsibility for the Construction Contracts Act has been given to the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Gerald Nash.  It is hoped to have the legislation activated by next year and that is the appropriate route to take.  In terms of the need to examine public contracts, we are carrying out a review of public contracts at the moment.  I have responsibility for it as it comes under the remit of the Office for Government Procurement.<br\/>On the broader issue of the potential difficulties posed by public contracts, I would very much like to receive correspondence from the Deputy on the matter and I shall get back to him about it.  It would be useful for me to read out the speaking note as the section is quite technical.  This is essentially a technical change to address two issues.  First, to remove any suggestion that it is possible for a payment to be taxed twice and second, to ensure that penalties are proportionate. <br\/>Where a principal contractor has failed to operate the relevant contracts tax, section 530F(3)(<i>a<\/i>) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that where the principal submits details of the relevant payment, and submits to Revenue any further information required such as a contract notification, Revenue will then establish the amount of tax which would have been due from the principal in respect of the payment using the subcontractors deduction rate and this will then become the tax due from the principal.  I told the Deputy that this was a technical provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900008#G01400","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416394200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I am chewing the cud.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900008#G01500","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1416394200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>This is the joy of tax.  Where a withholding tax should have applied to the payment, this is not available as a credit to the subcontractor as the subcontractor received the payment in full without the operation of the relevant contracts tax but the principal is liable for the RCT which should have been deducted from the payment.  In addition, the principal contractor is liable to a penalty of 35% of the tax that should have been deducted or &euro;5,000, whichever is lesser.<\/p><p>  In seeking to enforce the withholding rate in appropriate cases, Revenue compliance officers are being requested to review the tax affairs of subcontractors.  Where accounts and returns are belatedly filed by a subcontractor and tax paid, it is stated that there is no loss to Revenue in these circumstances.  Therefore, it is argued that Revenue should not be seeking this additional tax, in other words, from the principal contractor.  Section 15 amends this section so that the penalty for the non-operation of the RCT is set at a level to ensure that the Exchequer is protected and that the penalty is also proportionate and reasonable.  Also, in moving to this different civil penalty regime arguments as to whether the same income is doubly taxed are avoided.<\/p><p>  We want to be very clear that tax has to be paid but if a tax is not paid then there is also going to be a penalty.  Without this amendment that matter was unclear and it looked, potentially, like the same person was being taxed twice.  That is not the case.  There is the tax the person owes and then there is the penalty the person must pay for having failed to comply with the RCT in the first place.<\/p> <p>It is proposed that the new regime would reflect the level of risk associated with the incorrect operation of the RCT by a principal contractor by reference to the deduction rate applicable to a sub-contractor when the payment was made.  A higher penalty will be applicable in the case of a contractor where the sub-contractor was deemed to have a higher level of risk, and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Effectively, we are bringing in a sliding scale.  For instance, at one end of the scale where the sub-contractor to whom the payment was made is not known to Revenue a civil penalty of 35% of the relevant payment shall be applied to the contractor and there will be no mitigation of this penalty.  At the other end, where the sub-contractor is registered with Revenue and is liable for the RCT deduction rate of zero, a civil penalty of 3% of the relevant payment shall be applied, and Revenue will provide guidelines allowing for a mitigation to a zero rate.  <br\/>This is about clarity, control and recognising some of what the Deputy alluded to, without me getting into the specifics, namely, that there must be clarity in terms of sub-contractors' and contractors' tax liabilities.  This is basically saying that if someone is a compliant sub-contractor with their contractor there will be a sliding scale for offences.  If they are not complying there will be a higher level of penalty, and there is no such thing as double tax.  It is a penalty plus the original amount of tax.  I have tried to make that as clear as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900008#G01600","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416394800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I got some of that but I will have to study carefully what the Minister said and pass it on to people who are dealing with it at the coalface.

In effect, they are being employed by the principal contractor but the principal contractor does not want to admit he or she is employing them and pushes them into being categorised as sub-contractors when they are not.  That is the contention.  How is the Department of Finance dealing with that or has the Minister of State any thoughts on how this problem could be dealt with?  The workers are saying that if anybody seriously looked into the individuals who are being categorised as a sub-contractor under the RCT1 system, Revenue would very quickly discover that those people do not fit the criteria of being sub-contractors.

What prompted the Minister to include it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900009#H01400","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1416394800,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Revenue will not be seeking recourse to the individual who made a donation in good faith.  I am happy to clarify that.  It is not a case that if one made a donation to a charity, presuming it was still a charity, Revenue will come knocking on one's door.  That is not the case.<\/p><p>  I will outline for the Deputy the effect of this section.  The amendments being made apply only to approved bodies which are authorised as eligible charities by Revenue.  In other to obtain an authorisation an applicant body must satisfy Revenue in regard to a number of matters, and we know about these, including that it is established only for charitable purposes, its income is applied only for charitable purposes and before applying for authorisation it has been granted tax exemption in respect of its income under section 207 of the Taxes Consolidation Act for a period of at least two years.  <\/p><p>  Where Revenue is satisfied that an eligible charity has ceased to comply with the conditions attached to its authorisation, for example, where it loses its tax exemption status, it can then withdraw the authorisation of charitable status by written notice to the body.  However - this is the element we are trying to rectify - the withdrawal may only apply and have effect from the date specified in the notice which must be later than the date of the notice.  There is a lacuna in that there is a period of time between the date on the letter and the date where the withdrawal takes place.  In other words, the withdrawal of the authorisation for the purposes of the donation scheme is prospective only.  As matters stand, therefore, the situation can arises where Revenue withdraws a body's tax exempt status under section 207 with retrospective effect to the date from which the body fails to meet the requirements under that section but it can only withdraw the body's authorisation for the purposes of donations from a current date.<\/p> <p>This situation can arise notwithstanding the fact that a qualifying condition of authorisation as an eligible charity for the donation scheme, in the first place, is that the income of the body is applied for charitable purposes only.  That concept is already there.  In such cases a charity could have lost its tax exempt status but could still be claiming refunds of tax and contributions made to the body.  <\/p><p> The purpose of the amendment is twofold.  First, it is to remove the current restriction that requires the withdrawal of an authorisation for the purposes of donation schemes from an eligible charity to be prospective only.  In other words, if this is enacted, in future Revenue will be able to withdraw an authorisation retrospectively.  Second, to ensure that the retrospective withdrawal of an authorisation impacts solely on the affected charity and not on the donors who made their donations in good faith, which is the point the Deputy made, the amendment ensures that donors who have claimed or will claim tax relief by way of deduction on a donation made to the charity up to the date of the notice withdrawing the authorisation retain the relief or the entitlement to claim relief.  The amendments have effect from 1 January 2005 and authorisation issued under Schedule 26A before, on or after that date.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked from where this arises.  Much has happened in this House.  There has been an additional scrutiny applied to the charities sector and a new charity regulatory structure has been set up.  We want a situation whereby members of the  public, when donating to charities, know that they are donating to charities in that good faith.  This amendment is to ensure that is the case.  It is a sensible amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900009#H01500","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416395400,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416395400,"counter":186,"content":"<p>SECTION 17<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1416395400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 18:<blockquote><br \/>In page 29, line 21, to delete &quot;on 1 February of the tax year&quot; and substitute &quot;at the time of the payment or transfer&quot;.<\/blockquote>Section 17(2)(b) amends the approved minimum retirement fund, AMRF, provisions in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The change allows the beneficial owner of an AMRF to draw down up to 4% of the value of the assets each year.  Heretofore, the capital invested in such a fund - a maximum of &euro;63,500 - was, in general, effectively locked-in until the owner reached the age of 75 and only the income, profits or gains arising in the fund could be drawn down.  Among other things, the amendment as published in the Bill provides for more certainty on the amount that may be drawn down each year. <br\/>Section 17(2)(b) as published has a fixed annual valuation date of 1 February for the purpose of determining the amount of this 4% drawdown.  Following feedback from the pensions sector, the Minister is now proposing to allow for the 4% drawdown to be based on the value of the assets in the AMRF at the point of drawdown rather than at a fixed valuation date in a year.  That is the change.  I commend the amendment to the committee.  The Minister for Finance may bring forward further amendments to this provision on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900010#J00400","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416395400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1416395400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 19 is in the name of the Minister and amendments Nos. 19 to 42, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900010#J00600","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1416395400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 19:<blockquote><br \/>In page 30, to delete lines 19 to 23 and substitute the following:&quot; &quot; 'fund administrator' means a qualifying fund manager of an approved retirement fund or an approved minimum retirement fund or the PRSA administrator of a vested PRSA (within the meaning of section 790D(1)), as the case may be, (in this definition referred to as the 'fund') the beneficial owner of which is a non-member and the assets of which consist, in whole or in part, of&mdash;<blockquote>(a) assets transferred to the fund by virtue of the exercise by the non-member of a relevant option in relation to the transfer arrangement (in this definition referred to as the &lsquo;first-mentioned transfer'), or<br \/>(b) assets transferred to the fund which were previously held in another fund or funds the assets of which originated, in whole or in part, from the first mentioned transfer;&quot;,&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>As amendments Nos. 19 to 42, inclusive, all relate to subsection (4) of section 17 of the Bill as published, I propose to deal with them together.  Section 17(4) amends Chapter 2C of Part 30 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which provides for the maximum allowable pension fund at retirement for tax purposes - generally referred to as the standard fund threshold or SFT regime.  The changes made by section 17(4) are for the purposes of dealing with issues arising in cases involving pension adjustment orders, PAOs, where the SFT regime and PAOs interact.  At present, where a chargeable excess arises and a PAO applies, the chargeable excess tax is recovered by the pension scheme administrator solely from the scheme member&rsquo;s part of the pension benefits and the spouse or partner&rsquo;s designated share of the pension benefits is unaffected.  The changes made by section 17(4) of the Bill provide that, in future, any chargeable excess tax arising will be apportioned having regard to the terms of the PAO, so that both the member and non-member spouse or partner share the tax charge in a more equitable fashion. <br\/>I should state that this has proved to be a difficult and complex issue and the amendments required to deal with it in the Bill as published, in the first instance, and the further range of amendments I am now proposing are an indication of that.  The amendments reflect further consideration of the provision in the light of feedback and commentary received by the Department of Finance and Revenue since publication.  These changes will act to ensure that the provisions operate as intended. <br\/>Amendments Nos. 23, 25, 27 to 29, inclusive, 32, 34, 35, 37 and 40 to 42, inclusive, are minor drafting or technical amendments, which we can look at if members wish, to clarify aspects of the provision.  Turning to the other more substantive amendments, amendments Nos. 19 to 21 amend a number of definitions used in the provision.  The amendments are primarily designed to ensure that the terms &quot;fund administrator&quot;, &quot;relevant member&quot;, &quot;subsequent administrator&quot; and &quot;transfer arrangement&quot; take account of the dynamic nature of pensions, particularly in the private sector, whereby pension benefits can be readily transferred from one scheme to another.  The refined definitions will ensure that the correct scheme and, therefore, the correct scheme administrator is pinpointed for the purposes of administering the new provision as regards the collection and payment of any chargeable excess tax arising on a non-member spouse or partner. <br\/>Amendment No. 22 extends new subsection (5) of section 787O to make clear that, where a member of a scheme to which a PAO has been applied takes a transfer value to another scheme, the administrator of the new scheme in calculating the capital value of a benefit crystallisation event at the point of pension drawdown, and in providing information for the purposes of the application by the member for a personal fund threshold, must make those calculations as if the PAO had not been made.<br\/>Amendment No. 24 extends new subsection (5A) of section 787Q to provide that the pension scheme administrator of an ex-spouse or partner&rsquo;s independent scheme, to which the ex-spouse or partner has transferred the designated benefit under the PAO, is entitled to dispose of or appropriate such assets of the scheme as are required to pay the tax due and will be protected against any potential legal action from doing so.  <br\/>Amendment No. 26 is perhaps the most significant of the amendments being made.  As mentioned earlier, the intent of the overall changes being made by section 17(4) is to give a more equitable sharing of any chargeable excess tax arising in the context of PAO cases, as between the scheme member and the non-member spouse or partner.  Where the non-member spouse or partner leaves the designated benefit under the PAO as part of the member&rsquo;s pension until maturity, the apportionment is straightforward.  However, where the non-member spouse or partner has taken a transfer value to a separate independent scheme, the apportionment becomes more complicated.  This amendment ensures that the non-member&rsquo;s share of any chargeable excess tax in those circumstances will reflect actual events occurring at the point of transfer rather than notional events at the time the benefit crystallisation event giving rise to the chargeable excess tax arises. <br\/>Amendment No. 30 extends new section 787R(2A)(e) to place a limit on the liability of a subsequent administrator for a non-member&rsquo;s share of any chargeable excess tax so that it does not exceed the value of the assets in the transfer arrangement at the point at which the non-member&rsquo;s rights under that arrangement are being transferred to another arrangement, or at the point the retirement benefits under the arrangement mature and are drawn down.  Amendment No. 31 amends new section 787R(3B) which requires an administrator who apportions chargeable excess tax between the member and the non-member spouse or partner, in circumstances where the non-member has taken a transfer value to a separate independent scheme, to provide a certificate to the administrator of the independent arrangement detailing the amount and basis of calculation of the non-member's share of the chargeable excess tax.  The amendment places an onus on the administrator to establish, through inquiries, who is the subsequent administrator and extends the period within which a certificate must be issued from seven to 21 days.<br\/>Amendment No. 33 primarily recasts new section 787R(3C) as published in the Bill to break it up into more manageable subparagraphs for ease of the reader.  It also places an onus on the administrator of the member&rsquo;s scheme or the subsequent administrator of the non-member spouse or partner&rsquo;s independent scheme, depending on the circumstances, to establish, through inquiries, who the fund administrator is, or the administrator of a vested PRSA belonging to the non-member spouse or partner, and extends the period within which a certificate or copy certificate must be issued to the fund administrator from seven to 21 days.  <br\/>Amendment No. 36 amends new section 787R(6A) inserted by section 17 (4) of the Bill as initiated.  Section 787R(6A) provides for the retention of certain records by the administrator, subsequent administrator or fund administrator for a period of six years from specified dates.  The amendment clarifies the specified dates for the various parties involved.<br\/>Amendment No. 38<b><i><\/i><\/b>recasts the amendment made to section 787S(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in the Bill as initiated to clarify what the administrator of a scheme, who has apportioned chargeable excess tax between a scheme member and a non-member spouse or partner, has to include in the return the administrator has to make to the Collector General of Revenue for the purposes of accounting for chargeable excess tax.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 39 recasts new section 787 S1A inserted in the TCA 1997 by the Bill, as initiated, to ensure there is no doubt as to the responsibility for and the timing of the making of a return required to be made to the Collector General of Revenue for the purposes of accounting for a non-member spouse or partner share of a chargeable excess tax in circumstances where the non-member has taken a transfer value to provide an independent retirement benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900010#J00700","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416396000,"counter":192,"content":"<p>This is highly technical.

The Finance Bill amendment reduces the imputed AMRF distribution rate from 5% to 4%.  It is targeted at individuals in the age group 60 to 70 years.  It is intended to reduce the risk that individuals in that age group might outlive the funds in their AMRFs or their vested PRSAs.  The introduction of stepped increases in imputed distribution rates based on age, brings Ireland more into line with the draw down position internationally for similar post-retirement funds.  An AMRF represents a flexible alternative to the purchase of a pension annuity or the stream of taxable pension income.  It is open to individuals who generally have defined contribution pension arrangements and do not wish to purchase in pension annuity.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that most people with defined contribution pension funds are choosing the AMRF option and not purchasing the annuities.  For individuals aged 70 or over, the current 5% imputed distribution remains, as does the 6% rate for large value AMRFs in excess of &euro;2 million.

It would provide transparency in what we are doing in terms of multinational tax and domestic business tax and the effective rate paid.  A sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform has been examining the issue at length and it is clear that there are multiple ways to determine the effective tax rate using different models.

What I do not welcome is the fact that the Minister has allowed the double Irish to remain in place until 2020.<br\/>Other announcements are not contained within the Finance Bill, for example, on the patent or knowledge box, which is highly dubious.  We know that if we are to follow suit in terms of what the UK has done in London that it would raise big concerns with the European Commission.  It is not clear what type of patent or knowledge box the Government plans to introduce.  It appears that while the Government closes down one loophole it is about to open one or two others.

I accept Deputy Doherty has raised the issue previously in the context of previous Finance Bills and that it comes up regularly for discussion by the committee.  There is no internationally agreed methodology for calculating effective rates.  On foot of discussions at Committee Stage of last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill, the Department of Finance has produced a technical paper on effective rates of corporation tax in Ireland for the committee.  The paper was co-authored by Seamus Coffey, who is an adviser to a sub-committee of the finance committee.  The paper contains a comprehensive 40-page analysis of the issue and was submitted to the committee and published on the 7 April this year.  The paper was prepared to provide clarity about the seemingly conflicting figures that are frequently quoted and is an excellent resource for those seeking to understand what can be a complex, technical issue.

This is a very useful exercise in terms of looking at various methodologies and at various questions that have been posed at this committee and in many public and media fora over recent years on the effective rate.  We are pleased that it is in the public domain.  It is an excellent resource and it is good to see it being utilised.  One of the objectives of the paper is to be as open and fair in the analysis as is possible, so all the figures are in there.  For that reason, the Department commissioned an external academic, to whom I have already alluded, to ensure the work is seen to be as objective as possible.  I know the committee would accept the objectivity of that individual due to its own work with him.<\/p><p>  The paper examines three different methodologies used in the calculation of effective rates of corporation tax in general.  It then analyses eight different figures that are quoted in respect of Ireland in greater detail.  Each of these different approaches is relevant, depending on the nature of the question being addressed.  In attempting to assess the effective corporate tax rate applying to the total profits earned by companies in Ireland, the paper concludes that the approach based on the national aggregate statistics from the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office is the most suitable.  The paper finds that the effective rates of corporation tax, as measured according to the statistics from these two sources, are reasonably close to the headline rate of 12.5% and that the difference is mainly accounted for by double taxation relief and a small number of other reliefs, including the research and development tax credit.  Since 2003, the effective corporation tax rates on the CSO measure of profit, net operating surplus, and the Revenue measure of profit, taxable income, have averaged 10.9% and 10.7%, respectively.  In more recent years there have been differences between the two figures.  The CSO measure was 8.4% in 2011 and the Revenue measure was 10.4%.  This is due to the existence of large losses in the system, which can be offset against profits for tax purposes, but are not counted in the CSO figures.  On the basis of this extensive analysis, we are comfortable that companies in Ireland are paying the appropriate rate of corporate tax on profits generated by those companies in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Deputy Doherty has specifically proposed that the Minister for Finance prepare a report on the effective rate of tax charged to domestic businesses in this State and, separately, to multinational corporations, and analyse the impact of this Finance Bill on lowering or raising the effective tax rate.  On the effective rate paid by multinationals compared with domestic companies, I draw the Deputy's attention to research undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners and published on budget day as part of the broader economic impact assessment of Ireland's corporation tax policy.  The Revenue research, en titled A Note on the Context and Concentration of Corporation Tax Payments, used a new Revenue marker to identify corporation tax payments from the foreign-owned multinational sector.  This new Revenue marker is still under development, but the indications from Revenue to date are that this marker is quite comprehensive and that revisions to the data in future are unlikely to be significant.  Using this marker and applying the relevant methodology outlined in the technical paper, namely, dividing the amount of tax paid by the amount of taxable profits of companies, the effective rate applied to domestic businesses was 7.7% and that applied to multinational businesses was 11.1% in 2012.  Given the detailed material already produced by the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners and the need to allocate scarce resources most effectively, the Minister for Finance cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900013#N00100","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416397200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>It is disappointing that the Minister will not accept this amendment.  It should be standard practice when we deal with corporation tax, and, indeed, other taxation measures, that there would be a report to outline the effect of the budget or the Finance Bill in relation to those measures.  There are quite significant issues coming down the track in terms of the patent box and there are major question marks in relation to that.  The Government has not unveiled any detail of it bar the fact that it wants to introduce a patent box.  We do not know what type of examples it will follow, and we have the ending of the double Irish.  To my understanding, there is no document that shows the impact that has on the multinational sector in terms of its effective corporation tax rate, for good or bad.<\/p> <p>I will not press the amendment at this time.

This is another figure to add to the list.  We have 2%, 6.2%, 6.8%, 8%, 10.9%, and the figure of 14% was bandied about at one stage, which was truly mystifying.  Revenue's CTS1 statistics table on corporate tax tells its own story, and the suggestions that corporations pay anywhere close to 12.5% are exposed when one looks at the CTS1 table.  Revenue helpfully breaks down the tax cases in the corporate sector into categories of profitability, starting with bands from &euro;1 to &euro;25,000 and &euro;25,000 to &euro;50,000 all the way up to companies making profits of between &euro;5 million and &euro;10 million and more than &euro;10 million.<\/p><p>  The figure for those with a profit of more than &euro;10 million is interesting.  Some time ago I asked whether we could have a further breakdown of the corporations with profits of more than &euro;10 million, because in reality these are the multinationals.  I was told we could not have this further breakdown because the Department of Finance stated it might allow people to identify individual companies and we could not possibly do this.  This is pretty outrageous.  What we have available to us gives us a clue as to the answers Deputy Doherty seeks.  It shows 480 companies earn profits of more than &euro;10 million per year, and these 480 companies earn &euro;52 billion in pre-tax profits.  The slightly lower figure for total income and gains before deductions and charges is &euro;50 billion.  A total of 480 companies have &euro;50 billion of the profits and total corporate profits are &euro;61 billion.  The vast majority of profits generated by the corporate sector are generated by 480 companies, all of which earn profits in excess of &euro;10 million.  These 480 companies pay &euro;3.3 billion in actual tax out of the &euro;50 billion of total income and gains before deductions and charges.  This gives an effective rate for them of approximately 7.5%.  This figure includes companies at the lower end, which might not necessarily be multinationals, which earn &euro;10 million or a little over &euro;10 million in profits.  Within the smaller number of multinationals in this group, which almost certainly make much bigger profits, it is certainly indicated from this effective rate that the big multinationals are those paying approximately 6% or even less in actual tax on their total gains.  Down the table, the smaller companies making smaller profits are far more likely to be paying 9% 10% or 11%.  Already the evidence available to us suggests domestic small and medium enterprises pay approximately 12.5% or, generally speaking, somewhere between 10% and 12%, but the big incredibly profitable multinationals pay 6% or 7%.  This is just not acceptable.<\/p><p>  This relates a little to the discussion we had on SARP, but here we are not dealing with a few hundred thousand euro but billions of euros in forgone taxes which could be going to the Exchequer.  If these 480 companies, which make &euro;50 billion and pay &euro;3.3 billion in tax which works out at approximately 7%, were made pay 12.5% or even 10% or 11%, which is what most small and medium enterprises must pay, it would mean &euro;2 billion or &euro;3 billion extra in tax revenue for the Exchequer.  This is what is being forgone because of the tax treatment of these multinationals.  This must be investigated in a very serious way.  I suspect this is happening because of the way in which these companies are able to write off a number of matters under certain headings, allowances and deductions which themselves need to be scrutinised.  One of these is the royalties paid for patents, which brings us to the issue of the patents box and whether on its abolition the much trumpeted double Irish will, in fact, be replaced by another scheme through which the same companies will be able to avoid pretty much the same amount of taxes but in a slightly different way by speaking about patents and intellectual property rights.  They will be given until 2020, which is six years, to reconfigure their tax avoidance systems and funnel all of this through royalties and intellectual property charges or however it is written down to avoid paying tax.  This seems to be what is happening.  I do not see why the Government shows no willingness to look into this or to look into what is a two-tier tax system with regard to small and medium domestic enterprises as against the tax treatment of multinationals.  I am interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900014#O00400","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1416397800,"counter":272,"content":"<p>There is quite a lot in what the Deputy said.  I am somewhat disappointed I have not heard a response from Deputy Boyd Barrett with his thoughts on the document, whereby arising from debates of this committee, the Department of Finance conducted a substantial amount of analysis.  All of the figures, including those mentioned by the Deputy, were included and it has come up with what it believes is the best and fairest way of assessing the tax.  It was not an insider job.  Outside expertise was involved in the form of an eminent economist.<\/p> <p>There is a great deal of food for thought in it.  It is important that it exists because it dispels some of the myths that have existed with regard to corporation tax.  The Deputy is quite correct when he says this is extremely complex.  As I alluded to in my initial remarks on this proposal, there is not necessarily one universal way of doing it.  We have tried to get to the best way of arriving at a transparent point.  I put those figures on the record here today.<\/p><p> A great deal of corporation tax is paid in this country.  The Deputy's constituency is in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, where corporation tax of &euro;278.3 million was paid between 2008 and 2012.  We will have to do better in my own constituency of Wicklow, where just &euro;63 million was paid in corporation tax over the same period.  I have taken those figures from a 40-page document that was published on budget day, entitled Corporation Tax &ndash; A Note on the Context and Concentration of Payments.  Indeed, a total of seven reports on corporation tax were published on budget day as part of the accompanying documentation.  We have mentioned the double Irish system and the knowledge box.  We have not mentioned the OECD base erosion and profit-shifting process, but we know about it.  A great deal of effort is being put into looking at this entire area and at Ireland's competitiveness.  Given that seven reports were published on budget day, along with the 40-page document to which I have referred, it is clear that a significant body of work has been done.<\/p><p> Deputy Boyd Barrett has raised issues about the amounts of money that have been raised and paid.  If he does not mind me saying so, the 40-page report I have mentioned would suggest that he has confused the issues of gross profits and taxable income.  The chapter of that report starting on page 22 explains the difference between the two.  The suggestion that the right amount of corporation tax is not being applied to these companies in Ireland is dispelled in this neutral and objective report on the situation.  I would welcome and appreciate the Deputy's comments on box 3.1 in the report, which sets out the main differences between gross trading profits and taxable income.  I am the first to concede that it all gets terribly technical.  We have done a very extensive analysis and arrived at figures.  This body of work had not been done previously.  The concluding section of the report, on page 40, states \"the effective Corporation Tax rates on Net Operating Surplus and Taxable Income have averaged 10.9 per cent and 10.7 per cent respectively \" since 2003.  I do not necessarily expect that the Deputy and I are going to agree on this.  I am sure this debate will continue.<\/p><p> The knowledge box is not an attempt to have some sort of tax-avoidance scheme.  It is quite the opposite.  It is an attempt to catch up with many of our competitors that already have patent boxes in place.  Deputy Pearse Doherty correctly alluded earlier to the need to get this right.  Obviously, it needs EU approval.  The Minister could have chosen to try to rush some sort of patent or knowledge box through the Finance Bill pending EU approval, although I think it would have been unwise to do so.  He has chosen not to do that.  There will be a consultation period, which will be launched by the end of 2014.  We will have further details fleshed out at that stage in terms of where the Government wants to go.  Ultimately, we want to introduce a competitive income-based regime for intangible assets in Ireland.  It has been recognised that many of our economic assets and much of our economic activity is now in intangible areas like intellectual property.  Other countries are already doing this.  It is not an attempt to introduce a new double Irish system.  I cannot be clear enough on that.  We hope to legislate for this in the Finance Bill 2015.  I am sure people will have plenty of opportunities to engage through the consultation process.<\/p><p> It is quite right that the debate about corporation tax is continuing.  It is a very important issue.  I think it is the fourth largest tax take that this country has.  I am sure the debate will continue.  I genuinely believe the work being undertaken by the Department of Finance at the initiation of the Minister for Finance provides a great deal of food for thought and data.  Perhaps it is something we can explore further.  It is on that basis, and no other, that the Minister for Finance does not believe it is necessary to accept Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendment on this occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900014#O00500","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416398400,"counter":274,"content":"<p>We are talking about a knowledge development box, which is completely different from a patent box.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900015#P00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1416398400,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900015#P00300","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416398400,"counter":276,"content":"<p>The patent box system in the UK and the Netherlands is mainly a warehousing regime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900015#P00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1416398400,"counter":277,"content":"<p>It is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900015#P00500","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416398400,"counter":278,"content":"<p>The system we are talking about will assist with indigenous development as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900015#P00600","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1416398400,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Yes, the Chairman is correct.

I am merely pointing out that other countries have gone down the road of looking at specific boxes.  Our knowledge box will be based on the development of knowledge of intangible assets of intellectual property.  As I have said, it is not something we are rushing.  There will be significant consultation.  The details of how that will go forth will be known later this year.  By giving ourselves a 12-month period in which to thrash this out and scrutinise it, we will make sure it is the best in class, as the Minister for Finance said on budget day.

I accept that more work has been done on it.  One might argue that this has happened as a result of the big international movement in this area and the questioning, for the first time, of the consensus around low corporate tax rates by some people who have come to the Oireachtas.  The combination of those developments has forced some discussion and scrutiny of these arrangements.  I ask the committee to consider this proposal in the context of other measures that are being imposed on ordinary citizens at the moment.  Ordinary citizens are not given a six-year timeframe in which to readjust to possible tax changes and do not seem to get the benefit of the fairly privileged access to the Department of Finance and the Minister that seems to be enjoyed by the big corporations.  It has been suggested in reports that when the Minister, Deputy Bruton, was in the United States recently, the Government was busy telling these big multinationals not to worry and reassuring them that they will not have to pay much more tax.  The Government is giving the multinationals six years to adjust while this is phased in.  It intends to consult them all along the way.  Not only are these companies being given huge reassurance, but they are essentially being given advance notice to prepare themselves for any possible adverse effects of the changes in the corporate tax regime as well.  This contrasts with how ordinary citizens are treated when they are told \"here is your water tax and your this, that and the other - pay it\".  They are not given six years to assess how it might affect them.<\/p><p>  Having mentioned that contrast, I would like to focus on the need to thrash out seriously at some stage all the headings under which &euro;70 billion in gross profits comes down to &euro;40 billion in taxable profits.  To me, that is a three-card trick.  The ordinary citizen does not get the sort of massive tax breaks enjoyed by those who claim tax breaks on the basis that they have kids, they have to put a roof over their heads, they need lawnmowers to mow their grass, or they have a car.  I know ordinary citizens get some tax breaks in these areas, but they do not manage to reduce their gross income by nearly half - I refer to their taxable income - by the time taxes begin to kick in.  The level of allowances and deductions being given to corporations enables an enormous sum of gross profits to be reduced to a taxable figure of &euro;40 billion.  One cannot help feeling that this facilitates pretty significant tax avoidance.  Some of this revolves around things like company cars and extravagant management expenses which, to my mind, should not attract tax deductions.  Critically, it is clear from what is available to us from Revenue, and on the basis of an obvious and reasonably fair assumption that the companies making the bulk of the profits are the multinationals, that the key area in which this is happening is the area of intellectual property.  That is where it is happening.  We have whistleblowers and everybody.  All sorts of people have analysed it.  It is a fact that they are charging astronomical figures for the royalties for the right to use certain intellectual property.  They seem to adjust the charges or royalties they pay for that intellectual property conveniently to cover the vast amounts of profits they make so that those profits are then not taxable.<\/p> <p>To my mind, that is just a scam staring us in the face.  When the Minister of State states that we have to be competitive with other countries making tax offerings to these companies, he cites Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the UK, which, frankly speaking, are all the tax renegades of the European Union.  Do we have to compete with the tax renegades of the European Union?  We have just discovered that some big Irish companies are going to Luxembourg to avoid tax.  These are the people with which we are competing.  Could we not compare our tax system with the tax models in the Scandinavian or central European countries rather than competing with the tax renegades of Europe?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900015#P00900","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416399000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned the ordinary people a number of times in his contribution.  Many of the ordinary people are employed because of the rate of corporation tax that is in place which has allowed us to attract foreign direct investment.  Our corporation tax rate is a driver of growth and of foreign direct investment, which is ultimately a driver of employment.  I was glad to hear the Taoiseach say in Leaders' Questions yesterday that the 12.5% corporation tax rate was not up for negotiation.  I understand that tax competitiveness is being considered in the EU at present.  Does the Minister of State know the current position on that?<\/p><p>  In terms of the effective tax rate versus the headline tax rate, PwC produced a report last year which looked at the statutory corporate headline tax rate versus the effective tax rate of different countries.  It showed Ireland in a very good light in that, from memory, the effective rate was 11.8% compared to France's headline rate of 33.3% but where the effective tax rate is 8.2%.  Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned Luxembourg.  It has a headline tax rate of 22.5%, but the effective tax rate is less than 5%.  We compare favourably in terms of the headline rate versus the effective tax rate.  I hope the 12.5% corporate tax rate is protected into the future because it is a big driver of growth and employment.  In my own neck of the woods, from speaking to CEOs and the members of the American Chamber of Commerce, they are very keen to ensure that this rate is protected.

That is important.<\/p><p>  One often says that a lot of politics is grandstanding in these Houses.  In fairness to Deputy Boyd Barrett, when he actually speaks on this, I know he genuinely and sincerely believes everything he says on it, but I completely disagree with it.  I hope he accepts my sincerity in that regard.  I disagree with it based on a number of issues.  There seems to be at times an implication that he is talking about people's personal wealth or about personal taxation.  We are talking about companies that are employing so many people in this country, that are bringing in tax to this country, and that are contributing to communities and to regional development as well when we see them in suburbs and counties right around Ireland.  The value of multinationals to the employment number in the Irish economy is that real people with families have a pay packet coming into the home.  It is not just me, but Deputies McGrath and Walsh also say that the corporation tax rate is important.  Look at the ESRI report, which I think was also published on budget day.  It has done a very useful body of work on the effect of increases in corporation tax rate in Ireland.  It models various levels of increases and shows the impact this would have on new foreign companies coming to these shores.  A figure that sticks out in my mind is that if corporation tax had increased to 22.5%, the ESRI predicts that only 50% of new foreign companies would have opened on these shores.<\/p><p>  There is now a body of empirical data.  I accept that this work may not have been done in the past.  I accept that these debates are useful and are important in that regard, but it irks me when I hear his comments on the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Burton, and other Ministers meeting with business owners.  It is really important that Deputy Boyd Barrett met with the people on the picket line and engaged with them.  This is part of the job.  Equally, it is really important that Government Ministers and all of us can engage with other employers as well.  There is no difference between engaging with an employer who happens to be working for a multinational, engaging with the IFA, or engaging with a public sector trade union.  All of these elements matter and it is important that the Government, whatever its composition, does engage with them.  The reason the Government is engaging, and the Deputy referred to the double Irish, is that certainty is vital.  We know from IDA Ireland and watching developments in this country that companies make investment decisions over a seven to ten year window .  We have to provide them with certainty.  Certainty in relation to tax is vital.<\/p><p>  Deputy Walsh asked me about the international procedures in place.  Obviously, comments have been made by the new President of the European Commission.  Ireland is very willing to engage in any sort of transfer and transparency in relation to tax.  That has always been the position.  Tax work and tax it where it occurs.  We are also playing a very proactive role in the OECD BEPS process.  Do not just take my word for that.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has shown that by moving ahead of the double Irish, having first mover advantage, rather than waiting for an international process to resolve, Ireland has got out ahead, is protecting our international reputation and is bringing certainty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900016#Q00500","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416399000,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I understand that Deputy Doherty has withdrawn his amendment No. 43 to insert a new section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900016#Q00600","speaker":"990"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416399000,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416399000,"counter":289,"content":"<p>Sections 18 and 19 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416399000,"counter":290,"content":"<p>SECTION 20<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1416399000,"counter":291,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 44 is in the name of the Minister.

Amendment No. 45 changes the definition of \"first-time purchaser\" to include a relevant completion date and this also brings self-builds within the definition of first-time purchaser.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 46 substitutes \"dwellinghouse or apartment\" with \"dwelling\".  Amendment No. 47 inserts a new definition of \"relevant completion\" to allow for the self-build category of property.  This definition requires the completion of the construction of a new house to a standard where it is suitable for immediate occupation as a dwelling.  The completion must be on or after 14 October 2014 and on or before 31 December 2017.  The property on which the house is built must be conveyed or transferred in the name of the first time purchaser prior to 31 December 2017.  There is no requirement for the registration to take place after 14 October 2014.  This section will allow for the building of property on land which is already owned by the first time purchaser.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 48 extends the definition of \"relevant purchase\" to provide for both individual and joint purchasers and ensures that in the latter category each joint purchaser must be a first time buyer.  The amendment also extends the definition of \"relevant savings\" to include deposits amounting to not more than 20% of the value of a newly completed self-build property.  In addition the amendment extends the definition of \"relevant savings interest\" to include interest earned in the period of 48 months prior to a relevant completion in addition to a relevant purchase.  Effectively, this is to bring the self-builds into the category and to provide some clarity in that regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900017#R00800","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416399600,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I wish to speak to amendment No. 49.

The change I propose is that the relevant period be increased from four to five years in view of the fact that people will be saving for longer to buy a house.  Interest rates are at historic low levels.  People who are saving earn 1% or 2% interest on their savings if they are lucky and DIRT tax is 41% of that.  This is recognising the reality.  In view of the Central Bank rules which may come into play - it is likely there will be some change - which will raise the bar in terms of the amount of a deposit that people are required to save, many people especially in the high rental market will be saving for a long number of years.

Obviously this initiative is something the Minister will monitor closely, therefore I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900017#R01000","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416399600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>It is a modest initiative.   A person with savings of &euro;40,000 and earning 1% interest will pay DIRT amounting to about &euro;170.  Therefore, over four years he or will get less than &euro;650 back.  That will not have a huge impact in terms of the overall mortgage cost.  There are a couple of issues I want clarified.  I welcome the fact that self-builds are included.  It is an issue I have raised on previous Finance Bills which was completed ignored by Government.  Amendment No. 48 refers to \"the period of 48 months ending on the relevant completion date\".  A person who has been involved in a self-build would normally put their own personal money up front first, instead of drawing down their mortgage.  If one has &euro;40,000 in one's account to assist with the purchase of the house and one gets a mortgage of &euro;160,000 for a self-build costing &euro;200,000, if it was me I would pay the &euro;40,000 as soon as possible in the build as one receives only 1% interest, whereas if one is drawing down the mortgage one triggers automatically payment of 5%.  That would be the normal trend in terms of self-build where it is directly built by oneself.  Where one employs a contractor to do this work it would be a different scenario, usually the contractor would seek payment at the end of the build or may agree stage payments.  The principle remains where there are stage payments that one tends to use one's cash first because it makes financial sense, therefore the completion date could be an issue.  I do not know how to rectify it because there has to be a date from which to work back.<\/p><p>  The other issue on which I seek clarification is in amendment No. 48 which defines \"relevant savings\" as not exceeding 20% of the amount of the consideration paid in respect of the relevant purchase for the first-time purchaser.  I will use my own scenario as a first-time buyer.  If my wife and I were both first-time buyers, what consideration would we be paid?  There is no definition of \"consideration paid\".  Does the \"consideration paid\" mean half in the case of a joint mortgage?  We take out a joint mortgage where one is individually and jointly held liable but when that money is transferred is it 50% of the completion value?  There is no definition as to what that actually means and how that would apply.  It is left open to the possibility that one could avail of this twice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900017#R01100","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1416399600,"counter":305,"content":"<p>These are all important questions.

We are trying to bring the self-build in.  I take the Deputy's point.  I am not certain as to how to get around that.

Therefore, we should not be hitting them with DIRT as they try to reach that 20% target.  There is actually no requirement on any individual to have a mortgage.  The reason I say this is that until now, much of the market has involved cash buyers, people who are cash rich.

The Deputy's amendments were ruled out of order but I will respond to the broader points that he has raised.  The Deputy wanted consideration to be given to the effect of increasing the minimum holding period for shares from four to five years.  The EII scheme is targeted at job creation and retention and is available to the majority of small and medium-sized trading companies.  The scheme was subjected to a significant review this year by the Department of Finance, in consultation with the Revenue Commissions.  As the Deputy will know, the review included a public consultation process.  Following on from the review the Minister for Finance has brought forward a number of changes to the scheme, including the increase of the holding period for shares from three years to four years.<\/p><p>  The holding period for shares must be set at a level that, on one hand, allows the company to use the funds raised and increase revenue sufficiently while, on the other hand, not be so long as to deter investors altogether.  A company's stage of development is a key factor in respect of the shareholding period.  The increase in the holding period from three years to four years will allow a company more time to use the funds raised and, hopefully, be in a position, as the minimum four-year holding period ends, to repay the investors.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that the legislation only imposes a minimum four-year holding period and no maximum holding period applies.  Investors have stated that the five-year holding period was too long for them to wait for a return on their investments.  In the current economic climate where more companies are competing for less available funds, increasing the holding period to five years, in the view of the Minister for Finance, could serve to discourage investors further.  There is a balance to be struck in terms of incentivising the investor and enabling the company to utilise the investment.  The Minister is not inclined, therefore, to increase it to a minimum of five years.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked how many investors availed of the EII scheme.  In 2012, the scheme cost &euro;4 million and had 352 investors.  In 2013, the scheme cost &euro;12.4 million which included 1,011 investors, including six funds.  It is encouraging to see such a substantial increase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900019#T01900","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416400800,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416400800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>Section 24, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416400800,"counter":355,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1416400800,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 56:<blockquote><br \/>In page 49, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;Amendment of Chapter 3 of Part 38 of Principal Act (other obligations and returns)<\/b><br \/><b>25. <\/b>The Principal Act is amended in Chapter 3 of Part 38 by inserting the following after section 891E:<blockquote><b>&ldquo;Returns of certain information by financial institutions<\/b><br \/><b>891F<\/b>.

The first was that individuals made huge gains as a result of the rezoning of land and it was deemed appropriate that some of those gains would be recouped by the State, while the second reason was to serve as an anti-corruption measure.  I mentioned at this committee previously that one would hope that local authority members, elected by the public, who engaged in the rezoning of land for the benefit of individuals who may have been connected to them or supportive of them is a thing of the past.  However, it may not be a thing of the past and, indeed, we cannot actually ensure that it is so.  In that context, we need to make sure that adequate preventative mechanisms are in place to make such behaviour less appealing.<\/p><p>  There have been media reports recently relating to local authorities, planning permission and so forth which I am sure will be investigated by the relevant authorities.  I believe that the ending of the windfall tax, which was 80%, and just applying the appropriate levels of taxation is not the proper way to do this.  I believe that the windfall tax should have continued to exist at a reduced rate of 41%.  However, I also believe that the scrapping of this tax should only apply for a couple of years.  I say that because the windfall tax sends a signal to local authority members that they should not try to rezone lands for the benefit of individuals.  Furthermore, a key priority for the Government at the moment is to release land for development which is probably the primary motivation for scrapping the windfall tax.  Indeed, that is the same motivation behind the Sinn F&eacute;in suggestion that the tax be cut in half.  We want to incentivise people to release land at this point in time but by allowing this to be open-ended, such an incentive does not exist at this point in time.  Given the fact that land prices are recovering, the removal of the windfall tax actually acts as a disincentive.  The incentive at the moment is to hold onto land, wait until the market improves further and then sell it on without having to pay a windfall tax.  If the Minister were to introduce an amendment to this Bill to provide that the removal of the windfall tax would be for two years or some other specified period, that would incentivise people to release their land now, regardless of the rates.  The rates are a separate issue.  It would be open to the Government at a later stage to then decide if it wants to extend the period or not, depending on whether the measure was effective.<\/p><p>  There are time-limited provisions throughout this Finance Bill in many different guises.  The special rate of 4% USC for medical card holders is only extended by a couple of years, the VAT rebate under the home renovation scheme is time limited and the tax cut for high earners by way of SARP has only been extended for a couple of years.  Yet, when it comes to the windfall tax., there is no Cinderella clause included.  There is no cut-off period.  The provision, therefore, will not be as effective as it could have been had the Minister placed a 24-month time limit which would incentivise people to release land now, particularly around our capital and in other cities.  Such land is much needed for development purposes to deal with the current housing crisis, in both the social and private housing sectors as well as the rental market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900020#U00800","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1416401400,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I believe that any tax which is designed to prevent transactions from happening is not necessarily a good tax.  I know this tax was introduced by the last Government to deal with the issues referred to by Deputy Doherty.  However, it has now become a barrier to the release of development land onto the market.  We all accept that one of the main issues in the housing market at the moment is the lack of supply.  We need land that is suitable for residential development which is appropriately zoned and serviced to be brought to the market so that supply can increase, thus dealing with some of the acute shortages in certain parts of the country.  Deputy Doherty has raised a good point with regard to the hoarding of land.  While the removal of the 80% windfall tax removes a barrier to suitable development land coming on the market, that does not necessarily mean that such land will be brought to market.  It does not deal with the issue of land being hoarded, which can happen, over a prolonged period of time.  The Government may need to consider that issue so that there is proper balance here - we want to incentivise landowners with land that is suitable for development to bring it to the market while not encouraging them to hold onto land indefinitely in the expectation that its value will just continue to increase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900020#U00900","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1416401400,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I agree with much of what Deputy McGrath has said.  He is right to ask how this provision will ensure that land is actually utilised and not left idle.  In response, I refer him to the Minister's speech on budget day where he indicated that he plans to launch a public consultation process shortly on the issue of incentivising the use of currently unused land.  This will relate to land zoned and serviced for residential development.  The aim of the consultation is to assess the extent to which the taxation system can be utilised to encourage the development of such zoned and serviced land to assist with the shortage of residential properties in certain areas, of which we are all well aware.  Any existing levies will be considered as part of that consultation and any taxation measures which may be introduced as a result of the consultation will take account of any levies currently in place.  The issue of how to utilise unused land is one that the Minister is eager to engage with and he will launch a consultation process shortly in that regard.  It is a problem that the Government is acutely aware of at present.<\/p><p>  Regarding Deputy Doherty's point about replacing one set of tax provisions which are having a distorting effect with another set of provisions, the Minister for Finance is of the view that if one does so, one runs the risk of continuing to distort the market.  He is also concerned that one would effectively shoe horn transactions into a set period.  I know I am not directly addressing the section but rather the suggestion made by the Deputy in his contribution.  The Minister was very clear on budget day and on a number of occasions subsequently that this provision will be kept under very close review.  If it is found that transactions and the sale of land for development are leading to abuse or to increased costs of development, particularly in the area of housing, the Minister will not hesitate to introduce whatever measures are open to him and the Government in order to correct the situation.  <\/p><p>  The Minister gave consideration to replacing the windfall tax provisions with a higher single rate of capital gains tax above the current rate of 33% on any profits or gains from land disposals attributable to increases in land value above the non-developed or agricultural-use value.  However, the Minister was concerned that, as with Deputy Doherty's suggestion, that could have a distorting effect on the market.  We will keep this under close review.  I note the words of caution expressed by Deputy Doherty and the comments of Deputy McGrath on the issue of unused land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900020#U01000","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416401400,"counter":366,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has said that the effect of what I have suggested in terms of the windfall tax being removed for a specified period would be to shoe horn transactions into a particular period of time but that is exactly what we want.  That should be the stated objective of Government.  We want this land to be released for development purposes.  If the period in question is two years, that allows for this to happen in that period.  There is a shortage of development land around our capital city.<\/p> <p>We have a crisis in Dublin.  One of the reasons for the reduction from 80% is to allow this land to come on to the market.  The idea of creating a window is to encourage people to do it within a particular period.  It does not mean to say no land would be sold afterwards because it could be extended if the Minister of State so wished.<\/p><p> Earlier, we dealt with a measure in section 20 on DIRT tax, which has been placed in a window; people must buy a house within a two year period for exactly the same reason, which is we want to facilitate people to purchase a house at this point in time.  For this reason, a rebate from DIRT has been introduced with regard to savings for a four-year period.  I heard what the Minister of State said on incentivising land use, which is fine.  It could be the case that after the two year period it would not be realistic to return to 80% because no land whatsoever had been transferred.  One does not want to put a block on it.  However getting rid of it, which is very much an incentive for people to release land, and then increasing it to an appropriate level, or returning it to 80% and re-examining it at that stage, would signal to people they must use it or lose it.  This has been used by the Department of Finance over and over, such as with regard to the seven year rule for buyers which runs out this year, which was a window to get people involved in the market.  We should desire that land be released at this point in time for development purposes in the greater Dublin area and other areas.  The reduction in the rate should only apply for a period of time.<\/p><p> There is a secondary issue with regard to being an anti-corruption measure, but its stated intention is to have the effect of people releasing land, which is what I would like to see.  There is no point in getting rid of this windfall tax if people sit on land for two, three or four years as property prices increase.  If I were sitting on a piece of land which had been rezoned from agriculture to prime development and had to pay an 80% tax I would not sell it as I would not receive much benefit from doing so.  The Government is now stating it will get rid of this tax completely.  However, if I read any of the analysis I would know land prices are increasing and there is a chronic housing crisis in Dublin, so why would I release the land at this point in time?  There is no incentive for me to do so.<\/p><p> I genuinely suggest the Government examines the possibility of this on Report Stage.  It would not tie its hands because the year before it was due to finish the Government could decide to extend it, reduce the rate or abolish it.  The Minister for Finance has been quite clear since he took office that when we deal with financial measures it is not only with regard to raising or reducing tax and expenditure but trying to impact on the decisions people will make to affect other policies.  The reason we included this measure in our alternative budget was to encourage people to release land at this point in time.  The Minister of State has gone down this direction, but only half way.  The time part has been left out and I genuinely encourage him to include it.  The housing crisis has many components, but we need to get over this hurdle.  Including a time limit would create an incentive to release this land at this point in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900020#U01100","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416402000,"counter":368,"content":"<p>Are there deadlines for the public consultation process which the Minister started?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900021#V00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1416402000,"counter":369,"content":"<p>No, he has not outlined it yet.

Quite rightly, he can list a number of examples of time limits for various initiatives and taxation measures.  The Minister has taken the view there is no need to do so for this measure.  It has been very obvious the windfall tax has been a barrier to transactions.  It was introduced, I accept, as an emergency measure at a time of crisis.  The property market is now stabilising, and perhaps normalising, and therefore we do not need barriers to property transactions.  As I outlined in my opening contribution, the Minister is adamant he is keeping this under close review, and there is no assurance for anybody that he will not reconsider it and he could introduce a levy at a later date.  This is a measure to remove a barrier to transactions.<\/p><p>  With regard to Dublin, it is worth saying that in the immediate timeframe there is no shortage of development land in Dublin.  The problem is the actual lack of development, which is where consultation on what we can do to stimulate development can play a role.  There is no shortage of development land in Dublin, but there is in other parts of the country.  According to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, enough land is zoned for housing and has planning permission in the Dublin area for 30,000 housing units, or four years of supply, if construction activity were to be increased.  We have enough land in Dublin.  We are cognisant that if land were rezoned in other areas where there is a need for development it would be subject to the windfall tax provisions, as would the zoning of land development land generally.  It is like the conversation we had earlier about trying out something in a Finance Bill.  We believe the windfall tax is no longer required.  We believe it is a barrier.  We do not see it necessary to include a time limit because we are clearly outlining the Minister for Finance will keep it under very close review and consider it in future finance Bills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900021#V00700","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416402000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>The Minister of State mentioned 30,000 housing units and stated there is enough land with planning permission for these.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900021#V00800","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1416402000,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Land zoned for housing and with planning permission in the Dublin area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900021#V00900","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416402000,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Any land we are dealing with here is already zoned for housing anyway.

While there may be land with planning permission, the problem is it is not going onto the market.  We need some of this land to flow to people willing to develop it for housing purposes.  The land about which we are speaking has been zoned for housing purposes.  My point is the Minister of State is simply wrong on this matter.  If he does not believe the land needs to come onto the market why are we getting rid of the windfall tax?  These people benefited from local authorities rezoning land.  The land should come onto the market, which is why the windfall tax should be reduced, but the Minister of State does not seem to want the land to come onto the market now, next month or the month after.  He speaks about incentives and a consultation process which will be launched sometime in the future to incentivise people to release land and develop it.  This is a very simple measure.  I do not understand the Government's rationale for not including a Cinderella clause.  We will agree to differ.

The first suggestion is that the residential element of the relief be broadened out to those who are not ordinarily resident in the property and the second is that the application of the relief be broadened out beyond the six cities which the Minister for Finance currently has in mind.<br\/>On the first suggestion, I must re-emphasise that the purpose of the living cities initiative is to encourage families to return to live in the centre of these cities.  The Deputy's proposed amendment would, in the view of the Minister for Finance, reverse the intention behind the initiative.  The suggestion that the relief could be granted to someone who is not the owner or occupier would potentially encourage speculators back into the market.  This scheme is not intended to appeal to property investors or speculators.  I know that these are not the people which Deputy McGrath has in mind but that could be an unintended consequence of what he proposes.  Even those who do not support the initiative would agree that we do not want to arrive at that point.<br\/>Lest there is any confusion about this I should point out that the properties in question do not have to be occupied at the time the renovation work is done.  As we all know, in many instances they could not be occupied.  A derelict building would have to be made habitable before it could be occupied and the relief would only commence when it is occupied as a residence.  The relief is limited to owners and occupiers and does not and will not apply to landlords or speculators in the private rented sector.  We have seen in the past where difficulties can arise when tax incentives are provided on a wide-ranging basis.  When the Minister for Finance announced the living city initiative in the Finance Bill 2013, he stated that it was a scheme with a specific purpose to develop and reinvigorate run-down areas of our city centres.  The scheme was to be targeted at houses more or less on a street-by-street basis and was aimed at attracting families back to city centre locations.<br\/>The second element of Deputy McGrath&rsquo;s amendment is that the owner-occupier relief should be extended to all pre-1915 houses in towns with a population of 10,000 or more.  Again, the Minister has concerns around implementation of this in practice.  For example, if this was to be done, every pre-1915 house in the city of Dublin could avail of the relief and relief would be granted to some of the most affluent areas of our cities and towns.  The Minister is concerned that this could result in wastage of tax expenditures in areas which do not need regeneration.  This initiative is aimed primarily at urban renewal and regeneration.  We have to target the parts of our cities which are in decline and need help.  For this reason we are consulting the local authorities to identify the specific areas most in need of help.  This is a targeted initiative.  We cannot go back to large-scale property reliefs and any future schemes should always be subject to a comprehensive <i>ex ante<\/i>cost-benefit analysis.  For these reasons, I cannot accept Deputy McGrath's amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900022#W00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416402600,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I support the idea of trying to bring people back to living in the cities.

This report will form the basis of the submission to the European Commission for state aid approval.

I believe that in terms of properties in need of repair, the eastern side of the town of Bray would benefit more from this scheme than would Galway or Kilkenny cities.  I am not suggesting either of those cities should be excluded but I am intimately familiar with both of them and I do not believe they comprise as many derelict properties as the town of Bray.

The Minister of State said that the primary focus of this initiative, which has been three years in the making, is to encourage families to come back to live in the city centres.  The removal of the obligation on somebody who is availing of this type of tax relief, which is very generous over a ten-year period, to incur expenditure on the living quarters of a premises which facilitates them to live in it means that work does not comply with the stated intention of the living city initiative.

His amendment appears to have been designed to reinstate this element as well as deleting the requirement that claimants, under the commercial element of the initiative, must provide certain information to Revenue before a claim can be made.<\/p><p> Far from diluting the residential element of this initiative, the scheme is now being extended to single storey pre-1915 dwellings and we are no longer only talking about Georgian property.  Previously, this scheme had only been available to properties of two or more storeys.  There will be more residential properties that will fall within the ambit of this scheme.  The element of this scheme, about which Deputy Doherty has a concern, is only a minor part of the scheme itself.  There is a residential element for owners and occupiers and, apart from the extension to single-storey dwelling, this has remained the same from the beginning.<\/p><p> Separately, there is a commercial element, which complements but stands apart from the residential part.  I want to make it clear that this has always been part of the scheme from the beginning.  This is not a new element.  There was a small area of overlap, which applied when a commercial operation was intended to be located in what was originally a Georgian house.  It could only occupy the ground or basement floors with residential owner-occupier relief being claimed on the upper storeys.  The proprietor of the commercial premises did not have to live above the shop.  It could be somebody else.<\/p><p> There are good reasons the Minister is proposing to change this: first, the introduction of single-storey buildings into the scheme will have made that restriction irrelevant in many cases; second, with the benefit of hindsight, the Minister concluded that the restriction is an unnecessary complication which will have little or no effect on the scheme as there has always been a commercial element to the scheme; and, third, the aid limit on the commercial element of the scheme, introduced in the Finance Bill, will ensure that the initiative will not result in large-scale commercial developments.  This is not about allowing for a large-scale commercial benefit.  It is about trying to bring life back into the cities.<\/p><p> The types of commercial developments which the Minister, Deputy Noonan, had envisaged operating in these special regeneration areas are small retail operations and other small-scale local services.  These elements work together.  In the long term, it will not be possible to have one without the other.  People will not move back to live in these city centre locations if the local services are absent and retail activity will not be sustained in the absence of a vibrant  resident community - both need each other.<\/p><p> The second element of Deputy Doherty's amendment proposes to remove the requirement for prospective claimants to provide certain details to Revenue in advance of a claim being made.  This information will be used to measure how successful the initiative has been, how many residences have been refurbished, and how many commercial operations have been set up as well as ongoing Exchequer costs.  Information gathering, as the Deputy will appreciate, is increasingly a feature of EU state aid rule compliance, and it cannot be ruled out that the EU will require detailed information about the operation of this initiative in the future.  Obviously, we are eager to ensure we get that state aid approval.  The provision of this information will also enable Revenue to better supply data in answer to parliamentary questions on the cost and take up of this initiative which is important in terms of accountability to this House.<\/p><p> In summary, and for the reasons I have outlined, the Minister is not in favour of those proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900022#W01200","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416403200,"counter":394,"content":"<p>First, to clarify, the second part of my amendment which the Minister of State read out, which was ruled out of order, is a typographical error.

We have extended that to consider single-storey dwellings.  There is not the same synergy as having the commercial element downstairs and the residential part upstairs.

The purpose of the change in company residence rules is to bring Ireland's rules into line with the rest of the OECD jurisdictions and to address the potential reputational damage arising from the use of corporate structures commonly referred to as the double Irish.  A six year transitional period is provided for in the Bill to give existing companies a reasonable time frame to plan and re-organise their business structures.<\/p><p>The proposed Committee Stage amendment will address concerns that the commencement provisions in the Bill as published could be circumvented so that shelf companies or other such companies incorporated before 2015 could be acquired and re-used as non-resident companies in new business operations set up after 2014 and thereby avail of the transitional period.  This amendment will prevent such a scenario and will ensure that the transitional period is only available to companies with real and substantive business operations in place at the end of 2014.  The amendment replaces the existing subsection (2) in the Bill with a new subsection (2) to provide for the revised commencement arrangements.<\/p><p>I should emphasise that the new subsection does not change the commencement date of 1 January 2015 for companies incorporated on or after that date nor does it change the commencement date after 31 December 2020, for companies incorporated before 1 January 2015, which have real business operations established before the end of the year.<\/p><p>My amendment essentially introduces a two-step test to provide that the non-resident status may not apply if, first, there is a change in the ownership of a company incorporated before 2015 and second, there is a major change in the business of the company.  Where these two events occur during the transition period, the transition arrangements will cease to apply and the new rules on company residence will apply from the date of the change of ownership.  This should deter the acquisition or transfer of companies for use as non-resident companies in new structures that are set up after this year in order to avail of the transitional period.  This amendment will ensure that where there is an ongoing business in the company that was established before the end of 2014, the non-resident status will not change even if ownership of the company changes during the transition period.  In particular, this should allow mergers or acquisitions of existing companies that are undertaken for bona fide commercial reasons to avail of the transition arrangements.<\/p><p>In summary, the revised commencement provisions will ensure that existing projects can continue to avail of the old residence rules for the transitional period up to the end of 2020, while new projects which are set up from the 1 January 2015, will be subject to the new residence rules, as was originally intended.

Removing the element of the structure which gives it the double Irish name should help restore our international reputation in the context of current EU and OECD initiatives to combat aggressive tax planning. <\/p><p>  It is not claimed that this change will bring an end to international tax planning.  For that to happen - this is a point the Minister has consistently tried to make - co-ordinated action by many countries working together will be required.  That is the reason Ireland will continue to engage constructively on this issue at both OECD and EU initiative levels.  What we are doing here is trying to protect reputation, but also trying to take stock of our position in terms of our overall foreign direct investment offering - the three Rs, the rates, the regime and the reputation.  The rate is 12.5% and is non-negotiable.  We discussed earlier how the effective rate is close to the headline rate.  Other countries cannot necessarily say the same.  We have also talked about the regime, in terms of foreign earning deductions, SARP and the potential for the \"knowledge box\".  On reputation, we need to ensure that when countries locate here in the context of ongoing global initiatives, they know their corporate reputation can be protected and enhanced by doing business here.<\/p><p>  Deputy Doherty asked why there is a transitional period of six years.  The transition period, which will end in 2020, is provided in order to give existing companies a reasonable timeframe to plan and reorganise their business structures.  The 1 January 2015 effective date for new companies is to accommodate companies that may already have been at an advanced stage of planned investment in Ireland when the change was announced on budget day.  One of the key strengths of the Government's strategy on corporation tax has always been certainty and Deputy McGrath referred to this.  This certainty now applies not only to our 12.5% rate, but also to all aspects of corporate tax regime, including our rules on company residence.<\/p><p>  I believe Ireland has seized first mover advantage, but this is an ongoing process.  What other countries will do is a question for other countries, but rather than waiting for a process to arrive at a final destination, Ireland has moved through the budget and this Finance Bill to bring certainty.  Furthermore, the amendments we propose today will ensure nobody can attempt to circumvent in any way, shape or form the date of 1 January 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900027#BB00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416405600,"counter":487,"content":"<p>The Minister of State mentioned that no new companies can avail of this provision now and that no off the shelf companies can change ownership and so on.

The core point is that the double Irish is something that has been pushed in the past.  I acknowledge there have been different opinions from the Opposition, but Sinn F&eacute;in and some Independents have been raising the issue in the context of the reputational damage the double Irish has caused.  The Minister did not respond to international tax practice.  On the double Irish he said: \"while it exists, it cannot be remediated by changes in Irish tax law.\"  This has nothing to do with BEPS.  He said categorically in the D&aacute;il that Irish tax law could not end the double Irish.<\/p><p>  Let me give another example.  In January 2013, he said: \"The problem with the so-called 'double Irish' from Ireland's point of view is that it has that name.\"  Consistently, the basic argument from the Department has been that we could do nothing to end the double Irish.  Now it is being ended and I welcome that, although I am not completely happy with the phase-in dates.  However, the fundamental point is that the Minister has been feeding the public and the Opposition untruths that the legislation could not end the double Irish.  That is disrespectful to Parliament and to his colleagues.<\/p><p>  In the face of legislation presented that would end the double Irish, the Minister said categorically - doing so from the seal of office of the Minister - that legislation could not end the double Irish.  I believe it is important it is stated here - I know that as a member of Fine Gael and Minister of State in the Department the Minister of State will not do it - that the Minister was wrong when he stated that Irish legislation could not end the double Irish, both in October 2012 and in January 2013.  He said the same outside of the House as well.<\/p><p>  The core point is that the Minister and the Government want to create the impression that it had nothing to do with us, and that it should have been called something else rather than double Irish.   The suggestion is, \"why the hell did it end up being called double Irish and with us poor creatures over here getting all this flak from our European masters, from America and all of that and sure we cannot do anything about it, because it is a mismatch\".  There are two sides involved in any mismatch.<\/p> <p> However, one side can move to eradicate the mismatch.  That is what happened here and that is what is happening in terms of the tax code.  I am sure that the type of bluff that the Minister came out with on the floor of the D&aacute;il - or in October 2012 or January 2013 - does not wash with any of the people who are challenging the rate or some of the advantages we confer on certain multinational companies, when we know now that was not the case.  It certainly does not wash with me.  It is disrespectful and it should be acknowledged that the Minister was wrong.  I believe he did it intentionally and deliberately.  Either that or the Minister is a fool and did not know that Irish legislation could end the double Irish.  I would rather believe the Minister for Finance is not a fool.  I would rather believe he did it intentionally because he did not want to create the impression that we can stop this and go against those who, for their own selfish reasons, want to put pressure on Ireland's taxation regime.  However, the Minister has heightened that pressure by not dealing with this properly, trying to obfuscate and trying to say it had nothing to do with us and that it is just the name.  People who understand this know well that the Minister is talking nonsense and the legislation before us proves that to be the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900027#BB01700","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416406200,"counter":503,"content":"<p>Some of the Deputy's language was unfortunate and out of character.

The economic markets looking at Ireland and the turnaround of the Irish economy would not call the Minister a fool.<\/p><p>  We are dealing with a complex issue.  We all know international tax is a complicated issue.  There are many double taxation structures in place around the world.  We are unfortunate ours had a very catchy name - the \"double Irish\".  There are countless examples of double taxation standards and double mismatches, if one likes, of international tax.  The Minister has made the point - I make the point - the Government has made the point and any objective observer would make the point that Ireland on its own cannot end double tax structures.  However, Ireland could and did take measures in this legislation to end the potential damage to our reputation as a result of that label.  That does not mean that double taxation structures have all of a sudden gone away.  Either Deputy Doherty or Deputy Boyd Barrett referred earlier to other countries which already have such structures.  <\/p><p>  The Minister has made a decision.  I appreciate the Deputies do not like the timeline but they support the decision.  I respect Deputy McGrath's position on the importance of certainty and I have tried to respond to that.  However, the amendments and section we are dealing with today is a progressive step forward.  It gives Ireland first mover advantage.

However, the Government and the Minister have hidden the truth about the complicity of the Irish tax system in aggressive tax avoidance by major multinationals.  There can be no doubt about that.  A two-tiered approach to a taxation liability was underlying this.  In general, in the tax code, if a company was incorporated here it was liable to tax here.  However, that was not the case for these multinationals.  We allowed the situation to persist and pretended there was nothing we could do about it.  That is dishonest.  It is a dishonesty which flowed from the dogmatic and obsessive commitment of this Government, the main Opposition party and much of the political establishment in this country to doing whatever the multinationals want.  They were afraid to challenge them in any way for fear they might run away.  This cosy arrangement with the multinationals has persisted for quite a number of years.  It was finally challenged following the election of people to the D&aacute;il who were willing to question it and we have now discovered the truth.  That put pressure on the Government to change things.  The problem is that the multinationals then get six years to find another way around paying tax.  This is completely unacceptable and extraordinary.<\/p><p>  Many signals have been sent and assurances made.  That is how I read some of the comments made in the last couple of weeks on foot of the announcement about the abolition of the double Irish.  These were reassuring sounds from the Government to the multinationals.  They are not to worry as they will not have to pay any more.  They will have six years to work out how to deal with it and, in any event, the Government will work on a knowledge box on which the multinationals will have an input to ensure it does not hurt their interests.

The Government has said or done very little to convince me that is not the case.  The commitment by this Government has been steadfast.  It, like previous Governments, has been reluctant to look under the rock that is our corporate tax system and see the worms and maggots there.

The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the provisions of section 626B cannot be used by Irish resident individuals and trusts to avoid a charge to tax imposed under section 590 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.<br\/>Section 590 is an anti-avoidance provision which attributes certain chargeable gains, made by a non-resident company, to Irish-resident participators in that company.  The purpose of section 590 is to prevent persons from avoiding capital gains tax by transferring property to a non-resident controlled company.<br\/>It has come to Revenue's notice that some individuals are seeking to invoke section 626B, which exempts certain disposals of shares by companies from capital gains tax, in order to avoid a charge to tax under section 590.  There is considerable tax at risk in respect of the cases of which Revenue is aware at present, with the potential to run to millions of euro.<br\/>Revenue's position is that the exemption provided by section 626B and a related exemption in section 626C, which provides a similar exemption in respect of gains on the disposal of asset relating to shares, do not apply in circumstances where a gain accrues to a company but is attributed to an Irish resident individual by section 590.

The original definition already excluded farm houses and mansion houses unless they were derelict and unfit for human habitation.  The relief up to now has been targeted at the sale of outlying land parcels with their replacement by closer lying land parcels in regard to the main landholding with a view to reducing the total number of land parcel and improving to productivity and viability of the holding.  It would not have been expected that those transactions would involve many buildings, if any.<\/p><p>  In the budget last month, the Minister announced that Teagasc certification guidelines are being amended to enable whole farm replacement to be eligible for the relief, subject to meeting the conditions laid down by Teagasc.  The exclusion of buildings from relief in a whole farm replacement situation may be more relevant.  However, from the commencement of the relief, farm houses and mansion houses have been excluded.  An individual may be able to avail of capital gains tax principal private residence relief on the sale of the farm house.  Furthermore, the non-farm house buildings may well be depreciating assets and so would not generate a chargeable gain.  The exclusion of buildings is necessary to address concerns for EU state aid compliance and the Minister does not expect it to impact significantly on the operation of relief measures for those reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900029#DD02200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416406800,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I am confused as to what the EU issue is in regard to these particular building.

This covers a number of issues throughout the Bill, including long-term leases, retirement relief, capital acquisitions tax relief for young farmers, and single farm payment disposal, which is referred to in section 45.  The difficulty relates to the definition of an active farmer.<\/p><p>  In my part of the country, in counties like Roscommon, Leitrim, and Galway, the majority of farmers are part-time.  The definition of an active farmer under the legislation as it stands is that they must spend at least 50% of their time actively farming.  Because of the farm sizes we have and the capacity of those farms, especially those on marginal land, to generate a sustainable income, farmers are required to work off-farm to supplement that income.  One can see right across the annual Teagasc income studies the importance of off-farm income.  This is particularly the case in my constituency where many farmers work with Bord na M&oacute;na as seasonal workers.  Many of them would fail this test even though they are full-time farmers except for the seasonal work they do with Bord na M&oacute;na.<\/p><p>  The majority of farmers in the west - about six out of ten - are part-time farmers.  The objective behind all of this is farm consolidation.  It is about transferring farm holdings to younger farmers, who are more energetic and can increase production.  We need that in the west more than anywhere in the country.  We have fragmented holdings and an old farmer population, and it is difficult to get young farmers to take over holdings.  There is huge potential for efficiencies in agricultural production, but the active farmer definition as it stands would limit this.  I know the Minister has indicated that he will look into this, but there are no amendments to it before us, and he might clarify exactly the position and his intention.

Is it based on a 40-hour week in which case somebody who is farming for 20 hours a week or more will meet the definition and the difficulty can be overcome?  If not, given the number of hours that many people in farming work, the time spent working on the farm and in another form of employment could be more than 40 hours a week and the person might fall foul of the 50% test.

That is reasonable.  Any active farmer would work for approximately 2.5 hours a day.  That classification would be acceptable to farming groups, but the present definition is not acceptable.  I raised this on Second Stage in respect of farmers with small holdings, particularly on disadvantaged land, who would not have enough income to sustain themselves and need off-farm income.

This section does not refer specifically to active farmers.  My amendment No. 83 deals with the concerns expressed by many Deputies, including those present, and by the farming organisations.  The farming organisations and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have agreed that the terms of this amendment will meet their concerns.<\/p><p>  The Chairman asked me to refer to the farm tax review.  In the 2013 budget, I announced that we were doing a full review of the tax measures put in place over a variety of budgets to enhance and encourage farming and the agri-food business to see were they still fit for purpose.  In other words, were they still achieving what was intended.  The review was very good.  The farming organisations co-operated fully and came up with a report in which there are four recommendations that require further discussion with the stakeholders and we will have that discussion.  Commercial farmers and the farming organisations received the rest of the recommendations quite well.  Those are the recommendations that made up the agri-food farming tax package in the budget and in this Bill.  We were very pleased to do that.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the policy falls into two areas.  The first is to ensure that the transfer of farmland to the next generation of dynamic, energetic farmers could be achieved more easily and made more affordable to farming families.  They were well received.  There is an emphasis in the recommendations on leasing.  If one could not get permanent transfers leasing was good option.  The conacre system where one had land for only 11 months does not encourage investment.  Leasing for up to 15 years and the tax benefits that go with that were enhanced.<\/p><p>  Income averaging is another serious concern for farmers  because in farming one can have a middling year, a very good year, another middling year and then maybe two bad years.  How does one average income?  We considered various schemes in other countries.  We ended up changing the income averaging mandate that is in the tax code from three to five years.  That is of significant help.  One saw the beef crisis this year.  I presume that following the trends in milk prices in New Zealand and on the international milk market, something similar will happen with milk over the winter but it will be short term.  Averaging income and matching good years with bad years is essential to encourage farming as an industry, to make it worthwhile to be in it, and to encourage investment.<\/p><p>  Everything was fine until the question of the definition of the active farmer came up.  I examined it when Deputies brought it to my attention.  Deputies on all sides of the House contacted me, formally and informally.  The original definition of the active farmer was somebody who spent at least half of his time farming and the presumption was that we were talking about a 40 hour week.  It is reasonable to assume that somebody could spend 20 hours farming by spending an hour after work in the evening and spending another ten at the weekends because farming is the kind of activity where, unfortunately for young farmers, a bit of Sunday work is always required, especially on dairy farms.  The Deputies are very familiar with how that works.  It was also a trust system.  No one from the Revenue Commissioners or Teagasc was going to chase around with a watch to see whether somebody spent 20 hours on the farm.  It looked reasonable.  However, the farming organisations, individual Deputies and farmers are seeking additional assurance.<\/p><p>  In addition to the 50 hours dedicated to farm work, there are three other measures, some of which we had already.  The first test will be 50 hours on the farm.  If one is a qualified farmer, that is, one who has been certified after pursuing one of those courses with which the Deputies are familiar, there is no hours test.  It is sufficient to be a qualified farmer and have the ability to farm the land commercially.  Then one qualifies for the benefits in the legislation, which includes stamp duty, capital acquisitions tax and so on.  They all run on the same definitions.<\/p><p>  The second definition was if one worked off the land, for example, if the young farmer, qualified or not, was in Dublin and leased his land to a qualified farmer, whether he qualified under the 50% rule or the qualified farmer rule, the benefits would apply as long as the lessor qualified under the active definition.  The third definition meets the concerns of Deputies McGrath and Doherty.  If, for example, somebody, who was off the land for several years and had no qualification leading to certification, inherited on a sudden death the kind of thing that usually happens in rural Ireland and is unable to avail of it we have introduced a measure whereby somebody can qualify in the three subsequent years.<\/p> <p>There is a three-year window where one can qualify.<\/p><p> The purpose of the measures is not to raise taxes or have additional revenue.  It is to put incentives in place so that farmland does not lie fallow but is used to best purpose and farmed commercially.  It is an honour system in that nobody will be chasing around after people.  It provides an incentive to put land in the hands of people who will farm it commercially or are qualified to do so.  When we get to amendment No. 83 we can go through it again.  I assume the Deputy is in a bit of a hurry this evening with all the other things he has to do.  That is the position, if that satisfies his question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900031#FF00400","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416408300,"counter":550,"content":"<p>Yes it does satisfy the question and I thank the Minister.

We have raised this time and again and there were clear indications from a previous Minister of State and the Minister that this would be considered when the on-line element was up and running, as is now the case.  It is appropriate that we examine the possibility of a 3% rate and the provisions that would allow for that to be placed on the customer instead of the shop.  A number of betting outlets across the State find it difficult to maintain their presence as a result of the move to on-line gambling, which is understandable.  They incur a betting duty and a 3% duty placed on the customer, as it was years ago, would not only benefit the Revenue Commissioners through an additional tax take but it would provide a reprieve for those shops.  They are saving the 1% that they must find from their own profits, so it would be a 1% boost for them in effect.<br\/>We should consider this measure and the 3% rate is appropriate.  It is at a level where larger outlets would not be able to take on the costs and it would force them to pass it to the customer.  Anybody going into a bookmaker's office would not see a 3% charge as unique.  If a person uses BETDAQ or Betfair, that person is already paying charges for the laying of bets.  If appropriate, the levy could be put on winnings.  Over 93% of money taken in by betting shops are paid out in winnings so almost 100% would be recouped in the betting duty element.  The Government has in the past indicated it was open to such a measure and now is the time to consider the options for increasing betting duty, with the levies put on the customer instead of the business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900033#HH01300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1416408900,"counter":580,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 67 requests a report on the options on the introduction of a 3% betting duty for both on-line and in-shop bets.  There have been a number of calls for an increase in the rate of duty applying to betting.  However, I have always maintained that my preferred approach has been to first put a regulatory regime in place for the sector and to extend the base on which the 1% rate applies, ensuring the tax is applied fairly and widely on a level playing field for all.  This is being put in place by the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013.  All taxes are reviewed on an ongoing basis by officials from my Department and the Revenue Commissioners and this will be no different.  When we can be sure that we have in place a framework that captures all betting, all other options, including rate increases, can be considered.  However, the priority is to extend the tax to the remote sector.  I will not accept the amendment for those reasons.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 68 replaces section 21 of the Betting Act 1931 and provides for the extension of opening hours for registered bookmakers&rsquo; premises from 7 a.mm to 10 p.m. year round, subject to closure on Good Friday and Christmas Day.  It also provides for penalties where these opening hours are contravened.  These provisions are contained in the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013, which is currently before the Seanad.  However, issues raised by the EU Commission and Malta under the EU Technical Standards Directive means that the Bill is in standstill and will not now be enacted before the end of the year.  It is necessary to provide for the extension of opening hours in the Finance Bill to provide certainty for the bookmaking industry, which estimates that the existing restricted opening hours from September to March result in some 500 jobs being lost annually in the industry.  I commend this amendment.<\/p><p>  The betting Bill was introduced to the Seanad on the basis that it would clear the European Commission by the end of September or early October.  At that stage, Malta launched an objection, as is its right, so the Bill is further delayed while the Commission examines Malta's objection.  The reason for the objection would be well known to most Deputies, as it has an extensive on-line industry and does not wish us to follow through on our proposals.  Malta cannot delay us indefinitely and I understand the Commission will make a decision some time in the new year, as the standstill period runs out in the first week of January 2015.  We can complete the Bill in the Seanad at that stage before returning to the D&aacute;il.  I brought forward the element of the Bill that extended opening hours for traditional bookmakers because 500 people are losing their jobs because they are regarded as temporary or seasonal staff, as they are not retained during winter months.  This will allow bookmakers to retain such staff for the winter months.<\/p><p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty's proposal takes us back to a time when there was a more serious levy on betting.  Currently, a bookmaker would absorb the levy but in the olden days, when I was in a bookmaker's office more often than recent years, the option was to pay the tax on the wager or the winnings.  If the tax was paid on the wager, it became part of the bet, so it accumulated in the winnings.  That was one way of doing it.  The levies do not now apply to winnings but rather to turnover.  Bookmakers are subject to normal corporation profits tax, so this would be an additional tax.<\/p> <p>It is an additional tax and if one makes an assumption as to how much of a bookmaker's turnover is profit, let us say 7% or 8% at most, although they will claim that it is significantly less, and one does the sums on that basis, a 3% levy on turnover becomes a very high levy on profits.  As the Deputy said himself, 93% of what they take in is given out in winnings.  If one applies this turnover charge to the profit margin, it may be excessive.  That said, I am prepared to discuss it.  We will be back in the new year, hopefully, to have a full debate on the betting Bill once it clears the stand still period in the Commission.  I am sticking to the 1% levy at the moment because I want to equalise the online market with the traditional bookmaker market.  I do not want to disadvantage the traditional bookmaker by not having a levy on the online area or by having a bigger levy on the traditional bookmaker.  I am open to the Deputy's input and advice on what he thinks an appropriate levy might be but the first step will be to place a 1% levy on online betting to equalise it with the levy on traditional bookmaking.  We will see what level of compliance we achieve.  If we have a proper base for the levy, we can then discuss whether it is in the interests of the betting and blood stock industries to increase that levy by 0.5% or 1%.  My intention, however, is not to do that at the introduction of the betting Bill when it passes all Stages in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il early in the new year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900033#HH01400","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416409500,"counter":582,"content":"<p>On the face of it, the proposal in amendment No. 67 appears reasonable in that the increase is modest.  However, I would fear that the larger operators in the industry would be able to afford that 3% levy at the expense of the smaller, independent operators who employ thousands of people.  We met some of those operators recently and they indicated very clearly that they would be against any increase in the levy.  They support what the Minister is doing with regard to online and exchange betting but argued that any move to increase the betting tax for betting shops around the country would have a negative effect on the smaller, independent operators while the larger operators who have a big online presence would be able to absorb such an increase.  The end result would be that betting shops across the country would be shut down, with the loss of thousands of jobs.<\/p><p>  The opening hours provision in amendment No. 68 from the Minister has been welcomed by the industry.  Industry representatives have given a commitment to increase the numbers they employ on the back of the extra hours their shops will be allowed to open.  It is important that we listen to the bookmaking industry because it is an important supporter of horse racing in Ireland.  If one attends race meetings anywhere in the country, one will see that the numbers attending have declined sharply in recent years.  In that context, it is important that we support bookmakers because they are the drivers of much of the sponsorship of horse racing.  There is an ongoing debate about the merits of the sponsorship of horse racing and sport in general by alcohol producers but bookmakers are ploughing lots of money into horse racing in this country.  Horse racing is arguably one of Ireland's most successful international sports and employs huge numbers of people.  We also have a significant horse breeding industry here.  Indeed, Ireland is one of the largest breeders of thoroughbred horses in the world, surpassing both the UK and France.  It is important that we listen to the bookmakers.  <\/p><p>  Again, while the increase proposed by Deputy Doherty is modest, it would have a detrimental effect on the smaller, independent operators across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900034#JJ00200","speaker":"1185"},{"type":"speech","time":1416409500,"counter":583,"content":"<p>My amendment would not have a negative impact on independent bookmakers across the country but would actually have a positive impact because the amendment is clear that the levy would be placed on the customer rather than the bookmaker.  At the moment, all independent bookmakers, large or small, are absorbing a 1% betting duty.  They are taking that out of their profits which, as the Minister has suggested, are currently around 7% before operating costs.  They have to absorb that 1% now but if we were to apply a 1.5%, 2% or 3% levy to the bookmakers, they would go out of business.  The point is to place the levy on the customer which in effect gives 1% back to the bookmakers because they would not have to pay that charge out of their profits.  They will be more profitable and it is the customer who would pay the charge.<\/p><p>  The Minister made reference to a turnover tax and he is correct about that in respect of online betting and so forth.  However, this is what operated in the past.  As the Minister mentioned, one could do it on the profits or on the bets.  In the past, the rates were 15%, then they were 10% for a long period, then 5%, were abolished totally at one stage and then reintroduced at 1%.  If a person goes into a bookmaker's shop to put &euro;10 on a horse, a dog or whatever, he or she will be charged 30 cent under my provision and the State gets that 30 cent.  The bookmaker does not have to pay it.<\/p><p>  This is a complex area, particularly with the development of online and exchange betting, and that is why we need a report on the area.  We are suggesting that a report be prepared on the options available in terms of applying this levy.  I understand the Minister's objective of capturing everybody first and then examining the rates but this was first mentioned in the Finance Bill 2011 and it still has not been applied.  In that context, I am concerned about the delay, although I understand the issues relating to the European Commission and so forth.<\/p><p>  I have engaged with many industry players on this issue.  When they heard that we wanted to increase the betting duty to 3%, their initial reaction was that this would put them out of business.  However, when we clarified that we wanted to increase the duty to 3% but apply it to the customer rather than the bookmaker, they argued that it would benefit them, save jobs and enable them to keep their premises open.  <\/p><p>  The Minister made reference to the level of tax and the amount of bets that are placed here.  In my view, it would be impossible for the industry to absorb a 3% levy.  Some of the larger operators may be able to absorb a 1.5% or 2% levy but 3% is probably beyond even their reach.  That is why it should be set at a level that does not allow the larger operators to absorb it because that will only force people to go to them to place their bets and would put pressure on the other operators.  <\/p><p>  It goes without saying that the fact that we do not have a gambling control Bill is simply not good enough.  That should have been developed alongside the original legislation that we passed last year.  That said, the Minister's amendment is to be welcomed.  It causes concern to the industry that longer operating hours for winter racing is not allowed at this point in time.  The original 1931 Act has a cut-off point of 6 p.m.   What system operated heretofore with regard to winter racing and winter betting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900034#JJ00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1416409500,"counter":584,"content":"<p>I wish to refer to amendment No. 68 too.

Amendment No. 68 proposes to extend the opening hours of bookmakers and I support that.

The issue should be dealt with in parallel with the extension of opening hours.  We have been told the Bill will not be ready for another six to eight months, which is regrettable.

The 1931 Act provided for closure on Sunday, Christmas Day and Good Friday.  Otherwise bookies' shops could stay open from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m.  The Finance Act 1998 provided that Christmas Day, Good Friday and Easter Sunday were the closed days and that opening hours were from 7 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. from September to March and 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. from April to August.  It was in that Bill that the idea of a more tolerant summer season was introduced.  The Finance Act 2007 provided that the opening hours from September to March would be up to 10 p.m. where race meetings took place.  That was in addition to the provisions of the 1998 Act.  The Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013, which I published, stipulated Christmas Day and Good Friday as closing days and opening hours from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. otherwise, and that is what we are doing now.  The 7 a.m. start time was contentious when introduced but the situation has settled down.  I do not know what trade there is at 7 a.m. but obviously there is some.  The amendment in my name now states the opening times as 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. all year round with the exception of Christmas Day and Good Friday.<\/p><p>  The reason I do not want to move unilaterally to put a levy on punters is that punters will change and go online.  The last time I was at a race meeting I was surprised to see so many people with accounts with online bookies and using their mobile phones to text in bets even from the racecourse rather than bet on course.  The online industry is huge.  If one looks at Paddy Power's annual report, and he is only one of them, one can see the amount of punting online which is not only on horse racing.<\/p><p>  There is some illegal betting all the time.  No matter how one cracks down on illegal betting, there will always be a friendly publican who will oblige and say he will run next door, when he gets a few minutes, to put a bet on with the bookies.  That does not usually happen.  If there is a 3% levy on winnings at the bookies then a punter will think why pay 3% on winnings when one can either go legal online or illegal with a local interested party whom one meets in the course of one's social life.  We must keep things going.  Whatever we do we will do it online and offline together and that is where I am positioned now.  There is 1% levy on traditional bookies and I am attempting to put 1% on online betting which is where we are being held up.  One of the things that puts one off the European system is when one sees how long it takes to get a simple process - something like this - concluded and when the delays are built in to help the non-compliant rather than the compliant.  That is another day's work.  That is my position on the matter.<\/p><p>  It is worth saying this is all a kind of subsection of the bloodstock industry.  The bloodstock industry in Ireland is world class.  It employs about 16,000 people but before the recession it employed in excess of 20,000.  The people in the bloodstock industry who brief me have told me that the Irish bloodstock industry is losing its world ranking.  They relate that slip to the fact that prizes for races in Ireland are comparatively low, especially for key races.  Also, the people with the more expensive and, consequently, better horses are not inclined to stay here because they will not race them here for the prizes that are available here.  The big competitors are the UK and, more important, France.  As the best of horses are not here, there is a tendency to move stallions out of the country.  There are many advantages in France which encourages people to move there, and the industry is greatly concerned.  That was why, when I thought we would have a reasonable revenue coming from the betting Bill, we increased the money available to the horse and greyhound racing fund by about &euro;6 million and promised to do so for three years in a row.  The horse end of the fund has about &euro;44 million at the moment, of which half was derived from betting because it had to be supplemented in recent years.  When the Irish bloodstock industry was ranked next to Kentucky and number one in Europe, it received about &euro;60 million from the fund.  My intention is to build up the fund over three years.  I have made the commitment to do so in a multi-annual budget and I would like to continue to do that.<\/p><p>  I am concerned about bookmakers and their employees in terms of job creation, but I am not somebody who backs horses usually.  I am more concerned about ensuring that we have the relationships with the revenue which arises from the bookmaking industry and bloodstock industry.  Ireland is rightly famous for its bloodstock and I would not like it if we lost our world ranking.  The people at the top of the industry, whom I saw before the budget, were very strongly of the view that this was now the case.  That is the context and it is important that Members know the context as we debate these issues.  I am no expert and I am open to advice from Members.  We will talk about the matter again when the betting Bill comes in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900035#KK00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1416410100,"counter":587,"content":"<p>To clarify, the Minister mentioned that people are betting online rather than betting in bookies' shops.

That replicates what is being done in terms of the legislation that has been passed but is being held up in Europe.  Detailed discussion and examination of options are required.  The Department does such work and I hope it will be able to look at options.  We have triggered or the Department or the Government have triggered different consultations on different measures in the past.  Introducing the rate would be worthwhile.  The Minister has outlined clearly the challenges faced by the horse racing industry, particularly in terms of dropping down the world ranking.

People who have a flutter and place a bet on black or red at the roulette table can afford to pay a betting duty of between 1% and 3%.  It is difficult to collect the duty but it is not impossible.  In the same way it is a bit of a headache to collect a 1% charge on online gambling but it will be done, hopefully successfully, when approval is obtained from the European Commission in respect of matters relating to remote access betting, and so on.<\/p> <p>All other types of gambling are not being taxed, so I suggest that we move into this area.<\/p><p> In the context of amendment No. 68, the Minister indicated what was amended in the 2013 legislation.

As the Minister is aware, this is a major issue in my constituency and across the west in general.  It is imperative that everything possible should be done to try to bring people to account in respect of this matter.  On Second Stage I stated that at present the average fine, on conviction, in respect of fuel laundering is &euro;2,900.  The amount of damage done to vehicles by those involved in petrol stretching is far in excess of this amount.  I am of the opinion that we need to review the penalties which apply.  A cap of &euro;5,000 applies in respect of District Court fines relating to summary convictions.  This should be made the minimum level of fine in respect of those who supply illegal fuel.  Such individuals should also be obliged to serve up to 12 months in prison.  I understand that the current specification which applies in the case of unleaded petrol - reference is made to this in section 51 - could allow for up to 10% kerosene to be blended into it and no one would be guilty of breaking the law.  As a result, there is a possibility that people involved in petrol stretching could escape conviction.  Is there a need to tighten up the definition in respect of petrol to ensure there is no loophole in this regard?<\/p> <p>Second, if it is the case that we cannot secure a criminal conviction, can the Minister of State ensure evidence collated by the Revenue Commissioners will actually be made available for a civil class action, if it is to take place?<\/p><p> The other aspect is that we need to ensure what has been occurring cannot happen again.  Petrol stretching has been occurring in continental Europe, including Poland, for years.  It seems the Revenue Commissioners have had their eye off the ball in regard to what is happening in other jurisdictions.  We should have tried to put some checks and balances in place.  Let me refer specifically to section 50.  The information required for diesel deliveries is far more detailed than that required for petrol deliveries.  There is actually a variation in the amounts of detail required to comply with the licensing regime currently in place under the Revenue Commissioners.  The returns made by filling stations are far more detailed for diesel deliveries they receive than for petrol deliveries.<\/p><p> I understand a distributor that operates here and in the United Kingdom actually took petrol from its fuel stations off the market in the United Kingdom earlier this year.  There is genuine concern that some of that fuel ended up on the market here in our network of filling stations.  I urge the Revenue Commissioners to investigate whether the company took petrol off the market in the United Kingdom, the reason for doing so and, if it was taken off the market, what happened to it subsequently.  We should have assurances that it was not distributed in our fuel network.<\/p><p> The final aspect that needs to be addressed, which I raised last night, is the need to put a fund in place to assist those who have had their vehicles damaged.  Many of them have third party insurance so the damage to their engines is not covered.  Those with comprehensive insurance who do not have no-claims bonus protection face higher premiums.  Some financial relief will have to be provided for them.  There have been cases where insurance companies did not pay people who were comprehensively insured.<\/p><p> In this context, something needs to be done for licensed retailers selling legitimate fuel.  Owing to the current rumour and innuendo, their businesses are being undermined.  I know of a legitimate fuel retailer that wants to reduce the price of petrol by 2 cent per litre but which is afraid to do so for fear it will be branded as a fly-by-night operator selling dodgy fuel.  This is a serious issue and it needs to be tackled very quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900036#LL04000","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416411300,"counter":629,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.05 p.m. and resumed at 6 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1416411600,"counter":630,"content":"<p>Would the Minister like to respond to Deputy Naughten?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900038#NN00100","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1416411600,"counter":631,"content":"<p>Yes.  I thank Deputy Naughten for his contribution.  I am aware, having received a series of parliamentary questions from Deputies west of the Shannon of the high incidence of petrol stretching there, to which I have given lengthy replies.<\/p><p>  On the supply chain data as reported by traders, forecourt retailers must report their petrol-diesel purchases on a monthly basis.  They report on a transaction by transaction and delivery basis.  This reflects the much greater incentive for diesel fraud as against petrol stretching.  In regard to the terms \"diesel laundering\" and \"petrol stretching\" there is a lot more profit to be made in laundering than there is in petrol stretching.  This is the reason for the different treatment of diesel and petrol.<\/p><p>  On the kerosene issue, it is illegal to add kerosene to petrol.  There is no tolerance of that.  Diesel can be detected in petrol because of the marker in kerosene.  From 31 March next a much more effective marker will be in use for all marked fuels, including kerosene.  This will make detection more effective.  As a result of a joint operation between our Customs and Excise driven by Revenue and the authorities in the UK a new marker that will be effective on both sides of the Border will be introduced.  Previously, as markers were developed, antidotes to them were developed.  The marker now developed is more effective and will come into play on 31 March next.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked about penalties.  The penalty in this regard is, on summary conviction, a fine of up to &euro;5,000 and 12 months maximum imprisonment or both.  If the case goes to indictment the fine is &euro;126,790, which is very large, and-or five years maximum imprisonment or both.  These fines were last updated in the Finance Act 2010.  Fines are a matter for the courts.  Fines have been increasing as the courts treat these matters more seriously.  In regard to the odd numbers issue, this arises out of indexing of the fines as introduced.  The figure of &euro;126,790 is a result of that.<\/p><p>  An extensive range of new measures have been introduced over recent years to tackle fuel fraud, including enhanced supply chain controls and the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker.  The key measures include: the strengthening of the licensing regime for auto fuel traders with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of fuel criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market; the introduction of a new licensing regime for marked fuel traders in October 2012, which is designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering; the introduction of new requirements in relation to fuel traders' records which have stopped movements and fuel deliveries and ensures data is available to assess supply chain analysis; and the introduction in January 2013 of new supply chain controls following significant investment in new IT systems.  These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.  Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution that will support follow up enforcement action, where necessary.  Intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the Border of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations, has also been introduced and increased.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners reviews its strategies in relation to fuel fraud on a continuous basis.  Where it identifies a need for legislative provisions to strengthen the legal framework for tackling illegal activity and protecting legitimate business these proposals will be considered carefully.  Action against the illicit oil trade in the period since 2011 has led to the detection and closure of more than 30 oil laundries and to the seizure of 3 million litres of illicit fuel.  In addition, more than 120 filling stations were closed for trading without a licence or for breach of licensing conditions.  All the indications, based on feedback from the industry and tax revenue from diesel consumption, are that these measures have been successful in tackling the laundering problem.  I have had discussions with the trade which is very complimentary about the actions taken by Revenue.  We get empirical evidence on the basis of excise from diesel and petrol.  This naturally would be increasing as the economy grows.  Eighteen months ago when the economy was either static or growing slowly there was a significant increase in petrol and diesel consumption.  The trade attributed this to the effectiveness of Revenue in putting the illegal traders out of business.  As a consequence, legal traders' sales have increased.  The next step is the introduction of the new marker.  If it is successful enforcement will be easier. <\/p> <p>If one has a marker that is easily identifiable, one can pinpoint illegal fuel or additives, such as kerosene, to stretch petrol.  The will is there with Revenue and the personnel is there with Customs and Excise.  It is the techniques that have been lacking for a while, because the laundering techniques were almost equal to the marker techniques, but I understand that has changed and the tests they have done on this particular marker hold out significant hopes that it will be a very significant weapon in the fight against fuel laundering.  I will ensure Revenue knows of the Deputy's concern, and that of our colleagues, about petrol stretching which, in the overall scheme of things, is kind of minor league activity compared to fuel laundering.  However, there have been widespread incidents in the west of Ireland and it wrecks engines, so I can see why there is such concern.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900038#NN00200","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416411900,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  He is right that much work has been done on diesel laundering and there is absolutely no doubt but that Revenue, customs and his Department are to be commended on that.  The new marker, which will be introduced in the new year along with the licensing which has been introduced, will make a significant difference.<\/p><p>  The Minister is also right that diesel laundering has more potential to undermine the finances of the State than petrol stretching but the difficulty is that from the consumer's point of view, petrol stretching has a far more dramatic impact and it happens far more quickly.  I know of one local garage which sees two cars per day with their engines seized up because they have been filled with petrol which has been stretched.  We are talking about in excess of 200 to 300 cars whose engines have completely seized up as a result of this.  Many of these people do not have the financial resources available to them to replace their cars.<\/p><p>  The Minister admitted in his response to me that there is different treatment in regard to the accounts which need to be submitted by petrol retailers to Revenue when dealing with diesel and when dealing with petrol.  The reason Revenue has been so focused on the issue of diesel is that there is a huge financial loss to the State.  The financial loss to the State is less from petrol stretching but the financial cost to consumers is significant and quite a number of people have been badly hit.  I know of a couple, both of whom are on the minimum wage, with an eight year old car and a ten year old car, which they used to get to work.  They had third party insurance and they do not know how they will get to work.  Christmas has been cancelled for that particular family.<\/p><p>  I need an assurance from the Minister that the Revenue Commissioners will now apply the same criteria in regard to accounting for petrol which currently apply to diesel to ensure that petrol supplies are being monitored in exactly the same way.

The Revenue Commissioners are active on the ground but it appears to me - I am open to correction and the Minister might comment on this - that their efforts are, by and large, in dipping motorists' cars to see what fuel they are burning, lest they be burning agricultural diesel when they should be burning the other type.  Is there sufficient impetus in Revenue to dip at forecourts?<\/p><p>  I listened to a Revenue official recently, on foot of a very welcome investigation on the Border where a very significant diesel laundering plant was uncovered, say there was a network of approximately 150 filling stations around the country where this diesel was regularly laundered.  This is not rocket science in that if one chases cheap diesel at the forecourt, one is very likely to run into this problem of laundered diesel, although, as Deputy Naughten said, there are operators who are striving to be as competitive as possible and who are doing so legitimately.  <\/p><p>  Revenue has scarce resources and as much as there is something to be gained from dipping motorists' cars at marts or wherever - the agricultural community seems to come under the spotlight - far more significant progress would be made at source if Revenue concentrated on dipping at the forecourt.  There should also be an obligation on forecourt operators to retain a sample from each filling they receive - maybe this is already the case - and details of who supplies them.  Revenue knows there are approximately 150 filling stations around the country which deal with this and are selling it at very competitive prices relative to their competitors, which is unfair, so it is not rocket science to target the scarce resources in that direction.  <\/p><p>  There is nothing we can do other than significantly ramp up the penalties in this legislation, if possible, on forecourt operators because they are putting their legitimate colleagues out of business, are costing the State a significant amount and are impacting very significantly on individual motorists.  The issue of Revenue and resources is probably an endless debate.  We have had the debate about cigarette smuggling.  I do not know whether it should involve a combination of Revenue and the Garda.  The old weights and measures section, which used to ensure one was getting a gallon of petrol when one bought one, could be involved in sampling.  <\/p><p>  We have a lot of State resources, including personnel, knowledge and equipment.  Could we be assured we are getting the maximum return from the effort being made and that it is adequately targeted?  I do not know if the Minister can answer that in detail but this is a significant cost to the Exchequer.  By the nature of the game, these people will always be a step ahead of the State.  One can have a car which is motoring fine but the next thing it will not go and one is faced with replacing it, something for which one has not budgeted, and that is a huge cost on any household.  It is happening quite a lot.  It is only since it happened to me in August that I have become aware of dozens of people to whom it has happened.  It is something on which we could make more progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900039#OO00300","speaker":"986"},{"type":"speech","time":1416411900,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I do not disagree with Deputy Creed.  Revenue has been quite successful and the success rate can be measured in the new measures it has taken but also in the fact that since 2011, 30 oil laundries have been closed down.  It has seized in excess of 3 million litres of illicit fuel and closed 120 filling stations for various breaches.  Revenue dips at filling stations but its principal success is due to a Finance Act in which we made it compulsory for people with oil firms for marked oil to make returns and for forecourts to make returns.  Fuel is now traced from the refinery, or the port of import, all the way through to the filling station.  If there are any discrepancies or anomalies in the supply line, that alerts Revenue and it investigates it, and that includes dipping in the forecourts.  Revenue has been quite good.<\/p><p>  As I said, the level of profit on laundering is much greater than on kerosene.  In the family of fossil fuels, such as diesel, petrol, kerosene, aviation fuel, heavy fuel oil and so on, kerosene and petrol are one step apart.<\/p> <p>It is possible for a motor engine to work properly with small additions of kerosene but it is illegal to do so.  People can stretch their fuel by adding kerosene but it is illegal to do so.  If one were to add 10% kerosene to a litre of petrol, with a ratio of 90% to 10% kerosene, the profit would be about 5 cent a litre.  However, the profit on diesel laundering is about 50 cent a litre.  In terms of the effort of work by Revenue, diesel laundering is a bigger threat to the revenue of the State and, therefore, Revenue is chasing it.  We have to measure the application of resources as well.  I will look at what the Deputy has advised and I will draw it to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners but there is this imbalance between the profitability of the two illegal activities.<\/p><p> I read out the list of penalties, which are quite extensive.  Sometimes it might be difficult to get proofs because a tank can be dipped at a filling station but it might be difficult to prove who put it into the tank and at what point in the supply chain the kerosene was added.  There seems to be a mismatch between the success of Revenue and the number of convictions achieved, and there is also a time lag.  Revenue is very conscious of this situation and it is pursuing it very vigorously.  We have been talking about getting an indelible marker, meaning that it could not be easily removed by some other chemical process.  As a result of shared research with the UK authorities, Revenue believes it  now has an indelible marker and it hopes this will be effective on cross-Border activities.<\/p><p> We must acknowledge another element in that much of this activity is driven by former subversives who are now criminals.  They have the strong arm and the heavy hand and intimidation is part of the process as well as chemistry degrees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900039#OO00400","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416412500,"counter":637,"content":"<p>The Minister is correct that from the point of view of the Exchequer there is a marked difference between the financial impact of diesel laundering and petrol stretching.

Hundreds of people have had their engines destroyed.  I have given the example of one garage which is taking in two vehicles a day.  Second-hand replacement petrol engines cannot be found.  New engines are being sought from the country of origin.  There is a deficit of replacement engines because of the large number of vehicles which have been destroyed in our part of the country.

I refer to the possible monthly deferment of the payment by Revenue.  What is the rationale?  Tax will be delayed for a year, not lost, but the measure will affect the deficit or budget figures.<\/p><p>  I ask about the robustness of the legislation to ensure that the type of activity such as diesel laundering is dealt with and clamped down on as much as possible.  I listened to officials from Revenue.  I reiterate that Revenue is one of the institutions of State, if it can be described as such, which has been unscathed by the financial crisis in that people have a great respect for Revenue even though some of them might end up on the wrong side of it.  It is a very efficient organisation which has done a good job.  I hope the incoming chairperson is as efficient as the outgoing chairperson.  Is the legislation sufficiently robust to deal with this issue?  Revenue officials spoke on the radio about the recent discovery in south Monaghan.  It appeared from what was said - this is subject to a court case - that the discovery seemed to have been made by chance, that a lorry was spotted parked where it should not have been and a surveillance operation was mounted.  The operation, which had been running for more than a year, has been stopped and put out of business, and that is welcome.<\/p><p>  I refer to recent information about another case in Monaghan which has collapsed.  I can speak freely about the case now.  A &euro;4 million fuel laundering plant was detected by Revenue in 2001 but the warrant issued was for fuel smuggling rather than fuel laundering.  Therefore, the two charges against the individuals were dropped.  They would have had an opportunity to defend themselves in court but the case collapsed as a result of the issuing of the wrong warrants.  Is the legislation sufficiently robust to ensure that similar cases are not dropped for such reasons in order that at least they would make it to a court hearing?  This is a matter of concern.  I do not know who is to blame for the fact that the warrant was issued incorrectly.  It is not just an issue for Revenue as it has happened in other cases over the years.<\/p><p>  I was somewhat surprised that in the same radio interview it was suggested that criminal gangs have in their possession and actually own 150 outlets for laundered diesel in the State.  I could be wrong because it could be that number in the island as a whole.  These outlets are fronts.  I note that one of the amendments states that an operation must be working for profit and therefore is not a front for these activities.  If these are fronts to distribute washed diesel, how soon after the enacting of this legislation would the 150 operations be taken out of circulation?  Revenue has a list of suspected outlets but it does not seem to have the powers or the intelligence information to close them down.  From talking to individuals I am now very careful about where I stop for fuel.  Many smaller fuel operators are completely legitimate and people may be avoiding going to them and filling up in Topaz or Applegreen instead.  There is a suspicion and a fear among customers.  Can the Minister offer any reassurance that these illegal petrol outlets will be closed in a timely manner?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900040#PP00500","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1416412500,"counter":641,"content":"<p>The current laws are adequate.  It is just that the practice has been very widespread.<\/p> <p>The Revenue Commissioners are of the view that it is decreasing.  If they have <i>prima facie<\/i>evidence or even a suspicion that a particular station is selling laundered diesel or illegal fuel of some sort, they follow it up.  They are not standing back and saying, &quot;We know the names and addresses of 120 petrol stations that we think are trading in illegal fuel and we are not acting&quot;.  They closed 120 and they continue that work.  The first source of their information would be following the supply chain.  If 4,000 litres or 5,000 litres of diesel are being delivered to some country cottage with a shed at the back every week, one does not need to be Sherlock Holmes to be suspicious that they are not using it for the lawnmower.  Getting the information on the supply chain has been very effective.<br\/>They also work in another way.  If somebody like Deputy Creed had his engine destroyed, he would think about where he might have got the fuel.  Some people report to the Revenue Commissioners that their engine was destroyed as a result of getting fuel in a particular filling station.  They will follow that up as well.  They have no reluctance to follow up.<br\/>Petrol stretching relates more to gifted amateurs and local criminals, but diesel laundering is part of the national conspiracy we inherited from the Troubles in the North to a very large degree.  It is more prevalent in Border counties than elsewhere, but it has also spread right into the south of the country.  They own diesel trucks that ply the roads of the Republic and deliver to stations.  They may own a petrol station or may lease it.  There may be a former sympathiser who is now owning or leasing it.  The Revenue Commissioners are trying to break into that network.  It is not always easy to do so but they will continue to do so.  The proofs are difficult, but the marker should be easy.<br\/>My amateur understanding of this is as follows.  The marker was a coloured dye in green diesel or red diesel and the laundering simply washed out the dye using a chemical process.  The diesel then looked legitimate.  It did not look like home heating oil or agricultural diesel.  We went through a phase where as they kept changing markers, the process of laundering kept changing as well.<br\/>In the past two years, they did some serious scientific research.  I remember telling members two or three years ago that they had a very good marker and they found that if the diesel was stored in plastic containers for some reason or other, the contact between the plastic and the marker acted as a kind of antidote and nullified the marker so that did not work.  However, they have tested this rigorously in the way one tests scientific products.  They are quite optimistic that when they introduce this new marker on 31 March 2015 it will be successful, but the campaign goes on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900040#PP00600","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416413100,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I commend the Revenue Commissioners on the work they are doing in this area.

I urge the Revenue Commissioners to use every weapon in their armoury to get to grips with the issue.  Clearly, they need to use their very extensive powers.

In that interview he referred to 115 rogue fuel stations operating across the country.  I want reassurance that there is an operation in place regarding each of those.  I assume there is because I am sure the Revenue Commissioners would not have this list and be doing nothing about it.  The numbers of petrol stations closed in the past have not been anywhere near that figure.  I believe the report published in April mentioned 30 stations that were closed down last year.  Some of them may not be controlled by the criminal gangs this individual was discussing because they can also be closed down for other reasons.<\/p><p>  I want reassurance that there is an operation and that the Revenue Commissioners are focused on the issue and have the required powers.

Not casting any aspersions on other schools of dancing, but the idea ballet would be rated at 0% while Irish dancing is not exempt does not create a fair playing field in this regard.  I have seen documentation from the Revenue Commissioners on providing educational facilities.  Irish dancing lessons are not provided by a recognised cultural body.  If there is genuine willingness on the part of the Government to exempt Irish dancing schools from VAT it would be possible to do so.  I note no list of educational establishments for VAT exemption exists . It is dealt with on the basis of teaching methods as standards for equivalent content, and teaching methods and standards in educational establishments recognised in the State.  This is an important measure at any time, but in particular as we approach the centenary of 1916.

If it had obtained an exemption from VAT it probably would have made quite a difference to its prospects for survival.

It seems strange that Europe would say it will give a VAT exemption to member-owned golf club green fees but it will not give it to something like this or Irish dancing.  It does not add up.  I do not understand the logic of the policy.

The supply of services and goods to non-profit making organisations for the production of events or monuments designed to commemorate the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising.&quot;.&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>This relates to a VAT exemption for the supply of services and goods to non-profit making organisations for the production of events or monuments designed to commemorate the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising.  The commemoration will be a big occasion and it is hoped that community groups the length and breadth of the State can be involved with commemorating and celebrating the activities of those who were involved with the events of 1916 and remembering them in a fitting manner.  I assume this will be done in different ways, with some people constructing monuments or gardens while there will also be events based in the tradition of Irish language and dancing, arts, poetry and any other type of imaginable activity.<br\/>Many of these groups will raise funds and they might get small local grants but they will have to pay VAT on costs.  Approximately a quarter of the cost will end up in the Government's pocket when people commemorate the events of 1916.  As the Government has not been able to provide much money to commemorate these events across the country, it would be appropriate that any event organised at a local level by a not-for-profit organisation would not be subject to VAT.  This is a unique opportunity, as it is a centenary event.  A strong case should be made in this respect.<br\/>The amendment is open to change as I could not determine how to regulate the process.  For example, a group might argue that any event was a centenary event for 1916 and seek a refund of the 23% VAT rate.  We had to produce our amendments before the Government's plan became apparent but there should be some type of regulatory process to cover the issue.  Perhaps the projects would have to be agreed beforehand.  Mechanisms have been used in the past where proposals were pitched and if approved, a group could avail of a VAT exemption.  There will not be much forgone tax if we follow through on this but I am unsure if there are European Union rules that may affect the measure.  There should be ways around the problem.  We know that cultural bodies, for example, are exempt from VAT, so perhaps part of this idea could come under that umbrella.

The section in the Bill as initiated provides, subject to certain conditions, for relief from stamp duty to encourage the long-term leasing of land to active farmers.  The amendments in my name increase the lease period from five to six years and provide that the lessee must be either a farmer who has a farming qualification or a farmer who spends not less than 50% of his or her normal working time farming.  My amendments allow a farmer a period of up to four years to acquire a farming qualification.  They also provide for the claw back of the relief if the conditions on which the relief is granted are not satisfied.<\/p><p>The recommendations of the agri-taxation review are to focus tax reliefs on encouraging the transfer of farmland to active farmers.  In this context, the recommendation is that an active farmer is one who either has a farming qualification or who farms the land for not less than 50% of his or her normal working time.  In either case, the farmer must farm the land on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profit from the land.  Deputy McGrath&rsquo;s amendment does not necessarily meet these conditions because a farmer, as described in his amendment, could be engaged in farming in a minimal way and yet be within the charge to income tax under section 655 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.   For these reasons, I am unable to accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.<\/p><p>Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s amendment proposes the substitution of a specific period of a 35 hour working week in the section.  Many farmers, in addition to carrying on farming on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profit, also have off-farm employment to supplement their farming income.  Introducing a specific hourly requirement in the legislation as proposed in the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment, allows no element of flexibility for genuine situations where that 35 hour period might not be satisfied.<\/p><p>My amendment No. 74, together with a guidance note that I understand the Revenue Commissioners will issue, which will specify that Revenue will accept that normal working time, including on-farm and off-farm working time, approximates to 40 hours per week, is a more flexible approach that adequately addresses the issue raised by Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s amendment.  This will enable farmers with off-farm employment to qualify for the relief provided they spend a minimum average of 20 hours per week working on the farm.  Where anyone can show that his or her normal working time is somewhat less than 40 hours a week, then the 50% requirement will be applied to the actual hours worked, subject to the overriding requirement that the farm is farmed on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits.  For these reasons, I am unable to accept Deputy Doherty's amendment.<\/p><p>I am informed that issues have been raised about this provision from a State aid viewpoint as the proposed relief is confined to farmland.  Accordingly, amendment No. 78 provides that the section will be subject to a commencement order pending resolution of any State aid issues.  We discussed this issue fully when Deputy Naughten raised it under a previous section.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v participated in that debate.  I am willing to go through it again but I am simply pointing out that we did discuss it fully earlier.  I stand corrected in that four years rather than three years is provided for in respect of the time a farmer is allowed to obtain a qualification.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1416416100,"counter":751,"content":"<p>I welcome the agri-taxation review.

There is a need for recognition in this regard.  I am not happy with the proposal that 50% of an individual's working time must be spent farming.  I am a farmer.  One can farm successfully and productively on a commercial basis with the use of agricultural contractors.  Essentially, the person who manages the land and has the correct records and invoices is the farmer.  As a result of the expansion of our dairy industry, and given the huge land fragmentation problem we have in this country, there will be many arrangements in place that will result in a different definition of active farming.  I would not be completely wedded to the current the definition.  I understand why it is included but I believe there is need for recognition that it does not really define farming as it is currently evolving.  However, there is huge potential to do what the Minister proposes to do, namely, make land more available, but it would require more detailed discussion.

I have a somewhat jaundiced view about the ability to prise land from landowners because there is such a historical attachment to ownership of land, for good reasons.  Ireland is different to any other country in this regard.  If we think about previous incentives, like the early retirement scheme and installation aid schemes, none of them increased land mobility as policy instruments.  We must hope this will happen.  It is important that we do not devalue the contribution made by part-time farmers, which is part of the debate.  Many farmers looking in from the outside, who are talking about 20, 35 or 40 hours a week, would have a rather jaundiced view of the debate.  They do not farm by the clock but on the basis of whatever work must be done.  Even part-time farmers exceed the 35-hour or 40-hour week.  That is the nature of the business.<\/p><p>  I will query these points individually as we go through them.  Amendment No. 73, which proposes to amend section 66, refers to going from five-year leases to six-year leases.  This concerns exempting the lease from stamp duty.  My question applies equally to conveyancing later in the debate.  Transfers may occur on the death of someone and are not always predictable If someone inherits a property, there may be a five-year lease that is halfway complete.  If there is a lease in place and two years are left, how does this apply?  This may apply to someone who stands to inherit but is effectively locked out because of the lease.  The person does not want it to run six years from the date of inheritance.  This section deals with the lease but it also applies to conveyancing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900047#WW00200","speaker":"986"},{"type":"speech","time":1416416700,"counter":755,"content":"<p>It applies to new leases.

Everyone agrees there are other factors in addition to the reluctance of farmers to loosen their grip on land and make other arrangements.  One of the other factors is the 11-month system.  If we can move to leasing, it makes land more commercial because it gives the lessor the opportunity to invest.  There is full agreement on this point.  If the point came up in the review of farm taxation and we accepted it after being in constant interaction with the farming organisations.  The farming organisations agree with what we are doing and this is what they want and what they think will work.  When questions were raised about the definition of \"active farmer\", the advice was that it was a workable proposition.  It is an honour system because no one from the Revenue Commissioners is checking on the hours people spend on the farm.  It is a system of self-assessment to a large degree.

The reduced stamp duty is payable by the individual to whom the land is conveyed or transferred.  This relief is commonly known as consanguinity relief and is due to expire in relation to instruments executed after 31 December 2014.  <br\/>The amendments proposed to the Bill as<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>initiated arise from recommendations of the agri-taxation review.  They provide for the continuation of this relief for another three years in relation to the conveyance of land executed on or after 1 January 2015 and before 1 January 2018.  However, the relief as contained in the Bill is confined to the conveyance or transfer of land by an individual who is 65 years of age or under where the person to whom the land is being conveyed or transferred is a farmer who, from the date the land is conveyed or transferred, spends more than 50% of his or her time farming land &ndash; including the land conveyed or transferred &ndash; for a period of not less than five years. In addition, the land must be farmed on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits. <br\/>The amendment takes account of further representations to ensure that the recommendations of the agri-taxation review are fully reflected in the Bill.  My amendment gives farmers of any age who may wish to transfer their land to a close relative a final opportunity to do so before 1 January 2016.  Thereafter, the relief will only be available where the farmer transferring the land is aged 66 years or under.<br\/>In addition, farmers to whom the land is transferred and who have a farming qualification can qualify for the relief provided they farm the land on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits, without the requirement of spending at least 50% of their normal working time farming.  Farmers who do not already have a farming qualification are given a period of up to four years from the time they acquire the land to obtain such a farming qualification.  Finally, the relief will also be available to farmers who, instead of farming the land themselves, lease the land for a period of not less than six years either to a farmer with a farming qualification or to a farmer who farms the land for at least 50% of his or her normal working time.  In either case, the farmer must farm the land on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits.<br\/>This is the issue on which I had the conversation with Deputy Creed.<\/p> <p>This amendment brings the position up to date legally with what I was saying in our exchange of views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900048#XX03000","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416417900,"counter":794,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his introduction to this amendment, which I believe is substantially correct.

The Minister appears to be interfering in a way that is not required in the commercial potential of a landowner to contract with whomever he or she wishes, in terms of the best price available for the land.  For example, partnerships are becoming the norm now in farming.  Therefore, a partnership or limited company might be leasing the land.

The section does not specifically provide for the farming of land by companies.  The Revenue Commissioners have indicated that they will look favourably on allowing the relief on an administrative basis, subject to any controls considered necessary to avoid abuse, where a farmer retains ownership of the land but farms it through a company that is controlled by him or her and in which he or she is a working director who satisfies the active farmer requirement, in other words that he or she is a farmer with an agricultural qualification or is a farmer who spends not less than 50% of his or her normal working time farming the land on behalf of the company, and in both cases that the land is farmed on a commercial basis or with a view to the realisation of profits.<\/p><p>  Similarly, if the owner of the land leases it to a farmer, as provided for in the section, who farms it through a company and satisfies the active farmer requirements, the relief will also apply.

Capital acquisitions tax relief is available in respect of gifts and inheritances of agricultural property, including land, subject to certain conditions.  At present, individuals who are farmers as defined in the section are entitled to agricultural relief.  The definition requires that a farmer&rsquo;s agricultural property must comprise 80% by value of the farmer&rsquo;s total property.<br\/>The amendments to the agricultural relief provisions contained in the Bill, as published, provide for a further requirement under the definition to ensure that agricultural relief is more effectively targeted at individuals who inherit or who are gifted agricultural property and who actively farm it themselves or who lease it on a long-term basis to active farmers.  To qualify for agricultural relief, the beneficiary or lessee must spend not less than 50% of his or her normal working time farming agricultural property, including the agricultural property comprised in the gift or inheritance, on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits from that agricultural property.  The purpose of these amendments is to ensure productive use of agricultural property. <br\/>Amendment No. 83 further extends agricultural relief to any beneficiary of a gift or inheritance of agricultural property if that beneficiary is the holder of any of the qualifications for applying for relief from stamp duty in respect of transfers to young trained farmers - set out in Schedule 2, 2A or 2B to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 - or who achieves such a qualification within four years from the date of the gift or inheritance, and who, for a period of not less than six years, farms the agricultural property on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits from that agricultural property.<br\/>This amendment is designed to ensure that beneficiaries of agricultural property who hold qualifications in agriculture and who<b><\/b>are productive farmers but who are not in a position to spend at least 50% of their normal working time farming the agricultural property can also avail of the relief.  Following the passing of the Bill, the Revenue Commissioners will publish a note for guidance on the practical operation of the provisions.  This note will specify, among other things, that Revenue will accept that normal working time, including on-farm and off-farm working time, approximates to 40 hours per week.  This will enable farmers with off-farm employment to qualify for the relief provided they spend a minimum average of 20 hours working per week on the farm.  Where anyone can show that their normal working time is somewhat less than 40 hours a week, then the 50% requirement will be applied to the actual hours worked, subject to the overriding requirement that the farm be farmed on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits.<br\/>My second amendment provides for the claw-back of the relief if the additional conditions for the attainment of the agricultural qualifications by the beneficiary or use of the agricultural property by the beneficiary or lessee are not satisfied.  Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s proposed amendment to the relief involves the substitution of a specific period of a 35-hour working week in the section.  Many farmers, in addition to carrying on farming on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profit, have off-farm employment to supplement their farming income.  Introducing a specific hourly requirement in the legislation, as the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment proposes, allows no element of flexibility for genuine situations where that 35-hour period might not be satisfied.  I consider that the Government's first amendment, together with the guidance note that the Revenue Commissioners will issue on how what is termed &quot;normal working time&quot; will be applied in practice, is a more flexible approach and for this reason I cannot accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.  It goes over the same ground again but is simply adding a further definition regarding &quot;active farmer&quot; in case there is any doubt that the reliefs will apply to any person who qualifies under any of the four categories.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900050#AAA00800","speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416418500,"counter":822,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416418500,"counter":823,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 84 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1416418500,"counter":824,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 85:<blockquote><br \/>In page 88, to delete lines 12 to 22 and substitute the following:&ldquo; &ldquo;(4B) Where a donee, successor or lessee ceases to qualify as a farmer under subsection (1) within the period of 6 years commencing on the valuation date of the gift or inheritance, all or, as the case may be, part of the agricultural property shall for the purposes of subsection (2), otherwise than on the death of the donee, successor or lessee, be treated as property comprised in the gift or inheritance that is not agricultural property, and the taxable value of the gift or inheritance shall be determined accordingly and tax shall be payable accordingly.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900050#AAA01100","speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416418500,"counter":825,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416418500,"counter":826,"content":"<p>Section 74, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416418500,"counter":827,"content":"<p>Sections 75 and 76 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416418500,"counter":828,"content":"<p>SECTION 77<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416418500,"counter":829,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 77 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1416418500,"counter":830,"content":"<p>Can the Minister put on record the number of people who are paying the domicile levy at this point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900050#AAA01700","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1416418500,"counter":831,"content":"<p>It is small.

The purpose of subsection (5) of the new section is to make it clear that the Revenue Commissioners can challenge a transaction, both under the general anti-avoidance legislation contained in section 811C and by way of an alternative assessment under any other appropriate provision of tax legislation.  The wording of subsection (5) in the Bill, as published, could be read as implying that the same Revenue officer must make an assessment under section 811C and by way of alternative assessment.  This could give rise to difficulties, for example, where a Revenue officer who made an assessment by reference to section 811C has retired or passed away and another Revenue officer now wishes to make or amend an alternative assessment on that taxpayer in relation to the same transaction.  The amendment makes it clear that the assessments can be made by two different officers.  Needless to say, this does not mean that a taxpayer will be charged twice.  The subsection makes it clear that only one of the assessments can become final and conclusive.  <\/p><p>  Amendment No. 88 also relates to the new section 811D introduced to the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 by section 79 of the Bill.  Subsection (2) of section 811D defines a disclosable transaction for the purposes of the section.  The effect of the transaction being disclosable is twofold.  First, it cannot enjoy the benefit of the protective notification regime for which the section provides.  Second, if a taxpayer makes a qualifying avoidance disclosure of the kind provided for in the section, the level of mitigation of the surcharge provided for is less than for other transactions.  Broadly, a disclosable transaction is one which was disclosable under the mandatory disclosure regime.  However, for the purposes of section 811D, an exception is made where a promoter of an avoidance scheme ought to have disclosed but did not disclose a transaction and, therefore, did not provide the taxpayer with the transaction number provided for in the mandatory disclosure legislation but the taxpayer discloses the transactions and co-operates with Revenue in giving details of the scheme and the promoter.  In these circumstances, the transaction is not treated as disclosable for the purposes of section 811D and the taxpayer is allowed to make a protective notification and obtain the higher level of mitigation where a qualifying avoidance disclosure is made.  The purpose of the amendment is to clarify the interaction between the timings involved in making a protective notification and those involved in taxpayers receiving a transaction number under the mandatory disclosure regime.  The amendment ensures a taxpayer cannot avail of a protective notification simply by claiming that, at the time when the notice was made, he or she did not have a transaction number.  If a transaction number is given to the taxpayer at any time before the date for filing the relevant return, no valid protective notification can be made.  <\/p><p>  Amendment No. 89 relates to the definition of protective notification and the new section 811D.  This is a technical drafting amendment intended to make it clear that a protective notification must contain each of the four items of information set out in the definition.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 90 relates to subsection (4)(a) of the new section 811D, where it references section 811C(6).  Paragraph (a) of section 811D sets out the consequences where a taxpayer has made a valid protective notification.  These are that Revenue can carry out inquiries, make or amend assessments, etc., within the standard period for making inquiries.  For income tax, it is four years from the end of the year in which the return was submitted.  In addition, if Revenue considers that the transaction was a tax avoidance transaction and is successful in challenging it, no surcharge will be made and the interest on unpaid tax will only start to accrue from one month after the date on which Revenue makes or amends the assessment withdrawing or denying the tax advantage.  There are no provisions in the tax Acts that impose a time limit on the collection or recovery of tax found to be due and payable.  However, as originally drafted, there could have been some doubt as to whether this paragraph had placed a limit on when Revenue could collect or recover tax in situations where a taxpayer had made a protective notification.  This amendment seeks to remove any such doubt.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 91 relates to subsection (4)(b) of the new section 811D.  This paragraph deals with the situation where Revenue believes a notification is not valid, for example, because it was received late or did not contain all of the required information.  Revenue may only make inquiries or make or amend an assessment on a taxpayer who makes a protective notification within the prescribed period for so doing.  For example, for income tax or corporation tax, the period is four years after the year in which the return to which the assessment relates is filed.

That is wrong.  These people have been involved in tax avoidance transactions.  Today, the Government announced that people who cannot afford to pay water charges will be hit for an extra &euro;60.  These people were deliberately involved in tax avoidance transactions and the surcharge that is in the law is not applied and their interest rate is reduced by 20%.  That smacks of hypocrisy.<\/p><p>  I know we will not see eye to eye on this.  I have said before that there are two ways of introducing a scheme like this.

That is not the way to deal with this.  It may be costly and these people may be very wealthy and may challenge the Revenue Commissioners in the courts, but the Revenue Commissioners have issued 500 court notices against people who did not pay their household charge or their property tax.

These people are involved in tax avoidance schemes.  They are not involved in tax evasion schemes.  In several cases the Revenue Commissioners have challenged the legality of tax avoidance schemes.  The people involved in the tax avoidance schemes are prepared to take the Revenue Commissioners to court to prove that the tax avoidance schemes were legitimate and will pursue it all the way to the Supreme Court.  The Revenue Commissioners can do that and risk losing, taking the expense and opening a gap in the code or they can ask these people if they really want to go all the way to the Supreme Court and try to incentivise them to come out with their hands up and admit that their tax avoidance scheme was not kosher, pay all the tax they avoided and 80% of the interest and settle on that basis.  There is a queue of them challenging in court.  It is the advice of the Revenue Commissioners that this is a better way for them to do business and is more likely to end with revenue for the Exchequer than to pursue the matter in court with the possibility of losing key cases and opening gaps in the tax code which others could use to avoid taxes until we could close those gaps, which cannot always happen overnight.<\/p><p>  It is not tax evasion or incentivising people guilty of a criminal offence.  It is moving to close tax avoidance schemes where the Revenue Commissioners have a very strong opinion that a scheme is not in accordance with the law.  A major part of the problem we are trying to deal with is that cases can take years to process through the courts.  There is massive expense.  When cases have been processed, the Revenue Commissioners often find there are no assets left to pay the tax by the time they get a court adjudication.  If they go after everything, they can end up with nothing, even if they win the case.  It is not a wish to be soft on those who avoid tax.

I said they were involved in deliberate tax avoidance transactions.  Tax avoidance transactions may be legal but they can also be illegal.

Therefore, it was putting money beyond the reach of the Revenue Commissioners through a tax avoidance transaction which is against the law.  These people were deliberately involved in that action.  This is a softly, softly approach.  While the Minister&rsquo;s commentary about going through the courts and there being no assets left may be fair, there are two ways to deal with this.  The Minister could have told the individuals in the long queue that if they did not come forward and settle by such a date, the Government intended to double the surcharge on 30 June 2015.<\/p><p>  The interest and surcharges on the non-principal private residence charge of &euro;200 per year, which ran for approximately five years bringing it to &euro;1,000, built up to &euro;3,000 and Revenue doubled that.  The big stick came out and the Revenue Commissioners said if the charge was not paid by a certain date at the end of September, it would be doubled to more than &euro;7,000.  I know people who were in Scotland, America or parts of the North who were not aware that such a charge existed.  In this case the surcharge and 20% of the interest on tax avoidance transactions, which could be large multiples of the non-principal private residence charge, will be wiped out because the Revenue Commissioners may not win the case in court.

They get a lot of time if they go through the court process.  Sometimes at the end of the process they have cleverly disposed of assets and there is nothing for the Revenue Commissioners to get.

My advice is that while it is difficult to arrive at a precise number, we are discussing a figure in the hundreds rather than the thousands.  The table I have before me is not particularly clear and may be deceptive, but it probably gives the Deputy a flavour.  The overall number of protective notifications received is 518.  The overall number of protective notices under investigation or litigation is 443.  The overall number of protective notifications closed is 75.  These are the statistics for the end of June 2014.<\/p> <p>I refer to numbers being investigated under the different schemes.  The figure for the income tax loss scheme - the leverage financial trading scheme -  is 427.  The amount of tax at issue is &euro;30.1 million.  In terms of the year received, the figures are 19 in 2010, 40 in 2011, 129 in 2012, 136 in 2013 and 104 in 2014.  One can see that was a fairly active scheme being marketed under that heading.  The next scheme is a GCT loss scheme - option on spread betting on the euro and on the dollar.  It is a foreign exchange scheme.  The number is 12 and the amount of tax is &euro;12.5 million.  <\/p><p> The figure for the next scheme, the corporate deduction regarding employee benefit trust scheme, is three.  The amount of tax involved was &euro;400,000 and 2014 was the year of notification.  In regard to the capital allowances scheme - claim under section 291A of the sale of service mark to connected companies - the amount not quantified was one and that goes back to 2012.  <\/p><p> The principal one is the income tax loss scheme - the leverage financial trading scheme - where there are 427 of them, ranging over a number of years.  They go back to 2010 but they are still not resolved.  The court process will, in theory, deal with them but a queue has formed.

Under the revised mandatory disclosure regime proposed in the Bill, the Revenue Commissioners will assign a transaction number to each scheme disclosed to them under the legislation and will notify this number to the promoter of the scheme.  The promoter, in turn, is obliged to give the number to any taxpayer to whom the scheme has been sold and to any person who markets the scheme.  The taxpayer is obliged to include the transaction number in his or her return of income, thus allowing the Revenue Commissioners to track the use of the scheme more easily. <br\/>The purpose of subsection (4) is to impose certain obligations on a marketer of a scheme that is subject to the mandatory disclosure regime, where that marketer has not been provided with a transaction number by the promoter, as required by the legislation.  These obligations are being introduced so that any person marketing a scheme, which should have been but was not disclosed to Revenue, will be obliged to provide Revenue with as much information as he or she has in regard to that scheme.  <br\/>As drafted, subsection (4) was open to the objection that a marketer could not always know whether a scheme he or she was selling was an avoidance scheme that was subject to the mandatory disclosure regime.  This amendment recognises that there may be occasions when a person is marketing a scheme but does not actually know all of the details of that scheme - he or she is simply putting taxpayers in contact with a promoter and that promoter is the only person who really knows all of the details of the scheme.<br\/>This amendment makes it clear that a marketer cannot avoid an obligation under subsection (4) by arguing that he or she did not know all the details of the scheme and, therefore, could not know whether it was disclosable or not.  The obligation on a marketer applies if it would be reasonable for him or her to consider that the transaction would be a disclosable transaction.<br\/>This amendment also makes it clear that the fact that a marketer has provided information to Revenue in regard to a scheme - now that the legislation explicitly acknowledges that the marketer may be providing that information without having perfect knowledge of the scheme - does not, in any way, prejudice whether or not that scheme actually is a tax avoidance transaction that is subject to the mandatory disclosure regime.  If the marketer provides information about a scheme which is one that ought to have been disclosed by a promoter but was not, then Revenue will seek penalties for non-disclosure against the promoter of that scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900054#EEE00500","speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416420900,"counter":902,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416420900,"counter":903,"content":"<p>Section 80, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416420900,"counter":904,"content":"<p>Sections 81 to 91, inclusive, agreed to.\r\nNEW SECTIONS<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1416420900,"counter":905,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 93, 95 and 96 are related and may be discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900054#EEE01000","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1416420900,"counter":906,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 93:<blockquote><br \/>93.

This amendment seeks an exemption from the local property tax on the basis that one's house is affected by pyrite.  Deputy Daly told me that the requirement on the homeowner to get a hardcore infill test is more costly than the exemption from the local property tax and she proposes, on behalf of families whose houses are affected by pyrite, that there should be a much lighter requirement on householders to prove their houses are affected by pyrite and that they should be exempted from the local property tax.

At this stage, many are looking at a spike of two bands in the valuation of their property.  For instance, the property of somebody currently in band 3, where the property has a valuation of between &euro;150,000 and &euro;200,000 and the person is paying &euro;315, could jump quite easily to band 5, where properties are valued at &euro;250,000 to &euro;300,000, which would result in an LPT liability of &euro;495, a jump of &euro;180, which is more than anyone will pay in respect of water charges.  I refer merely to the additional LPT.<\/p><p>  Many of the Minister's backbenchers, especially those based in Dublin, have expressed concern on this issue.  I acknowledge it is two years away.  There is certainty for 2015 and 2016 as to what those liable will pay, but this is coming down the track quite quickly.

I am aware of the issues that Deputy Boyd Barrett is attempting to address with his proposed amendment No. 93.  Officials of the Department of Finance, with officials of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, have been examining the alternatives other than testing that may be available to confirm entitlement to a local property tax exemption with a view to coming up with a viable solution for all.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's amendment removes the requirement for sub-floor hardcore testing and replaces it with either acceptance by the pyrite remediation board for remediation or location in any area where the presence of pyrite has been established.  As I am sure the Deputy will be aware, the pyrite remediation board's pyrite resolution scheme is limited to properties with a damage condition rating of two and this requirement would be of no use to a property with a damage condition rating of one with progression.  As the pyrite remediation board's pyrite resolution scheme is a scheme of last resort, it would also be of no use to properties being remediated through other avenues, for example, insurance or directly from builders.<\/p><p>  It is important that any changes that may be made to the LPT legislation do not go beyond the objectives of providing only a temporary exemption for homes with significant pyritic damage.  As I have advised on many occasions, a liability to local property tax should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.  Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  The other option proposed by the Deputy, that is, location in any area where the presence of pyrite has been established, does not in itself establish the presence of pyrite in any particular property.  In this regard, I believe the Deputy's proposal is too broad and could result in the relief being available to those beyond the intended target group.<\/p><p>  The local property tax operates on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for the property owner, in the first instance, to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  Where a property owner does not qualify for an exemption, when making an assessment, issues such as the presence of pyrite in a particular area would be one of the factors that could be taken into account in valuing their property.  The advice is clear.  If there is pyrite in the area or if there are signs of pyrite in the house, that should be taken into account when a home owner is assessing the value of his or her property.  For the reasons outlined above, I oppose the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy Doherty's amendment No. 95, the non-principal private residence charge has been superseded as a source of local government funding by the introduction of the local property tax.  The level of income expected to be generated by LPT in 2015 is in the region of &euro;500 million.  The reintroduction of the NPPR charge, even at double the rate of the original charge, which was &euro;200, would not generate one third of this level of income.  I expect the local property tax to provide a more sustainable system of funding for local government and a sounder financial footing for the provision of local services.  It will lead to greater transparency and accountability at a local level and it is certain that the stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability created can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.<\/p><p>  As regards abolition of the local property tax, it is well-established that the taxation of property through an annual recurring tax is less economically distortionary than the imposition of tax on either income or capital.  This is supported by economic literature and OECD analysis which underscores how an annual tax on land and buildings has a relatively small adverse impact on economic performance.  ESRI research shows that a property tax is six times more job-friendly than taxes on work and income.  The Government is determined to do everything in its power to protect and support the creation of jobs.  The introduction of a property tax is part of a broader approach to the taxation of property.  The aim is to replace some of the revenue from transaction-based taxes, which have proven to be an unstable source of Government revenue, with an annual recurring property tax, which international experience has shown to be a stable source of funding.  The local property tax has been successfully introduced and we can look forward to a stable source of funding which is fair and progressive with the owners of the most valuable properties paying most.  The tax is equitable, has reference to ability to pay, conforms to international norms and significantly broadens the domestic tax base.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to accept this amendment.<\/p><p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty also referred to recent events in Donegal.  I understand that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has been concerned about this matter and has been in touch with interests in Donegal about the problem with concrete blocks in that county.  I understand that as yet no firm evidence has been provided to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to substantiate the figures quoted.  I understand the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is prepared to review any information that can be made available on these matters, such as test laboratory reports on the concrete blocks and structural reports on the affected dwellings, and having regard to such information, the Department may be in a position to offer advice that may be of assistance to affected home owners.<\/p><p>  As a general rule, building defects are matters for resolution between the relevant contracting parties - the home owner, the builder, the supplier or their respective insurers, and in the event a settlement cannot be reached by negotiation, the option of seeking redress in court can be considered.  Where appropriate, affected home owners should pursue their structural guarantee or insurance providers where structural guarantee insurance is in place.<\/p> <p>It is understood that legal proceedings may have been instigated in some of the cases relating to the problem in County Donegal, which is the appropriate course of action to take in the event that the responsible parties, that is, the builder, the supplier, their insurers or both, do not face up to their responsibilities and provide a solution to the affected home owners.  However, as I stated, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is available to receive relevant information and to be of assistance to home owners if they are in a position to be of assistance.<\/p><p> As for amendment No. 96 tabled by Deputy Michael McGrath, the Deputy proposes to give broad discretion to the Minister as to when properties should be revalued for local property tax, LPT, purposes.  As the local property tax is a new tax, the Government wishes to provide certainty to home owners and for this reason, valuation periods of three years were introduced with the exception of the first valuation period, which covers three and a half years.  In addition to providing certainty, it also eases the administration burden on the home owners by not being obliged to revalue their houses each year.  The Deputy may be aware that under the LPT legislation, where a property is not a &ldquo;relevant residential property&rdquo; on a valuation date, that is, not liable to LPT, with certain exceptions that property will not be a relevant residential property until the next valuation date.  In the interests of equity to compliant LPT payers, it is important to have regular valuation dates in order that newly-built properties are brought into the LPT net.  It also provides certainty to those home owners as to when they will become liable to LPT.  In the absence of further valuation dates, new properties built after 1 May 2013 would not be liable for LPT and would not have a valuation for LPT purposes.  Should those properties be brought into the scope of LPT using a different valuation date, it would be inequitable to those home owners as their LPT liabilities would be assessed using a later valuation date where property prices are increasing compared with those currently on the register.<\/p><p> While I am very conscious of the concerns of home owners regarding increasing property prices and the effects this will have on their LPT liabilities, particularly in urban areas, I do not believe the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment is the most appropriate way to address these concerns.  The next valuation date is not until 1 November 2016.  In advance of that date, in conjunction with my officials, I will examine the LPT and any impact on LPT liabilities due to increasing property prices.  However any consideration at this stage would be premature.  For the reasons outlined above, I am not minded to accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900055#FFF00300","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416422100,"counter":912,"content":"<p>I revert to the position in County Donegal regarding the problem of mica within the defective blocks.

I am informed that from the information available at this stage, the case in respect of the dwellings affected by structural problems in north County Donegal differs noticeably, in that traceability does not appear to be an issue.

The point being made to me is that, for example, if a company in Ireland appoints an overseas director, who flies into Ireland several times a year for board meetings, the Revenue's current position is that the director's flight and hotel costs are a benefit in kind and he or she ought to be subject to income tax on that.  In contrast, if European civil servants comes to Ireland for a meeting with the Department of Finance, they would not pay BIK, so there is inequality of treatment with businesses seeking to avail of overseas expertise to improve their firm.  Although Revenue claims this has always been its view, many industries have had specific rulings from Revenue to the contrary.  It is an interesting question.  Should a director of a company here, who is living abroad and travelling to and fro, be subject to BIK on costs which were incurred necessarily in order to attend meetings here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900057#HHH00100","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1416422700,"counter":937,"content":"<p>Section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for a tax deduction solely in respect of expenses of travel necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of an office or employment.  In general terms, this means that travel expenses incurred by an employee or office holder travelling to or from work do not qualify for a tax deduction and, where an employer pays or reimburses such expenses, they are taxable.<\/p><p>  In the case of an executive director or employee, this means that travel expenses incurred travelling from his or her normal place of work to attend board meetings will generally qualify for a tax deduction and an employer may pay or reimburse such expenses free of tax.  The reason for this is that the director or employee is travelling from his or her normal place of work to another work location and is travelling &ldquo;in the performance of&rdquo; his or her duties.<\/p><p>  However, in the case of a director living outside the State who has no executive or other duties within a company, travel expenses incurred travelling to attend board meetings in the State do not qualify for a tax deduction and where an employer pays or reimburses such expenses, they are taxable.  The reason for this is that the director is merely travelling to work.  It is important to distinguish between individuals who have executive functions in a company and those who do not.  In the case of the former, there is no issue in relation to the taxation of travel expenses.  In the case of non-executive directors, I am conscious of the need for companies to maximise the range of skills, experience and independence on their boards.  This is important for a number of reasons, not least in the interests of good corporate governance.<\/p><p>  While I do not propose to accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment, and this is an issue that has already been raised with my Department recently, I understand the Revenue Commissioners will commence a broad review of the tax treatment of travel expenses in early 2015.  As part of this review, they will look at the tax treatment of travel expenses incurred by non-executive directors in travelling to attend board meetings, including expenses incurred by those who travel from outside the State.  The review will take account of the longstanding principles governing the taxation of travel expenses, existing guidance issued by the Revenue Commissioners and the need to re-examine such principles and guidance to ensure consistency of treatment as between taxpayers.  The review will also have regard to implications for the Exchequer.  Consultation with stakeholders will also form part of the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014111900057#HHH00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1416422700,"counter":938,"content":"<p>I welcome that because my understanding is that Ireland is an outlier in its treatment of this issue.  That is something the Revenue can check.  It strikes me as odd that a non-executive director who, of necessity, travels in and out of Ireland to attend meetings and who is reimbursed for the cost of that travel, is then taxed by the Irish Revenue on the amounts that have been reimbursed.  The net effect of it is that the non-executive director incurs a cost by virtue of performing his or her duties.  It is an issue for some companies which are seeking to attract high-calibre people who are based abroad to act as non-executive directors and provide their expertise to businesses here.

I am very honoured to be here today.  The rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, ISIS, is a pivotal moment in international relations.  I have spent most of my adult life studying the Middle East, travelling to it, researching and writing about it, teaching on the subject.  I have never been more dispirited, concerned, disillusioned about the future of the Middle East than I am today and that is directly related to the rise of the ISIS crisis.  Now is a moment for the international community to pause and seriously evaluate this particular crisis, which is not just a Middle Eastern crisis but a global one.  The ISIS crisis is at the top of the international agenda.  How did we get here and what can and should the international community do about this crisis?  I encourage the members of this committee to think about what particular contribution Ireland can make toward alleviating and resolving the ISIS crisis.<\/p><p>  The roots of the crisis are located in Syria.  It does have Iraqi roots and the background to that is in the document I circulated.  We would not be having an ISIS crisis had there not been a conflict in Syria.  Fundamentally, the failure of the international community to deal with the 3 and a half year ongoing bloodshed and carnage in Syria has led to this particular crisis moment in international relations.  According to the United Nations today, Syria represents the biggest humanitarian and moral crisis of the 21st century, replete with the displacement of nearly half of Syria&rsquo;s population, either as refugees or internally displaced, the largest refugee crisis of the 21st century and a human rights crisis that is borderline genocidal.  The words \"state-sanctioned war crimes\" and \"crimes against humanity\" litter the human rights documentation on this conflict.  There is a rape crisis, a child-killing crisis, a public health crisis and a starvation crisis in Syria but Syria is much more than that; Syria is fundamentally a political crisis.<\/p> <p> The origins of the crisis in Syria that has produced ISIS go back to March 2011 and the context of the Arab Spring when there were pro-democracy protests against authoritarian regimes throughout the Middle East and north Africa which eventually spread to Syria.  It is important to remember that at least for the first six months of the Syrian uprising, these protests were non-violent and non-sectarian.  There was no ISIS or al-Qaeda to be found.  There were pro-democracy protesters who protested in the best spirit of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi in challenging one-family rule for 41 years.  It was the brutality in the crackdown by the Assad regime on peaceful protesters that led to the militarisation of the uprising and, fundamentally, its Islamisation and extreme development in a militant Islamic current known as Islamic State.<\/p><p> While this was happening, the international community stood on the sidelines and watched things deteriorate.  The general view most people had was that the UN Security Council was deadlocked and could not do anything about it.  Russia and China were on one side, with the United States and the European Union on the other.  There was no agreement.  Although we could pass a few resolutions, hold a bunch of meetings and travel to Geneva, fundamentally nothing was done and the position worsened.  By the beginning of 2014, there was a general view that because of the deadlock, the situation in Syria had to burn itself out.  Nobody wanted to take charge or speak up.  There was a general view that as bad as the situation in Syria was, what had happened there could be contained.  That was the view of many realists in the United States; they believed it did not really affect the world, the West or the United States.  The operating assumption was that events in Syria could be \"contained\".  We now know that the conflict in Syria could not be contained and it has spread to Iraq.  ISIS is on the outskirts of Baghdad and was almost in Iraqi Kurdistan, having taken the major city of Erbil.  The crisis in Syria has destabilised the entire region.  <\/p><p> After a very significant western - American-led - troop deployment in Iraq and the withdrawal of troops from Iraq and the region as a whole, the United States and the world has had to reinvest and re-engage in the Middle East because of the broad failure of the international community to take the crisis in Syria seriously from the start.  It is interesting to ask if the international community had responded much more effectively and earlier, if we would have an ISIS crisis today.  It is useful for us to litigate what could or should have been done, but we must deal with what can be done at this time.  In this context, it is important to emphasise the centrality of Syria to the ISIS crisis cannot be ignored or denied.  The five western hostages beheaded by ISIS were killed in Syria where ISIS was reborn and reconstituted.  According to US intelligence estimates, two thirds of ISIS military forces are located in Syria.  There is no solution to the ISIS crisis without debating a political solution on the future of Syria, as the issues are deeply interlinked.<\/p><p> The question is what role Ireland can play in tackling this crisis.  I am here to encourage it to use its soft power in the global community and specifically the Middle East to help to push the conflict in the right direction.  Ireland has a very good reputation in the Middle East because of its political history in struggling for self-determination, dignity and human rights.  There is also the very principled stand it has taken on the core identity issue in the Middle East - the Palestine-Israel crisis.  Support for Palestinian self-determination has given Ireland much goodwill and if it could speak up and start to put the situation in Syria back on the agenda, specifically how to reach a political solution, the world would start to take notice.<\/p><p> There are some actions that Ireland could and should take to help to push this conflict in the right direction towards a resolution.  It could support the struggle for self-determination, dignity and democracy for the people of Syria that began three and half years ago with a peaceful uprising against the Assad family.  In keeping with this, there is a Friends of Syria group made up of several countries that have supported the struggle in Syria and Ireland could join that group.  It could also join the 112 countries which have designated the Syrian National Council as \"the legitimate representatives of the Syrian people\" in contrast to the Assad regime.  Ireland could also support the moderate Syria rebels who have been abandoned by the world by supporting the creation of a no-fly zone and a buffer zone where the people in question could reconstitute.  There is no solution to the Syrian crisis unless moderate political forces can start fighting against ISIS and the Assad regime which are basically two sides of the same coin.  We need the types of group supported by the international community, including Ireland.<\/p><p> Ireland could get behind the newly released document entitled, Syrian Freedom Charter, which has been circulated from Syrian civil society and is basically a blueprint for the future of a democratic Syria.  It is based on the 1955 South African freedom charter - a great blueprint - and countries such as Ireland, with a good reputation and commitment to human rights and democracy, in supporting the voice of that document could help to push events forward in a political fashion.<\/p><p> Ireland could also support the recent French proposal which advocates that we learn the lessons of recent events in Kobani on the Syrian-Turkish border.  We can use that model to try to save Aleppo, the second largest city in Syria which is almost under complete siege by the Assad regime.  There is a small element of moderate rebels still there and 300,000 people are about to be besieged.  France has articulated a proposal to come to the rescue of these citizens in the moderate Syrian rebel forces.  It is a plan that Ireland should support in trying to advance a resolution of the conflict.  <\/p><p> As indicated in my document, former President Jimmy Carter has brought forward a three point peace proposal to resolve the Syrian crisis and Ireland could lend support to it.  There are also a number of UN resolutions that remain unenforced that relate to humanitarian aid, including UN Security Council Resolutions 2139 (2014) and 2165 (2014).  Ireland could give a voice to them.<\/p><p> We need a threefold strategy to push the issue forward by supporting moderate Syrian rebel forces to defeat militarily; removing the root causes of political extremism in the Syrian regime, specifically the Assad regime; and putting in place a moderate government that would ensure there could be no rise of religious extremism, and ensuring Syria can begin to build a future that is inclusive, representative and truly democratic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nader Hashemi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416407700,"counter":982,"content":"<p>If members wish to ask questions, our guest may answer them and I will allow them to make a follow-up comment.

The estimates range from 20,000 to 200,000, but how many are there?  How much of ISIS comprises genuinely dissatisfied Sunnis from Iraq and Syria and how many are foreign jihadi?<\/p><p>  Watching the conflict, people are struck by the number of modern weapons used.

There is the technical knowledge to use these weapons, which suggests many of those involved may have fought under the previous regime.<\/p> <p>Could Dr. Hashemi comment on that?

The problem that has produced ISIS is that the Governments in the two existing states of Iraq and Syria suffer from a deep crisis of illegitimacy.  In the case of Iraq about 20% of the population, the Sunni population do not trust the Government and feel they have been marginalised and excluded by the Baghdad Government.  The strategy that President Obama has laid out is I think a strategy that will work in Iraq if we can stick to that strategy.  One has to give the central Government in Baghdad political legitimacy and push it to be more inclusive, to bring in the Sunnis and to get them to turn away from al-Qaeda as their political representation and a voice to air their set of grievances and come back and work with them in the context of an Iraqi political union in a country that actually works.  That is the correct strategy.<\/p><p>  The same strategy also needs to be applied to the case of Syria.  In Syria, the conflict is much more complicated.  Some 70% of the population in Syria are Sunnis and they view the existing Government in Baghdad as completely illegitimate and representative of a minority set of interests rooted in the Ba'ath Party and the Alawite sect.  Those basic principles of political legitimacy as a way of dealing with the ISIS crisis and draining the Sunni population away from ISIS towards the central Governments that are democratic and inclusive is the right strategy to pursue.  It will take a long time because there is a lot of disillusionment, anger and marginalisation.  Broadly speaking that is the way forward and that is a role the international community can and should play.<\/p><p>  With respect to questions on troops, most of the reports state there are about 30,000 to 40,000 ISIS fighters.  I have never heard a figure of 200,000, but of the 30,000 to 40,000, about half of them are foreign fighters.  The vast majority are disgruntled Sunni young men from Iraq and Syria.  Many of the foreign fighters are from neighbouring Arab countries, from Morocco to as far as Indonesia.  The vast majority come from Iraq and Syria.  As I just stated these young Sunni men from Iraq and Syria feel their existing political systems are non-representative, unaccountable and irredeemable.  They joined ISIS as a way of finding some hope for a better future.<\/p><p>  The challenge of draining away and convincing young Sunni disgruntled men that their future lies with their own Governments and not with this Islamic State is a long-term solution but one that must be rooted in trying to increase the political legitimacy, inclusiveness and democratic nature of the existing political systems.  That will not happen overnight.  It will take a long time.<\/p><p>  I think that the plan that President Obama laid out with respect to Iraq is the right plan.  The problem is that President Obama has not said anything about a political solution for Syria, except the usual general talking points.  As I said before there is no solution to the ISIS crisis unless there is a solution for Syria's political future.  That is the major question that hangs over our heads and needs to be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nader Hashemi"},{"type":"speech","time":1416408300,"counter":987,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Crowe have some short questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900005#D00400","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1416408300,"counter":988,"content":"<p>I have a question on the Kurds and the difficulties they are experiencing in their city of Kobani?

I am of a different view.  In my view there needs to be a political solution but a political solution can only be arrived at if we have a military component to it.  Kobani is a perfect test case for that.  To say that there is no military solution to Syria is basically to abandon the people of Kobani to the ISIS fighters.  Kobani has been effectively saved in the past few weeks because of the significant support that has been given to it as a result of US air strikes, sending in Kurdish fighters and drops of armaments.  That has shifted the tide.<\/p><p>  When we started looking at this particular city, it looked as if it was about to fall but because of significant military support, the tide of the war has shifted and things look much better for the people of Kobani.  I think that particular model needs to be applied in other parts of Syria as a way of pressuring the Assad regime to come to the negotiating table.  President Assad is not going to come to the negotiating table and negotiate anything unless he is forced to do so.  I think that is the broader model.  That is what the French proposal was all about.  It is not something I am coming up with, the French Foreign Minister has a military-political plan for Kobani on the table right now.<\/p><p>  With respect to Turkey's role, it has conflicting roles in the region.  It has its own Kurdish minority problem.  It also has a broader regional set of interests.  Turkey has been trying to leverage its geographic position to get the US to commit to a much more serious long-term political plan for the future of Syria.  Turkey effectively told the Obama Administration that it would come to the rescue of the people of Kobani on the condition that the US would agree to a no fly zone and for the US to go after the Assad regime and do what should have been done some three and a half years ago.  President Obama for reasons that we can talk about, has been very reluctant to get into a deeper engagement with respect to dealing with the political solution in Syria.  In my view that has to do with the negotiations that are going on with Iran.  We can talk about that, should the Deputy wish to do so.  <\/p><p>  Turkey's position is that of a regional power.  I am of the view that there will not be a solution to Syria unless Turkey is brought on broad.  We have to consider Turkey's geographical position and its relationship with Western countries.  Turkey is destined to play an important role.  Turkey has to be part of the broader solution in terms of how we solve this broader crisis of ISIS.  To ignore Turkey is to make the ISIS crisis much more difficult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900005#D00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nader Hashemi"},{"type":"speech","time":1416408300,"counter":990,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy Crowe.

There is so much I would have liked to have been able to tease out.  When Dr. Hashemi was talking about the Kobani model, he meant the military aspect of it.  I have a question about the Kurdish people because they have lost out in so many other conflicts.  They have been to the fore in contributing and when the conflict is over, they are left with less land than they had when they started out.  I would be interested to hear his comments on that.<\/p><p>  Dr. Hashemi referred to removing President Assad, but in my view he is not moving anywhere.  Is there any possibility of negotiating with him?  Dr. Hashemi mentioned the Syrian National Council and I wonder where it is at this particular stage.  When Dr. Hashemi spoke about moderate government, I thought of Libya and the overthrow of Gadaffi.  I think people would agree that Libya is in a worse state now than it was under Colonel Gadaffi.  Libya is in an appalling state now after all of their attempts at moderate government.  I think because of the situation in Syria and ISIS it is not getting the attention that it should get.  He mentioned Iran, which is a major player, but because they were excluded from the talks initially, they no longer are involved.  I think was a mistake.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900005#D00800","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416408300,"counter":992,"content":"<p>The Kurds have been treated very badly in the modern history of the Middle East.  Their sad fate is that they are divided between four countries.  Any solution to a stable Middle East must include recognition of Kurdish national and cultural rights.  There is no support in the international community for an independent Kurdistan, despite what we hear about the withering away of the First World War borders.  However, there is a lot of support for federal political systems in the region in Iraq and in a future Syria that grants groups such as the Kurds full cultural autonomous and even national recognition but within the existing framework of Iraq and Syria and in Turkey.  That is what has been happening in the case of Iraq.  The Kurds in Iraq basically are autonomous.  That is what needs to happen in a future Syria.  That is what is beginning to happen in the case of Turkey.  There has been some movement in terms of Turkey's relationship  with the Kurds, a de-escalation of that particular conflict.  That is something that the international community should be pushing.<\/p><p>  In terms of President Assad's future, the Deputy is correct that he is not going anywhere.  Let us be clear why he is not going anywhere.  President Assad is not going because he has strong support from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, and the international community has stood on the sidelines for the past three and a half years and abandoned the moderate Syrian rebels.<\/p> <p>President Assad is not going to go anywhere until he is pushed.  He will not give up 44 years of one family rule because of some pro-democracy protests that happened three and a half years ago.  President Assad will be forced to concede some of what he holds right now if he is pressed to do so.  The Russian position could be challenged in the Security Council.  Iran's position in the region could be challenged by the global community.  There is no stability in Syria or the broader Middle East as long as Assad stays in power.  I was very happy to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, make that exact same point at this committee last week.  That is the correct policy.  Ireland seems to be on that track and it needs to stay on that track.<\/p><p> With respect to Libya and Syria, Deputy O'Sullivan is correct, Libya is a disaster.  The international community came to the aid of the Libyan people to overthrow Gadaffi, however, afterwards they basically abandoned them.  There are lessons to be learned from that.  We talk about a future stable Syria, the lesson from Libya is that it is not simply good enough to topple the dictator, there has to be a plan for stabilisation, reconstruction and peacekeeping in which Ireland can play a role in the aftermath.  Otherwise, one is prone to get the dissolution of the state, war, anarchy, breakdown and the possibility of a repeat scenario along the Libyan model in Syria.  That is not what we want to see so that a central element of a peace plan must have built into it a post-conflict reconstruction and stabilisation plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900005#D00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nader Hashemi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416408900,"counter":994,"content":"<p>Thank you.

What I mean by that is the following.  The roots of the ISIS crisis is fundamentally to be located in the broken politics of the Middle East.  The broken politics of the Middle East is a function of two converging variables that have produced the ISIS crisis.  First, the legacy of political tyranny and political despotism that has characterised the politics of the region has been most manifested in the two countries that have been most adversely affected by the legacy of political tyranny, Iraq and Syria.  When compared to the countries of the Arab League, Iraq and Syria are the two countries whose post-colonial political condition has been most severely decimated by political authoritarianism.  The human rights record for example of the Ba'ath Party under President Assad and Saddam Hussein has devastated this society.  That is a main cause.<\/p><p>  The other main cause is that Iraq and Syria have been devastated by the predictable consequences of state breakdown that has resulted from ongoing war.  The state in Iraq and Syria no longer functions as a normal state.  Iraq has been in constant war for the past 35 years - the Iran-Iraq war, the Iraq-Kuwait war, devastating sanctions, the American occupation from 2003 until today.  It is a devastated society.  Syria has been the site of the worst humanitarian and moral crisis of the 21st century with borderline genocidal conditions.  The state has withered away.<\/p><p>  In this vacuum produced by state breakdown, war and also the legacy of political tyranny and chaos ISIS has emerged.  It provides a narrative.  Most of the people who join ISIS have been born, bred and raised in politically authoritarian tyrannical societies, where the state has broken down and where they or their families have either been in prison, as a political prisoner, have been suffocated or have been scared.  This is the enveloping context that produced the ISIS crisis.<\/p><p>  One has to ask oneself why this is happening in Iraq and Syria.  If this is a religious question, a problem of Islam, how come in those parts of the Muslim world where Muslims are in the greatest majority, Indonesia, Malaysia and Bangladesh, one does not see these thing happening?  One sees them happening in Iraq and Syria precisely for the reasons I mentioned, namely, the predictable consequences of the convergence of the legacy political tyranny; state breakdown; war and chaos which put together creates a fertile soil for this particular group to emerge.<\/p><p>  On top of that, religion is important here.  There is a particular theological interpretation of people who subscribe to the ISIS world view that comes out of a puritanical, ultra conservative, anti-humanistic and intolerant interpretation of Islam rooted in the Arabian peninsula, coming out of the Wahabi creed of Islam.  If one looks at the theological interpretation of ISIS, the books they are using in their classrooms, the intolerance, the beheading, the animosity toward Shia, towards women, towards culture, toward peoples who are minorities, all of this is straight out of the playbook of a particular puritanical and ultra-conservative orientation that comes out of the Saudi peninsula.  One does not see this in other parts of the Islamic world.  One does start to see it in the later half of the 20th century largely as a result of the marriage of Wahabi Islam, ultra-conservative puritanical Islam and the development of oil and the wealth that is generated in the Persian Gulf area that allows this particular interpretation of Islam to be disseminated.<\/p><p>  If one looks at the whole history of Islam, 1,400 years, one does not see these types of manifestations of Islam but one sees them happening at certain moments in certain places of time because of the convergence of what I would call three factors, state breakdown and war, the legacy of political tyranny and also this ultra puritanical conservative interpretation of Islam.  Put it all together and one gets ISIS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nader Hashemi"},{"type":"speech","time":1416408900,"counter":998,"content":"<p>I want to follow through on this thread.

That is the third option that has not been pursued.  We have to start from the drawing board again because they have been decimated.  They are the weakest party to this conflict.  This third option can be pursued and should be pursued.  The only way we will get a stable future in Syria is by supporting those people who are committed to basic principles of human rights and democracy.<\/p> <p>That is the third issue.<\/p><p> I must disagree with the earlier comments on religion and Islam.  It is absolutely wrong to state there has been no condemnation of ISIS by Muslims.  I challenge the Senator to find any mainstream or even marginal Muslim group which supports ISIS.  I am asked this question all the time.  On my website I have a list of every major Muslim organisation which I know has issued a condemnation of ISIS.  Not only that, but more than 300 leading Muslim scholars have issued a public document pointing out how the ISIS interpretation of Islam is a violation of mainstream interpretations of Islam.  There has been broad condemnation and I will be happy to share the document with the Senator if it will help.<\/p><p> One cannot compare the predictable consequences of Qatari foreign policy and the type of Islam coming from Qatar with that of Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabia has been producing, promoting and disseminating a very intolerant and puritanical interpretation of Islam for at least 50 years.  The reach of Saudi oil money and the scholarships given to students from around the Islamic world to come to Saudi Arabia to internalise a particular intolerant interpretation and return to their own communities to spread it has been a long-standing story.  It has been well documented and is partly responsible for producing this intolerant interpretation of Islam which has now manifested itself in ISIS.  The challenge is to try to promote and support those interpretations of Islam which are more inclusive and tolerant.<\/p><p> As committee members know from this country's experience, religion can be interpreted in many ways, in exclusive, intolerant and backward ways but also the converse, with tolerant, ecumenical and inclusive interpretations.  Ireland and the rest of the international community have a deep interest in trying to support those forces and voices which promote the latter interpretation of Islam.  One will not get away from the question of religion.  The Islamic world is deeply religious and we have an interest in promoting more tolerant and inclusive interpretations of Islam.  I wish there were many expressions, but they just do not receive the same type of financial backing with oil money as this ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900006#E01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nader Hashemi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416409500,"counter":1005,"content":"<p>I will allow Senator Jim Walsh back in after other members have spoken, if he wishes to reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900007#F00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1416409500,"counter":1006,"content":"<p>To follow on from what Senator Jim Walsh stated about support for the moderate forces, how representative and how strong are they?

It was a blueprint for a future post-apartheid South Africa.  Looking back, we see that the document played a role in bringing various political constituencies around a common agenda.  The civil society organisations led by the local co-ordinating councils in Syria which have representation throughout the country have produced a similar document based on the South African blueprint.  It is an inclusive document for democracy, human rights and civil society which lays out a blueprint for a future Syria.  It was not dreamed up by a handful of activists; it is based on the most detailed survey of Syrian public opinion ever conducted.  A total of 50,000 people in every district in Syria and including the exiled community of those who were kicked out and have become refugees were surveyed and they voiced their opinions.  The document is far more representative than anything we have seen in the history of modern Syria.  Ireland and the international community could get behind this document because it is the embodiment of the values to which we subscribe in western liberal democracies.  It is also a reflection of Syrian views.  It is representative and overlaps with the views of moderate Syrian rebels who stand for the freedom charter principles.  It is a new document which has just been released and about which committee members will hear much more.

Unfortunately, in some conflicts one must invest in a military struggle to defeat those political parties which simply are not willing to compromise or share power.  We are in this crisis because of Assad's obfuscation, gerrymandering of the political system and authoritarian policies.  He does not want to leave.  There is no way out of the problem in Syria unless a military solution is used as part of a broader political agenda.  They must go together, as one cannot separate them.  That is how we must start to think about the solution.

While I accept and applaud Dr. Hashemi's outline of how Ireland can play a role in finding a solution, it is startling to hear that 50% of ISIL fighters are not Syrian.  It is also frightening to think British, as well as two French, people have been connected with the beheading of aid workers.  Dr. Hashemi has explained that he believes the chaos, dictatorship and horrible leadership in Syria and Iraq bred this sandstorm and volcano.  One can accept this, but what is the attraction for the 50% of fighters who do not come from this culture?  That is a big concern.  I do not want to be simplistic, but it seems there must be a religious motivation for people to leave Ireland, England and France as Muslims to fight exclusively with ISIL.<\/p><p>  Dr. Hashemi has requested our support for the weak democratic forces, but I have read in the newspapers that last week ISIL defeated what was to be a stronghold of these democratic fighters.  There is the power of Russia and its influence, as well as of China to some degree.  In particular, does Dr. Hashemi agreed that unless the two major Islamic states and key players of Saudi Arabia and Iran are forced into some compromise, the region will always be destabilised?  People from Tehran who have come before the committee state things are wonderful in all of these kingdoms.  People from Morocco who have come before the committee state all of these kingdoms are fundamentally undemocratic.

In a free democratic society, governments cannot monitor every single behaviour.  A lot of this has to come from local communities and families.  This speaks to the question about youth radicalisation in Muslim communities.  The key trigger that can predict if one particular young person, living in the West, born and raised in, for instance, England or the United States, is going to become radicalised is not religion - although religion is part of it and I will address that in a moment.  It is an inner personal crisis, sense of alienation, or a search for a particular identity.  This is the trigger that will explain why one particular person as opposed to another ends up leaving a comfortable home in the West and joining ISIL.  There is a certain ideological and psychological crisis of confidence, identity and of social alienation which explains why some individuals become radicalised and not others.<br\/>Often those individuals who are searching for a meaning or a cause have in many ways, in one iteration of their lives, before they go to the ISIS, group, no interest in religion.  The books that were purchased online by some of these British Muslim youths who had gone over to join ISIS were identified.  These books included <i>The Koran for Dummies<\/i>and <i>Islam for Dummies<\/i>.  These are young kids who were partying, drinking and doing all things un-Islamic in one particular phase of their lives who then become, all of a sudden, hyper religious in another phase of their lives.  They then think they can join some sort of cause, redeem themselves and fill a particular void in their lives by joining up with ISIS.  Religion is part of it.  There are also other things going on within the personal lives and in the family homes of many of these radicalised kids.<br\/>Generally speaking, governments can do more but there is nothing that can be done to absolutely solve this problem.  A figure of 33 people from Ireland is a lot.  The same numbers are seen in the United States and it is a much bigger country.  Ireland is doing a pretty good job compared to other countries in the world facing similar problems.  However, there is nothing absolute that can be done.  A lot of this has to be done within families and communities.  It needs to be self-regulating.<br\/>In Canada, where I come from, there was a problem with youth radicalisation.  There also was an attack on the Canadian Parliament a couple of months ago.  The local mosque in the city where the person responsible for that particular attack lived kicked him out when he started to talk about his radical views.  That is something we want to see happening in more communities; radicals being kicked out of the community.  That is one way of addressing this broader problem. <br\/>The question of youth radicalisation is also a by-product of a point I mentioned earlier.  There is a mainstream interpretation of Sunni Islam that has been deeply informed and warped by Wahabi interpretations of religion that have distorted.  Many mainstream Muslims growing up in any urban city in the world have, over the course of their particular upbringing, been exposed to one particular variant of Islam which they think is authentic and real and all other interpretations are considered by them to be heretical and distorted.  That is a conservative, intolerant interpretation of Islam.  Practices have manifested, that are very much localised and only to be found in the last two or three decades in Muslim communities around the world, where all of a sudden Muslims are taught that they cannot listen to music, wish their Christian neighbours a merry Christmas and that women and men have to be completely separated behind a partition.  These are all recent manifestations of a puritanical and ultra conservative interpretation of Islam that has been becoming mainstream in the last two to three decades of the 20th century.<br\/>If one goes back to the earlier part of the 20th century, or to other moments in Islamic history, this type of intolerance, rejection and animosity towards women, minorities and Sufi Muslims is not seen.  It is a by-product of a particular mainstreaming of an ultra conservative, intolerant, puritanical interpretation that has affected the minds of some of these young people.  There is an almost identical overlap with Wahabi puritanical Islam when one looks at their behaviour and what they think is authentic Islam.  <br\/>That is one reason the radicalisation is occurring.  The challenge is to provide alternative interpretations of religion that challenge the puritanical, intolerant Wahabi version and give Muslim young people another option, namely, that a person can be religious and a member of a democratic society, respect pluralism and be tolerant.  That is a challenge for Muslim communities, in every part of the world.  They need to try to compact this particular negative interpretation which feeds into the radicalisation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900008#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nader Hashemi"},{"type":"speech","time":1416410100,"counter":1011,"content":"<p>I always feel uncomfortable when we as Westerners are asked to provide solutions to problems in Africa, the Middle East or, as now for instance, in this war zone.

Unfortunately, there are some organisations that have to be dealt with militarily and defeated.  Part of the strategy to defeat them is to provide alternative options for young people who are looking towards ISIS and think ISIS can represent a positive future for them.  It is not possible to invite representatives of ISIS to the table and agree some sort of solution that can help solve this particular problem.  Alternative options have to be part of the strategy.<\/p><p>  ISIS is a small band of militants which draws on a larger section of support that is rooted, in the case of Iraq and Syria, in what was mentioned by one of the members earlier, in the broad feeling that Sunni populations are politically marginalised and excluded - that they have no representation and no hope in the existing states in which they live and they look to ISIS as an alternative option.  We should seek to strengthen the legitimacy of the existing states in Iraq and Syria and start to drain away some of the support base that exists in some of these Sunni communities.  It is members of this support base who have looked to ISIS for inspiration and as an option for a better future.  It is not possible to negotiate with them.  I wish there was a non-military solution.  <\/p><p>  In one sense, the Arab League can be helpful in this particular challenge, particularly on the short-term basis in terms of helping with the military dimension of the problem.  Air forces and military components have been part of the American-led effort against ISIS.  However, long term we have to remember that the Arab League is a joke.  They are all political tyrannies, non-democratic and headed by ruling elites.  I do not see a significant or constructive role for many of the Arab League states, particularly the prominent ones - Egypt and Saudi Arabia for example - in dealing with a political legitimisation crisis and a crisis of democracy and representation.  All of the Arab League countries, with the exception of Tunisia, are non-representative and have their own internal legitimisation crisis.  One has to be very honest on this.  Many of these so-called Arab moderate governments with which we have close relationships are really very immoderate in terms of how they treat their own populations and how they deal with questions on democracy and human rights.  I am very wary of any suggestion of working with non-democratic political systems to solve a problem that is fundamentally rooted in a crisis of democracy and human rights.  That is a non-starter.  <\/p><p>  I take the Deputy's point.  Why should the West have to go in and solve other people's problems?  No one is asking the West to go in and solve the problems of Syria and Iraq.  It is a question of supporting the moderate, democratic and inclusive-oriented elements of those societies.  They are begging the West for support and assistance.  In the case of Ireland, we are really talking about moral support.  It would be a huge boon to have the Government speak out and defend basic universal principles, get behind the freedom charter, support the International Criminal Court and get behind, support and invite to this country those elements of in particular Iraqi and Syrian society, who have a blueprint for an inclusive, democratic future.<\/p> <p>It would be a huge boon if, for example, the Irish Parliament were to pass a non-binding resolution in support of the Syrian freedom charter for a future Syria that is inclusive, democratic and protects minority rights in particular, including Christian and Alawite minority rights.  The resolution could reflect the blueprint for a future Syria and Ireland's values as a liberal western democracy and view that anyone agreeing to the blueprint would have the support of Ireland and the international community.  Such a simple statement would go a long way to boosting the morale, self-esteem and hope of people fighting in very difficult circumstances in Syria against a fascist regime in Damascus and an Islamic-fascist movement in the form of ISIS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900008#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nader Hashemi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416410700,"counter":1014,"content":"<p>I have made it a rule that members may ask one or two questions.

What motivates people in western society, living in comfortable and safe surroundings, to become involved in a war?  Are the reasons political or religious or a combination of the two?  Is it a product of modern telecommunications?  Fifty or 100 years ago communication was by letter or newspaper.  I am a keen student of history.  Abraham Lincoln decided on the abolition of slavery when things were going wrong in the American Civil War.  It marked the turning point, was the holy war and the <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre<\/i>.  What is the <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre<\/i>motivating people in western society to live a dangerous life and become radicalised?  What is driving them to do this?<br\/>Dr. Hashemi referred to the American intervention in Iraq and its withdrawal from that country.  He also referred to the international intervention in and withdrawal from Libya.  I agree entirely that it is a critical issue because it leaves behind a society that is not ready, when it does not have the support to carry on and is not capable of doing so.  <br\/>How does our society support the moderates?  We cannot declare peace or do anything that will force people to come to the negotiating table.  People who wear masks and hoods cannot be identified and, therefore, prosecuted.  How can we deal with this aspect of the matter?  How do we prevent the funding of an ongoing war when those creating the problem have access to oilfields and associated revenue? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900009#H00300","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416410700,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>Youth radicalisation is not something that happens overnight.  There is a large body of good scientific studies of how a particular person, born and raised in Denver, Colorado, for example, where I live, can become radicalised all of a sudden.  What explains that phenomenon?  The critical question is why does it happen to some youth and not to others living in the exact same environment.  They are exposed to the same family and one brother becomes radicalised while another does not.  Much of the answer has to do with the personal idiosyncrasies and crises of the particular individual.  The key trigger is that he is looking for something bigger than himself, a cause, an identity.  He is exposed to different points of view.  The Deputy hinted at one common theme that keeps emerging and explains the phenomenon as it relates to ISIS.  Much of the radicalisation is happening on-line by means of social media.  However, it does not happen overnight.  People wonder about how can anyone be so attracted to beheadings?  What interpretation of Islam or religion produces that connection?  If one listens to the on-line recruiting, that is not how they attract young people.  The narrative of ISIS that is very appealing, attracts some young disgruntled, disoriented and confused Muslims is the following: there is a major humanitarian and moral crisis in Syria today which is borderline genocidal.  The world has abandoned the refugees, the women and children and there are chemical weapons being used.  The narrative reasons that the person, as a believing Muslim, has a moral obligation to come to the aid of his or her brothers and sisters who are suffering; that the person has a moral obligation to stand up for his or her co-religionists; that he or she should abandon this secular material lifestyle of comfort he or she is living in the West and come and be part of something that is bigger; that he or she should come and change the course of history; that no one cares about Syrian suffering, Syrian refugees, Syrian displacement but that he or she can play a role.  That is what attracts people, but, of course, when young people go there, which is easy to do, they discover it is very difficult to come back.  The narrative that draws people in is really one of moral suffering, abandonment, appealing to young people in their late teens and 20s, many of whom have a sense of adventure, that they can be part of something bigger.  However, as I hinted, other things are going on.<\/p><p>  There is this particular puritanical and intolerant interpretation of Islam that, sadly, has become mainstream within the Sunni Muslim community.  In most Sunni mosques in North America, the ones with which I am most familiar, most of the interpretations, in varying degrees, overlap or have shades of Wahabi teachings embedded within them.  This is the idea that Christians are not really people of good standing, that they cannot be trusted.  This comes from the view that there is only one interpretation of religion that matters - forget Christians, Jews, atheists and Buddhists.  In this interpretation of Islam there is also a deep intolerance against other Muslim interpretations - there is one way - my way or the highway.  In many ways, this is not unique to Islam.  The history of religions is filled with the clash of the intolerance of different voices, some that are radical, some that are more tolerant and some that lie in between.  This is also part of the narrative.  If one observes the form of Islam to which these young people are exposed, particularly in the English Muslim scene, it is an intolerant interpretation.  Sadly, the inclusive, more open-minded, more democratically oriented interpretations of Islam are in the minority.  These are the ones that need to be supported and encouraged to provide an alternative voice for young people because it is a problem if all they hear is that the only authentic way to be a good Muslim is to subscribe to that interpretation of Islam.  It is part of the overall radicalisation process, but it is not the only one.  Youth radicalisation has taken place throughout history, whether in religious or non-religious settings.  It is not something that is about religion.  There may be an assumption that if the majority of the people in the Middle East were not Muslim, if they were Buddhist, we would not have this problem, but I disagree with that assumption.  It is much more than a problem with religion; religion is part of it, but it is not the key element; it is a contributory factor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900009#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nader Hashemi"},{"type":"speech","time":1416410700,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>The committee visited the Middle East last year.

On the Syrian refugee question, one my big concerns is that the conflict in Syria does not look like it is going to end any time soon and there is already a great number of refugees.  There are 3 million Syrians who have been formally registered by the UN as refugees, and another 6 million to 7 million who have been internally displaced.  Those are, unfortunately, ideal recruiting grounds for groups such as ISIS who can appeal to these refugees who have no chance of going home, no jobs, no future, to come and join them.<\/p><p>  The region was deeply destabilised in 1948 as a result of the Israel-Palestine conflict and the spread of the Palestinian refugee problem, which is ongoing.  It has created a lot of instability in neighbouring countries.  In Jordan, there was a major civil war in 1970 and its population is majority Palestinian refugees.  It has had a long-standing problem with negotiating its Jordanian-Palestinian identity.  The big fear is that Syrian refugees are going to play an equally destabilising role.  The difference is that now we have ISIS, which can recruit people.  In the case of the Palestinian refugees we did not have a radical Islamo-fascist group that could recruit people.  It is a cause for concern that unless the crisis in Syria is solved in some way where these refugees can start to go home, we will start seeing ripple effects, spill-over and unpredictable consequences that do not bode well for the stability of the region.  Given the globalised world in which we live, all of us in the international community are going to feel the destabilising effects of this conflict in one way or another.  This is another reason Syria demands our attention.  In many ways it is central to solving the problems of instability in the region.  The Chairman just alluded to one small aspect of it that has the potential to be very catastrophic.<\/p><p>  With respect to Iran and its role in Syria, I am a strong critic of Iran's foreign policy towards Syria, largely because Iran has arguably been the biggest backer of the Assad regime.  The footprints of the Islamic Republic of Iran are all over the atrocities of the Assad regime.  The statements from the Iranian leadership suggest that Syria is the equivalent of Iran's 37th province, in other words, that it is more important than the oil-producing regions of Iran.  Iran is deeply embedded with the Assad regime and has stated in many different ways, directly and indirectly, that it is willing to back Assad to the end.  <\/p><p>  Iran's geostrategic view of the region is based on its rivalry with Saudi Arabia.  The big fear is that if a pro-Iranian regime in Damascus falls, it is going to upset the balance of power in the region to the benefit of Saudi Arabia and its allies.  The other concern that Iran has for Syria is that Syria is the conduit to Iran's major ally in the region, Hezbollah.  It does not want to see the Damascus regime fall, so I cannot see Iran playing a particularly positive role on the Syrian question because it has been so deeply embedded by backing the Assad regime.  <\/p><p>  There is a connection with the nuclear question which is one reason President Obama has been reluctant to go after Assad and get more deeply involved in talking about a political solution with Syria, in my opinion.  He knows that will have negative consequences for the US-Iran nuclear negotiations, which are at a very sensitive point right now.  There is a lot of evidence suggesting that one reason Obama backed off and turned the conflict over to the Russians last September, having threatened to hit Assad after he used sarin gas on his own people, was that at the time, as we now know, Iran and the US were in secret negotiations over the nuclear issue in Oman.  There are statements by Iranian leaders to the effect that, had there been a military strike against Syria, Iran would have pulled out of those negotiations and the interim Geneva agreement would not have been produced.  These issues are in many ways intertwined and overlapping, but at least in the short term I do not see Iran playing a positive role.  Rhetorically, Iran has said that it supports self-determination for the people of Syria and free and fair elections, but it also very openly supported the fraudulent election that Bashar Assad held in June, which was a fake election.  Iran's official rhetoric on supporting the legitimate voices and grievances of the Syrian people is not matched by its military behaviour, or by its support for sham political processes that we have seen take place in Syria.  I view it as a very negative player in the Syrian context.<\/p><p>  Having said that, Iran is a regional player and has to be part of any stabilisation plan for the broader Middle East.  If we can get to a nuclear accord with Iran, that will be an important step forward.  It might open the door to solving other regional issues.  The Saudi-Iran rivalry was mentioned before.  That has exacerbated and raised the political temperature in Syria to new levels, but the fundamental roots of the Syrian crisis go back three and a half years, to a pro-democracy uprising in the context of the Arab Spring, with which Saudi Arabia and Iran were not involved.  All that was involved was citizens protesting against a political tyranny.  As the conflict spread and became militarised, that allowed for regional countries to get involved, supporting different sides and complicating what had been a very difficult problem to begin with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900010#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nader Hashemi"},{"type":"speech","time":1416411300,"counter":1020,"content":"<p>How strong are the relationships between all these radical Islamic groups like al-Qaeda, Boko Haram and ISIS and the other groups in the region as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900010#J00300","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416411300,"counter":1021,"content":"<p>Thankfully, they are not very strong at all.

There is a rivalry for regional dominance in the Middle East between two of the major powers, Iran and Saudi Arabia.  Iran has been significantly weakened economically, the Deputy is right, because of its nuclear programme.  It has also gained somewhat in political influence after the demise of Saddam Hussein, because the successor Government in Iraq has been a group of Shia political parties that are allied with and sympathetic to Iran.  Iran's influence has in many ways expanded into Iraq, where before it had no influence under Saddam Hussein.  The economic sanctions have weakened Iran, but it is still able to sell its oil on the international market.  It is a fairly rich country by developing-world standards, and is still a long way off from economic collapse and from being a destitute, broken society.  It has a lot of cards to play.  One reason it has come to the negotiating table on the nuclear question is what Deputy Byrne hinted at, namely, it realises its economic future will not be able to improve unless it resolves this nuclear question and the economic sanctions are lifted.  We are still a long way away from any kind of total collapse or a reduction in Iran's regional influence as a result of the current sanctions placed on it.<\/p><p>  Saudi Arabia does not want Iran's influence to increase and that is completely understandable.  These are two countries that have conflicting interests.  One thing the international community could be doing is trying to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia to some sort of common understanding.  As long as these two countries are funnelling and fuelling different groups and militias it is going to add to the political conflict in the region.<\/p> <p>The new, moderate Government in Iran under President Rouhami has tried to reach out to the Saudis and achieve a dialogue, and I hope this is a step forward.  However, there is a long way to go before we can hope Iran and Saudi Arabia have put aside their differences, largely because the conflict between them has been ongoing at various levels since 1979.  The Deputy put his finger on something that is very important in the destabilisation of the region, namely, the regional rivalries and proxies that are funded by major powers, of which Saudi Arabia and Iran are two of the biggest.  This must be part of any regional de-escalation of the conflict in the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900010#J00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nader Hashemi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416411900,"counter":1025,"content":"<p>I return to the possible curtailment of revenue to ISIS, particularly the oil revenue.

Early this year, President Obama called ISIS the junior varsity, JV, team of al-Qaeda.  He did not pay much attention to it, and this was not his personal view but what his intelligence services were telling him.  The general view is that nobody predicted that ISIS would emerge into the fighting force it has become.  It has been a surprise to many people watching events in Iraq to see a group that had formed and announced itself only in 2013 dominating approximately 81,000 sq. m. of real estate, approximately the size of Great Britain, in the heart of the Middle East.  It has been a shock to many people and was unpredictable.  One explanation for the success of ISIS is that there is nobody to stand against them.  The existing states in Iraq and Syria have withered away.  There is much Sunni disgruntlement and disillusionment, which has produced support for ISIS in these parts of the Middle East.  The good news is that the world has finally woken up to the fact that it cannot ignore the rise of ISIS and that it is not just a Middle East problem but a global problem.  There has been a major intelligence failure, but one of which everybody is guilty because nobody saw it coming.<\/p><p>  One of the reasons ISIS has been successful is because it has captured a number of Syrian oil fields and has sold oil on the black market, giving it a revenue source.  The other major source of funding that has been widely reported is the money that is being given by private charities in the Gulf region.  There is a lot of money in the Gulf area, and many people with rich, deep pockets, and they have been a major source of financial support for ISIS.  That private money comes largely from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.  Although it is often misreported in the media that the Saudi and Qatari Governments are supporting ISIS, there is no evidence to support it.  Private money has been a major reason ISIS has been so successful.  It can pay its fighters more generous monthly stipends to keep them loyal compared to other groups, and this must change if we want to help change the battlefield conditions in Iraq and Syria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900011#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nader Hashemi"},{"type":"speech","time":1416411900,"counter":1027,"content":"<p>I find this enlightening, as other members will.  It is a very good insight into the situation.  It appears mystifying that a very fragmented opposition to Assad, at one stage comprising 14 disparate groups, emerged as a dominant force ahead of al-Qaeda.  From what Dr. Hashemi says, it appears to be the dominant force there.  On the other hand, he advises that we should support the other moderate rebels, some of whom are probably already being subsumed into ISIS.  In practical terms, how can the situation be turned around?  It almost seems as if they will have to be defeated before anything can be done.  Most religions place a great emphasis on the dignity, preservation and protection of human life.  How can it be that so many within the Muslim communities are prepared to be suicide bombers, for example in 9-11, prepared to lose their own lives as well as killing others?  Obviously, it is done in the hope that they can be saved, in religious terms.  It seems to jar.

This explains the rapid success, because these people know how to run an army and a state.  It is not simply a band of radical Islamic militants.  One of the key elements of the support structures of ISIS is the remnants of the former Iraqi Ba&rsquo;ath army, which has played a critical role.  This speaks to the fundamental question of Iraq&rsquo;s future.  Iraq&rsquo;s new Government does not have the legitimacy it needs to defeat the remnants of the former regime.<\/p><p>  The rebels need to be vetted.  There are many Syrian young people, some of whom have joined ISIS or other rebel groups, some more extreme, some more moderate.  One of the challenges of supporting a moderate rebel movement is that there must be proper vetting.  In any battle that takes place there are people who do not have strong ideological convictions but are young and destitute and have taken up arms to fight for a better future.  They will often switch sides based on who is winning a particular war.  One reason ISIS has attracted many recruits is because it seems to be winning.  It is the lead horse.  If one can support the moderate Syrian rebels, show they have a base of support, a buffer zone and a future, many recruits will go the other way, simply because they seem to be on the winning side.  This is a major part of any civil war calculation.<\/p><p>  On the Senator's question about religion and suicide bombings, it comes down to a confluence of a set of political circumstances that feeds a particular religious interpretation.  Do the members know which country produced most of the 9-11 suicide bombers?  It was Saudi Arabia.  Of the 19 people involved in the attack, 15 came from one country.  Was it a coincidence, or does it tell us something about the internal politics and policies of Saudi Arabia?  These were not destitute or the poorest of the poor, but middle class people, many of them educated, but who felt their political future could best be invested in by engaging in such a suicide operation.  It highlights the tragedy and nightmare authoritarian regimes produce for their civilians and societies.  There have been many reports that many of the ISIS suicide bombers who have engaged in attacks in Iraqi cities against other rebel groups also come from Saudi Arabia.<\/p><p>  A predictable set of consequences emerge from closed political systems with no representation, political parties, civil society or newspapers and where the only way a young person feels he or she can change his or her future is by engaging in some type of radical political action.  It is not fundamentally a problem of religion, although religion is a component of it, but a question of the political and social circumstances that produce such behaviour at a particular moment in time.  This is the root of the problem.  It does not happen in Indonesia, the biggest, most populous Muslim country in the world.  One reason is because Indonesia is an emerging democracy.  For all its flaws and problems as a developing society, the indicators and measurements for democratic development in Indonesia are fairly good by developing world standards, and in terms of the Muslim world, it is one of the most advanced countries.<\/p> <p>That tells us something about how we should deal with these questions of radicalisation and destabilisation.  If we support a broader process of democratisation, political development, inclusion, with strong civil societies and interpretations of Islam that are more inclusive and humanistic, it will not produce the radicalisation we are seeing in the Iraqi, Syrian and Saudi Arabian nexus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900011#K00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nader Hashemi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416412500,"counter":1030,"content":"<p>Dr. Hashemi is in big demand today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900012#L00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1416412500,"counter":1031,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Hashemi for his wonderful insight into the conflict and educating us all on the serious difficulties encountered as a result.

I do not believe one can negotiate or engage in dialogue with him and his group.  However, it is possible to reach out to those members of the Sunni population in Iraq and Syria who form the bulk of the supporters of his movement and woo them away from this radical movement known as Islamic State.  It is possible to offer them alternative options by letting them know that there is a future for them in their countries.  There is a new Iraqi Government that is reaching out to them, letting them know that their future lies in Iraq, not with Islamic State.  The same general principle also applies in the case of Syria.  If people are given options that are more inclusive and tolerant, they will choose the more tolerant and inclusive ones than the more radical ones.  That is a broad principle that applies in all societies across different moments in time.<\/p><p>  In response to Senator Michael Mullins's questions, I have not been invited by the parliaments of other European Union countries to talk to them about this issue, but if he could set up these meetings, I would be happy to go, especially if he could pay my travel expenses.<\/p><p>  I believe the vast majority of the Syrian people support the moderates.  We do not know fundamentally what the people of Syria actually want and support because they have never been given the opportunity to express a point of view.  That is precisely where the story begins.  When one family has been in power for 44 years, with no free elections and no free press, we do not know what the people in that country support.  I encourage members to visit the Syrian Freedom Charter website and find out more about it.  It is the most detailed survey of Syrian public opinion - inside Syria and outside Syria - which I believe represents the voice of the moderates.<\/p><p>  The Senator asked if I was optimistic about the Carter peace plan.  Unfortunately, I am very pessimistic.  Until major countries - the major powers in the world - come to prioritise the question of Syria, it will not be put on the track to find a solution.  Up until now the view has been that Syria is a tragedy, that we cannot do much about it and that the situation can be contained.  I may be a little more optimistic today than I was a few months ago because ironically as a result of the ISIS crisis, Syria is now back on the global agenda.  People now realise we cannot ignore the situation in Syria and pretend that it will go away.  Many people were hoping President Assad would just stay in power, that he would resolve the issue and that it did not matter to us.  Actually it does.<\/p><p>  There is a deeper lesson.  When countries engage in activities that are borderline genocidal, including mass displacement, human rights violations and war crimes, we cannot pretend that the situation will simply contain itself, particularly given that Syria is in the heart of the Middle East and borders seven countries.  It has affected Iraq, Jordan and now the international community.  Therefore, I am not optimistic about the Carter peace plan.  However, if countries such as Ireland start to give voice to Syria, the Carter peace plan and the freedom charter and let people know that we need to take the situation in Syria seriously because it affects all of us, there is some room for optimism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014111900012#L01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nader Hashemi"},{"type":"speech","time":1416412500,"counter":1039,"content":"<p>It would be remiss of me not to ask Dr. Hashemi a general question.

We represent almost 6,000 workers across 26 counties, and work to promote the responsible sale, marketing and consumption of alcohol and to share best practices with the entire trade.  It is a mandatory requirement for membership of NOffLA that one is trained and examined under NOffLA's responsible trading certificate to ensure that alcohol is retailed in the safest and most responsible manner possible.  Our members' outlets tend to be owner-operated and located in the heart of their communities.  As alcohol is our primary product, retailing responsibility and, by extension, retaining a clean off-trade licence is of fundamental importance, as loss of licence equals loss of livelihood.<\/p><p>  NOffLA welcomes all new measures designed to curb problem drinking and reduce public order offences and looks forward to the introduction of the public health (alcohol) Bill, amongst other legislation, for its potential to curb irresponsible pricing and promotion of alcohol.  Conscious of the delays that can occur in bringing about new legislative mechanisms, including delays entirely out of the hands of the Government such as European scrutiny, NOffLA stresses the urgency in considering matters already on the Statute Book that can have an immediate and positive impact.<\/p><p>  NOffLA believes that a stringent application of existing laws regarding both the sale and consumption of alcohol would serve to limit the access of young people to alcohol.  This would reduce the levels of public drunkenness and by extension, social order issues.  For example, fines ranging from &euro;500 to &euro;5,000, as well as summary convictions, exist for the following offences: adolescents who purchase alcohol, adolescents who lie about their age to purchase alcohol, adolescents who consume alcohol in public, adults who purchase alcohol for children, and adults who permit a child to consume alcohol in their home without the express consent of their parent or guardian.  Lesser, yet still notably punitive, fines exist for public drunkenness and any offensive and abusive actions that can ensue.  Were it to become common knowledge through enforcement that public and underage drunkenness carry heavy penalties, individuals would think twice before consuming to excess and committing these offences.  A full list of these infractions can be found in the presentation appendices.<\/p><p>  NOffLA does not seek to place the blame solely on the consumer, recognising that alcohol retailers are the final link between the product and any consumer who may ultimately commit the public order offence.  NOffLA has no time or sympathy for any retailer involved in the irresponsible retailing of alcohol as ultimately those of us who retail strictly within the law are punished for their irresponsibility in terms of our reputation as responsible retailers.  Matters such as underage purchasing should be rigorously investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify how the alcohol was acquired and harsh sanctions be delivered as appropriate.  I must add that these investigations may be hampered by a wider systemic shortfall in community policing due to other Garda commitments.  This often results in suspected incidences of proxy-purchasing being reported by retailers but not being caught in time by the Garda due to its limited resources.<\/p><p>  To mitigate the incidence of irresponsible retail in the off-trade, NOffLA has long maintained that the current Responsible Retailers of Alcohol in Ireland, RRAI, code of practice on the display and sale of alcohol products in supermarkets, petrol stations and convenience stores is entirely unfit for purpose and is in desperate need of replacement.  Not only is the code voluntary, it permits the self-service of alcohol and contains ambiguous terms such as \"as far as possible\" that results in seemingly high compliance rates for retailers that do not nearly match the prevalence of these irresponsible practices.<\/p><p>  NOffLA strongly disagrees with the decision by successive Governments not to enact section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, which provides for the separation of alcohol products from all other grocery products in mixed trading premises.  The proposed substitute, the publication of a statutory code using section 16 of the miscellaneous provisions Bill promised since October 2013, while far from ideal, is nonetheless eagerly awaited.  We understand, however, that there may be an issue with the lack of sanction contained in section 16 of the miscellaneous provisions Bill which is causing delays at the Office of the Attorney General, and would ask the committee to consider calling on the Minister for Justice and Equality to immediately enact section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, which will have the same impact and, more importantly, the required sanction.<\/p><p>  Either way, we believe the introduction of the statutory code, using section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 or section 16 of the miscellaneous provisions Bill, should reflect the urgency of this issue and we would recommend that it adequately addresses the need to separate alcohol from other products with a clear divisible means of access.  Access to this alcohol area should be strictly confined to adults and exclude those under 18 unless they are accompanied by an adult - which is currently the law in off-licences.  Alcohol should only be purchased in this area with a dedicated till operated by a trained shop assistant.  Our full recommendations in this regard can also be found in the presentation appendices.<\/p><p>  NOffLA recommends also that the committee consider augmenting the powers and protections afforded to off-licence retailers so that they can exercise judgment in refusing sales, whether it be a consumer's state of mind or suspicion that he or she is buying for others, without fear of infringing on that person's civil liberties.  Our hands are tied legally, for example, from preventing a young person on his or her 18th birthday buying a litre of spirits even though it is unlikely that the person alone will consume that quantity - and if that were the case, it would be even more dangerous.  An example of the issues faced by off-licence retailers and the legal risks are illustrated in Appendix II of the presentation.  This is where a member of ours received a solicitor's letter stating that a girl of 18 years plus ten days who had been refused a litre of vodka had her civil liberties infringed by our member refusing to sell it to her and offering to sell her a smaller amount.<\/p><p>  The National Off-Licence Association is grateful for the opportunity to appear before the committee today, and grateful for the committee's time in considering the points we have made.  We look forward to working with the committee, and Government, on this important issue.  We are happy to elaborate on the issues presented and relevant questions the committee may have.<\/p><p>  By way of context, I am accompanied by Mr. Kevin O'Brien, an off-licence proprietor in the busy Mulhuddart area who employs 15 people and is knowledgeable regarding staff training, benefits of community policing and local public order issues, and Mr. Martin Moran who advises NOffLA members on licensing law and related legal issues, and as such can clarify any matters in this regard.  As for myself, I operate an off-licence in Rathgar as well as being the Chair of the National Off-Licence Association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111900003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Evelyn Jones"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416391800,"counter":1061,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the committee.  I am accompanied by Ms Noreen O'Sullivan, who is our national president and a publican operating in Nenagh, County Tipperary.  Much of what I have to say will echo many of the comments made by Ms Jones.  I am here in my capacity as chief executive of the Vintners Federation of Ireland, which represents thousands of small businesses which run public houses outside Dublin.  The federation has 4,000 members.<br\/>The theme of this meeting is legislative issues surrounding licensing laws.  This discussion is most welcome because the current licensing situation in Ireland is putting small businesses at a distinct disadvantage.  Changes to the laws surrounding how alcohol is sold, especially the removal of the groceries order in 2006, have been instrumental in driving a sea change in the way in which Irish people consume alcohol.  In 1999, 60% of the volume of alcohol consumed in Ireland was bought in the on-trade and 40% was bought in the off-trade.  By 2013, those ratios had been completely reversed.  This has had a number of profound affects, including: the loss of thousands of jobs from the employment intensive on-trade; the health impact of encouraging drinking outside of a regulated environment; and the social impact resulting from isolation.  The grim reality, which many of the members will recognise, is that the rural pub is slowly disappearing from the landscape.<br\/>Given that this committee is focused on the legislative issues surrounding licensing laws, I do not intend to dwell on the impact that the rural pub has on local communities and Ireland's tourism infrastructure.  Instead, we will turn our attention to the specific policy issues that this committee must consider in the context of the Irish licensing regime.  Members of the drinks industry in Ireland are very aware that there are issues surrounding the misuse of alcohol.  We want to work with the Government to address these issues, not least because they are causing significant damage to the reputation of an industry which supports 92,000 jobs throughout the country.  That is why members of the Support Your Local campaign &ndash; which includes pubs, restaurants, hotels and independent off-licences, as well as drinks suppliers throughout the country &ndash; issued a pledge in April 2014 to work with the Government on the implementation of meaningful policy measures to combat alcohol misuse.  These measures involve addressing the sale of cheap alcohol; introducing a statutory ban on price-based advertising; and introducing statutory codes to regulate the merchandising of alcohol.  I will now comment briefly on each of these.<br\/>As already stated, in 2006 the then Government removed the groceries order on all goods including alcohol.  This was despite warnings from the drinks industry that it would lead to a situation in which supermarkets would follow the example of their UK counterparts and use alcohol as a footfall driver.  Unfortunately, that prophecy has been proved absolutely correct.  In light of the complete absence of real regulation on the way alcohol can be purchased in supermarkets, footfall is often driven through offering promotions relating to the quantity of alcohol purchased.  Gone are the days of the humble six pack.  Consumers are now offered slabs of beer and this beer is actually cheaper than water.  To place this matter in context, I have in my possession a copy of an advertisement from a Sunday newspaper published prior to St. Patrick's Day 2005 in which a slab of beer is advertised at &quot;cost price&quot;.  The price quoted in the advertisement is &euro;37.98.  If one purchases today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, one will see that the same product is now being sold for &euro;24.  This places the effect of the abolition of the groceries order, as it relates to the sale of alcohol, into perspective.<br\/>The scale of the problem we are discussing can be difficult to articulate properly because the CSO does not collect information on promotions.  However, industry figures show that 60% of the volume of alcohol sold in Ireland is now purchased in off-licences - mainly those attached to multiple supermarkets - and that 70% of off-licence alcohol is sold on promotion.  This means that 42% of the volume of all alcohol sold in this country is bought at close to or below cost.  In an attempt to make back margin on such sales, the price of bread, nappies, milk and other such products must be increased.  The Government needs to address this issue as a matter of urgency and the drinks industry stands ready to work with it when it does so.  It should be noted that the State actually subsidises this below-cost sale of alcohol through the VAT system.<br\/>Footfall is often driven through supermarkets by large expenditure in the media, particularly the print media.  Not only is this contributing to the problem I have just outlined, it is also creating an environment wherein the sale of cheap alcohol is normalised.  One need only look at a Sunday newspaper in the days before a bank holiday weekend - or any weekend -  to see the scale of price-based advertising on the part of the multiple retail chains.  Before 2006, multiple retailers used promotions on consumer electronics and other products to drive footfall but the removal of the groceries order has allowed them to use alcohol instead.  If the Government were to act to ban this practice, these retailers would simply find a new product to entice consumers into their stores.  The mechanism for the Government to address this issue already exists.  Section 16 (2) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 allows that where the Minister is satisfied that the medium used for the advertising, or the nature of the advertising, or both, is intended or likely to encourage the consumption of intoxicating liquor to an excessive extent, the need to prohibit or restrict such advertising will come into play.  There can be no doubt that price-based advertising in the print media, whereby consumers are often encouraged to purchase more and more to maximise the so called value of a promotion, falls under this category.<br\/>The final point that needs to be considered by the committee relates to placing codes to regulate alcohol on a statutory footing.  There is one particular code which I wish to highlight and to which Ms Jones has already referred.  The 2008 Act contains provisions in respect of separating alcohol from other products in mixed-trading outlets.  Essentially, those who drafted the Act wanted to put a stop to the practice of placing white wine beside nappies in supermarkets.  However, following an extensive lobby from the multiple retail chains section 9 of the Act, which contains these provisions, was not commenced.  Instead the voluntary responsible retailing of alcohol in Ireland code was introduced.  In substance, this code differs from what was proposed in the Act in a single - but central - way, namely, it is voluntary rather than statutory in nature.  The code states that certain things should be put in place but, as Ms Jones pointed out, the inclusion of the phrase &quot;as far as possible&quot; renders it meaningless and useless.  Naturally, this phrase made the entire code redundant and to this day it has been honoured more in the breach than in the observance.  The Government must commence this section of the 2008 Act in order to force large multiple retailers to level the playing field.  We simply want to operate in a fair trading environment where the substantial advantages that the large multiple retailers enjoy are not copper-fastened in legislation.<br\/>Current licensing laws date back to 1833 and have been updated regularly since then.  The result is a very intricate and complicated set of laws.  These laws need to be simplified and their consolidation has been promised for almost ten years.  Unfortunately, this matter has actually slipped down the list of priorities.  The consolidating legislation is now promised for mid-2015.  However, a promise in this regard has been made on an annual basis for almost a decade.  Part of the regime to which I refer involves licensing hours and days.  At present, Good Friday is a prohibited day.  The Easter weekend has become a central part of the tourist offering and it is impossible to continue to justifying this position.  A Private Members' Bill to rectify the position in this regard was introduced in the Seanad and we would urge members to support it.<br\/>I thank members for their attention and we will gladly try to answer any questions they may wish to pose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111900004#C00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Cribben"},{"type":"speech","time":1416391800,"counter":1062,"content":"<p>I apologise for the fact that I will be obliged to leave in a moment in order to go to the Seanad.

Obviously we are not comfortable selling alcohol to persons who are under age and we are definitely not comfortable selling alcohol to an adult who will give it to a child.  We have to police an area of 100 metres in front of our shops, so one would keep an eye out.  If one saw an adult walk out with six cans of beer and hand it to a child, one would confiscate that alcohol and bring it back into the shop.

There is a significant difference in price.  How can one pay &euro;5.50 or &euro;6 for a bottle of alcohol that can be sold in a supermarket for &euro;1?

Most of the time, and to repeat what I said earlier, 42% of all alcohol is sold on promotion.  Some 70% of what one sees in the supermarket is sold on promotion, which is generally below cost.  One cannot compare the price and value in the supermarket with what one gets in a pub.  They are two very different experiences.  One goes into a pub, and the publican is paying for lighting, entertainment, for Sky sports, water charges and so on.<\/p><p>  The product that is being sold in the supermarket is being sold below cost.  There is the perception that this is consumer-friendly.  It is anything but consumer-friendly.  The supermarkets are super-profitable and they must recoup the cost of the promotion.  One does not become super-profitable by selling one's products below cost.  One has a footfall driver and one sells that below cost to get people in but when people come in they buy other products.  The price and the cost to the consumer of other staple products, whether they be bread, milk or nappies, is increased.<\/p><p>  Our engagement with Government for quite some time has been to request the introduction of a minimum unit price for alcohol.  In 2014, the broader drinks industry signed a pledge that it would work with Government to tackle the issue of cheap alcohol.  There are a number of ways to do it.  One way is to reintroduce the groceries order.  That worked in the past, it can work again and it is immediate.  Minimum unit pricing is another option.  We recognise, and people may not be aware, that the concept of minimum unit pricing has been introduced in Scotland but it has been held up because some vested interests have taken a court case against it which is now being adjudicated in Europe.  We all know that Europe does not necessarily move too quickly as it takes a long time to get out of first gear into second gear.  We are probably looking at a period of 18 months to two years for that adjudication.<\/p><p>  The Government made a commitment this time last year to introduce minimum unit pricing.

They have been referred to by Deputy Mac Lochlainn.  There is a concept, described by a new word in the dictionary, called pre-loading.  That is exactly what Deputy Mac Lochlainn described.  It is a major problem for publicans.  People come in and have one or two drinks, which really should have no effect, but the publican will find it is having a serious effect because the people have consumed a great deal of alcohol before they have come into the pub.  There is an added problem for publicans who run late night operations.  A number of people come in, not only pre-loaded but also well stocked.  They come in and buy a coke but the naggin of vodka is somewhere else.  They go into the toilets and suddenly the coke is a lot strong than it was before they went in.  That is a major problem and it leads to public order issues.  In some places, the biggest problem in terms of public order issues is where people have been refused entry because of the level of pre-loading.  They never get inside but the problem remains outside, when people are told they are not getting in.<\/p><p>  The availability of cheap alcohol feeds directly into the issue of public order.

It has been said to us time and again that part of our culture is to drink but the culture seems to be heading in the direction of binge drinking.  Young people, the young adults over 18 years seem to think that binge drinking is the way to go.  It is very serious from the point of view of their health but it has very serious implications for public order.  People have accidents and end up in hospital.  Do the witnesses wish to comment on the binge drinking culture that seems to be accelerating, where people drink to get drunk?  In other jurisdictions I have visited that is not the case, it is frowned upon.  In some countries it is a badge of shame to be drunk in public.  Here it seems to be the thing to do.

Let me put it in context, some 93% of all the pubs in Ireland are family owned businesses.  They operate in communities and by and large their customers are either neighbours or friends or sons and daughters of neighbours and friends.  They have no great interest in peddling alcohol to very young people.  I openly suggest that the alcohol that is being sourced for the very young people is not being sourced, by and large, in pubs.  It is sometimes dangerous to generalise but there is a shift in culture whereby the target for some people is not social drinking but how quickly they can get drunk.  That is a major challenge for the members of the Vintners Federation of Ireland.  Equally, another major challenge is pre-loading, the concept I mentioned earlier.  One does not know the extent to which people are pre-loaded when they come into the pub.  If they are looking for a quick hit, that is a problem that is different from the situation in the past.<\/p> <p>Moreover, when they do come in, they are seeking what one might call a quick fix or a quick hit.  That problem certainly is different from where it was previously and is one that requires significant different levels of management on behalf of licensees.

Fundamentally, it goes to two core issues, the first of which is that of education, and again I refer to drink-driving and smoking, where the impetus came from the children.  It started at the bottom and worked its way up that it was unacceptable to smoke as a parent and was unacceptable to drink and drive.  A young person now would not consider getting into a car with somebody who had taken alcohol.  That is how education on those issues worked and, if possible, we should have the same education regarding alcohol.  As to the second issue and to close the circle on the Chairman's previous question, I refer to the point at which the doorbell rings, the alcohol is presented and the 18 year old comes to the door with his Garda ID.  Legally, he is entitled to purchase alcohol.  Once the door closes, it depends on who is behind the door but the reality is that an 18 year old person who appeared at the front door is responsible for anybody behind it who is under the age of 18 and consuming alcohol.  We seek an increased level of enforcement and if the laws that exist were used in respect of adults, that is, people aged 18 and over who are purchasing alcohol for those who are under 18, one could make serious inroads into this issue in a very brief period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111900007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Evelyn Jones"},{"type":"speech","time":1416393600,"counter":1092,"content":"<p>I have one final question.

One has an automatic rise in anti-social behaviour but when they are present and are seen travelling around the community on their bikes, there is an automatic drop.  Unfortunately, when I spoke to my local community guard about two months ago and told him I had not seen him for ages, he replied that he had been pulled off the job.  That has happened several times in recent years, that is, the first person to be pulled off his or her day-to-day duty is the community garda.  However, it is the community that suffers from the lack of that community garda.  I appreciate serious crimes and other things are going on but we must invest in community garda&iacute;, who are fantastic.  They build relationships with the local traders, the local community and even with people who perhaps normally would be anti-social.  They build a relationship and get to know such people and are able to nip it in the bud.  Similarly, we may have an incident in which we have a gang of kids, especially during the school holidays, who are hanging around the gates and so on and we know they are asking people to buy alcohol.  We could go out and ask them to scatter but I can assure members the answer we would get is not repeatable here today, never mind the threats we also would receive.

We want to do this, if possible, before 24 November.  The motions concerns a proposed opt-in regulation of the European Parliament and the Council establishing a European Union agency for law enforcement training would be very helpful to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  CEPOL is a European Union agency established in 2005.  Its goal is to bring together senior police officers from police forces in Europe, essentially to support the development of a network and encourage cross-border co-operation in public security, law and order and the fight against crime by organising training activities and research.  Ireland participates in the existing Council decision on CEPOL.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is an active contributor in a variety of ways to the work of CEPOL; in fact, it plays a central role in organising courses.<\/p><p>  CEPOL is a virtual college which organises between 80 and 100 courses, online seminars and conferences on topics relevant to police forces throughout Europe.  The implementation of the activities is organised by national course managers and normally takes place in the national police training colleges of the EU member states.  The operating budget is &euro;8.45 million which is spread over three pillars, namely, staffing, infrastructure and operational costs.  <\/p><p>  There are 34 full-time staff who were based in the United Kingdom but are now based in Budapest.  Work is ongoing to decide what the long-term future of CEPOL will be.  The Justice and Home Affairs Council of Ministers voted to move the seat to Hungary in October 2013.<\/p><p>  CEPOL is a very cost-effective way of upskilling members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in critical policing areas in times of restricted budgets, but it also offers a diversity of training courses for police officers in areas in which they may not have a national skills base.  This is very important.  There may be emerging areas or areas in which specific training is necessary for police officers.  It could be cyber crime, dismantling illicit laboratories or other such areas in which it would be very helpful to have a European and an international context for working together.<\/p><p>  I attended the international Interpol conference recently for one day and one could see where that kind of cross-border work, the sharing of information and upskilling on an ongoing basis was ever more necessary because crime did not stop in its methods.  Criminals are constantly upskilling in the way they commit crime, which is most obvious on the Internet.  CEPOL provides an opportunity to bring together those skilled in this variety of areas.<\/p><p>  There is a grant agreement system that allows people to attend.  This year 47 courses were attended by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Members can see that it is a useful resource in the areas of cyber crime and urban violence.  Another area at which they have looked is trafficking in human beings.  The courses facilitate a very wide range of topics to be considered by police officers.  There are also bilateral exchanges.  The topics covered are ones that have been identified as priority areas.  Each year member states apply for a grant agreement which is highly sought after. Therefore, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with other police forces, has to try to win the tender to undertake courses.  It contributes 5% towards the cost of running courses.<\/p><p>  The Garda College has been involved in the running of CEPOL courses since CEPOL was established.  There is a senior management programme which I am happy to say has been hosted by the college in Templemore in recent years.  It is a flagship programme and quite an amount of expertise has been developed by the college in the topics covered by the course.  The programme lasts for a full year and is organised in four one-week modules in four member states, from which members can see its complexity.  The final module of the course will be held in December in Templemore.<\/p><p>  This is a proposal for a regulation which the Commission has produced with a view to enhancing the operational mandate and reforming governance in line with general principles laid down in the Lisbon treaty.  The general aim of the proposal is to \"improve EU security through the implementation, by CEPOL, of a new training approach for EU law enforcement officers, consistent with evolving priorities for operational law enforcement and co-operation\".  It is putting governance on a stronger footing.  Obviously, the motion will pass through the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.<\/p><p>  I do not believe there are difficulties or implications arising from the regulation from an Irish perspective and recommend the motion to the committee.  There are certain governance principles, in line with those laid down in the common approach to EU decentralised agencies, and I am recommending that we exercise our discretion to opt in to the measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111900008#K00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1416394200,"counter":1104,"content":"<p>I apologise for being a little late to hear the Minister's presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111900008#K00400","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1416394200,"counter":1105,"content":"<p>Not at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014111900008#K00500","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1416394200,"counter":1106,"content":"<p>The principle of police services across Europe and internationally co-operating is welcome to combat the dangers posed by trafficking, drugs, security threats and so on.

Before commencing, I will briefly outline the challenges and provide information on the Eircode design, the consultation and the next steps in the process.<\/p><p>  As members can see from the slide showing the timeline of key events, the project has been on the go for quite a while, having started with a Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, symposium in 2003.  In 2006, the national postcode project board's report recommended that Ireland should introduce a postcode system.  A good Oireachtas report was also done in 2010.  It examined many of the issues with postcodes and recommended that a unique identifier be considered for the Irish addressing situation.  The procurement process started in 2011 and the contract was awarded in 2013.  The contract was approved by the Government in October of that year and signed in December.  The code's design went to the Government in April and was launched the same month.  Since then, a great deal of work has been undertaken.<\/p><p>  Before I get into the detail of the codes, it might be useful to refer to some of the issues with addressing in Ireland.  As many members are aware, there are 2.2 million addresses in Ireland, 200,000 of which are commercial.  Ireland is unique compared with other countries, particularly those in the OECD, in that greater than 35% of our addresses are non-unique.  Effectively, this means that many people have the same address as others.  Another relevant point is that, between 1991 and 2011, there was a 44% increase in the countryside's population as opposed to a 30% increase in the State overall.  There was not an identical increase in housing, but there was considerable new build.  I imagine that many of the new addresses are non-unique.  This gives a sense of the scale of the addressing challenges applying in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Also relevant is the fact that there can be surname clustering, particularly in rural areas.  None of the names in the slide we have supplied are real, but they give a sense of an area where many people can have the same surnames and initials because they are John, James, etc.  This poses a difficulty for deliveries.  An Post does a good job, but the world has changed and there has been considerable centralisation of call centres.  For utilities, delivery companies and emergency services, finding people in rural areas can be challenging.  The development of the project is meant to address this major issue.<\/p><p>  The addressing challenges do not stop in rural areas, as there are also issues in urban areas.  For example, there is no mandated form of addressing in Ireland.  As such, people tend to choose a form of address that suits them.  They can have multiple forms of address for the same house, as highlighted in the slide.  There are also vanity addresses.  Even in cities, finding people can be difficult because the same house can have three or four types of address.<\/p><p>  The question was what would be the best system to deal with the non-unique issue in rural areas and the addressing issues in urban areas.  After a long and detailed procurement process, a great deal of work and many reports on finding the best solution for Ireland, the one that resulted was Eircode.  Unique to each address, it is a seven-digit code divided into three and four digits.  The first three relate to a post town.  The example used is A65.  Currently, there are postcodes in Dublin like D12 and D24.  These are routing areas.  The Dublin codes will stay the same, including D6W.  After a routing area, a unique four-digit, alphanumeric code will be assigned to each address.  This means that no one will have to change one's form of address.<\/p> <p>This unique code will mean that in Ireland, nobody will have to change their form of address.  Unlike in other countries, there will be no mandated form of addressing.  Nobody will have to put up signs on roads all over the country.  People will not have to put anything up on their houses.  In effect, this system will allow people to have unique identifiers without having to do anything themselves, aside from getting their codes next year.<br\/>I would like to deal with an issue that has been raised with regard to the unique identifier.  People have asked why the code cannot be sequenced.  Intuitively, one would expect that this would be a good idea.  If one thinks about it, however, one will appreciate that unique identifiers that are allocated in a sequenced way will not last very long.  It would be impossible for new builds to be given codes that follow the sequence.  The documentation that has been furnished to the joint committee uses the example of a new house that is built between two existing houses.  In such a circumstance, it would not be possible to sequence that code.  Similarly, if a house were knocked to facilitate the development of apartments, it would not be possible to have a sequence.  It is possible that if we adopted a sequenced system with a unique identifier, we would have the worst of all worlds because people would think it was sequenced but it could turn out not to be sequenced.  In such circumstances, there would be a great deal of confusion among code holders, call centre staff and the emergency services.  We have adopted a non-sequential system to make sure that when a person gets a code, that code stays with that property.  When a person gets a code on a property, he or she will always have that code.  That means the system we have adopted is very future-proofed.  We feel it will work very well going forward.  I will give an example.  The use of seven digits in a three-digit and four-digit formation means that in any individual post town, one would have to go over 300,000 individual identifiers before one would run into any kind of issue.  Clearly, we are a very long way from that.  This shows how the system has been future-proofed.<br\/>The design of the postcodes is an issue that has been raised.  People have asked whether we should have considered the UK system.  Clearly, many systems were considered as part of the procurement process.  In terms of the output, the system that was chosen is one that will effectively meet the needs of the Irish addressing situation, as opposed to an addressing situation anywhere else.  We have adopted a non-sequential system as part of our approach to this unique situation.  As there will be many addresses in each area, we hope to avoid the situation in the UK, where a postcode can define a lot about individuals in terms of where their children go to school and where they can avail of the services of doctors.  We are avoiding the issue of postcode discrimination as it exists in the UK.  Postcode ghettos will not apply here.  We expect that the system will have many beneficial uses.  When people get their codes next year, they are likely to start using them for online ordering, etc.  However, the use of the system is not mandatory for individuals.  No one will be forced to use the system.  We believe the benefits of the codes are such that most people will start using their codes when they get them.<br\/>I would like to speak about the key benefits of this approach.  It is important to think about what is in it for people on the ground and what they feel are the benefits of the codes.  As part of Capita's communications strategy, it conducted a <i>vox pop<\/i>in urban and rural areas to ask people what they perceive to be the benefits of postcodes.  Many people who engage in online ordering said that they would like to be able to insert a postcode when asked, just as people in other countries can do, and that this would help them to get deliveries.  There was a recognition that this infrastructure is important in so far as it will allow Ireland to be up there with every other country.  I think the system we have chosen is world-beating because the unique identifier suits the Irish situation.  Many people, especially, in rural areas, said they clearly understand that it can hard for the emergency services and others to find locations in rural areas if they are not sure where people live.  This problem is exacerbated by the extent of new builds, the prevalence of surname clustering and the other issues I have mentioned.  Those who were asked about the codes could see many benefits of them.  We feel that when the codes are disseminated next year, the take-up will be very high.  Many people, especially those who engage in online ordering, already know about the real benefits of the introduction of these codes.<br\/>An extensive amount of consultation took place during the pre-tender phase in 2010 and 2011 and again during the post-tender phase.  I will not go through all of it, obviously, but I will give a sense of what was done.  While we did not engage in consultation after the design was adopted, we contacted those who will be affected by the design, including the emergency services, to ask them whether it would work for them.  The Department and Capita have both engaged significantly with stakeholders.  The Department has set up a forum with all the public sector bodies that will be adopting the codes next year.  The response has been overwhelmingly positive.  These bodies see the real benefits of the codes in terms of delivering services on the ground and, at a more strategic level, in terms of policy-making.  The codes will help public bodies to identify where people live and where services such as schools and doctors' surgeries are located.  They will give these bodies a sense of where the cohort of people they are trying to serve are living.<br\/>I will give a sense of how the cost of the project, which is approximately &euro;27 million, is divided.  The biggest part of the project in terms of individual payments relates to the encoding of public sector databases, such as those held by the Department of Social Protection, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The rationale for the encoding of those databases is to make sure people start using the codes immediately.  When the codes have been launched, the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners, etc., will start writing to people and the dissemination of the codes will begin.  People will obviously get a letter about the codes next year, but they will also start getting letters from State bodies with their codes.  This will give them a sense that something is really happening on the ground.  We feel that will support people taking up the codes.  Other payments are being made to An Post in respect of its dissemination of the codes next year, to GeoDirectory in respect of its database, which is one of the main ways to populate the Eircode database, and to Capita in respect of the design it has produced and the population of databases.  Some 18% of the costs are being paid to them.<br\/>As we roll out this very large infrastructure project next year, it will be very important for us to take the communications element of it very seriously.  The Department and Capita have put a great deal of work into designing a high-end communications strategy that will explain clearly to people why they are getting the codes and the potential benefits of the codes.  There will be community engagement as well as part of that.  The precise modalities of that have not been worked out.  This is part of the work we will be doing.  Capita and the Department will have a strategy there.<br\/>The issue of data protection has been raised.  The Minister has made it clear to us that he expects a belt-and-braces approach to data protection to be adopted.  We fully accept this requirement.  The contract with Capita contains very strong protections in regard to data protection.  I know that when Capita is doing the accreditation with the value-added resellers, it will emphasise the importance of data protection.  When the codes are launched next year, obviously our aim will be to ensure all members of the public have absolute confidence that their privacy concerns regarding this project are being addressed.  While it is not yet strictly necessary to do a privacy impact assessment - it is not a statutory requirement - the Department has undertaken such an assessment.  It has engaged with many stakeholders in the public and private sectors by asking them whether they envisage that any data protection or privacy issues will arise for individuals.  They have overwhelmingly said they do not expect such issues to arise.  However, they have emphasised that this is an important issue that must be managed.  They clearly feel that the protections that have been provided to date are quite strong.  We are satisfied that we are on the right road from a data protection perspective.<br\/>It might be useful to outline to the committee what the next steps with this project will be.  We are working hard on the encoding of the public sector databases.  We have put in dummy codes for the moment.  Clearly, the next step is for the large owners of databases like the Departments of Social Protection and Transport, Tourism and Sport to test the codes to ensure they fit in with those databases.  Most of them have a number of databases.  It is important for them to be satisfied that the codes will work.  Capita, which has already done a great deal of work around stakeholder engagement, will start a more intensive phase of that process in the new year.  It has already set up a website, <i>eircode.ie<\/i>, which is worth looking at.  It proposes to start a media campaign with the public in the early summer of 2015.  The Minister has said that in mid-2015, the codes will be launched and everybody will get a letter from An Post with their codes.  I thank the committee again.  I will be happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111900003#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Cronin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416390000,"counter":1139,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cronin.

I have a brief presentation and I am aware that I last to speak before members put their questions.  I want to give them a sense of what Capita is and of our credentials.  Capita is the largest business process re-engineering company in Europe and we employ more than 64,000 people.  Our annual turnover is just under &euro;5 billion for 2014 and when we announce our results it will be more than &euro;5 billion and our profitability after tax will be in excess of &euro;500 million.  We are a FTSE 500 company and ranked 52nd in the FTSE 100.  We are larger as an organisation than Marks &amp;amp; Spencer, easyJet, and Sainsburys.  Roughly 50% of our revenue comes from public sector contracts, so we have a good deal of experience in dealing with major contracts and we have over 30 years experience of delivering major projects of this nature.  We are now the largest business process re-engineering company in Ireland.  We are also the highest rated asset management company in Europe.  We employ more than 2,000 people in Ireland and an additional 1,050 people in Northern Ireland.  Thus, more than 3,000 people employed by Capita on the island of Ireland.  The jobs that we create in Ireland are high-end jobs.  We have people in financial services, insurance, IT and various other roles.  Some of the contracts we operate in Ireland are with NAMA, the insurance industry, Aviva, Prudential, MetLife.  We have a contract with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Our locations in Ireland are in Dublin, Kildare and Cork.<\/p><p>  The next slide illustrates the implementation programme.  We have a methodology we use in implementing programmes.  There is a good deal of detail behind this.  This sets out the high-end programme in a pictorial form.  <\/p><p>  The issues we trying to address in Ireland are those that Ms Liam Duggan, Ms Patricia Cronin and Mr. Eamon Molloy outlined.  The issue we have in Ireland is finding locations or addresses.  It is particularly an issue in rural Ireland with regard to those non-unique addresses.  I have a few illustrations that outline that in more detail.  It is an issue mainly but not exclusively in rural areas.  In rural areas, townlands are rarely signposted and the boundaries are not visible.  Boundaries often overlap and, compounding that, there are multiple locations with the same placenames such as Kilmore, Rathmore and Borris.  To compound that further, in some instances there are two or three locations called Kilmore.  Finding locations is difficult in Ireland.  As Ms Patricia Cronin outlined, there is also the vanity issue in terms of mistaken addresses where people are identified in one postal district or one townland when they are in another one.  Also, some towns and cities cross county borders such as Athlone which is both in Country Roscommon and County Westmeath.<\/p><p>  The next slide illustrates what we are talking about in terms of a non-unique address.  It shows a townland in County Meath that is roughly halfway between Slane and Navan.  It is known as Gormanlough and the next townland to the west is Causestown and the next one to the east is Stackallen.  There are no signposts.  Villages tend to have a signpost indicating one is entering the village and another way indicating one is leaving the village but townlands do not have such signposts.  It is rare to have a signpost that identifies where the townland is.  At the south of this illustration there is the main road between Navan and Slane and the signpost that leads one to that road points one in the direction of Kells but there is no mention on it of Gormanlough, Stackallen or Causestown.  Therefore, finding locations is difficult.  If one finds Gormanlough, it is not obvious from the road which are addresses and which are outbuildings.  When people are talking about structured or sequential codes, sequential codes may work in a city where there are streets with numbers on the premises but even with that there are some difficulties because some streets have even numbers on one side and odd numbers on the other side.  There is the matter of how to sequence to provide for that.  Finding addresses in towns and cities is not the issue, rather it is finding addresses in this sort of location.  Trying to come up with a sequence for this type of location is impossible.  Where does one start and finish, given that the townland is not demarked and one does not know what is a building that is an address that one will want to find and what is an outbuilding.  Trying to build a structure in a sequence around that is impossible.<\/p><p>  The next illustration sets out the townland as it will be when we will introduce Eircodes.  Each building will have a unique identifier or eircode.  A person living in Gormanlough will be able to say this is my Eircode and one can verify that Eircode is in Gormanlough and it will also give the X and Y co-ordinates for the location.  If a service delivery person is delivering a package or goods or a person from the emergency services is calling to the location, that eircode will bring them to the exact location.  It does solve the problem posed by the non-unique addresses in Ireland.  <\/p><p>  There has been talk about structures and it has been asked why can it not be obvious in the code what the structure is.  If we put a structure in a code, it will suit one specific industry - it may suit the logistics industry, but it will not necessarily suit other industries.  The next slide shows an illustration of County Kildare.  It sets out the district electoral divisions and Garda divisions for Kildare, which are difference.  By starting with an individual address point and the GPS co-ordinates, the X and Y of that, one can build up any area information one wants.  One can put in one's own boundaries and therefore every service delivery requirement is catered for.  One decides what the boundaries are and the database of addresses and corresponding eircodes will give the demarcations to suit that.  If one wants to deal in counties, district electoral divisions, or Garda subdivisions, one can do that and have them crossing borders.  One builds one's sequence to suit oneself from the database of codes and co-ordinates.  <\/p><p>  The next slide is another illustration.  It is not easy to see but it is a town and the red lines mark the district electoral division areas of the town and the picture on the right shows those buildings that fall within that district electoral division area marked out.  In a database one would have those subdivided and one could illustrate that on a wall and have the map on a wall with one's particular small areas marked out - it would not be predetermined for one.  We have a website with information for the general public and also information for businesses advising them what they need to do to get ready.   <\/p> <p>We are engaged in consultation processes with individual companies and industry bodies.  <\/p><p> I thank committee members for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111900005#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416391200,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>I thank all of the delegates for their presentations.  This topic has aroused a lot of debate since representatives of the Freight Transport Association Ireland appeared before us a few weeks ago.  It stated the postcode system was not fit for purpose and that it was costly.  In the presentation made today we have heard about a cost of &euro;27 million.  The FTAI used a figure of &euro;80 million.  How does one explain the difference in the amounts?  <\/p><p>  The word \"useless\" was also used to describe the postcode system.  In the previous presentation it was indicated that the emergency services were engaging with the Department on the postcode system but all members have since been contacted and told that this is not the case and that the view of the emergency services is that the system might cost lives.

I will make two points.  I will let the representatives of Capita which is managing that side for us deal with the issue of cost.  Ultimately, what is being offered is a business solution which solves a fundamental problem and will generate an awful lot of value.  Effectively, we have a situation in terms of delivery in Ireland where it is extremely difficult for businesses making deliveries in rural Ireland to find the point of delivery.  That is giving rise to very significant costs.  We have been told that the absence of a postcode in Ireland is creating issues around competitiveness because it is simply a more expensive country in which to engage in any type of logistical operation.  Dealing with the competitiveness problem requires us to address the issue of non-uniqueness.  The amount of 35% of addresses is very big and it does not just relate to homes; it also relates to business addresses.  In talking to major UK multinationals, as well as Irish companies involved in doing business in Ireland, it is clear it is a significant issue for them.  An important point for us is that it is a penalty which applies principally in rural areas and the regions.  The cost penalty does not arise in cities.  Looking at the project during the years, if one could say what the significant change has been in terms of mindset from 2010 on, ultimately it has really been about dealing with the uniqueness issue.  Dealing with uniqueness is not easy, but it has to be done.  In fairness, the committee was one of the first to deal with it, which very much helped the process.  It became clear that if one were to have a postcode, one would have to deal with the uniqueness issue.<\/p><p>  I have provided the direct cost to the State.  I am very glad to confirm that there has been a very extensive process of consultation since the beginning of the procurement process and even preceding it.  Ms Cronin&rsquo;s slides show that ultimately we have dealt with a very large number of people.  Having a postcode is a topic which excites a great deal of interest and there are very diverse opinions when it comes to postcodes.  Different people hold different views and they are held passionately, honestly and openly.  There is no issue in that regard, but, ultimately, when one is making a final design available, one must look for something that is in the public interest that meets most requirements, most of the time, and where it does not, it should be possible to deal with the issue by way of very minor and cost-effective adaptations.<\/p><p>  In terms of the most extensive of consultation processes which happened prior to procurement, we consulted no less than eight groups of bodies, for example, financial, retail and other bodies.  On the logistical side, we had reasonably frequent contact with the various companies involved, including significant players in the FTAI.  We also dealt with significant delivery operators which were not part of the FTAI, some of whom had made their opinions known to the committee.  In fairness, regardless of what one could say about where the project stands, it is not due to a lack of consultation.  <\/p><p>  Mr. Duggan will speak about the issue of costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111900006#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Molloy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416391200,"counter":1148,"content":"<p>In terms of cost, it is for every business to decide whether it sees a benefit in the system because not all businesses will benefit in the same way.  I take issue with the position of the FTAI.  I also take some responsibility.  We have an engagement in which we are meeting various stakeholders, of which Mr. Allen is in charge.  We have met people, but perhaps some of the communication was not at the level it should have been.  In the case of the FTAI which predominantly represents British-based carriers, its expectation was that the code would be similar to the system in place in the United Kngdom, where it is a cluster based system that does not identify individual addresses but clusters of, typically, 12 to 25 addresses.  Because of the uniqueness of the situation in Ireland with rural addresses, that system simply would not work.  The expectation of the FTAI is one thing, but what we are delivering is something else.  In addition, what it describes in terms of sequencing solves a problem that we do not have - finding addresses in urban areas - but does not solve a problem that we do have, namely, finding addresses in rural areas.  What we have done since representatives the FTAI appeared before the committee two weeks ago is engage with each individual member of the FTAI, the larger members, to explain the issues we have encountered, what we are trying to achieve and how the system will work.  The process is ongoing.  I think it is fair to say the engagement has been very positive and that there is now a better understanding of what we are doing, as opposed to what was the case.<\/p><p>  Costs are down to individual businesses in the sense of whether they find a benefit in using the system.<\/p> <p>If it is a small business with 100 customers, it is probably best to wait until a customer makes contact again and then collect the Eircode from it as opposed to buying the database because at that level it is probably not of significant benefit.  As the owners of a small business in a rural area know where their customers are, they do not have the same challenges as a bigger business.  A large business that may want to undertake a geospatial analysis, for instance, has a very different set of requirements, but if a small business wants to access the information, there will be a number of products of offer.  It is not just a single database with includes all of the information.  One product will be a simple database containing the addresses and the Eircodes.  Another will include the addresses, the Eircodes and the GPS co-ordinates.  Not all businesses require them but some do.<\/p><p> We have also built an alias file because people represent their address differently.  That is a topic about which we could talk for a long time, but I will not do so.  However, aliases are key in addressing the question of matching.  <\/p><p> We will have a number of products.  We have not yet finalised the pricing with the Department, but they will be priced either on a per user basis in terms of the number of people on a computer screen within an organisation who access the data or on a per transaction basis, namely, the number of records they look up.  If a small business is using the system, it will probably do so on a per transaction basis.  We are talking about cent per transaction, not euro - probably less than 10 cent per transaction.  If a small business has a requirement to look up 100 addresses in a month, typically it will pay about &euro;10.  That is the level we are talking about.  If a very big business wants access to all 2.2 million addresses and the other information available such as district electoral division, DED, areas or small areas, it will pay significantly more, but it will gain the benefit of it.  It will be up to each business to engage in its own cost benefit analysis and if it believes there is value to be had, it will buy it, as happens in the case of any other service, including software for which people buy software licences and so on.  It is down to the individual business to engage in its own cost benefit analysis, but for a small business, we are talking small, not large, amounts of money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111900006#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416391800,"counter":1150,"content":"<p>I do not know who is taking the question on the emergency services and the current problems with postal addresses in counties.

Issues were raised about the project by the Data Protection Commissioner in his last annual report.  Clearly, it is the job of the commissioner to raise these issues.  We have had a great deal of engagement with the Commissioner and understand the concerns of the office.  We have explained in great detail what we are doing.<\/p><p>  I have mentioned the contract with Capita which includes a great deal of material on what it must abide by in terms of data protection, the way it stores information, the Minister's right to inspect its data protection facilities and, very importantly, the accreditation process for the people who will be selling on the Eircode database.  There will be very strict requirements on which Capita will insist.  We have insisted on this as part of the contract.  <\/p><p>  On foot of our engagement with the Data Protection Commissioner, we have also undertaken a privacy impact assessment which is a specialised document whereby one looks at a project such as the Eircode system and reviews it from beginning to end to determine if there is a potential impact on anyone's privacy.  As part of this, we have spoken to many stakeholders.  We have spoken to the National Consumer Agency, logistics companies and Digital Rights Ireland, with which we have had an in-depth conversation to see if there is anything in the proposal that might be considered to have an impact on anyone's privacy.  Broadly, they are satisfied with what we are doing.<\/p><p>  Clearly, on foot of the commissioner's recommendations, we will include additional requirements for Capita such as a privacy statement on its website in order that members of the public will have a good sense that privacy is taken very seriously as part of the project.  In addition, when everybody receives his or her letter next year, there will be a link in the draft notice with the fact that there will be a privacy statement on the Capita website.  I am sure Capita's call centre staff will be trained to address any privacy issue any member of the public might have.

In the area in which I work there are approximately 600 delivery addresses.  In one rural town there are five people with the exact same name and surname at different addresses.  Equally, we had a situation where the delivery address was Castletownbere, Bantry.  That was the correct postal address, but it was 35 miles from the Bantry area.  Visitors come to Bantry, get off a bus and look for Castletownbere.  The local community decided arbitrarily to strike Bantry from the address, which helped the tourism sector.  They decided they would simply use Castletownbere, County Cork.  It worked fine for that purpose, but it made deliveries a bit of an issue.  There is a constant issue with non-unique addresses.  I accept the point being made in that regard.  However, I have a couple of questions.<\/p><p>  At what stage in the conception or procurement stage of the process was it decided that it would be a unique address, a unique identifier postcode?  Was it at the very beginning of the process?  How are the X-Y co-ordinates embedded in the seven digit postcode and how can it be used for an ordinary punter who might want to use them to find a location?  Are there data protection issues in that regard?  Was any consideration given in the roll-out of the Eircode system to having a pilot project or area to determine what practical issues might be encountered in using the system?  Was the tender designed to accommodate users with higher volume delivery items?  As Mr. O'Sulllivan said, was it for operators with 2 million plus items per day as opposed to 10,000 large items per day?<\/p><p>  Is there scope within the Eircode system to use non-delivery addresses in the future?  Some of the issues in rural Ireland include where one has a delivery address to the home but adjacent to it may be a small engineering office or garage.  Is there scope to use a second code to identify the commercial element where there is a mixed-use address?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111900008#H00800","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416393000,"counter":1170,"content":"<p>I will respond first before Mr. Duggan replies.  The initial project is fundamentally about addresses.  However, once the initial system has been embedded and the issue of addresses has been taken care of, there will be scope to consider an expansion.  Speaking as a cautious civil servant, it is better to approach these matters by taking a number of steps rather than a great leap, particularly as so much of the project will be different not only at national level, but also internationally.<\/p><p>  The Deputy made a good point when he asked whether the tender was based on large users only.  If the tender had been focused on large users and urban areas only and had not been equally focused on users in rural and regional areas, we would not have taken the approach we did.  We have a scenario where we are basically dealing with external commercial operators and there is a high level of awareness and interest.  The Nightline Group is a simple example.  It is a very big company but we are also aware of other companies.  The system will work for large and small businesses and the real benefit is in rural and regional areas, which is not to say the cities are different.  I did a quick check before the meeting which showed that the problem with addressing is not confined to rural areas.  In my case, I checked and found that while I have a unique address, there are four different versions in common use scattered around various Government databases.  There is a fundamental problem.  I do not know how An Post manages to achieve 95% next day deliveries but this is an enormous achievement.  If so many versions are attached to unique properties, the non-unique properties must be an even greater problem. <\/p><p>  I will ask Mr. Duggan to address the issue of piloting, on which I will say only that we have embarked on a staged process and we test at every step we take.  It is not the case that we will explode onto the scene with something that has not been reasonably well tested in the background.  My colleagues will provide further detail on that point. <\/p><p>  Mr. Duggan will also respond to the question on X and Y co-ordinates.  A good question was asked on procurement and when we made a decision to take the unique option.  As the person responsible for procurement, I can state that we had not made a decision to go unique when we started the procurement process.  We are often accused of opting to go unique because it suited corporate interests or whatever.  We had not made that decision in 2010.  Administratively, there will always be a reluctance to do things in a radically different manner.  What happened was that we engaged in an extensive process of consultation.  I can state categorically that, as a public servant, I did not meet a single person during the engagement process who believed it was worthwhile doing the post code nationally without dealing with the unique issue.  It was not the case that we chose to make a decision.  We were forced to make it because we did not meet anyone who had a different opinion.  This was a remarkable turnaround, which highlights the benefit of the type of procurement process in which we engaged, that is, a competitive dialogue.  Ultimately, we were engaging with people to ascertain what solution would work.  The solution is based on Irish requirements and the specific contingencies of the Irish market.  It is not based on problems that do not exist here but real problems faced by Mr. Duggan on the ground every day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111900009#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Molloy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416393000,"counter":1171,"content":"<p>The X and Y co-ordinates are stored in the database, not the code.  They are 16 characters long and do not lend themselves to being memorised as one cannot expect people to remember a 16 digit string.  A phenomenon known as chunking, which is used primarily in the telecoms industry, is where people remember groups of numbers in twos, threes and fours.  What we are doing is using a seven character code consisting of two chunks of three digits and four digits, respectively.  This has been done for memorability reasons.<\/p><p>  As to the reason the X and Y co-ordinates are in the database as opposed to the code, if they were in the code one would leave oneself open to obsolescence and a lack of future-proofing.  By storing the co-ordinates in the database, one has them in the background.  We have a licence to operate for ten years.  Ten years ago, there were no tablets and smartphones were in their infancy.  We cannot predict at this stage what technology will be available in ten years.  By storing the information in the database, we can easily change what is in the background.  If X and Y changes and, for instance, three dimensional co-ordinates or some other form of co-ordinates are implemented, we can embed them in the database without having to change the code upfront, whereas if they were in the code and some new methodology was introduced, we would have to re-issue the codes.

I like to figure things out in my mind and keep them simple.  If I can understand them, I can then explain to people the reasons a measure has been introduced, what is its purpose and what will be its benefits to society in general.  Reading the documentation and listening to the presentation, I am still some distance from reaching that stage in regard to Eircodes.  I will explain the reasons.<\/p> <p>Someone mentioned vanity addresses.  There are also vanity projects and I fear that there is a little vanity about this project.  Latitude and longitude do not change, nor do X Y co-ordinates.  The X Y co-ordinates will be used to identify houses or premises built next door to another house or premises; therefore, we are discussing the process of translating X Y co-ordinates into something that can be used to enable a letter to be dropped.  That should be straightforward, but we seem to have come up with an expensive and extensive system to do this.<\/p><p> I have looked at all of the documentation on the reasons the system was put in place in the first place and all sorts of claims are made about the financial benefits that will ensue for various sectors, including the public service, but there is no explanation of how these financial benefits will accrue.  It seems rational that automating the delivery of pieces of paper to addresses will make life easier for those engaged in business or the public service, but do we need to spend this much on the system in order to achieve that outcome?  It is unclear to me precisely what business or public service problem we are trying to address with the Eircode system. <\/p><p> I have some questions about the process of the project.  Typically in a project such as this someone identifies problems to be solved and, through a process of discussion with others, begins to think through what system is needed to solve them.  Following that process of discussion, a high level functional specification is devised to find a system to solve the problems identified.  That system is improved and the concept is generally proved at that point before one moves to the technical specification.  One then prepares a request for proposals and tenders, to build or buy the system or modify the one already in place, test and implement it.  It all hangs from the very first point on what problem we are trying to solve.  Typically people are engaged in an advisory capacity with the Department because some specialist knowledge is required during these steps.  Are there individuals who or companies which were engaged to advise the Department through the various stages of the process and are now involved in the ongoing project management?  Last December it was announced that a monitoring body would be set up.  I think BA Consulting had the contract.  Was the contract ever awarded?<\/p><p> Indemnity insurance for &euro;22.5 million formed part of the request for proposals.  That seems extraordinary when we consider the costs of the project as outlined by the delegates.  <\/p><p> Mr. O'Sullivan said An Post will fully use the Eircode system.  In its current form, if 100,000 documents, letters and parcels entered the sorting office in Athlone or wherever else, would the Eircode format, as constituted, support scanning and automatic sorting, or would there have to be a translation process?  Could the Eircode format, as structured, facilitate scanning and mechanical sorting of these documents, letters and parcels?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111900009#J00800","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416393600,"counter":1178,"content":"<p>As the person involved in procurement, the basic objective was to give Ireland a postcodes system.

In this blocking of some companies from tendering, Eircode, either intentionally or otherwise, blocked an existing system developed in Cork from being eligible for consideration.

He has referred to the Dublin postal districts.  One of the principal tenets set by the Department in selecting a code is that people should not have to change their current address.  This is related to the Chairman's point about sense of and attachment to place.  The Dublin postal districts are viewed by residents living in these areas as part of their current addresses.  To attempt to change or remove Dublin 4 would be the equivalent of taking away the name of a town for people who live in provincial Ireland.  It does no violence to people's current addresses and is carried into the code as designed.<\/p><p>  On the investment by An Post, I noted in my opening statement that we had completely replaced our automated sorting equipment over several years up to 2012.  Now that we have changed that equipment, we are able to introduce new systems - the technology changes very quickly - which are capable of dealing with postcodes.  We have a small software capital investment of approximately &euro;1 million, but we see it being repaid very quickly, given the benefits we will get from our use of the Eircode system.  It is up to each company to use the code to its benefit.  We see benefits in how we apply it.  As an example, we are entering into the busiest time of the year for An Post, with our volumes doubling or even trebling.  This is most welcome in terms of revenue, but it is also a huge logistical challenge.  During the month of December we hire approximately 1,000 casual staff for our large sorting centres.  Even though they are untrained and will not be carrying a natural geography of the entire country with them, we require them to sort the country's letters for delivery.  When we have the Eircode system which will be in place by next Christmas, we will be asking the staff we hire in to sort letters by hand simply by matching a portion of the code.  That will make our Christmas operations far more efficient than they are.  We have made a capital investment, but we see significant benefit for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111900012#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1416394800,"counter":1215,"content":"<p>How much is it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111900012#M00600","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416394800,"counter":1216,"content":"<p>It is &euro;4 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111900012#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416394800,"counter":1217,"content":"<p>Dublin postal district information is in common usage.

Nobody could say, for example, that Dublin 4A is better than Dublin 4Z.  We are avoiding the postcode discrimination or ghettos to which Mr. Molloy referred.  That is an important point.<\/p><p>  I addressed the pilot scheme issue.  Quality assurance testing is carried out at every stage, but a meaningful pilot scheme requires us to test what happens in real life.  If we had merely picked a county or an area to assign codes and the service providers in these areas did not know the codes, the pilot scheme would have been of little or no benefit.  We are absolutely sure every element of the project has been tested and subjected to quality assurance.<\/p><p>  On the cost for hauliers, many small hauliers around the country use Sat Nav or GPS to find locations.  The difficulty with current Sat Nav technology arises from non-unique addresses.  The haulier may receive a GPS location for Gormanlough that does not identify the exact house.  We are discussing this issue with the various Sat Nav and digital mapping companies which will incorporate the Eircode system into their systems, perhaps not on its launch but certainly in time.  All a haulier will need to do is put the Eircode information into the satnav device to obtain the exact location of the delivery address.  It will not just bring him or her to Gormanlough, it will identify the exact house.

We also have found it difficult to buy online from the United States to Ireland in particular without a zip code.<\/p><p>  While some of my questions have been addressed by Senator O'Donovan, it was stated that this is the first system of its kind in the world and obviously, there will be a great number of teething problems as it progresses.  However, if this proves to be an enormous success and if other countries around the world wish to have a similar system, who has the ownership of this system and the associated royalties?  Is it the Department or is it Capita?  From where does the formula for the unique identifier come and how is it determined?  An example was given of two addresses that might be 150 m apart between which a third home may be built.  How will the new unique identifier for that house be identified?<\/p><p>  To revert to the question of Sat Nav, if we are trying to be more efficient, why would small businesses be obliged to pay for the new unique identifier?  The approaching Christmas season was mentioned and in a scenario in which I send out my Christmas cards this year and the address for one happens to be 4 Kildare Street, Dublin 2, it will go to the sorting office.  Does An Post then take that envelope and apply the unique code to it, after which it arrives at 4 Kildare Street, Dublin 2?  Likewise, if I intend to send out 100 Christmas cards, does that mean the onus is on me to identify the new zip code or Eircode for those to whom I may be sending them?  Another area on which a point was made concerned Google Maps.  If I, for example, intend to travel somewhere in the United States and enter the area code 10580, it will take me to Rye, New York.  Under this system, if one puts in the Eircode, it could bring one exactly to the house.  Will Sat Nav companies such as Google Maps and others be buying this system from the witnesses in the future?

I am unsure whether the witnesses are aware of the cultural implications whereby these unique identifiers actually could kill the Irish nickname forevermore.  Anyway, I hope that does not happen because those nicknames say a lot about us.  I have a couple of questions.  My impression is this really is a fallback position and is a verification.  While we will rely primarily on the address, where there is ambiguity this is to prove beyond doubt that the item in question is intended for John Foley in a certain house that has this code.   What will happen if someone has the correct address on the letter but the code is wrong?  Will the letter be delivered to that person in any event?  If the code is different, will it be taken that the reasonable likelihood is that the address is correct?  Will there be a way of working this out?<\/p><p>  Can someone simply put down the code alone on a letter, put it into the post and expect it to get the intended recipient or must someone have a reasonable amount of information on both sides?  Further to this point, what are the implications in respect of unsolicited or junk mail?  At present, for example, An Post has direct mail services in which one can take a geographical area and send out flyers, leaflets and whatever else.  What will the implications of this system be for such businesses and for those who previously were not affected?  At present, the direct mail service will attempt to verify that something being sent out is legitimate and is not fraudulent or associated with any kind of dodgy business or whatever.  Will this system have safeguards and how localised will be the availability of the database?  Will it be at a national level or, for example, if I had a business from which I sought to distribute everything within the mid-Kerry area, could I seek all the relevant codes and, if so, what information would I get?  To be specific, would I get the names and addresses or just the codes?  I ask the witnesses to clarify this point.  As for people who are deceased or have gone away, if the name and the code for the particular property are on the envelope, will the letter simply go through the letter box?  At present, it will come back to the sender with a message to the effect the recipient is deceased or gone away.  What will happen in those circumstances?  Will it be delivered and will An Post's responsibility for that item of mail be finished at that point?  The point has been made that this system is voluntary and is not compulsory at present.  Is there a future cut-off date beyond which it will be compulsory?  For example, will it be announced that from 1 January 2022, it will be necessary to use the code as otherwise, the item will not be accepted or will not be delivered?

They are well known throughout the country for knowing where everyone is located and they are brilliant at handling the five Brendan Griffins and so on.  In common with many people, my wife orders online and they know where the house is located because they use Sat Nav.  Consequently, I do not know with what problem this investment is supposed to be dealing.  I have serious concerns about the escalation of costs.  When I raised this issue in the Seanad on 4 July 2013, I noted &euro;15 million was the figure reported by The Irish Times.  The then Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, stated one should not believe the numbers one reads in the newspapers, the clear implication being that I was exaggerating the &euro;15 million.  It then became &euro;24 million on 20 April and is &euro;27 million today.  Moreover, one figure provided to members concerns that the consultants' fee at &euro;6 million or 3% of the cost.  That would make it a &euro;50 million project and people appeared before this joint committee at the last meeting suggesting it was an &euro;80 million project.<\/p><p>  Were this project to come before the Seanad, I could not vote for it on the basis of what I have heard.  I do not know what the benefits are supposed to be compared with the Sat Nav used by the independents and the excellent network the post office already has.  In fact, it might undermine the post office, if its advantage in knowledge through its local people becomes available through this system.  I made the point at the last meeting that given the nature of the Trinity College constituency, I have constituents in both counties Monaghan and Fermanagh.  All my letters to Clones get through but it is an added nuisance in Newtownbutler to include the seven-digit code.  Do we not have technology that can recognise where Mayo is?  Must it have seven digits after it?  After what I have heard this morning, I now am more sceptical than ever.  Certainly, were any estimate to come before the Seanad on this, I could not support it without a cost-benefit analysis, as well as much more convincing evidence that this is a project with which it is worth proceeding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111900013#N00700","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1416395400,"counter":1226,"content":"<p>We will take the questions in the order they were asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111900013#N00800","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416396000,"counter":1227,"content":"<p>The question was whether it was up to individuals to find out the Eircode location code of the people to whom they were writing.

When the parcel, package or letter comes in, if we are sorting it by machine, it tries to read the characters using optical character reading technology and breaks down and segments the letters used.  The Senator gave the example of Kildare Street.  It recognises the \"K\", \"I\" and \"L\".  If the code was on it, it would attempt to recognise it.  If it recognised it, it would not apply anything to the mail piece; it would simply recognise where to sort it to.  If the code was not present, it would the same with the textual address - it would recognises where to sort it to.<\/p><p>  For the people we employ who sort manually, the same process applies.  If the code is present, which is easier for us, they will recognise it very simply and know where to put it, but they will not put anything on the mail.  If there is no code, they have to read several lines of textual address which in some cases is not well written to figure out its destination.  However, we will not be attaching the code to the mail.  Our view - it is sensible and how it works worldwide - is that the sender applies the postcode.  We are not the only postal operator, but I do not imagine any of our competitors will start adding the codes either.<\/p><p>  Deputy Brendan Griffin asked about cases where the address was correct but the code was incorrect.  The technology in our sorting centres is very sophisticated.  When it is reading a mail piece with a textual address and a code, it checks whether they match.  That is how we intend to use the code.  Therefore, it is extra verification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111900014#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1416396000,"counter":1230,"content":"<p>If it does not, does it go back for manual sorting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111900014#O00400","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416396000,"counter":1231,"content":"<p>If our system cannot be absolutely certain it can make the decision, it sends an image of the letter to the person operating a video screen.

It does not contain names; it only contains address information.  Therefore, nothing on the database can indicate whether someone is alive or dead.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about optical character recognition and potential confusion with letters and numbers.  We have stripped out areas of potential confusion.  Where there is a \"zero\" and the letter \"O\" and even a \"Q\", which can be confused, we have gone with the \"zero\".  Where the lower case \"i\" and the capital letter \"I\" can look like the number \"1\", we have left in the number \"1\" and taken out the lower case \"i\" and the capital \"I\".  In verbal recognition as the letters \"M\" and \"N\" can sound alike, we have taken out the letter \"M\".  Therefore, if someone is verbally giving a code and says \"O\", we will know that it is a \"zero\".  There are 25 characters in the set, including the ten numbers from zero to nine.  When the various letters are taken out, we are left with 25 characters.<\/p><p>  We have gone through an exercise to take out rude or offensive and real names.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan spoke about the backlash when we launched.  With 25 characters in the second block - the unique identifier - the potential number of combinations, when 25 is multiplied by 25 by 25 and by 25, comes to 390,625.  Members can believe me when I say that.  We have taken out more than 90,000 potentially offensive and rude words, real names and so on.  As an exercise, we bought online Scrabble.  We looked at all four and three letter words and so on.  We had our people based in Maynooth visually go through what was left and some unexpected things showed up when one was looking for words.  If there is a \"V\" beside another, it looks like a \"W\" and thus can create something else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111900014#O00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Duggan"},{"type":"speech","time":1416396000,"counter":1235,"content":"<p>What about something like \"IRA\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014111900014#O00900","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1416396000,"counter":1236,"content":"<p>That would not be included.
