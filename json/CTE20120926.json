This is our first opportunity to meet formally.<\/p><p>  The upcoming meeting of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, EPSCO, will be in Luxembourg on 4 October.  I wish to brief the committee on my priorities during the forthcoming EU Presidency.  As the members are probably aware, the EPSCO Council covers a wide range of issues, spanning the responsibilities of a number of Ministries, including those responsible for social protection; jobs enterprise and innovation; justice, equality and defence; health; and, more recently, children and youth affairs.<\/p><p>  I will concentrate on the issues in respect of which my Department will have lead responsibility.  Some of the matters are technical and I will present them in the order of the agenda.  No. 4 concerns association agreements.  As the first social protection item, it is a relatively technical one.  No. 4 is an agreement on the Council position to be adopted in regard to the social security aspects of association agreements the European Union has with Albania, Montenegro, San Marino and Turkey.  These agreements cover a wide range of matters dealing with the relationship between the countries in question and the European Union.  Generally, they include a clause on social security co-ordination.  The purpose of these Council decisions is to set out the manner in which the European Union sees the social security clauses being implemented and they are subject to agreement with the individual countries.  Ireland has no issue with these decisions as they mainly involve equality for nationals of the countries involved in their dealings with social welfare and the export of contributory pensions.  These requirements are already covered under our domestic legislation.<\/p><p>  However, an issue arises with the Turkey agreement in respect of the legal base for the decision.  The base being used is Article 48 of the treaty, which deals with free movement and which Ireland and the United Kingdom contend relates to EU citizens.  As this agreement relates to a third country, the base should be Article 79, which deals with rights of third country nationals.  The effect of using Article 48 is that it deprives us and the United Kingdom of the right to opt in or out of the decision under Protocol 21 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union.<\/p><p>  A similar issue has arisen in regard to agreements with Switzerland and the EEA countries, and the United Kingdom has already taken cases to the European Court of Justice to have the matter clarified in regard to the agreements.  Ireland is, on the advice of the Attorney General, supporting the United Kingdom's submissions.  The concern is that the use of Article 15 may set a precedent that would have implications for our national interest in areas other than social securities.  In these circumstances, Ireland will record its disagreement with the decision on Turkey by way of the joint minute statement with the United Kingdom.  It is understood that this decision may not be accepted pending the outcome of the Swiss and EEA cases.<\/p><p>  Agenda item No. 6, Europe 2020 and the New EU Governance, concerns the evaluation of the second European semester and thematic surveillance in employment and social policies, and endorsement of the contributions of the social protection committee.  This item relates to an opinion of the social protection committee on the European semester process.  It is one of a number of committees that has produced an opinion on the process.  The social protection committee offers opinions and produces reports for the Council in the areas of social protection, health care and pensions and is competent to do so under the treaty.<\/p><p>  The key political message in the opinion is that social policy issues are increasingly relevant in the semester and that EPSCO has a key role in ensuring that the positive contribution of social protection to inclusive growth is properly reflected in all relevant Council recommendations.  This reflects the view that the ECOFIN and banking issues have tended, for understandable reasons, to dominate the agenda.  The opinion was agreed by all member states and the Commission at a meeting of the social protection committee on 20 September 2012 and should be endorsed by the Council without difficulty.<\/p><p>  Paragraph (c), on the social protection performance monitor, refers to the endorsement of the SPC's introductory report.  Under this item, the Council has been asked to endorse a report submitted thereto on the social protection performance monitor.  The monitor is currently being developed by the social protection committee and the Commission services.  It is in response to the European Council conclusions of December last year which called for complementing reinforced economic governance with improved monitoring of employment and social policies.  The output of the monitor will form part of future social protection committee annual reports on the social dimension of Europe 2020 for the Council.  EPSCO has already endorsed the employment performance monitor through which it follows the employment policies.  The social protection performance monitor will enhance the Council's ability to gain a deeper understanding of developments occurring regarding social policies across the Union, to monitor them closely and regularly and to identify social trends common to a number of EU states.  The new tool covers the three strands of the social open method of co-ordination, social protection, pensions and health, as reconfirmed by the Council in June 2011.<\/p><p>  No. 7, Towards a Job-Rich Recovery and Giving a Better Chance to Europe's Youth, is important.  One of the challenges faced by the European Union and Ireland is tackling unemployment, with particular emphasis placed on the experience of young people, whose rate of unemployment across the Union is twice the average.  There has been much activity at both national and EU levels in attempting to face this challenge.  The Commission's employment package and the Council's Compact for Growth and Jobs, published earlier this year, request member states to engage in economic and social policies to boost employment rates, particularly for the long-term unemployed and young people.  The Youth on the Move flagship initiative is currently under way.  It focuses on supporting young people in the transition from education to work.  The Council's conclusions will be adopted on 4 October.  They are a response to the employment package and are a further development on work done thus far, including strengthening employment policy measures at both national and EU levels.<\/p><p>  The conclusions call on the member states and Commission to take action on a number of fronts designed to step up job creation and labour demand.  These conclusions will be followed up later in the year with a youth transitions package.  I will be prioritising work on this during our Presidency.  I will return to this later.<\/p><p>  Child poverty has been a concern at EU level for at least a decade.  In 2012, the social protection committee presented an advisory report to the European Commission on preventing and tackling child poverty and social exclusion and promoting children's well-being.  Drawing on the social protection committee's advisory report and main messages, draft Council conclusions have been prepared under the Cypriot Presidency.  The conclusions recognise that income-support measures will not, on their own, address child poverty, and that without broader consideration of children's well-being, child poverty can and will have some effect on all children's outcomes.  It is for this reason that access to services and children's participation are important.<\/p><p>  These conclusions invite the member states, European Commission and social protection committee, taking account of the specific circumstances in each member state, to take action along specified lines.<\/p> <p>They are to aim to ensure adequate and sustainable investment in child and family supports, mitigating negative impacts on the most vulnerable while maintaining an adequate balance between universal and targeted policies, to incorporate child poverty and social exclusion, as well as child well-being, as key issues in the European Union 2020 strategy and the integrated social open method of co-ordination and to make full use of existing tools to improve the monitoring of and reporting on child poverty, social exclusion and child well-being, as well as the evaluation of policies.  Member states are asked to consider, when designing and implementing policies, that investing in children is a long-term investment, that they make full use of financial opportunities provided through the EU including Structural Funds and that they promote the engagement of all key actors, including local authorities and NGOs.  I strongly endorse the holistic approach envisaged in the conclusions.  It is my view that, working closely with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, these Council conclusions, together with the new child poverty subtarget under the national social target - as the revised national poverty target is now known - provide a unique opportunity to tackle child poverty and in so doing to promote child well-being within the Europe 2020 strategy to the betterment of all children.  I understand these conclusions will be followed up by a European Union recommendation on child poverty, which will be included in an overall social package that will be published by the European Commission in March.  At this stage, it is not clear what will be contained in that package but if time allows after publication, it will be my intention, in consultation with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, to ascertain what progress can be made in this area during the Irish Presidency.<\/p><p> As for the priorities for the Presidency, although my role here primarily is to brief members on the Council, as Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU rapidly approaches, I will take this opportunity to apprise members of my key priorities for social affairs for the Presidency.  As I already stated, the EU agenda in the social protection area covers a wide range of issues, including activation and employment, pensions, social security and social inclusion.  Tackling unemployment and addressing the social consequences of the crisis effectively, pursuing reforms to improve employment levels, in particular of young people, as well as developing, implementing and mainstreaming effective policies to combat poverty and support vulnerable groups all are areas in which the EU is highly active in developing policy and actions.  Accordingly, it is appropriate that priorities for the Irish Presidency should reflect the emphasis the EU places on these important issues.  One of the highlights of the Presidency will be to bring Ministers of employment and social affairs to Dublin in February 2013 for an informal ministerial meeting.  The general theme for the meeting will be &ldquo;Supporting People into Employment&rdquo;, with a particular emphasis on youth unemployment.<\/p><p> The youth unemployment element will be particularly timely.  In December 2012, the European Commission will publish a youth transitions package, the main element of which will be a proposal for a so-called youth guarantee aiming to ensure targeted young people are either working or in appropriate training or work experience within a specified time after becoming unemployed.  The objective of the proposal is to intensify actions at EU and member state level aimed at addressing the high level of youth unemployment across Europe.  The European Commission is anxious to see significant progress in this area during the Irish Presidency and hopes that Council recommendations can be adopted.  The informal meeting will seek to advance the issues raised in the Commission proposal with a view to adopting Council conclusions on the Commission package at a formal Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs, EPSCO, Council during our Presidency.  The informal meeting will also include meetings with the social partners and with the social platform at a European level.  This informal meeting will be jointly run by my Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, with input from the Department of Education and Skills.  An  interdepartmental group of officials is currently working to put together a comprehensive set of policy papers to address the wide range of issues that come under the theme of getting people back to work.<\/p><p> As for other social protection measures during the Irish Presidency in addition to the youth guarantee, it is my intention to make progress on two key legislative measures, namely, the pensions portability directive and a regulation to amend the social security co-ordination regulations.  The portability directive proposes minimum requirements for enhancing worker mobility by improving the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pension rights.  It is important in the context of increasing worker mobility and in particular, mobility within self-employment.  At present, there is no common framework in the EU regulating the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pension rights.  The fact that pension rights may not be preserved in a supplementary pension when a person leaves employment is considered to be a serious obstacle to the free movement of workers within the EU.  Accordingly, it is acknowledged there is a need for Union action to improve and support the mobility of workers across the European Union.  It is expected that the Commission will introduce the proposal late in the Cypriot Presidency.  Co-ordination of social security systems is perceived by the EU as an important element in the measures that are in place to encourage and facilitate the free movement of workers and EU citizens in general.  Accordingly, it is important to ensure the regulations are updated on a regular basis.  These regulations require amendment to take account of changes to the social security systems of the individual member states and judgments of the European Court of Justice, as well as to deal with issues identified in the operation of the regulations.  Changes are made on an annual basis and it is expected that the Commission will publish the proposal for the latest round of amendments in December 2012.  There are a number of small amendments and technical changes which are unlikely to be opposed by any of the member states and, in the circumstances, I expect it will be possible to reach an agreed approach at Council and possibly a first reading agreement with the European Parliament.  I am looking forward to a successful EU Presidency, which I hope will make a significant contribution to advancing the EU agenda on a range of issues and in particular, as I stated, in addressing on an European Union-wide basis the issue of unemployment with particular emphasis on the problems experienced by young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600003#B00500","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348650600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and will open the floor to members.

I have a number of questions and thank the Minister for the briefing, which was useful even though the European Union does not have a huge amount of competence in respect of social policy.  In particular, I wish to concentrate on one point the Minister already has highlighted and which was reported in the media yesterday, namely, the proposed European Union youth guarantee.  While it sounds good, the detail is not available on what precisely it means or what sort of money will be spent.  The European Commission examined this proposal and indicated it would allocate a budget of &euro;4 million to it.  Given the huge number of unemployed young people across Europe - I believe the figure is a colossal 7.5 million and rising at present - that would be 50 cent per person.  Unless money is to come from somewhere else, this scheme will go nowhere.  The International Labour Organization suggested that for Ireland alone, such a scheme, which entailed a commitment to young people that they would be offered a job, training or educational opportunity within three months of being made redundant or failing to get a job, basically being unemployed, would cost Ireland approximately &euro;300 million or &euro;400 million to operate and to have the proper effect.  From where will this money come?<\/p> <p>Will it be in place next year during Ireland's EU Presidency term so that young people can look forward to some form of labour market activation?  In Ireland there are 80,000 young people unemployed, a figure that increases at the end of each school term.<\/p><p> One EU programme is called Youth on the Move.  Figures from the latest <i>Quarterly National Household Survey<\/i>demonstrate that 96,000 young people between the ages of 20 and 34 have literally disappeared from the workforce.  They have not shown up as unemployed or returned to study.  That suggests they are certainly on the move, getting out of here.  This fact highlights the urgency of a need for a commitment to proper funding to ensure jobs are created and proper training and educational opportunities are given so young people can access jobs.  Where will the moneys come from for these programmes?  Has the Minister had discussions with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation?  Has there been any discussion with the troika to allow the funding suggested by the International Labour Organisation to be spent on this programme until the unemployment level is properly addressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600004#C00700","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348651200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Anything to do with the EU seems to be attended with an unusual amount of jargon.  I listened carefully to the Minister's presentation but I do not know how much wiser I am except that I now know the EU social protection Ministers will be visiting Ireland in February.  Regarding the pension portability issue, the Minister will be aware that there is no common framework to make pensions portable in the EU.  Herculean efforts have been made to put a directive together, so far without success.  The last directive up for negotiation would have given a fair amount of flexibility to individual member states which seems a bit of a contradiction.  The Minister stated she is hoping to make progress on this during Ireland's EU Presidency.  How realistic is that?  I do not believe there is a hope in hell that we will have this directive anytime soon, let alone during Ireland's Presidency.<\/p><p>  Last Monday I read about the European youth guarantee in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> so I did not have to come here today to hear about it.  Officially, 30% of the population under the age of 25 cannot get a job.  That grossly understates the case.  A parliamentary question I put down to the Taoiseach yesterday revealed that in the past 12 months alone, 76,000 people have left this country.  That is over 200 a day, of whom I suspect most are young.  The Minister claims any of these young people who cannot get a job will be guaranteed an education or a training place.  What percentage will be accommodated by the training and education schemes available?  What extra numbers will be involved?  I suspect it will be quite substantial.  How much is this going to cost?  Has provision been made for it?  I read a suggestion in Monday's<i> Irish Times<\/i>, which surprised me, that we expect the EU will pay for these programmes.  Judging by the sort of figures floating around, that is most unlikely.  According to the brief from the Department of Social Protection, over &euro;500 million must be made in savings in the social welfare budget this year.  How realistic is this proposal?  How much is it going to cost and who will pay for it?  How many people will benefit from it?<\/p><p>  The Minister stated similar schemes have worked well in Austria and Germany where youth unemployment is low.  I would respectfully suggest that youth unemployment is much lower in these countries for reasons other than the offer of a guarantee scheme like this.  I recall a similar scheme in operation in the United Kingdom which has not been particularly successful.  If this scheme becomes a reality here, how will it coincide with the Pathways to Work scheme?  The pathways scheme involves the referral of jobseeker's allowance recipients to a case officer to incentivise them for getting back into the workplace.  Will there be a separate stream for recipients under 25 who will fall under the guarantee programme?<\/p><p>  I want more clarity on this as last Monday's announcement has created a good deal of hope and expectation, particularly among young people who are growing increasingly desperate.  I want to ensure on their behalf that there is some substance to this guarantee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600005#D00200","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1348651200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Does the Minister envisage that the package proposed by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, EPSCO, will include budget checks for child poverty?  While there has been much talk about child poverty, unless vulnerable children are protected against budget cuts, it is meaningless.<\/p><p>  All the points have been made about the number of young people unemployed and long-term unemployment.  The long-term unemployment rate is increasing to a dangerously high level.  These proposed initiatives will not deal with the issue at all.  There needs to be significant investment in job creation across Europe, particularly in Ireland.  Private investment is on strike, as the Minister knows, even though the money is there.  The Government is not able to or willing to put in the real investment needed for creating jobs.  How much money from Europe does the Minister envisage will be needed to implement these proposed initiatives?<\/p><p>  There is also a concern about the types of jobs that will be created by these schemes.  Only several weeks ago, the M. J. Gleeson Group in Cherry Orchard, under the auspices of redundancy, let 12 permanent workers go.  They had all just joined a trade union and were replaced very quickly with agency workers.  We have to ensure these schemes go along with the protection of trade union rights, the right to join a union and the right not to be made redundant for doing so.  Are we moving towards more agency work rather than permanent work under these schemes?  There are other areas that have to be looked at.  What are the Minister's ideas on the amount of money needed to get people off the dole?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600005#D00300","speaker":"1032"},{"type":"speech","time":1348651800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>My question is related to the same matter rather than the Minister having to go back to it again.<\/p><p>  I welcome in principle the concept of the youth guarantee scheme.

Obviously, the important detail must be worked out.<\/p><p>  I have a number of questions on this for the Minister.  Does she know how many of those under 25 are unemployed graduates, in other words, with a higher education degree?  Those with higher education degrees need not be turned around and put back into education because they might be only coming out of it, aged 23.  They would need job specific training or internships.  I propose that the Minister extend this scheme to those between the ages of 25 and 30.  I realise that would add further to the budgetary issues about which Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh spoke, but we now know there is a future in digital technology.  An EU Commissioner has stated that by 2015 there will be 700,000 IT engineers lacking across the EU.  We need to examine the skills set of graduates up to the age of 30 and ask what type of training and conversions the Department could offer to give them the correct skills set to match the genuine needs.  We are kidding ourselves if we say governments can create jobs.  Governments do not create jobs.  Governments create schemes or training programmes that will equip young people for the jobs being created by industry or by business.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's answer to my question about the graduates, the needs, and whether she would be looking at those between the ages of 25 and 30.

In future, the census form should be used to collate such data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600006#E00800","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1348651800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I will start with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's questions.  The youth guarantee has been under discussion for a number of years at EU level.  The important political aspect of this is that the European Union, for understandable reasons, has been focused on the banking crisis and the economic crisis, but, as the committee will be aware, there is an enormous human dimension to that crisis, particularly in the context of those who are without work, those who have lost their businesses and young people who, as has been referred to by a number of committee members, cannot get on the ladder of work having been trained and educated.  If we get the youth guarantee, it will provide a framework for having pathways for young people which will avoid as far as possible a young person going onto the live register when he or she completes education or training.  We should be able to provide them with work opportunities.  At present, getting a job is difficult.  If one cannot get a job, training, education and work experience such as internships are critical to not letting somebody go onto the live register where six months becomes a year or two.  As members will be aware, one can go to estates where the numbers of workers - fathers, sons, daughters and grandparents - is much lower than it might be on another estate in another part of the same city.  This is our crisis.  It is a crisis for the individual and for the community, particularly in areas that are badly affected.  If we get the agreement of the Commission at the end of the Cypriot Presidency in December, we will have an opportunity to bring that Commission paper to the informal meeting in Dublin and then to EPSCO.  At that point, it would become a question of resources as the EU reviews its budget, which it is in the process of doing, ensuring that funds such as the European Social Fund are utilised in this specific area and that the European Union uses parts of its budget to stimulate employment, which, in turn, will help economic recovery in the different countries.  In a way, in the 1970s and 1980s, as older people will recall, that was the widespread experience right around Ireland of how the European Union operated in terms of supporting nationwide initiatives, particularly for those being educated, for instance, in the institutes of technology, and in deprived areas.<\/p><p>  On Youth on the Move, EURES acts to assist the mobility of workers.  Since I have been Minister, I have attended approximately four job fairs held in different parts of Ireland to encourage mobility.  It is a question that is frequently asked, for instance, by German and Luxembourg Ministers, in whose countries there is a shortage of young people and who are quite interested, for example, in Irish apprentices going to work in Germany.  It is meant to facilitate that.<\/p><p>  On the discussion with other Ministers, since I have become Minister for Social Protection, I have gone to a number of European meetings and have made it my job, on every occasion that I have been there and at every opportunity, to inform people about the level of unemployment in Ireland and of my view that the unemployment issues in Europe are a key priority for EPSCO to address.<\/p><p>  I was asked for the figures on young people.  According to the recent census, the number of young adults in the population has fallen by approximately 100,000 in the past three years, as Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh stated.  That has been largely due to what statisticians call cohort effects, that is, that there were a smaller number of births in the 1990s.  It also reflects migration flows.  Some of these are our young people leaving to go abroad, as we all are familiar with.  In other cases, young people from different countries who came here to work have returned to their own countries.  There is a significant worrying number of our young people leaving to go abroad.  I went abroad to work when I was younger.  Provided one has an opportunity to come back, working abroad can be a valuable experience.  I hope it is in the context, to return to the earlier point, of work to get experience and that the person has a choice and an opportunity to come back to his or her own country.<\/p><p>  The big strength of Ireland is that we have a large number of young people.  We have been sending small pilot schemes, for instance, of apprentices to finish or enhance their training, to German cities and with particular German firms, and that has gone quite well.<\/p> <p> Senators Healy Eames and Moloney raised related issues pertaining to JobBridge, internships and training.  Deputy O'Dea also asked how we can identify younger people in the Pathways to Work process.  The core of the Pathways to Work process, which we are rolling out in a number of offices and will implement throughout the country later this year, is that when someone applies for a payment or benefit, he or she supplies data that will now be used to profile his or her record of employment, education and skill levels and previous earning capacity.  The Department has worked with the ESRI to develop a prediction of exit from the live register tool based on these data.  In many cases, highly educated graduates will spend only a short period on the register because they may simply need to look for another job.  Every year, more than 140,000 people leave the live register to take up employment because there is a large turnover of people on the register.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600006#E00900","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348652400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Are precise data available on how long graduates stay on the live register?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600007#F00200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1348652400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>We are just starting on the Pathways to Work process and, as Deputy O'Dea noted, it is a question of identifying these people and their skills levels.  These data were not gathered in the past but they form part of the new Pathways to Work profiling project.  It will take a number of years to build up the profile as new people come into the system.<\/p><p>  In regard to Senator Moloney's related question, just under 5,000 people are on JobBridge placements currently, and more than 4,000 have completed placements.  Indecon is conducting a review of JobBridge.  When the initiative was first introduced, I gave a commitment to this committee and the D&aacute;il that we would seek to put in place online monitoring in order that we could learn as we go.  We began the examination of JobBridge earlier in the summer and I expect the report on that will be with me.  At present, we can identify the areas in which participants in JobBridge are working.  Approximately 25% of those who go on placements are graduates.  These are highly skilled people, some with postgraduate or even doctoral degrees, who cannot find jobs because they do not have experience and cannot get experience without finding employment.  They are in a catch-22 and the purpose of JobBridge, with a six or nine month timeline, is to give them that experience and opportunity.<\/p><p>  In terms of what people are doing, I can only give members a flavour of our initial data.  I will revert to the committee when we have the detailed data.  A fair number of people on JobBridge are going to small and medium-sized employers and in many cases they are finding further employment either directly through that employer or by building up a network.  A number of people are also going into public bodies and community and voluntary organisations.  Clearly the capacity of those organisations to offer jobs subsequent to placements is more limited.  For example, more than 80 people are working on games development with the GAA.  We have done considerable work with the GAA on establishing a sports development programme.  People can develop contacts and networks by working with clubs.<\/p><p>  In respect of the questions raised by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and Senator Healy Eames, I am interested in developing a profile of traineeships over a longer period.  Ironically, there is great demand in the IT sector in this country at the highest level but that demand is repeated throughout Europe.  I am pleased to say the Government is investing heavily in programmes like Springboard and Skillnets and on conversion courses for professionals such as construction engineers, architects and CAD designers who found themselves without work as a result of the collapse of the construction industry.  My Department is spending just under &euro;1 billion on job related supports in addition to the other social welfare payments we make.  Other jobseekers have left school early or at leaving certificate level and need traineeships which provide training and work experience that assist them in finding employment.  Deputy O'Dea referred to Germany and Austria.  In both these countries education and on-the-job training are interrelated.  This is a very successful feature of the German system and could be investigated profitably by this country.  The Minister for Education and Skills is dealing with a Bill on education and training and reform of the VEC structure.  My Department sits on the board of the group which is progressing that development.  It is important from a social welfare point of view that unemployed people have relevant opportunities and, in particular, relevant apprenticeships and traineeships.  We all know that with the collapse in construction, apprenticeships have suffered a severe reduction in terms of numbers, and we need to look to the future.<\/p><p>  In regard to pension portability, I will bear in mind what Deputy O'Dea said.  The advice from the European Commission is that a number of countries are ready to move on this issue but, as he will know from his long experience as a Minister in the previous Government, the agreement of member states is needed on proposals from the Commission.  The Commission is optimistic that progress can be made but the Deputy will understand how these matters work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600007#F00300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1348652400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>We said we would move on to the pre-budget discussion at 11 a.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600007#F00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1348652400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I have further questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600007#F00500","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1348652400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>We are straying into areas that are outside the remit of this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600007#F00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1348652400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I wish to make one point in response to Deputy Joan Collins.

I have responded to parliamentary questions indicating that I favour it.  We are progressing that legislation which is being developed in the Department along with a number of other changes on registration.  It follows the production of a detailed Law Reform Commission report on the area.  One of the most important rights in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is the right of the child to have knowledge of who his or her parents are.  In this country and in most European countries that information is held on the database of birth certificates and birth registers.  Most European countries provide for it.<\/p><p>  Senator Moloney asked about pensions Ireland pays to people overseas, most of whom are Irish.  The Department is gathering the data following the Senator's question at last Thursday's meeting.  I understand that approximately 50,000 people are getting such payments - most of them from Ireland.  Many of these people might have worked in their youth in Ireland and then went to Britain to work.  They then have some pension payments from the UK and some from Ireland.  They would seek to maximise the pension from each jurisdiction.  Most of those arrangements are the subject of bilateral agreements with different countries.  The United Kingdom would be the major country because of the number of Irish people who emigrated from here to there in the 1950s and 1960s.  The United States, Canada, Australia are the other principal countries.  I will come back to the Senator with the details of those numbers, which are being researched in the Department.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Dea asked about the guarantee.  The Deputy has been a member of Government and has been deeply involved in European Union affairs over a long period.  The European Union progresses as follows.  Proposals are made, which are then agreed through the European Commission, the European Parliament and the national governments.  That has been in place since long before my time in government and also probably since long before the Deputy's time in government.  There has been no advertised change in that.<\/p><p>  The proposals on the youth guarantee are very positive and in many ways reflect what I have been doing since becoming Minister, which is to provide a structured pathway for people of various ages to go to work rather than having young people coming out of school and unable to get a job.  They go on the live register and six months becomes a year which becomes two years.  More than 9,000 people have taken advantage of the JobBridge mechanism we introduced, which backs up what the Deputy said about the enormous interest among young people in positive options.  In addition we have places on traditional CE schemes.  I am interested in developing a traineeship structure to expand the traditional opportunities that were available, particularly for young men in apprenticeships but which because of the collapse of the building industry are not available for the types of young men interested.<\/p> <p>Not everybody wants to be an IT programmer or language writer.  Many people want to work in retail, construction or banking at mid-level.  In this respect, countries such as Germany have an established record of using traineeships to give people continuing education and work experience.  This seems to work very well for these countries.  How will the EU fund this?  It can do so only through devoting some of its budget to it.  This is why I stated, in view of the framework agreed by the Commission, the European Parliament and the member states, that I hope the European Social Fund will be one of the headings when it comes to determining the budget.<\/p><p> Earlier this year President Barroso sent officials to each member state to examine the issues there with regard to unemployment and young people.  The Commission has a good overall picture of the terrible difficulties young people have.  This is a positive development and I welcome it.  During Ireland's Presidency I will do my utmost to advance this.  As with all EU matters, it is for negotiation and advancement through discussion.  In speaking about this we are returning to an older vision of the European Union which is as much about the social union and social progress as it is about bankers, who have understandably received the detailed attentions of the European Union in recent times.  This is one of the reasons EPSCO will focus on such issues, which is a positive development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600008#G01600","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348653600,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Does the Minister envisage that the EU will put up the money to fund this in its entirety in so far as it relates to Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600009#H00200","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1348653600,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I did not say that.

I welcome this new initiative, which has been put in place on foot of a commitment in the programme for Government to enhance the role of Oireachtas committees in engaging with the whole-of-year budgetary process.<\/p><p>  As I outlined at our meeting on 22 May 2012, the Department will spend approximately &euro;20.5 billion on a wide range of schemes and services this year.  These services and supports have some impact on the life of every person in the State, and the scope and scale of this expenditure plays a key role in the wider economy and helps to partially offset the effect of the downturn.<\/p><p>  The Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014, published last December, provides for new expenditure reduction measures of &euro;1.033 billion over the next two years in the Department's budget.  This includes &euro;540 million of new savings to be achieved in budget 2013.  Reducing overall expenditure in 2013 and beyond, as required by these expenditure ceilings, while protecting the most vulnerable people in Irish society will be extremely difficult.  A critical analysis of social welfare policy and expenditure will be required and the committee's input in this regard will be valuable in informing the budget process.  My officials have provided committee members with briefing material, including a fairly detailed brief on expenditure in the Department, which I hope will assist in our deliberations today.  I propose to quickly go through the key points in the briefing in order to inform and begin our discussions.  I welcome the views of committee members and I look forward to their engagement on how the Department can achieve its expenditure ceilings in 2013 and 2014.<\/p><p>  I would like to take this opportunity to briefly update the committee on some of the Department's key priorities.  The Government's priority is to reduce the level of long-term unemployment and, in so doing, to ensure the overall level of unemployment will fall as the economy returns to growth.  There are two major elements to the Government's response, namely, the action plan for jobs and Pathways to Work.  The goal of the action plan for jobs is to create new jobs, while the goal of Pathways to Work is to help ensure that as many of these jobs as possible, along with other job vacancies, are filled by people on the live register.<\/p><p>  As the committee is aware, the Department has established the new National Employment and Entitlements Service, which is central to the realisation of the Government's Pathways to Work policy.  The first step in establishing the National Employment and Entitlements Service was integrating staff from F&Aacute;S, the community welfare service and the Department.  This integration, which involved the transfer of almost 1,700 staff, was completed on schedule in January of this year.  It will facilitate the delivery of a one-stop-shop service and greatly simplify the process, as people previously had to engage with three separate organisations for welfare and employment services.<\/p><p>  The delivery of a one-stop-shop service is being piloted in four of the Department's offices and will be extended to a further ten offices by the end of the year.  Development of this new integrated service is predicated on a case management approach which begins for the client from the moment he or she first contacts the Department.<\/p> <p>This personalised response will monitor the client's progress towards the employment, training or education opportunities on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p> There is occasional public debate on whether people on the live register have a financial incentive to work and reference to the relatively high wages that would need to be earned to match or exceed that said to be available on social welfare.  However, the great majority of people on the live register have a significant financial incentive to work.  For example, some three quarters of people on the live register claim a weekly payment that comprises the personal rate only.  The maximum rate is &euro;188 per week.  More detailed information on the incentive to work for people on the live register is contained in the committee's briefing material.  As members will see, the amounts paid in some cases, for example, where rent allowance is paid to large families of two parents and a significant number of children, can be relatively large.  This has been pointed out in many studies and is the basis for my discussions with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with a view to transferring responsibility for rent supplement to that Department.<\/p><p> I am conscious that the people who turn to my Department for support played no part in causing this financial crisis and I will do my best to ensure that the burden of resolving the crisis does not fall disproportionately on their shoulders.  One of my key priorities, therefore, is to ensure that the Department's reducing resources are targeted at the people who need them most.<\/p><p> Members will be aware that I had a particular interest in the area of fraud and control when I began in the Department.  For this reason, I asked my officials to increase their efforts to combat fraudulent activity.  Social welfare fraud is often perceived as a victimless crime, but it is not.  It undermines public confidence in the entire system as well as being unfair to other recipients of social welfare payments and taxpayers.  It is important at this point to state in the clearest terms that the majority of people on social welfare are claiming only the entitlements due to them.  However, we must ensure that any fraudulent activity within the social welfare system is vigorously prevented and combated.<\/p><p> The Department is conscious of its obligation to protect public money and is determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and dealt with effectively when detected, bearing in mind that taxpayers and people paying PRSI are carrying the cost of social welfare.  The committee's briefing material provides members with some further information on the work of the Department's control division, including this year's control targets, information on the fraud initiative that I launched late last year and a summary of how control savings are calculated.<\/p><p> I will revert to our consideration of the 2013 Estimates.  Table 1 in the briefing details the Department's expenditure on its various programmes in 2012.  As can be seen, the largest block of expenditure relates to pensions and will amount to &euro;6.2 billion, approximately 30%, of overall expenditure.  Members may wish to note that expenditure on pensions, on a no policy change basis, will increase by at least &euro;200 million in 2013 and increased by a similar figure this year.  We have a demographic dividend, in that more older people are living for longer.  As such, more people qualify for longer for the State contributory and non-contributory pensions.  It is not atypical for someone entering pension age today to claim a pension for a further 25 to 30 years.  The demographic challenges are increasing annually.<\/p><p> Expenditure on working age income supports, including jobseeker's and one-parent family payments, accounts for 28% of overall expenditure, some &euro;5.7 billion.  Expenditure on working age employment supports, including the community employment, CE, scheme, JobBridge, T&uacute;s and various employment supports, amounts to more than &euro;983 million or nearly 5% of the Department's expenditure.  This represents an increase of &euro;122 million, some 14%, over 2011 and is a clear indication of my priorities in this area.<\/p><p> Expenditure provision for illness, disability and carer's payments will amount to more than &euro;3.4 billion or nearly 17% of expenditure in 2012.  These supports include carer's allowance and benefit, domiciliary care allowance and disability allowance among others.  In total, payments to carers amount to more than &euro;700 million.<\/p><p> Expenditure on children and families will account for nearly 12% of expenditure or nearly &euro;2.4 billion, of which nearly &euro;2.1 billion will go towards child benefit while &euro;200 million will be spent on family income supplement.<\/p><p> Expenditure on supplementary payments, agencies and miscellaneous services accounts for &euro;1.2 billion or nearly 6% of expenditure.  This expenditure comprises four main elements, namely, rent and mortgage interest supplements of &euro;487 million, the household benefits package of &euro;335 million, free travel amounting to &euro;77 million, and fuel allowance amounting to &euro;214 million.<\/p><p> Members may also wish to note that three quarters of expenditure is incurred by a relatively small number of schemes.  This is broken down on table 2 of the material.  Other than expenditure on child benefit, members may wish to note that this expenditure relates to the cost of the weekly rates of payment for the recipients involved.  It does not include the cost of supplementary benefits, for example, free travel and the household benefits package.  As outlined in the table, 1.473 million people are in receipt of weekly payments in respect of 2.2 million people, a significant portion of the population.  We pay child benefit to approximately 600,000 families in respect of nearly 1.2 million children.  Social welfare's reach into every corner of the country, including the majority of households, is significant.<\/p><p> The sheer scale and scope of expenditure by my Department reflects the Government's commitment to protecting the most vulnerable in our society and recognises the role of welfare expenditure in the wider economy.  However, we are in a difficult economic situation, which is reflected by the fact that we are still spending considerably more each year than we take in through revenue.  Expenditure ceilings for my Department for 2013 and 2014 have been set in this context and, to be frank, achieving them poses the Government a major challenge.<\/p><p> Table 4 shows how social welfare expenditure increased significantly in the 2002-11 period.  It is interesting to note that, in 2009 after the bank collapse and the guarantee, our expenditure increased significantly.  Table 5 details the increase in weekly recipients and beneficiaries while tables 6 to 8 outline the payment rates during those years for various social welfare schemes.  Those rates continued to increase after the crash.<\/p><p> One of my key priorities as Minister for Social Protection - the country's largest spending Department - is to bring some balance to our expenditure and funding, in particular by starting to put the Social Insurance Fund on a sustainable footing.  This is important not only so that we can recover our economic sovereignty, but also to ensure that the social protection system is sustainable in future.  The significant shortfall in the Social Insurance Fund, which is being met by the Exchequer, and the prospect of an acceleration of this deficit in future must be addressed.  The committee considered this issue last week.<\/p><p> The Exchequer still makes the most significant contribution to social welfare expenditure in terms of resources, as it funds all assistance-based schemes and child benefit.  However, employees, employers and the self-employed also make a significant and valued contribution to the social welfare system through the operation of the Social Insurance Fund.  The Revised Estimates of expenditure for 2012 provide for social insurance income of close to &euro;7.1 billion, but expenditure on social insurance will be almost &euro;8.9 billion.  The deficit of just over &euro;1.8 billion will be financed by the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>This is now likely to be exceeded in 2012.  The recently completed actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund was presented to this committee on 20 September last.  I hope the committee found that presentation useful.  It is hoped the review will inform the short, medium and long-term policy development in relation to the social insurance system generally.<\/p><p> On the budget for 2013 and beyond, &euro;20.55 billion overall was allocated to the Department of Social Protection in 2012.  During the period 2009 to 2012, inclusive, budget saving measures to the value of approximately &euro;2.7 billion were introduced.  The details of these measures are contained in table 3 of the pack provided for Members.  This means that social welfare expenditure in 2013 would have increased by &euro;2.7 billion more had these measures not been introduced.  Achieving a further &euro;540 million in expenditure reductions in the budget for 2013 as set out in the comprehensive expenditure report will be difficult.  The scale of the reduction means my Department must continue its examination of all schemes and services, which was commenced as part of the comprehensive review of expenditure completed last year and informed the Government's consideration of the budget for 2012.<\/p><p> I hope I have provided members with a good overview of the Department's expenditure in 2012, the challenges ahead in 2013 and beyond and the wide variety of considerations which must inform the budget and Estimates process for 2013.  I must stress that our system of social protection is a major piece of social investment and a major source of stimulus into the economy because our pensioners, carers and unemployed people who receive income support from my Department spend it in shops and businesses.  It is an important part of economic demand and stimulus in an economy which has experienced a banking and construction industry bubble collapse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600009#H01400","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348654800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I am aware Senator Power must leave for a vote in the Seanad.

However, I will read the transcript of the proceedings.<\/p><p>  I would like to raise a number of issues, the first of which is consistency across Departments in terms of the impact and cost on the social welfare programme as a result of changes being made in other Departments, in particular, the Department of Education and Skills.  The Minister spoke at length in her opening address about options for young people, including Pathways to Work and so on.  Last year, however, the Department of Education and Skills abolished postgraduate grants which resulted in a dramatic reduction, as outlined by the colleges over the summer, in the number of applications from young people from low income families to attend third level college.  While the Minister is putting new options in place in her Department, other Departments are removing valuable options, the result of which is, in the short term, young people who would have gone to college being on the dole because they cannot get a job, and in the longer term, the unavailability, when there is a pick-up in the economy and new jobs are created, of people with third level qualifications.  Was the Minister aware of that decision prior to its being announced and did she raise concerns about it from the point of view of her Department?  What processes are in place to ensure similar decisions are not made this year and instead are thought through from a cross-departmental perspective? <\/p><p>  My second question is in regard to the processing of claims, which has been an issue of concern for a number of years.  I am aware there have been some improvements in some areas.  A particular issue of concern is the waiting time between people finishing up on schemes and obtaining benefits.  I have been contacted a number of times about waiting times in respect of illness benefit in particular as a result of the enforcement of the two year limit.  I am sure Deputy O'Dea and others have received similar representations. People's illness benefit is being withheld while they wait for months on a decision in regard to whether they qualify for invalidity benefit.  While the payments outstanding will be backdated, people are experiencing a lot of stress and uncertainty while waiting for a decision.<\/p><p>  My final question is in regard to the progress being made in terms of the integration of the tax and social welfare systems.  The Minister in her speech outlined the remit of the group and what it was set up to do.  However, I am interested in hearing what progress has been made and the outcomes to date.  While obviously this has implications in terms of child benefit and other issues, there is a real urgency to get those two systems working together.<\/p><p>  I thank the Chairman and Members for the courtesy of allowing me to put my questions to the Minister first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600011#K00300","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1348654800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her presentation.

Given current projections for economic growth and so on, I am pessimistic about where we are going to get the money for the youth guarantee scheme, regardless of how much co-funding is provided by the EU.  I was struck by the figure mentioned by the Minister in her speech in regard to the cost of pensions, which is currently in excess of &euro;6 billion.  I would have thought that the best approach for a country faced with a situation like this is to encourage people to provide for themselves.  Rather than introducing pension levies and threatening reductions in tax relief for people who put money aside for pensions in order to look after themselves when, clearly, if the statistics are correct, the State will not be able to look after them in 20 or 30 years because the resources will not be available, the Government should be moving in the opposite direction in terms of encouraging people to provide for themselves.<\/p><p>  I note what the Minister had to say about the Social Insurance Fund.  I regret I missed the briefing last week on the fund, which I am sure was very interesting.  I am a little confused as to the reason there is so much concern about the Social Insurance Fund.  It seems to me to be a bit of an accounting exercise.  The fact is that 60% of social welfare benefits are paid from outside the Social Insurance Fund.  The only time the Social Insurance Fund washed its own face was during the period of high economic growth.  I sincerely hope what the Minister said - she might give the committee some reassurance in this regard - was not code for saying PRSI will have to be increased.  If the Social Insurance Fund is to wash its own face then the only way that can be done is for more people to get jobs.  It appears ludicrous to be trying to balance the Social Insurance Fund through the introduction of measures which will increase the cost of creating those jobs.<\/p><p>  I thank the departmental officials for their detailed brief, which I read last night.  I was struck by a number of issues in it, especially the scale of the overall spend on social welfare and the key role it plays in the economy generally, including as a method of redistributing resources, as mentioned on page 5.  It is also stated on that page that expenditure on social protection can play an important role in stabilising the economy by supporting the overall demand for goods and services in the domestic economy and mitigating the societal consequences of the recession.  The Minister emphasised in her concluding remarks the benefit to the economy and demand in the economy of the amount of money being distributed through the social welfare system.  The Minister will be aware that the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste have given a commitment that social welfare rates will not be cut.  I take it , in view of the importance of social welfare as a redistribution mechanism and its importance to the economy, where domestic demand is on the floor, that that commitment stands and social welfare rates will not be cut in the forthcoming budget.<\/p><p>  The Pathways to Work scheme is referred to in the official brief.  I understand it is being piloted in Arklow, Parnell Street in Dublin, Sligo and Tallaght.  Does the Minister have feedback on how well it is working in practice?  She referred to an evaluation report but surely the Department has received some feedback on whether it is working.  I have spoken to people employed by the Department of Social Protection in the vicinity of the four places mentioned and they have told me they have not noticed any significant difference.<\/p> <p>I do not know how many hundreds of thousands of social welfare officers are in the country but the pilot scheme is going on in four areas that will be extended to ten.  How long will this take to function in the entire country?  Is it making a difference on the ground where it is being piloted?  What is being done about establishing links between employers and training providers?<\/p><p> There is an announcement on page 11 of the brief relating to rent allowance.  This indicates that the Department currently provides rent supplement to housing authorities; it will begin using a new housing assistance payment, with the commencement date for the new arrangement being 1 January 2013.  This means the current system of rent allowance will be replaced by a new housing assistance payment administered by local authorities.  How realistic is the target of 1 January next, as it is approaching quickly?  If we are talking about transferring this responsibility to the local authorities, there must be some idea of how it will work in practice.  Are we still talking about houses in the private sector and will the local authority agree the rent?  Will the rent instead be agreed by landlord and tenant, with the local authority charging what is deemed a differential rent?<\/p><p> The rent allowance scheme has caused mayhem from one end of the country to the other, particularly in urban areas, and I could spend the rest of the day citing instances of trouble.  I even had e-mails related to the issue this morning from people in estates in Limerick.  Will people go to the local authorities if there is a complaint about the conduct of somebody going into rented accommodation using rent allowance or the friends they tend to bring, who are often more troublesome?  What role will the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, have in future?  If somebody cannot get satisfaction from the local authority, will that person be forced to take a case to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, and against whom will the case be taken?  Will it be taken against a landlord or a local authority?<\/p><p> What gets under my skin is the blatant lack of transparency.  Some years ago there was a great deal of agitation in the D&aacute;il and outside it because the EU Commission decided that farmers who got grants from the EU had to have their names and the amounts paid on a website.  Perhaps Members recall that happening.  According to a parliamentary question I asked recently, last year the Minister's Department paid &euro;436 million in rent allowance to landlords whose identity we cannot get.  By law, these people remain anonymous.  If somebody came to me in the morning and told me a neighbouring house was rented to an undesirable person, with terrible trouble in the estate - this is not an imaginary example by any means - I could try to contact the HSE.  Depending on whom I speak to, the person in the HSE might be very reluctant to say even if the renter is receiving rent supplement, and I will definitely not be told the name of the landlord.<\/p><p> This appears daft.  The EU pays a certain amount to farmers and there must be transparency in that regard.  Irish taxpayers are paying the guts of &euro;500 million to landlords but there is no right to find out who are the people who receive the money.  Some of the taxpayers are the people affected by anti-social behaviour, yet they have no right to find out the name of the person they are supporting through rent supplement coming from their taxes.  It is ludicrous.  Will we have transparency and will there be some arrangement to publish the names and addresses of landlords?<\/p><p> I can give a practical example.  A person may not want to go to the PRTB - there are many reasons for this in Limerick - and let his or her name go public.  It would be preferable if the landlord could be approached for a deal but this is impossible because we cannot get the names of landlords.  Will the Minister address that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600011#K00600","speaker":"1059","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348655400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Will the Deputy wrap up as he has been speaking for ten minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600012#L00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1348655400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I have one question relating to fraud.

It is a good mechanism which recognises the role the committee can play in trying to tease out some of the issues and provide helpful suggestions.<\/p><p>  There is a context, which has been stated by the Minister.  The briefing made a good point at the beginning, which was partially quoted by Deputy O'Dea.  It probably should be stated more often that when dealing with the Department of Social Protection, the primary role is to support people.  In doing so, there is a contributory effect on the local economy and social consequences.  The briefing made that point quite well.<\/p><p>  Any changes in the Department can have consequences, which sets it apart from other Departments.  The media and some commentators have an agenda because the Department is the biggest spender, with the idea that its expenditure must be cut as a result.  The logic omits the fact that because of the recession, the number of people dependent on the Department has increased.  Even if we remained at the current level of payments and allowances, the spending of the Department would increase, despite controlled savings or efficiencies within the Department.  There is a job of work to be done.  Our party, in its costed alternative budgets, has not increased payments but we tried to ensure that the <i>status quo <\/i> remains, even with the increase in prices facing people dependent on social welfare, including the price of gas and electricity.  Those will have a greater impact on people in need of the Department's help.<\/p><p>  The briefing also documents, in a table, the range of cuts implemented to date by this and the previous Government.  It is quite stark, with the Minister mentioning that &euro;2.7 billion has been taken from the system.  The vast majority of the &euro;2.7 billion has been taken from the pockets of people dependent on social welfare and has not come from efficiencies within the Department or controlled savings.  That means the local economy has suffered the consequences, and children have also suffered when parents cannot put food on the table.<\/p> <p> There is a list, as the Minister stated when we discussed the issue of youth unemployment.  In the last year the level of unemployment has increased substantially.  The number of long-term unemployed who have different needs has increased also.  Even since the production of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, there has been an increase in the number of job losses in the economy.<\/p><p> I will proceed to my questions.  The Minister has stated in the past that the intention of the Government is not to cut social welfare rates.  Is that still the intention?  Does the Minister believe the reduction in the number of months for payment of the fuel allowance is a cut in social welfare rates?  The changes she has implemented with regard to lone parents are the same as a cut in the rates.  The reductions in rent and mortgage interest supplement are also cuts in the rates.  So far, the Minister has been cutting but saying there is no cut in the rates.  Is that commitment dead in the water at this stage?<\/p><p> My other question is related to the committee because it agreed on a report I produced on the single working age payment.  One of the recommendations in that report was that in any social welfare reform the value of existing earnings disregards for secondary benefits and the means or capital allowance should be maintained.  That was signed up to by the members of the committee.

We are now in the middle of what we are told are the budgetary negotiations before the next budget, but we still have not seen the review.

Is there any indication of the amount by which it will be exceeded?  This has major implications for future planning.  Table No. 4 on social welfare expenditure appears to indicate there will be a drop in expenditure this year.  The expenditure figure will be &euro;20.547 billion, but if the deficit is to be exceeded by the figure given, how will that expenditure figure increase?  Will it be the same as last year, which will mean there will be no overall saving?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600012#L00800","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348656000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I must ask the Deputy to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600013#M00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1348656000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Table No. 11 indicates where potential savings could be achieved.

Everybody who represents constituencies where there is a great deal of rented accommodation available has experience of the same problems.  As a result of this, when I entered the Department I changed the legislation in very important ways to give social welfare officials and inspectors more powers of investigation with regard to landlords.  This was before the Deputy became his party's spokesperson.  From May 2012, social welfare inspectors and higher executive officers, HEOs, have been given powers of inquiry to ensure rent supplement is being paid correctly.  The types of inquiries to landlords that are considered necessary include confirmation that the person to whom rent supplement is being paid is the actual tenant.  The Deputy made a very polite allusion to a phenomenon I know well.  An individual receives rent supplement for himself or herself and, perhaps, his or her children.  That person is fine, but he or she might have a hidden or undeclared partner and that person might not be so nice.  In fact, it might be a problem for the first person.  We are all familiar with this.  Officials now have powers of inquiry which they did not have previously to find out if the person concerned is actually the person who is the tenant.  Then there is a statement confirming that the person to whom rent supplement is or has been payable is or has been residing at that address for the period for which the rent supplement is or has been paid; confirmation of the duration or period of the tenancy; and any other relevant details that the landlord may have which may be relevant to the payment of rent supplement.  A landlord who fails to comply with a request made by the relevant designated person or social welfare inspector shall be guilty of an offence.  We took these powers in May because I share the concerns expressed.  Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh and I have discussed this issue on previous occasions.  It is a significant social problem.<\/p><p>  The reason I would like responsibility for the payment of rent supplement to be transferred to the local authorities is very simple.  The local authorities have housing departments.  Since I came into the Department I have been working in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing.  A group of officials from both Departments is working together to develop a new payment which will be called the housing assistance payment.  What are the difficulties and challenges in doing this?  There are a couple which I have enunciated previously, but I will go through them for Deputy Willie O'Dea's benefit.  The first is that local authorities have approximately 88 separate differential rent schemes and ways of charging for different types of accommodation, individuals and family circumstances.  There has been very positive work ongoing for some time by officials in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to have a more coherent and reduced number of schemes.  That work appears to be progressing well from the regular updates I have received on it.  <\/p><p>  The second issue is that local authorities have a significant problem where there is a rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and ordinary traditional tenancies.  In some cases people on social welfare may build up arrears by not paying the rent.<\/p> <p>I am working with the Attorney General to develop legally the scheme people are familiar with, the household budgeting system, which is used in post offices.  It was originally developed to prevent people getting into arrears on electricity and gas.  When someone signs in after getting a tenancy, they cannot sign themselves off even though, under the legislation, they may do so.  The consequence is that Dublin City Council, which operates in Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's constituency, has a particular problem.  There may also be a problem with a build-up of arrears in Limerick, with which Deputy O'Dea is familiar.  We are working to change it because it is important that local authorities can have confidence in receiving rent and that people with a social welfare income commit to it.  For women, it is the worst thing that can happen to a mother as it puts great pressure on the family.  Getting out of arrears, which build up relatively quickly, can be very difficult.<\/p><p> I share the concerns of Deputy O'Dea in respect of rent supplement.  I do not agree with the comments of Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh about rent allowance for landlords and the mortgage interest supplement.  As the Minister for Social Protection, I am not in the business of seeking to enhance the income of landlords and banks.  I want to make the two systems as efficient and effective as possible, with the best value for money.  We carried out an exhaustive survey of rent around the country based on the data available within the Department and from external sources.  We found that rents paid were in excess of average rents.  I published this material before Deputy O'Dea became spokesperson and a member of this committee.  That may have been a historical matter but we sought to achieve rents that reflected commercial rents.  It is being done on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p> Community welfare officers, who deal with rent supplement, were transferred to my Department in October.  We are currently working with them to enhance their work in a range of areas.  There is much debate in the public domain about the Croke Park agreement but the Department of Social Protection, enabled by the Croke Park agreement, is undergoing the largest transformation in its history.  Some 1,700 staff transferred from the HSE, including 1,000 community welfare officers and 700 staff from the F&Aacute;S employment offices and community employment schemes.  The integration of these staff members is a major job.  Issues have arisen involving the industrial relations procedures under the Croke Park agreement.<\/p><p> That partially answers another of the questions posed.  The Deputy asked how long this process will take.  We had to take in the staff first.  We launched Pathways to Work earlier and it is now operating on a pilot basis.  The number of people interviewed so far this year, the activation referrals, amounts to 100,000, an increase of 37%.  I can make available the table to which I am referring.  People are called to an interview, a group interview in some cases, followed by a one-to-one interview.  Some of this depends on the configuration of the local social welfare office.  The number of interviews scheduled is 75,000, an increase of 50%.  The attendance rate for the first scheduled engagement is approximately 75%.  When we invite people to an engagement, a group interview or a subsequent one-on-one interview, about 10% of referred clients leave the register prior to the first engagement and another 10% leave the register by the date of the second session.  These statistics were reviewed in June and July.<\/p><p> We are operating a two strikes system in terms of our approach to fraud.  People are invited to meet officials in a group engagement or in a one-to-one engagement.  Of the 20% of people who sign off before the first or before the second engagement, many of them may have found a job that week.  In other cases, we are not quite so clear but there is a turnover on the register.  The vast majority of people welcome the engagement, while others do not have time in their busy schedules to engage.  The problematic element is the remaining 5%.  Some 3% of referred clients are still scheduled to attend the second engagement and 2% fail to do so.  We are particularly concerned about the latter 2% and they become liable for penalty rates in respect of reductions in social welfare payments.  Since the introduction of the penalty rates in May 2011, some 1,374 customers have had penalty rates applied.  With the two strikes approach, a number of people sign off and we have a core consideration about why the remaining people, who are liable for penalty rates, are not responding.  It is a lengthy process because we want to give people the opportunity to respond.  I stress that most people respond and in some cases they have recently signed off anyway.  In other cases, for their own good reasons they may leave the register.<\/p><p> This is a new approach and is important when one thinks about pensioners and the Deputy's comments about our social insurance fund.  We want to ensure our pensioners can look forward to an adequate pension, whether it is the contributory pension or the non-contributory, means tested pension.  We must ensure the resources in Department of Social Protection are used as well as possible.  The vast majority of people interacting with the Department are as honest as the day is long but a percentage of people have a difficulty.  Through the approach of Pathways to Work, we want them to come in so that we can help them.<\/p><p> I launched the T&uacute;s scheme shortly after I came into office.  It has 5,000 people and is operated by local community partnerships and local development groups and networks.  It exclusively targets, on a basis selected by the Department, people who have been unemployed for more than one year.  In its deliberations in respect of social welfare, the IMF was anxious to examine some of the people who were long-term on the register.  Through the local employment services and local partnerships, there is a great amount of valuable work being done around the country.  I thank the local partnerships, the local development companies and the Leader companies that have used T&uacute;s and built it up to 5,000 people.  It involves people who are on the register for more than one year.  Many positive and encouraging developments are taking place for people on the live register.  They are desperately anxious to contribute and to go back to education or to work.  Some &euro;84 million was provided for T&uacute;s, which amounted to an increase in expenditure in order to provide opportunities.<\/p> <p>Our spend on JobBridge, which again is an activation opportunity, was in excess of &euro;65 million - almost &euro;67 million this year.  That expenditure represents the increase in the expenditure on labour support mechanisms.  It is a very important spend and I am very grateful to the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for making extra resources available.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about the scale of the adjustment.  I remind him that in November 2010 his Government set out a four year national recovery plan and Fianna F&aacute;il's targets for social welfare were even more daunting.  In 2013, Fianna F&aacute;il wanted a reduction in the four year plan - I am sure the Deputy has it and is very familiar with it - of &euro;1.4 billion.  In 2014, it wanted a reduction of &euro;1.9 billion.  That would have meant a reduction of &euro;800 million in 2013 and further reduction of &euro;500 million in 2014, so his Government, in calling in the IMF, had a series of situations to grapple with in terms of social welfare expenditure.  That was its suggestion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600013#M00400","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348657200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>It was predicated on different rates of growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600015#O00200","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1348657200,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Yes, but those growth rates, unfortunately, turned out to be not very sustainable and, similarly, the numbers who were unemployed were far higher.

Is there a cap on the number of social welfare payments for which a person can qualify?  Has this been looked at and is it feasible?  For example, a person could be in receipt of rent allowance, a medical card, free fuel, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, the lone parent allowance, child benefit and maybe even half the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  If one looks at that cumulative picture, what job could meet that in this environment?<\/p><p>  I do not agree with the social welfare system in the way it is framed, with 64 schemes.  Are we creating a system which is, in itself, mitigating against work?  The Minister said three quarters of people are on the basic jobseeker's benefit.  There is no issue there.

If we can bring them into the Social Insurance Fund by giving them the option to make a class A contribution, they would qualify for benefits.  They have a number of benefits currently with the 4% contribution, but if they increased the percentage, when they fall on hard times, they could apply for illness benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.<\/p><p>  The Minister asked us about ways to help to bring in an income.  I have been thinking about the people who are signing on for credits.  They are not getting a payment but are ensuring their entitlement to pension is kept up to date.  To me, it is really a pension policy.  I would be in favour of a small contribution - maybe &euro;1 per week - from the people who are signing credits only.  They are not getting money but are sending in sick certs to get a credit contribution and they are signing credits at the local office.  This is like a pension policy for them and ensures their pension is in place in future.<\/p><p>  I refer to something mooted in the general election campaign but which seems to have fallen by the wayside.  It may be more under the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform's remit than the Minister&rsquo;s but I am talking about a central assessment unit which could assess people.  People are being assessed for social housing, medical cards, social welfare and third level grants.  There is a duplication of work by civil servants.  There should be a central office where the housing department could ask for Marie Moloney&rsquo;s assessment as could the medical card and the social welfare departments.  I do not understand why something like that is not being worked on as it would do away with duplication of work.<\/p><p>  I know the fraud officers are very active on the ground but we should adopt the policy that a person is innocent until proven guilty because some of the fraud officers are very aggressive, for the want of a better word, when they go to people's houses.

They should have the right to know who the landlord is who is allowing this antisocial behaviour and collecting a social welfare cheque at the end of each week.

This has been in gestation for a long time; the process had started before the Croke Park agreement was even dreamed of.  The agreement provides for transfer from other Departments that are less overworked than the Department of Social Protection.  How many have been transferred as a result of that provision?  Talking to officials on the ground in the Clare-Limerick-Tipperary area, the experience is that they are still far too busy and could do with a lot of extra staff.<\/p><p>  I asked the Minister how many people had been designated to investigate the 985,000 cases of fraud.

As far as the general situation is concerned, there is an interesting section in the briefing document from the Department where it is estimated if someone is more than 70% as well off staying at home, that is what he tends to do.  The Department has some interesting and helpful figures there, finding that in a recent analysis of the minimum wage, 90% of social welfare payments have a replacement rate that is less than 70% the minimum wage and 10% of claimants have a replacement of between 70% and 80% of the minimum wage, indicating that the social welfare system is not a powerful disincentive to those who want to go to work.<\/p><p>  I am not trying to be politically contentious but the internationally recognised standard for the poverty line is 60% of the average industrial wage.  In this country, there are 750,000 people living below that line, with 250,000 of those being children.  The Minister will find the vast majority of those are found in the ranks of social welfare recipients.

The community welfare officers have transferred from the HSE and are now part of the community welfare service in the Department of Social Protection.  They are not necessarily expert in dealing with housing need and the setting of rent, whereas this has been part of the responsibility of the housing section of the local authorities.  We must bring the different systems together.  I am happy that we have made progress.  I share Deputy O'Dea's concerns on the way some tenants, or people associated with them who are not declared, may cause great difficulties.<\/p><p>  I will be able to provide the Chairman with data on the people who avail of free travel.  At present, in approximate figures, about 745,500 social welfare recipients get free travel.  This includes pensioners, people with a disability and carers.  Some 85,700 persons have companion passes and another 361,200 are spouses of recipients, making a total of 1.1 million people who receive a free travel pass.  The Chairman is correct in saying that the overall cost of the scheme was capped at &euro;77 million by our predecessors in Government some years ago, simply because the numbers, and the number who were not pensioners, was rising significantly.  I will provide the committee with these figures.  It may be worthwhile for it to consider them more closely.  The operators have raised issues on the schemes and have a number of queries.  There is an inter-departmental group comprising the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Social Protection and the representatives of the National Transport Authority and so on dealing with it.  There is a concern about some level of abuse, such as forged passes being used.  People may have seen reports in the newspapers on an exercise that officials in the Department together with the operators of the trams carried out in Dublin.  We have set up a hotline for transport operators, so that if inspectors who are checking tickets and passes believe the transport pass may be improperly used they can telephone and check the person has a valid pass number that is duly authorised.  We started this a couple of months ago, so I do not have full outcomes.  I will be happy to come back to the joint committee to discuss this when we have more detailed information in the Department.  I know that Dublin Bus as well as other operators are concerned.<\/p><p>  For the past ten to 15 years we have been speaking about changing the system in the Department so that a person is issued with a personal services card which has photo ID.  This is a huge piece of work.  We have started to implement it this year with the change to pathways and the introduction of the personal services card.  In fairness to the staff, there are major ongoing changes, such as upgrading IT and changing to new systems.  Unfortunately it takes time.  I do not think there are any fraud problems with pensioners because everybody over 66 years is entitled to the free bus pass.  I have never heard a suggestion of a problem with that scheme.  The problem may lie with some of the other categories, for example younger people who may have counterparts who are entitled to free travel and they are enabled to use it.  There are 99,000 on disability allowance who have a free travel pass.  Many of them would be quite young.  There is a problem.  The operators have raised it as a problem.<\/p><p>  The bulk of the allocation of &euro;77 million goes to CIE as a subvention.  Another amount goes to rural and community bus developments.  Senator Marie Moloney would be very familiar with its operation in County Kerry.  Some goes to private bus operators but they have raised their issues with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  <\/p><p>  Perhaps this may be an issue the joint committee might return to when I am able to give the secretariat a more detailed briefing.  I share the Chairman's appreciation of the value of free travel for people, particularly pensioners.  I spoke to a medical consultant in the area of caring for older people and I was told of the tremendous value of encouraging people to travel around.  Senator Moloney can tell us of the value to the local economy of the golden years pensioners who travel to Killarney for a short break.  It has very important social consequences and benefits for people individually and also it helps pensioners to travel around and see the country.  That has an impact on tourism and leisure.  I am very conscious of the value that older people and people with mobility issues derive from their free travel pass.<\/p><p>  The spend in 2011 on rent supplement was &euro;503 million.  The estimate for this year is &euro;436 million.  Some people have had difficulties but the individual community welfare services are dealing with people on a one-to-one basis.  New rents are being negotiated yearly or every couple of years.  The estimated savings to the Department are about &euro;67 million.  In the context of the budget, achieving these savings is important.  I will revert to Deputy O'Dea on his questions relating to identification.  As I said, the new powers for inspectors should be of assistance.  We might talk more about that.<\/p><p>  In response to Senator Healy Eames, the increase in the deficit of the social insurance fund does not affect spending.  The Government commits to a programme of spending on social welfare of &euro;20.5 billion.  Some of that spending, that is contributory old age pension, job seeker's benefit and so on is funded out of the social insurance fund but the Government has committed to that spending.  If there is a shortage on the fund, the deficit is made up out of general taxation.<\/p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh also referred to this issue.  The Government adopts an estimate for the year and where the social insurance fund falls short or the deficit is larger than predicted general taxation is used to make up the shortfall.  This is currently the case in the period since estimates were done with the International Monetary Fund in September 2010 and confirmed in November, the number of people on the live register has increased by 40,000 more than anticipated.  The good news is that the social insurance fund will balance itself as people return to work in a number of years but if we continue to have high levels of unemployment we will need to ensure the fund is resourced.<\/p><p> Members should also note in respect of the social insurance fund that the health levy-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600017#Q00300","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348659000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Has provision been made for such a scenario?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600018#R00200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1348659000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>-----was originally an insurance based payment.  The replacement levy, which the previous Government introduced, was described by the Economic and Social Research Institute in the original papers as a universal social contribution.  However, when the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Brian Lenihan, presented it in the budget the levy had morphed into a universal social charge, in other words, a general tax to provide for a range of social spending as opposed to a contribution.  One of the issues we need to address is whether we can rebalance the contributory element if the social welfare system.  When Lord Beveridge developed the notion of modern social welfare 70 years ago he did so on the basis of an insurance based system.  This is an extremely important concept because during their working lives people pay into an insurance based system from which they earn an entitlement to claim if they fall unemployed, become sick or retire.  They can, therefore, look forward to some comfort from a fund into which they have paid.  In that sense, it is important to keep the social insurance fund in balance.<\/p><p>  On Senator Marie Moloney's query about bringing people who are self-employed into the social insurance fund, the actuarial review the joint committee studied last week showed that on an actuarial basis the self-employed, who pay a 4% contribution, do better from the fund than any other group.  The 4% contribution gives a self-employed person who becomes unemployed an entitlement to an old age pension or a widow's-survivor's pension on a contributory basis.  This represents extraordinarily good value for a 4% contribution.  The actuarial review report notes that such a contribution would only fund a pension of around &euro;28 if it were valued on an actuarial basis.  The difficulty with regard to self-employed people, as highlighted in the programme for Government, is whether they can be brought into wider social insurance schemes.  While this is possible, they would also have to make sufficiently large contributions to make the system viable as the deficit in the fund would otherwise increase. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600018#R00300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1348659000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Is it possible to do that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600018#R00400","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1348659000,"counter":115,"content":"<p>No, the reason being that the scheme was designed for that purpose.

In other words, self-employed people would have to pay the employee contribution of 4.25%, the employer contribution of 10.5% and a small additional contribution to cover their entitlements on an actuarial basis.  One of the proposals that has been made has been to provide such an option on an opt-in basis.  The advisory group, to which several members referred, is working on this and other issues.  It also had to await the outcome of the actuarial review, which was completed during the summer.  The Department published the review at the earliest possible date and circulated it to the joint committee and D&aacute;il in late August or early September before circulating it to the media in order that all the parties would have an opportunity to examine it.  This is an area on which there is considerable common ground between the political parties in the D&aacute;il and one on which we can move forward in a progressive manner.  I do no yet have a report from the advisory group as it only recently received the actuarial review of the social insurance fund.<\/p><p>  Senator Healy Eames referred to placing a cap on the number of payments.  Our system does not work in this way.  In Austria each family has an account in which all payments and benefits from the State, ranging across education, agriculture and health, are aggregated.  It was interesting to study this system and the various benefits individuals and families received from the State but for reasons connected with information technology, it would be some time before we could have a similar system in place.<\/p><p>  As I indicated, those who have a significant income from social welfare are households of two adults and more than three children.  Such households receive two adult rates of payment and payments of &euro;29.80 per week for each dependent child.  A family renting in Limerick or Dublin city centres will also receive rent allowance of between &euro;800 and &euro;1,000 per month.  If one compares the income of such a household with the minimum wage, it is easy to envisage that the family may have a social welfare package, including rent allowance, of between &euro;29,000 and &euro;31,000.  One of the steps I took on becoming Minister was to reinstate the minimum wage to ensure a distinction between it and social welfare rates.  The large number of people in receipt of the single rate of jobseeker's allowance, which stands at &euro;188 per week, can see there is a large differential between social welfare and being in a paying job.<\/p> <p>In talking about a family with two adults and more than three or four children, we are talking about a significant amount of income flowing into the house.

I want to be clear.  The reasons people get different social welfare payments is because they have an entitlement or because they have particular needs within their family which generate additional payments.<\/p><p>  In last year's budget, I looked at, and I will continue to look at, the issue of multiple payments.  We had a situation, for example, where some people on CE schemes were getting double payments.  The system could not afford that.  Any cut is difficult and painful for the people concerned.<\/p><p>  The Senator has emphasised her concern with regard to carers.  This concern is shared by all parties.  However, it must be borne in mind when looking at the statistics that some of the people who are getting a series of additional payments are getting them because within the home they are looking after children with a special need - which we want them to do - and the State is recompensing them for that work.  Therefore, in discussing this issue, we need to be aware of the different categories of families receiving payments and supports from my Department.  Carers do a great job for people who require a full-time carer, which is the criterion for getting a carer's allowance.  It is important we have a knowledgeable discussion about how some families might have a profile of higher levels of payment.  A big concern relates to the rent allowance and we have talked about how we might reform that.  However, there are other additional payments some families get for special circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600019#S00500","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1348659600,"counter":125,"content":"<p>There is another question related to that.

Operation Lifestyle and Assets is a pilot project directed towards individuals whose lifestyle and displays of wealth or assets are not commensurate with social welfare dependency.  In my own constituency, and I am sure in Deputy O'Dea's too, there are a number of individuals who, while claiming social welfare, seem to enjoy assets and lifestyles not consistent with that.  That is being run with the support of the Revenue Commissioners.  We have an operation in the taxi rental sector to ensure that taxi drivers are registered for PRSI and taxation.<\/p><p>  Operation Narnia was an investigation, undertaken by the special investigation unit in conjunction with Customs and Excise, into an individual who has been in receipt of jobseeker's allowance and who was alleged to have been in receipt of the proceeds of significant cigarette smuggling.  Operation Garden focused on garden nurseries to ensure that people employed in that industry are registered for PRSI and taxation and are not working and claiming at the same time.  Operation Credit concerned self-employed people to see if there were any issues with regard to concurrent working and claiming.  The townscape project involves feet on the street, where inspectors go into an area, for example a commercial street or an industrial estate, and check with employers that everybody in their employ is registered for PRSI and taxation.  In a lot of cases, people will say that they only started work an hour ago and are not on the books yet.  Nonetheless, it sends out a very strong message and has been very strongly supported, I am happy to say, by employers who are delighted to see the Department doing this.

That compares with 10,300 reports for the same period last year.  Members of the public are very anxious to support social welfare reform.  People value, in particular, our payments to pensioners and they want to make sure that pensioners are not left at a loss because other people are scamming the system.  There is a general social consensus on that.  <\/p><p>  The control savings target for 2012 is &euro;645 million.  We are reviewing 985,000 individual social welfare claims.

However, I wish to stress to all committee members that this refers to the prevention of expenditure which would have happened had we not got these systems in place.  Unfortunately, I cannot present these as savings to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.  I can only say that our expenditure levels are lower as a consequence.  Some money can be repaid to the Department but because often the people involved have a social welfare income, we are limited by law in what we can make them pay back.  This is an issue that my Department is examining, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  <\/p><p>  Regarding Deputy Griffin's question on child benefit, the Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the issue of who makes tax returns.  I have met them to discuss this matter.  I am awaiting the final report by the advisory group on child benefit and am sure that group will have something to say on the matter too.  The trend in Ireland has been that self-employed people use the Revenue on-line service, ROS, to file their income tax returns.  Many people in the PAYE system do not file a tax return at all but I believe there is merit in their doing so. However, there are different views on the issue in the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, in terms of the administrative burden involved.  In order to do what the Deputy spoke about, we would need a tax return to be filed by those in receipt of the child benefit payment.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy's constituent's suggestion of introducing a discount card for travel is one I had not heard of before.  Earlier we had a discussion of the value of free travel.  I mentioned to a colleague, Senator Moloney from south Kerry, that the fact that our pensioners can travel around the country is greatly appreciated by traders and hoteliers in places like Killarney.  Those in the hospitality sector appreciate the value of the golden years travel and the business it generates.  We must bear in mind that a scheme of free travel, particularly for pensioners, encourages them to be active, to be out and about in their own country and to enjoy some leisure breaks.  People from Killarney may be in Dublin and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  There are lots of clubs for older people who travel together and I value the scheme.  However, as I explained earlier, we are reviewing various features and looking at some issues that the operators have with the scheme.  Perhaps we can return to the issue at a later stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012092600020#T00300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1348660200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and her officials for briefing the committee.

I welcome Mr. Maurice McQuillan, humanitarian manager at Tr&oacute;caire, Ms Jane-Ann McKenna, head of office at M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, who has previously appeared before the committee, and Dr. Simon Collins, chairman, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res.<\/p><p>  The committee has been kept informed by both organisations of the gravity of the situation in the region of South Kordofan and the Blue Nile area in particular.  We are deeply concerned about the need to alleviate the humanitarian situation by ensuring unhindered humanitarian access.  A ceasefire and moves by Sudan and South Sudan to resolve outstanding issues between them are essential if longer term stability is to be restored.  Members will be aware that the joint committee wrote to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, at the end of July endorsing specific recommendations as proposed by Tr&oacute;caire.  The T&aacute;naiste has assured the committee that he shares our concerns and that he will continue to emphasise the urgent need for humanitarian access to civilians and supports the recommendations which I referred to.  I know all present will welcome the fact that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided &euro;6 million in terms of humanitarian support this year and is ready to provide further support to humanitarian organisations working on the ground.  I also raised the issue of the Blue Nile and what is happening in South Sudan with Baroness Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, at the foreign affairs chairpersons' meeting in Cyprus two weeks ago.  The High Representative stated there is huge concern about what is happening and work in the region is ongoing.  <\/p><p>  Members of the committee who travelled to Ethiopia last year will recall the refugees from the Blue Nile region with whom we met at the border with South Sudan and their harrowing stories of what they had to endure in the Togo refugee camp.  That is almost 12 months ago.  The situation has deteriorated since then.  The committee was also told some time ago at an informal meeting with a priest involved in Tr&oacute;caire of the deteriorating situation in the region owing to a conflict in regard to petroleum.  We heard harrowing stories of what the refugees had to endure, their long journeys to refugee camps and the problems they experienced with the army and so on in terms of human rights.<\/p><p>  The committee will hear first from the witness from Tr&oacute;caire and then from the witnesses from M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, following which I will allow questions from members.  Before I invite the groups to make their presentations, I draw their attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  However, if directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. <\/p><p>  I now invite Mr. Maurice McQuillan to address the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012092600002#A00400","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348666200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>When I landed on 1 June last at Yida refugee camp on the airstrip in Unity State in the north of South Sudan I was lucky to meet Sr. Lucy Rocio, a Mexican-born Comboni missionary sister in her 30s who was heading back up through Yida to Gidel hospital in South Kordofan.  When I asked her about the situation in Gidel hospital she gave me a plethora of statistics.  However, her eyes lit up when she talked about her special patient for the past two months, a 12 year old boy called Kalo who was the victim of an Antonov bomb and who, rather than having the usual type of shrapnel injuries that would go with that, was severely burned by the radiant heat when the bomb landed near him.  Sr. Rocio described to me the stench she and the staff endured as they tried to change his bandages and cut away the dead tissue and rebandage him.  She said he was one of the most stoic children she had ever nursed and that while he rarely cries, changing the bandages is sometimes too much for him and he and the staff cry.  Towards the end of June, when I was back in Ireland I received a short message informing me that Kalo had died.  He went into shock and although they tried to keep him alive and urged him not to give up he could not hang on.  Members will see a picture of Sr. Rocio and Kalo on the front of the short handout which I have provided.  That is the reality of life and death for Sr. Rocio and the people of the Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan.<\/p> <p>Indiscriminate aerial bombing means that children get killed.<\/p><p> I will give a quick update on the current position and refer to the two maps in the presentation.  On 9 July 2011, south Sudanese independence was declared, with border demarcation disputes continuing after that, including disputes over oil revenues.  Not everybody is aware that a state of active violent conflict continues within the borders of north Sudan, particularly the Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan.  The conflict is primarily between the Sudanese Government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North.  Since our last informal meeting with some members of this committee, the public profile of the position in South Kordofan has changed but the reality for most families living there has not.  On the same day as our last meeting, Baroness Valerie Amos, head of the UN office for humanitarian co-ordination and assistance, issued a statement expressing the UN's deep concern about the deteriorating position in Sudan, particularly in South Kordofan and Blue Nile, where hundreds of thousands of people remain trapped in the conflict zone, with little access to food, water, shelter and medical services.<\/p><p> I considered a number of statistics in this regard and according to the UN population census of 2010, the population of South Kordofan is 2.5 million people.  A conflict such as this causes people to flee, becoming refugees outside the country or internally displaced people within.  The UN estimates that the population affected by the conflict stands at 520,000 people, with the total number of refugees in south Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia from South Kordofan estimated at 252,000.  The number of internally displaced people within the Nuba Mountains is roughly estimated at 70,000.<\/p><p> This leaves 198,000 of the affected population within the Nuba Mountains unaccounted for.  These are the people who have been badly affected by the ongoing conflict, and they are feeling the effects of the aerial bombardment, current flooding, high malnutrition rates and the associated food insecurity.  These men, women and children are affected by the 27 separate incidents logged of serious conflict in the past two months, which range from shelling to aerial bombardment and open conflict between the warring parties.  As a result of hunger, many of these people had to eat the seeds they should have been planting in June and July this year.  They are the people who were afraid to go into the fields and plant whatever seeds they had not eaten because they feared the Antonov planes would bomb or fighter jets would strafe the open fields.  The harvest has been severely affected not by drought or crop disease, as in other areas of Africa, but rather people's fear of going into the open because of a sustained bombing campaign.  The Famine Early Warning System, FEWS-NET, estimates that over 200,000 people now face a crisis at emergency levels with regard to food insecurity.  That position will deteriorate as long as the conflict persists and current restrictions on humanitarian access continue.  Tr&oacute;caire is working with these people in the Nuba Mountains and we want the Government to help them.<\/p><p> There are photographs detailing what Tr&oacute;caire is doing in the presentation.  Since June 2011, Tr&oacute;caire has been working with the diocese of El Obeid to keep Gidel hospital in the Nuba Mountains open and deal with food insecurity in and around the area.  The first phase ran from June to January last year, with a budget of &euro;1 million.  Tr&oacute;caire supplied programme management and practical logistical support to the diocesan staff, as well as co-ordinating the fund-raising effort.  The first phase focused on medical supplies for the hospital, food and cooking utensils for the sick and wounded in the hospital.  There were also limited food supplies for general distribution in the Gidel area.<\/p><p> The second phase, running up to this December, involves scaling up the budget to &euro;2 million.  Relief flights with medical supplies have continued and we are also providing 188 metric tonnes of food, hygiene and cooking items to approximately 38,000 people.  This is a drop in the ocean when one considers the 500,000 people affected by the conflict and the large-scale operation south of the border.  For the 38,000 men, women and children, it is a very important drop in the ocean.  We are calling for greater access for larger humanitarian organisations in South Kordofan.<\/p><p> This is probably one of the most complex, difficult and risky operations that Tr&oacute;caire has been involved with since Biafra.  Many areas in South Kordofan are in open, violent conflict, and the big issue within South Kordofan is access.  All the big humanitarian agencies have either been thrown out or denied access, and the added value we can bring comes from church structures and facilities, which remain in place, as well as committed and dedicated professional medical staff in Gidel hospital.  It is nonetheless difficult.  This summer I travelled to the UN headquarters in New York for confidential talks at a high level.  I am well aware that what we are doing is a risky business but I am convinced we are doing the right thing.  The bottom line from a humanitarian perspective is that saving lives and alleviating suffering in and around Gidel hospital must take precedence.<\/p><p> What can the joint committee, which has been supportive of the efforts to date, do about South Kordofan?  The committee can request the appropriate Minister to raise the Sudan issue as an agenda item at the EU Council foreign affairs meeting on 15 October.  That would be a continuation of the call by the EU Council on 23 July.  The committee can also request that the Minister maintain pressure, as necessary, at both general affairs and foreign affairs meetings throughout the Irish Presidency of the EU from January 2013.<\/p><p> The committee can request the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, in his role as chairman of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, to advocate to fellow members with regard to the opening of South Kordofan to humanitarian access for both the UN agencies in the north as well as agencies such as Tr&oacute;caire and other international non-governmental organisation which can support and assist families from the north and south.  The committee can also continue to advocate with the Sudanese Government for the full implementation of the recent memorandum of understanding for humanitarian access to South Kordofan and Blue Nile.<\/p><p> Committee members can engage directly with parliamentarians and colleagues in the European Parliament through the various pan-European parties so that the Sudanese issue and the current humanitarian crisis in South Kordofan is placed on the agenda of the equivalent of foreign affairs parliamentary committees across Europe.  They can also engage directly as parliamentarians and humanitarians with counterparts in the US and other G8 and G20 countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China, asking for practical support in exerting whatever influence is possible on the two parties to the conflict to complete the political negotiations under the UN Security Council resolution.  The fighting must be stopped before humanitarian access becomes possible, and that leaves the last step of political negotiations, which can be protracted.  Our experience in Northern Ireland indicates that the first step is to stop the fighting.<\/p><p> We are talking about 500,000 people affected by a crisis, with approximately 200,000 unaccounted for in South Kordofan.  In the 21st century we cannot stand by and accept the indiscriminate bombing of civilians.  We should not stand by and see hunger being used as a weapon of war.  We must not tolerate more horrific deaths of children like Kalo.  I do not apologise for relating how his injuries were described by Sister Rocio, as he had third degree burns to 40% of his body.  Instead of the beautiful black skin that is characteristic of his people, his skin was a melted mass of white, red, black and green colours.  It was green because the tissue was so gangrenous.  Sister Rocio attempted to nurse him back to health but he died on 20 June this year at 10 a.m., with his crime being to stand 5,000 feet below an Antonov bomber when it indiscriminately released its load.  We are asking the committee to engage on the South Kordofan issue in order to prevent more deaths of children like Kalo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012092600002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice McQuillan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348666800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. McQuillan, for your very humane contribution on behalf of the people of South Sudan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012092600004#C00100","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348666800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us to this meeting.  As it is our first time to appear before the committee I will begin with a short overview of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF, and the type of work it does.  I will then discuss our current intervention in South Sudan and, in particular, the humanitarian crisis currently faced by the refugees who have fled the Blue Nile and South Kordofan states.  I am joined by our chairman, Dr. Simon Collins, who have been with MSF for over eight years.  He has spent over two and a half years in South Sudan.<\/p><p>  M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res is an international emergency medical aid organisation that was established over 40 years ago.  It has been established in Ireland since 2006.  Our primary objective is providing emergency life-saving care to victims of war, conflict and any disease outbreaks.  We often work in places where there are no other aid organisations or where organisations choose not to go.  We are independent, non-political, non-religious and primarily privately funded.  We received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999 for our work.  The key principle of MSF is to speak out on behalf of those who have no voice, particularly to speak about what we know and what we have witnessed on the ground.  As we implement all the programmes ourselves we are in a key position to relay the messages we hear from our patients in the hospitals.<\/p><p>  MSF is present in over 65 countries throughout the world, including places such as Syria, Somalia and South Sudan.  Our annual budget is approximately &euro;900 million per year.  Thousands of Irish donors are funding our projects overseas and every year we send out Irish volunteers to the fields, including doctors, surgeons and nurses.  Currently, there are two Irish expats working with us in South Sudan with this refugee crisis.<\/p><p>  One of the reasons I mention the size of MSF operations is to put the refugee crisis in South Sudan into context.  This is the largest MSF emergency intervention this year.  We have allocated a budget of over &euro;20 million for the camps in Upper Nile and Unity states alone.  As members will see from the briefing paper I have circulated, there are almost 170,000 refugees scattered across five refugee camps in the region.  Today, all of these refugees are 100% dependent on humanitarian aid for their survival.  The health situation of the refugees has varied from poor to catastrophic over the last few months and it has been nearly a year since they first began to arrive.  This is due to the difficulty of the situation, the insufficiency of the international aid effort and the fact that the camps have yet to provide adequate refuge for them.  At present, we are running hospitals, mobile clinics and outreach services in all five camps treating malnutrition, infections and disease, as well as running vaccination campaigns.  The gravity of the situation has pushed MSF to work in other areas including locating, treating and distributing water, which is not usually our key response.<\/p><p>  In July, we conducted a mortality survey in Yida camp, which is in Unity state.  This showed a mortality rate of four deaths per 10,000 people per day among children under five years of age.  This is twice the emergency threshold.  That means approximately five children were dying per day in Yida, mainly from diarrhoea and severe infections.  These are treatable illnesses with the right care.  A nutrition survey carried out in Batil camp at the same time found that nearly 50% of the children under three years old were malnourished.  Both of these surveys indicate a catastrophic health situation in the camps.  The camps are ill prepared and lack sufficient resources to deal with the high level of need that exists.  In light of this, MSF, along with other organisations, has had to scale up its response immensely over the last two months to bring the situation back to what is now considered a normal emergency level.  However, our medical teams continue to see the consequences of inadequate aid provision, particularly in water and infrastructure.  This can be seen in the recent hepatitis E outbreak which happened in all the camps in the Upper Nile area.<\/p><p>  For the refugee camps within South Sudan the only blockages to access are remoteness and logistical constraints.  It is a notoriously difficult place in which to work.  It is expensive and it is extremely difficult to get the right supplies and transport them in.  All organisations, including MSF, have been taken by surprise by the sheer number of people crossing the border and the scale of the crisis.  The response from the international community has been slow and inadequate.  Relief operations must now be scaled up and maintained.  Any reduction in the response or change in the situation on the ground could tip the conditions in the camps back to catastrophic levels again.  Contingency plans must also be put in place to deal with new arrivals, which are highly anticipated at the end of the rainy season in the next month or two.<\/p><p>  I have spoken mainly about the precarious situation within the camps in the Upper Nile and Unity states.  However, the situation in the Blue Nile and South Kordofan must be mentioned as well.  Unfortunately, we cannot say much about that situation.  Essentially, we do not know what is happening on the other side of the border, particularly in the Blue Nile state.  We are unable to work there.  All we know is that 170,000 people have fled and have recounted harrowing stories about the level of violence and conflict they have encountered in their regions and homes.  We must ask why independent humanitarian aid organisations are not allowed to work in this region and why nobody knows what is happening on the ground.  MSF is deeply concerned about the health and safety of the people in both the Blue Nile and South Kordofan.  More must be done to ensure that independent humanitarian relief is given to those who need it most.<\/p><p>  I ask the committee to raise the current crisis in South Sudan, which I detailed in the briefing paper I circulated, and the need for independent humanitarian aid in the Blue Nile and South Kordofan states as a matter of priority for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012092600004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane-Ann McKenna"},{"type":"speech","time":1348666800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I compliment them on the briefing papers they provided and on the content of their presentations.  Both the Chairman and the two witnesses used the word \"gravity\" on a number of occasions.  The presentations are very graphic regarding the serious situation in that region which is, unfortunately, deteriorating since July 2011.  The problems of access, displaced persons, unaccounted- for persons and the food insecurity facing so many hundreds of thousands of people are grave issues and they must be amplified in every forum, be it through parliaments or by Ministers in the different forums in which they have an opportunity to participate.<\/p><p>  The requests made by Tr&oacute;caire and MSF are very reasonable.

What are the primary stumbling blocks in the process?  Is it the funding of Nuba rebels by South Sudan and ethnic militias by Sudan and is this on the agenda of the talks?

Is it possible to use more persuasive diplomatic methods to convince the warring factions, with Northern Sudan being a serious perpetrator, of the error of their ways?  Appealing to their better nature does not appear to work.  I am not happy about going down the road of sanctions but someone must be supplying them with materials to carry out warfare.  It may be helpful to know who is supplying material, for how long and who is providing funding.  Across Europe, funds are hard to come by, particularly for one country and in light of the amount of funding required for an operation of this nature.  Can the witnesses give us any useful information in our attempts to pursue the matter with the T&aacute;naiste and the relevant international authorities with a view to alleviating some of the negative impact?  This is separate to the point about humanitarian aid in what is an extremely dangerous place.

I now have a clear understanding of the situation from the maps provided.  To a layperson, it is a complicated area.  As an Irish citizen, I felt the Sudanese issue was portrayed on television and radio as being resolved, in that 99% of people in South Sudan agreed in a plebiscite to declare independence.  I was mystified by people declaring their independence when borders have not yet been defined.  It is a criticism of the international community, which progressed the independence programme, that people were voting to create a country when the borders were not yet defined.  I presume it is within the border region that humanitarian difficulties arise.  The reason for this is oil, the lack of borders and the body of men and women from the region described as the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North, SPLM-N.  According to the maps, they control much of the area in the mountains being strafed by Sudanese jets.  To what extent is this a continuing war between Sudan and the forces of the militias operating in south Kordofan?  Is there an up-to-date position on the ongoing talks in Addis Ababa between the presidents to alleviate the problems?  Apparently the issues are border demarcation, creating a safe demilitarised zone, citizenship rights and the allocation of Sudan's national debt.<\/p><p>  I praise people who move into such terribly dangerous arenas.

Those of us in the West, who live in houses, find it hard to imagine 55,000 people living under canvas in very poor terrain, which is prone to flooding.  There are also other camps with similar problems.<\/p> <p>As a country, we have put &euro;30 million into the Sudanese region.  Recently, we have been giving smaller sums for particular projects.  As a small country with economic difficulties, we should be applauded for the work we are doing.<\/p><p> Often when one meet delegations such as these, one almost feels panic that people will die unless we resolve complex problems.  Along with M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&eacute;res and Tr&oacute;caire, who else is out there?  Presumably, they are not the only humanitarian groups in the region.  Am I right in presuming there are thousands of other volunteers and agencies from around the world, from the United Nations to the African Union?  Is it a particularly western activity to provide aid?  Do very profitable and economically viable African nations have agencies like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Tr&oacute;caire or whatever?  Are we talking in a vacuum?  Is there a wider picture at which we must look of other countries doing as much if not more than what we do as a tiny little island country in economic decline?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012092600005#D00400","speaker":"1030","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348668000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I will be brief because many of the comments I would make have been made.  I pay tribute to the delegates for their presentations and, more significantly, to their colleagues who are working in the field at great personal risk.  I think Mr. McQuillan said it was akin to Biafra which was a highly dangerous situation.<\/p><p>  I am concerned by the indiscriminate nature of what is happening, in particular the bombings.  It is terrible to see young children being put in the firing line and innocent civilians being killed as a consequence of the indiscriminate approach.  Civil war can be very difficult.  That is very pertinent to an issue raised at this committee previously in regard to the arms trade treaty.  Have we written to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and if so, have we received a response in that regard?  We asked that he would do everything he could to achieve completion of, and agreement on, that.  Full agreement was narrowly prevented by the US, in particular, and by Russia, to a lesser extent, at the negotiations last June.<\/p><p>  There was a field mission last year.  The Department raised the issue of the peace dividend and the need for some post-war development in the area of schools, health clinics, safe water, infrastructure and so on.  If one's life is at risk, and using Maslow's hierarchy of needs, survival is what is important.  When one is at that stage, all these other aspects are not the focus.  Is anything happening in that area which would give some optimism that stability can be provided?  <\/p><p>  I formally propose that we run with the recommendations made to us and that we request the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to raise the Sudan situation as an agenda item at the EU Council, that it is pursued during our Presidency of the EU and that he raises it in his capacity of chairman of the OSCE.

I was impressed by the resilience of those people.  We spent several hours with them and saw the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees doing some excellent work.<\/p><p>  One would have to reflect on the fact that we saw canvas tents suitable for approximately three people with maybe 12 or 15 people in them.  People, especially young girls, expressed their worry and discomfort with the situation they were experiencing.  It is necessary that we do all the things we do here but one cannot fully comprehend the situation without being there and talking to people about their experiences.  All one man wanted to do was to get back to his village and open his business again.  Other people did not know where members of their families were and whether they were alive.  They said everything was broken up because the troops came and people just scattered.  If somebody was away when people had to flee, they did not know what happened to that person.  That is the human aspect of it.  <\/p><p>  It is important to keep people's attention on this because attention will move away from a difficult situation as people get accustomed to hearing the same story.  We had experience of that with the Troubles in the North of Ireland when people said, \"Not the North again\" even though people were dying.  One must be very careful to ensure the subject is fully understood and is kept in the focus of international attention.  What is the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees doing in the two camps mentioned?  What involvement has it?  It was very good to us when we visited the camp in Ethiopia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012092600006#E00400","speaker":"1056"},{"type":"speech","time":1348668000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegations from Tr&oacute;caire and, in particular, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&eacute;res, who are paying their first visit to the committee.  I am sure it will be the first of many visits.  The picture painted was a very human one of great suffering and deprivation and one which must be of grave concern to us all.  I very much applaud the amazing work which has been done over the years in areas of conflict by organisations like Tr&oacute;caire and M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&eacute;res.  We should never forget the wonderful volunteers who work in very difficult circumstances to try to improve the lot of the less fortunate on our behalf.<\/p><p>  The picture painted is particularly grim, with little sign of improvement.  The number of people who are unaccounted for, the 200,000 people who are in dire circumstances and the inability of people to sow crops for fear of being killed in the fields is intolerable.  It is a very complex political situation which I do not understand.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Neville gave a very human description of his visit there.  Is any progress being made?  What is happening on a day-to-day basis on the ground to try to improve the situation and bring an end to the violence and killing?  <\/p><p>  I support Senator Walsh in urging us to adopt the proposals put before us.  I have no doubt the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will take the opportunity to raise the situation at every forum in which he has influence.  We must ask, however, if that is enough.  Where are the more powerful nations and what are they doing?  We have seen figures that indicate when it comes to putting their hands in their pockets, some of the wealthier nations lag behind what we in Ireland are prepared to do for the less fortunate.  What should we do about that to put pressure on the more powerful nations to play their part in bringing an end to the conflict and improving the lot of the people in South Sudan?<\/p><p>  I thank the witnesses for a very insightful presentation.  The danger is that some of these areas of conflict can go off the radar from time to time when difficulties arise elsewhere and the media lose interest.  It is important we retain focus on what is happening on the ground and I wish the witnesses continued success and assure them of our continued support in their work for the less fortunate.<\/p> <p>Members are well briefed because we have had a number of informal meetings on this in recent months.  George Clooney highlighted the situation when he protested in the US Congress in Washington after his visit to the region.  The situation is difficult in South Sudan; it is hard for NGOs to even traverse the region because of the terrain, which makes it difficult to get aid in and out for those unfortunate people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012092600006#E00500","speaker":"1118","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348668600,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I suspect the members of the committee are probably more expert politically and economically than any of us so they might be better placed than a group of humanitarians to answer some of the questions themselves.<\/p><p>  Deputy Smith asked about numbers.  In the paper I distributed I restricted the information to some photographs and text.  I could have given a ten-page paper but if anyone wants further detail, I will supply it.<\/p><p>  Deputy Crowe asked some interesting questions, particularly about this being a process.  That is why we want to keep it on the agenda.  This is not a matter that will be solved today or tomorrow.  When I went to New York during the summer I got a clear impression from the highest levels that this was the case.  That is why we are keen to keep humanitarian efforts that are happening there on the radar, particularly in South Kordofan, tricky though it may be.  It will not be solved in a hurry and that is why we must keep it on the agenda.  I do not want to go into detail on the question of its being a risky business in this forum but I would be happy to follow up elsewhere.<\/p><p>  There was a question about the SPLM, a movement, and the SPLA, an army.  They are closely linked.  The SPLM-North fought with the SPLM during the civil war but they are separate and have different aspirations.  To an extent they see themselves as northerners but not under the present circumstances.  It is complicated.<\/p><p>  The Government of Sudan controls the air and the SPLA controls the ground.  Economically, the allies of North Sudan provide them with money so they can buy jets and the allies of the SPLA provide them with money so they have better ground equipment.  As a result there is a stalemate, with the SPLA North winning all ground battles but unable to advance much further because the air is controlled by the Sudanese Government.<\/p><p>  There is room for optimism on a mediator following the memorandum of understanding for humanitarian access to South Kordofan and the Blue Nile.  It is one thing having a memorandum, but it is another to have it implemented.  It is easy to sign up to it during the rainy season when very little can happen anyway.  The full implementation of the memorandum and the follow-up will be crucial, but there has already been some rhetoric that may indicate a pulling back from it.<\/p><p>  The levers are economic in the north and from reports we can see some changes.  We must then look at who has the economic influence.  It is no different from many other areas of Africa.<\/p><p>  To finish on an optimistic note, conflict is not endemic or historical in this region, particularly South Kordofan.  There are animists, Christians and Muslims who traditionally have lived together in peace and harmony in one village.  That is part of the tragedy; politics and political aspirations have pushed this to the forefront when traditionally people have lived together quite happily.  That gives us room for hope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012092600007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice McQuillan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348668600,"counter":167,"content":"<p>As Mr. McQuillan said in response to Deputy Durkan's question on the security situation and the different factions, we are not in a position to comment on what is happening at that level.  Although these things are happening, our priority is that we must be on the ground to treat those affected by this.  That is our key priority: regardless of where they are, we should have access to them.  I have highlighted the camp situation in South Sudan because we have full access there but the international community has been slow to respond and put in place the necessary resources for those who are there now, and have been there for up to a year.  There are moves under way outside the humanitarian perspective but there is still a huge amount of work to be done to alleviate suffering.<\/p><p>  Deputy Byrne alluded to some of the other organisations working on the ground.  We are in the camps in the Upper Nile region; we are the largest medical actor there and we run all the medical activities in the different camps.  The UNHCR is responsible for camp management and has been co-ordinating with its implementing partners but we have come across the issue of commitments made by implementing partners not being fulfilled, such as the commitments for water and sanitation infrastructure.  That is a result of the implementing partners not having enough resources or funding to carry out the work they have committed to.  As a result there is a backlog in service provision and we stepped in to fill the gap.<\/p><p>  Senator Walsh spoke about the development element of South Sudan a year after independence and asked if the region itself could develop in a sustainable fashion.  The terrain where the camps are located is very inhospitable.  It is also difficult to deal with 170,000 people.<\/p> <p>That is the reason we mentioned the contingency planning element.  Although we know there may be more refugees coming after the rainy season, there is still no contingency planning being done to consider where the 170,000 people will go in advance of the next rainy season.  Since June a number of the camps have become flooded and as a direct result we have seen the outbreak of disease.  Contingency planning is needed.  We in MSF have noted that South Sudan has been in a constant state of emergency for the past 20 to 30 years.  There is a need for an effort both on the development side and on the emergency side, which must happen in parallel.  With the onset of independence it became evident that development could really ramp up, which is great, but it should not be forgotten that emergency needs must be met as well.  We advocate that there should still be sufficient funds invested in the emergency element to deal with the daily ongoing crises as well as the development aspect.<\/p><p> One of the reasons that scale-up has been slow is that a number of the organisations working on the ground are engaged in more developmental activities and so it is very difficult to switch gears automatically into emergency mode.  We know it is difficult for people to engage in more emergency activity at ground level.  I know Senator Michael Mullins referred to other more powerful governments that could potentially have more influence in this region.  One of the reasons it is important to highlight this to the Irish Government is that MSF is known as an independent neutral organisation which is impartial to government influence.  We recognise that Irish Aid has been supporting us.  Irish Aid has a number of programmes and is very independent in terms of the aid that it distributes on the ground.  It is key for us, when discussing these issues with the relevant governments, that there is no agenda arising from the situation on the ground and that we are advocating from a humanitarian perspective for the priorities that need to be met.  There should be no other agenda in terms of the situation in the north and south of Sudan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012092600007#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane-Anne McKenna","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348669200,"counter":169,"content":"<p>May we have a short briefing on the current situation in Syria?

Members will have received copies of our PowerPoint presentation, which I will go through now.  The first slide sets out a brief history of the MAN project, what has been achieved to date in this regard, and our view on how it has affected public policy.  Unfortunately, parts of the slides are obscured from view.<\/p> <p>There is not a huge amount of detail available on them, but, as well as being an aid for members, they help to remind me of what I am saying.<\/p><p> The company that runs the State's metropolitan area network, MAN, infrastructure is e|net.  There are 94 such networks in towns and cities across Ireland.  They were deployed in areas in respect of which it was agreed between the State and the European Union that there was a market failure in the provision of telecommunications infrastructure.  They operate on what is termed a wholesale open-access model.  The critical point is that e|net does not provide services directly for consumers, which means people cannot contact us by telephone in order to purchase access to broadband services.  That is why one will never see e|net logos, brands or advertising throughout the country.  This may be the reason people are of the view that there is a low profile to the business.  It is a wholesale business and our customers are the telecommunications operators.  We focus very much on ensuring the latter provide services on the metropolitan area networks.<\/p><p> The company's headquarters are located in Limerick and it employs 51 people.  That number has risen significantly in the past couple of years.  I will not go into too much detail on the history of the company.  We have, however, been operating the metropolitan area network infrastructure since 2004, when we won the first licence to do so for a period of 15 years.  We won another licence in 2006 to service a further 66 towns.  In 2008 and 2009 we conducted an analysis of the impact of the metropolitan area networks on the first 27 towns in which they were put in place.  We discovered that in the five years before the networks were put in place, the towns involved were winning approximately 22% of new IDA Ireland-foreign direct investment jobs.  In the three years after they were up and running the average figure in this regard was above 80%.  The impact of metropolitan area networks in attracting foreign direct investment and related jobs to towns such as those to which I refer is significant.<\/p><p> One of the points I would make on e|net and the metropolitan area networks is that I do not believe the latter have solved all of Ireland's broadband problems.  In addition, I am not stating Ireland does not have problems with broadband.  However, the networks have been a significant policy success in the context of the increasing competition in regional areas, reducing the cost of telecommunications in these areas and bringing jobs to them.<\/p><p> I will now comment on how the networks operate.  The company -  e|net - sits in the middle of a complex operational arrangement.  Where we sell services to licensed telecommunications operators, we provide them on the metropolitan area networks.  We also use other networks connected to the metropolitan area networks to Dublin in order to ensure the traffic on the metropolitan area networks actually gets to the capital and onto the Internet.  The networks remain at all times in the ownership of the State.  Technically, ownership of each metropolitan area network rests with the relevant local authority.  Therefore, ownership of the Cork MAN rests with Cork City Council and Cork County Council.  The networks are publicly owned.  We have spent considerable amounts of money on maintaining and extending them and such extensions also remain in public ownership.  We have actually built the equivalent of two new metropolitan area networks with moneys procured from our own shareholder funds, but these remain in State ownership.  That is part of the return to the State.  There is also the fact that the networks have been enhanced to a considerable degree since we assumed responsibility for them.<\/p><p> We have a very strong policy partnership with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  We are obliged to operate the metropolitan area network infrastructure in an open-access, carrier-neutral way to ensure all operators are treated in the same way.  Our achievements in the areas of jobs, competitiveness and the cost of telecommunications are demonstrable.  It is a very useful model and platform through which policy can be developed.  It is our opinion that metropolitan area networks and e|net, in partnership with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, have done a good job in dealing with the policy challenges in 2004.  We stand ready to help and provide support in dealing with the policy challenges which emerged in 2009.<\/p><p> On how e|net fits into the telecommunications market, if members look at the top part of the diagram on the slide on display, they will see that we are all consumers of communications services.  We all use broadband and actually use the communications market for many more purposes than used to be the case.  For example, 20 years ago people probably only used it to make telephone calls.  Then they began to use fax machines and after that they stated to access the Internet via dial-up connections.  Most of us now spend a large part of our time on these networks.  We use them not just for telephony but also to access broadband services.  The metropolitan area networks are also increasingly being used for entertainment purposes.  UPC, one of the major cable TV operators, is distributing its entertainment content via the networks.  This is going to become much more common.  These are the services that are being deployed over the networks.<\/p><p> Between us and the services to which I refer are the service providers.  Members will have heard of most of these operators, both large and small.  We have named a few of them - Eircom, Vodafone, O2, 3, UPC, Imagine, Cable and Wireless, Verizon, BT and Smart - on the slide on display.  Members can see beneath that list of names a much smaller group of companies and entities which actually operate networks.  There are a lot fewer networks in Ireland than there are operators.  Networks are critical; they are the roads and the operators are the trucks.  There are plenty of truck operators, but there are not as many road networks.  In Ireland there are five networks of varying geographical extent.  The primary network is that operated by Eircom.  This is an incumbent network which theoretically reaches every home and business in the State.  BT's network is extensive in Dublin and also runs along the railway lines.  Electric Ireland, in the form of ESB Telecoms, ESBT, has a telecommunications network which runs along its main high voltage infrastructure.  UPC has a cable TV network that is extensive but only in the major urban areas.  Infrastructure is provided by e|net in 94 regional towns, in most of which the only other network available would be that provided by Eircom.  However, this is provided on a different basis.  Underneath this again there is a great deal of State-owned infrastructure that is very useful in deploying telecommunications infrastructure.  For example, CIE can put fibre in place along its rail network, Electric Ireland has it across its electricity network, Bord G&aacute;is has a telecommunications subsidiary, Aurora, the NRA has ducting which is very useful for telecommunications networks and there is a company called Shared Access which works with the OPW to provide telecommunications infrastructure.<\/p><p> There is a complicated layer of telecommunications in Ireland and e|net is very much focused on the provision of telecommunication networks for other telecommunications service providers.  The next slide contains a list of some of its customers.  If someone is operating in any of the 94 regional towns to which I refer and accessing any of these services, he or she is probably using a metropolitan area network without realising it.  I want to try to nail one of the myths that nobody uses the metropolitan area networks.  They support 3G mobile coverage, cable TV and normal mobile coverage.  Certain high profile retailers are connected to the networks and if one is making a credit card payment in one of their shops, the traffic in this regard is carried across them.  The networks are in the background and if we decided to switch them off in the morning - we have no intention of doing so - people would lose mobile signals, credit card payment details, TV signals, etc.  Their disappearance would be very noticeable.  As a result of the fact that e|net does not have a really recognisable brand and that the metropolitan area networks are often connected indirectly to consumers and businesses, what we do is not so noticeable.  This has been a problem for us as we have developed the business.  Many believe the networks are in the ground unused, that they are very expensive to use and so on, but that is not the case.  The cost of using them, benchmarked against that of any other fibre infrastructure anywhere in the world, is hugely competitive.  It is important to realise that metropolitan middle mile infrastructure, which is what the metropolitan area networks are, was not necessarily intended to bring directly connected fibre to every home and business in a particular town.  This infrastructure was put in place in order that all the different types of telecommunications services could be connected to it and that we could inject lower cost and higher performance into the networks through the use of that fibre.<\/p><p> I referred to jobs.  The next slide shows some of the regional, high value foreign direct investment companies connected to the metropolitan area networks.<\/p> <p>I will mention two, EA Games and Northern Trust, that announced jobs in recent weeks, which are end users of the MANs.  They will buy services from one of our customers.  We do not sell to EA Games or to any of those companies.  Our customers sell to those and we find that they enjoy those services.<\/p><p> A significant proportion of the public sector and public sector premises are using the MANs and have been able to reduce the cost of their communications significantly.  If the telecommunications costs of regional public sector entities were reduced by 10% to 15%, which we think the MANs may well be supported in doing, that alone would be enough to pay for the investment that was made in the MANs in terms of the original founding investment.  A great number of public sector entities are getting their communications services better and more cheaply than they did in the past.  That is as much as I want to say about e|net and the metropolitan area network infrastructure.<\/p><p> I may be telling members something they already know but I want to share my views on why we think broadband is important and why broadband as an area of policy is one that cannot simply be left to the market and forgotten about.  The most important aspect of broadband as a component of the economy is that it is a proven driver of economic growth.  We have a number of studies on a range of different, important and well-respected economic analyses - if members would like to read them, I have a booklet I can share with them - showing that high quality broadband will increase the economy somewhere between 1% and 2%.  I do not need to remind members that an extra 1% to 2% growth may well be the difference between our doing or not doing the IMF plan.  This is an engine for economic growth and that has proven to be the case.  If one thinks about why that is the case, one will note that many of the world's markets are moving online.  Members will know this as they purchase products online.  They buy tickets online.  The economy is moving online.  The better served this country is in that economy, the better it will perform in it.  We have some problems in this area.  We know that Ireland has an online balance of payments deficit.  Irish consumers buy much more online than Irish businesses sell online.  A business needs more communications infrastructure to sell online than a consumer needs to buy online.  Much of this comes down to the quality of the communications infrastructure, which is a critical component.<\/p><p> I would explain this by asking members to reflect on the building of canals in the 18th century, railways in the 19th century and electricity infrastructure in the 20th century, and communications infrastructure is the critical national infrastructure for the 21st century.  It will define the winners and the losers.  The most interesting point is that by the end of each of those centuries, every country had its critical national infrastructure but the countries which got it first and built it best derived the most and the longest lasting economic advantage from it.  The British built the canals first, the US built the railways first and they had a century of economic advantage from that, long after everybody else had caught up.  It is the same with communications infrastructure.  The countries that have the best communications infrastructure will attract the best communications jobs and companies, develop the strongest communications in the economy, and by the time all the other countries have an infrastructure to match, it will be too late.  We really believe that.<\/p><p> The interesting point about broadband is that it is not only about the economy.  There is barely an area of public policy that is not heavily affected by broadband and broadband quality.  To take the example of health care, the only way we will be able to deliver health care in the 21st century is outside the hospital.  We know that our hospitals cannot carry the number of sick people we will have in the 21st century.  We need to look after our patients at home much more and the only way we will be able to do that is by new medical communications technology and the only way we will be able to deliver that is through appropriate infrastructure.  The only way we can offer services like that is if those services are available on a ubiquitous basis.<\/p><p> Communications is a green technology in that we can significantly reduce our emissions through the use of technology such as video-conferencing and teleworking.  We can significantly make an impact towards reaching our emissions targets.<\/p><p> In education we are already rolling out at 100 Mbs, and the Minister has talked about industrial strength broadband in schools, and that has a significant impact on education.  The difference between reading Martin Luther King's speech on paper and seeing him on screen in a classroom giving that speech at the Washington Monument is transformational.<\/p><p> In terms of traffic on our roads, the gain that can be made is simple but powerful.  If we could reach a point at which people were working from home on one working day in 20 - that could consist of one worker in 20 who works permanently from home, or all workers working one day in 20 from home - it would take 5% off peak traffic loads.  Peak traffic loads define the size of the road network we need to build.  If we can reduce peak traffic loads by 5%, we would probably get a two- to three-year break in road traffic growth.  That is a significant economic break.  This stuff drives the economy.  It is critical for health care and education and has benefits in most public policy areas.  It is an area policy-makers cannot ignore and I do not believe they are.<\/p><p> It had been policy for a long time that communications and communications infrastructure was a matter for the private sector.  There is an important point in that respect.  We have spoken about the benefits to the economy and to the State of next generation broadband or top quality infrastructure but a strange pattern globally in telecommunications is that most of that benefit is not coming to the network service providers.<\/p><p> To return to the example of members, if they reflect on the volume of communications services and communications networks they use and the amount that is spent on those compared with when they used those networks only to make phone calls, economically the average customer spends about the same now when they are practically living on those networks compared with what they spent on them in the past.  For whatever reason and whoever is at fault, communications network service providers have not managed to earn any more revenue, despite the explosion in the use of their networks.  The members will know this.  They will know it from their bills, which are broadly in line with what they have been in the past.<\/p><p> With regard to the communications sector in terms of its revenue, the ComReg statistics track the size of the Irish economy.  This explosion in the use of communications services and the quality of communications services has led to no growth in communications revenue.  If one is trying to build new networks, that is a disaster because there is no upside, and that is difficult.  We have felt for a long time that we are not getting new high quality communications infrastructure because of Eircom and its financial problems, and to an extent that is true, but there is a much more insidious underlying factor here, which is that the business case for communications service providers for new builds is pretty marginal, particularly where it is not competitive to build more than one.  We believe this is an area that requires State intervention.<\/p><p> On EU policy, this is beginning to be understood and agreed in policy across Europe and globally.  The EU, as part of its digital agenda for Europe, set targets that everyone will have basic broadband of 30 Mbs and up to 50% of consumers will be using 100 Mbs by 2020.  If it is left to the private sector to achieve those targets, that will not happen.  There is no business case to do that.  There is a business case to do some of it but not to do all of it.  What drives a business case is cost and revenue.  This work will be done in areas where it is cheaper to deploy network and areas that are cheaper to deploy network are high population density areas.<\/p><p> The former Minister, Eamon Ryan, supported subsequently by the Minster, Deputy Rabbitte, commissioned the next generation broadband task force to examine where exactly the operators would have networks and to compare that with the digital agenda for Europe targets.  Essentially the next generation broadband task force report, which I hope the members have read, states that the industry is certainly good for the first 50%.  Therefore, 50% of homes and businesses in Ireland will have 100 Mbs quality broadband available to them by 2020, and that is great.  That is as good as most countries are looking at.  Not many countries, particularly the EU 27, are looking at much better than that.  With regard to the other 50%, the last 30% are rural areas.  It is very clear that there is not going to be any new provision of fixed line network there paid for by the private sector and that some form of State intervention is needed.<\/p> <p> On the middle 20% it is less clear.  These are the smaller regional towns, including Monaghan, Letterkenny and Drogheda.  The first 50% essentially is Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  The middle 20% comprises our regional towns and the last 30% comprises rural areas.  The larger urban areas will be okay and a policy intervention has been announced for the rural areas.  The State will support the development of broadband networks to the tune of &euro;175 million.  In the other regional urban centres it is less clear how they will be addressed.  We would have some concerns about those areas but there is no need to worry yet.  However, policymakers need to keep an eye on it because no operator is announcing any fixed line development plans in those areas.  It will take a new or upgraded fixed line network to deliver the kind of broadband homes and businesses in those areas will require.<\/p><p> The Minister's announcement of &euro;175 million for the rural areas is an excellent policy.  Having discussed this with other stakeholders in the industry, we believe that economically that should be enough to do it.  However, only one thing will be built in these areas, and if that one thing is a monopoly, it would be bad.  Whatever gets built with this &euro;175 million, we need to ensure it is open and competitive and that all operators are allowed to provide services over it.  Otherwise we believe it is very good policy.  However, we remain concerned for the middle 20% of urban areas.<\/p><p> That concludes our discussion of e|net's stance on broadband policy and I would be happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092600003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conal Henry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348649700,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Mr. Henry drew an analogy with the canals and railway lines.

Mr. Henry is correct in saying that broadband infrastructure and penetration are vital for industry and personal use.  People have made decisions on where to live based on broadband availability, and newspaper property advertisements often refer to broadband availability.  Given the difference between broadband availability in large urban areas and other areas, it could give rise to an urban-rural divide.  Some people have been willing to take extreme measures to get broadband at home.  People want to work from home and Mr. Henry spoke about the one day in 20.  Many more people would work one or two days a week from home if they had the cover.  There needs to be a drive to ensure every community has broadband cover.  I believe the Minister referred to it as the electricity of this generation.  We saw the consequences of some places such as the Black Valley in Kerry being left to the very end.<\/p><p>  Ireland lies 17th out of 27 in the European league and other countries are far ahead of us, not just in the large urban centres but right across their communities.  We need to work hard on the issue and raise it to the top of the agenda.  Mr. Henry has presented figures on industrial employment and uptake of jobs and so on, which confirm my opinion that those are based on the large urban centres with connectivity to top of the range broadband facilities.

I live in Manorhamilton, a small town in north Leitrim which has a MAN.  Many people were sceptical when the MAN was being installed in Manorhamilton.  Mr. Henry talked about attracting new industry, but there is another aspect.  Industry that was based in Manorhamilton long before the MAN would probably not have remained without that MAN infrastructure.  Anyone living in the west or north west understands how essential a good communications network is.  Traditionally, in all aspects of infrastructure there is very little north of a line from Dublin to Galway.  The roads tend not to be as good and so forth.  This is where there are some isolated pockets of industry, as opposed to farming villages or market towns, and these are spread throughout the west and north west.  I do not believe we exploit them enough but we are very glad to have the MANs in Manorhamilton, Sligo, Bundoran and Ballyshannon.<\/p><p>  Mr. Henry spoke about the vision for the future for the middle range of towns and more rural areas.  Is e|net working with Government on the overall telecommunication plans and the different solutions?  Is it working with Government on realistic timeframes for getting things done or does it just respond to requests from Government to do something?  What is the level of information share between e|net, which has a vision, and Government, which has a project to do?<\/p><p>  While both public and private money has gone into the MANs, the State and semi-State sectors are not exploiting the technology that is being made available to them.  We sometimes put in infrastructure without changing how we work in Government and semi-State offices.  We still operate with 19th century paper record systems and outmoded communications systems within and between Departments.  I doubt if Mr. Henry's office has any input into that sort of thought process by Government.  However, he may be aware of such analysis.  In fairness it is probably a question I should be asking of Government and not of e|net.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092600006#G00500","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1348650300,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I apologise for missing the presentation and forgive me if my question has been answered.

The relationship between policy and industry is far stronger and deeper than it has ever been in my eight years' experience in telecommunications in Ireland.  The next generation broadband task force was an excellent development as it formally invited the CEOs of the major telecommunications companies - one can discuss whether e|net is a major company but I was one of those CEOs - and the dialogue was instructive for policy and the industry.  On a quarterly basis e|net has the opportunity to discuss our business and wider issues through the arrangements in place with our concession agreement.  This quarterly liaison process works well and includes officials from the Department and a local authority county manager.  It is an excellent process in which to discuss issues.  While it is focused on issues associated with the metropolitan area networks, the dialogue is instructive for us all.  There is always room for more discussion and sharing but I do not have fears about a lack of access to policymakers or concerns that we cannot get our views across to policymakers.<\/p><p>  The point made on the State and the semi-State sector not exploiting the technology and changing the way we work is correct, but relative to our colleagues in France, Germany and the UK I do not believe we are any worse off.  Good work is being done.  The Revenue online service is excellent technology.  The work being done on HEAnet with regard to third level and second level institutions can be breakthrough.  I will not mention the name of a particular school because I do not have its permission to do so, but it is in receipt of 100 Mb broadband and all first year pupils have been given an iPad instead of a set of books.  This is transformational, as much for the orthopaedic health of the pupils as anything else.  The Department of Finance has a vision on how it wants to aggregate central services, and areas of the public sector are doing very interesting things.  It could be brought up a level and made more visionary and coherent, but this is a challenge that exists in the public service in its entirety.<\/p><p>  To answer Deputy Phelan, the landscape in Ireland is definitely an issue.  We have a sparsity of population and the bungalow in the corner of a field effect.  It is far more cost effective to deploy networks to clusters of buildings.  We do not have clusters of buildings, we have large numbers of isolated buildings and this makes the average cost per home in Ireland significantly higher than the average cost per home in other countries.  If one wanted to fix Ireland's broadband problem and decided to forget about the industry and just write a cheque to fix it once and for all, it would cost approximately &euro;2 billion.  This is big, but not that big.  This is not what we suggest doing, but if one were Roman Abramovich and decided to bring fibre to every home in Ireland, this is what it would cost.<\/p><p>  The motorways were not a missed opportunity.  Most of them were built with ducting, which is piping along the side, and this removes 90% of the cost of building a fibreoptic network.  The other 10% is with regard to deploying the fibre.  However, we have concerns about what has been done as it has not been particularly well mapped so it is not exactly clear what is in place.  We also believe the current charging structure is a little high.  However, these can be changed so opportunities exist and we will certainly pursue them.<\/p><p>  I apologise to Deputy O'Mahony for what happened at the weekend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092600007#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conal Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1348650300,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I detect there was very high use of broadband in Donegal yesterday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092600007#H00400","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348650300,"counter":198,"content":"<p>There was, yes.

Revenue per MAN largely tracks population so Cork is the biggest.  There are outliers which overperform and underperform.  Letterkenny is very strong relative to its population whereas Waterford is quite weak relative to its population.  We believe this is because of the nature of the industrial bases there.  Letterkenny is more technologically based with call centres whereas Waterford has a more industrial base, although this is purely a guess.  In smaller areas, Manorhamilton and Carrick-on-Shannon in Leitrim do very well and there are many jobs there.  In Mayo, Ballina is strong while Kiltimagh and Claremorris are getting strong.

Fibre, although a technology of sorts, is actually a means of distributing the technology.  There is nobody in communications globally saying the position of fibre distribution will always remain the same.  Traffic is gathered, largely wirelessly these days from a Wi-Fi or mobile network, and distributed in a wired way over fibre.  Fibre uses the physics of light.  One fibre the width of a human hair could carry all the voice traffic in Western Europe.  With regard to physics, fibre is exponentially better than certain other technologies.  Deploying fibre will create the capacity for whatever types of technology are being used by the consumer.  The more fibre, the better the quality of all the networks.  MAN networks, WiMAX broadband, 3G broadband, LLU broadband and cable television broadband are all coming onto the fibre networks.  Fibre is critical to all the technologies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092600007#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conal Henry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348650900,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Since fibre is so important, it has considerable implications for planning, especially if there is ever to be a housing boom again in Ireland.

As the Chairman indicated, I am accompanied by officials from the Department: Ms Kathleen Licken, assistant secretary; Mr. Kenneth Spratt; Mr. Aidan Ryan, technical adviser; and Ms Finola Rossi, assistant principal officer.<\/p><p>  The Department has circulated to committee members a copy of the Government's recently published national broadband document, Delivering a Connected Society - A National Broadband Plan for Ireland.  The plan, launched by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, on 31 August last, will be the main focus of my opening statement.  The Minister's target, as outlined in the report, is that at least half of the population will have high-speed broadband by 2015.  The specified targets in the plan for the remainder of the population are to be implemented over the lifetime of the Government.<\/p><p>  We have circulated to members the report of the task force on next-generation broadband, published last May.   The task force was chaired by the Minister.  The report and the deliberations of the task force helped inform the content of the plan.  The importance of high-quality broadband as enabling infrastructure for economic and social development is accepted at both domestic and international levels.  International experience and research support the view that high-speed broadband, in particular, is a key requirement for growth and jobs.<\/p><p>  In a study completed for the European Commission, the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that the Internet accounts for an average of 3.4% of GDP, and as much as 6% of GDP in advanced economies.  The study notes that SMEs with a strong web presence have been shown internationally to grow twice as quickly and export twice as much and create twice as many jobs as those with a minimal web presence.  The Internet is, therefore, critical for business growth and development.  It has a positive impact on many other facets of modern society, including entertainment, education, e-health and e-government.  Widely available high quality broadband can also assist with regional and rural development.<\/p><p>  Before outlining the key elements of the national broadband plan, I will refer briefly to the current position on broadband provision nationally.  Considerable progress has been made in recent years on both the coverage and speed of national broadband infrastructure.  The improvement is reflected in the fact that, over the past five years, the number of broadband subscriptions in the country has increased from approximately 600,000 to almost 1.7 million.  Some five years ago, basic broadband speeds of between 1 Mbps and 2 Mbps were the norm.  Now, typical speeds of up to 10 Mbps are becoming the norm, with speeds as high as 150 Mbps in some areas.<\/p><p>  It is estimated that private investment in broadband infrastructure across all platforms over the past five years amounted to some &euro;2.5 billion.  This investment has greatly improved the quality of broadband infrastructure.  For example, investment by UPC has resulted in availability of over 100 Mbps already to some 35% of the population.  These figures are set to rise, with UPC recently announcing the introduction of 150-Mbps services and expecting to expand the footprint over which these services are available.<\/p> <p>Eircom has indicated a commitment to major fibre-based investment, which will significantly improve fixed-line fibre-based broadband availability to significant segments of the population.  Other service providers also have invested to improve the coverage and speeds of their broadband offerings.  Investment in mobile broadband has led to an exponential increase in the number of mobile broadband subscribers from 45,000 five years ago to almost 600,000 at present.  Wireless broadband solutions are particularly important for Ireland given our low density of population and high percentage of rural population, which makes the provision of high-speed-fixed-line broadband in these areas very costly.  Notwithstanding these positive developments, there remains an unacceptable digital divide between rural and urban areas.  A key commitment in the national broadband plan is to tackle this divide decisively.<\/p><p> As joint committee members are aware, there is no national State-owned telecommunications company in Ireland.  As alluded to, the private sector has invested significantly in broadband infrastructure with very positive outcomes.  On foot of various Government decisions, the taxpayer over recent years has also funded targeted investment, largely in areas where there was evidence of market failure.  It is estimated that approximately &euro;300 million of Exchequer investment in broadband has occurred in the last decade.  This has included measures such as the fibre-based metropolitan area networks, MANs, which have greatly improved available broadband infrastructure in approximately 93 cities and towns; international connectivity projects, including Global Crossing and Kelvin, which have facilitated access by Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise sector to international trading opportunities via new sub-sea cables; the national and rural broadband schemes, which have ensured basic broadband coverage for virtually every premises in the country; and the 100 Mbps to second level schools project, which will deliver high speed broadband to every second level school in the country by 2014, thereby enabling students to acquire and engage with the digital world, which is crucial to the modern economy.<\/p><p> A central feature of the State interventions is that they have been strategic and targeted in nature.  Where the market and private investment can provide, there is no need for State funding, especially in the current very difficult fiscal climate.  In any event, such intervention would generally not be permissible under EU state aid rules.  This principle also has guided the Government&rsquo;s approach to Exchequer-funded investment under the new national broadband plan.  As the Minister put it in his foreword to the plan: \"Notwithstanding the constraints imposed on the Exchequer at present, Government will intervene where &ndash; but only where &ndash; it is evident that the market will not deliver.&rdquo;  The national broadband plan is a clear expression of the central importance of broadband infrastructure to the achievement of wider economic and social objectives.  The plan was formulated following a comprehensive consultation process.  A central element of this process was the next generation broadband task force, which was established and chaired by the Minister.  The task force included high level industry experts and considered a wide range of issues through five working groups which examined appropriate targets for broadband speed, demand stimulation, the removal of barriers perceived to hamper investment, spectrum policy and the potential role of State entities in facilitating the roll-out of high speed broadband.  The task force published its report in May of this year and was itself subject to a public consultation process.  This report was very valuable in informing the thinking that went into the consideration and final content of the national broadband plan.  The plan itself was launched by the Minister on 31 August last, just three months after completion of the task force report.<\/p><p> The central commitments in the plan relate to the availability of high speed broadband throughout the country.  In summary, these commitments are that 70 Mbps to 100 Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half the population by 2015, at least 40 Mbps and in many cases much faster speeds to at least a further 20% of the population, and potentially as much as 35%, which will include smaller towns and villages, and a minimum of 30 Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, no matter how remote.  Implementation of the plan will improve radically the quality of Ireland&rsquo;s broadband infrastructure.  It is an investment in Ireland&rsquo;s future.  This improvement will have an impact on all areas but will be especially pronounced in smaller urban centres and in rural areas.  In this way, the digital divide to which I referred earlier will be decisively addressed.<\/p><p> While a significant element of the commitments will be delivered via private sector investment, the plan includes an indicative investment by the State of &euro;175 million where intervention is necessary to ensure the targets will be met.  This is likely to be focused mainly in areas of low population where there is no commercial case for investment by the private sector.  The plan also addresses other areas that have an important impact on the provision of broadband infrastructure, namely, stimulation of demand for broadband, barriers to the provision of broadband infrastructure, spectrum policy and the potential contribution of infrastructure owned by State entities to the roll-out of high speed broadband.  Implementation of the plan will be progressed urgently given the priority attached to it by the Government.  A key milestone in this regard will be the completion of a formal mapping exercise to determine the exact position in respect of existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  As members will appreciate, this will be a major exercise on which the Department will require outside assistance, including from the commercial broadband operators.  The outcome of the mapping exercise will inform the procurement process for State intervention.  Key factors will be to ensure no gaps with regard to the coverage and speed targets set out in the plan, as well as optimal value for money for the State, including guarding against unnecessary investment in areas where the industry will deliver the targets.  State intervention will also require EU state aid approval.  The final level of intervention will be determined following the public procurement process when a competitive tender process will be concluded.  In addition, the other elements of the plan will also be progressed by direct initiatives and cross-Government action.  In this regard, it is the objective to publish a national digital strategy by the end of this year.  This will be an important element in the drive to stimulate demand for broadband.  A particular target will be small enterprise and the SME sector generally, in which the current level of online presence is unsatisfactory and may be hindering the sector from availing fully of trading opportunities.<\/p><p> The national broadband plan aims to change radically the broadband landscape in Ireland by providing the framework necessary to ensure the delivery of high quality, high speed broadband infrastructure.  The key, of course, will be delivery on the commitments, and the plan sets out a strong framework backed by Government to ensure this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092600008#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Dunning","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348651500,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dunning for a comprehensive overview of the position.

The delivery and upgrading of the broadband network is one of the major issues facing society in respect of economic and social development in the future and is a major priority.  I wish to ask questions on a number of issues.  The delivery of broadband also has the potential to create a huge divide between urban and rural areas and between isolated locations and less isolated urban and large centres of population.  This was evident in the presentation made by the previous delegation with regard to networks and the major urban centres.  When young people who have gone through college and have had the benefit of high quality broadband contemplate setting up a small industry at home or whatever, their first question concerns the availability of broadband because it is the connection into the 21st century and the world beyond.<\/p><p>  The Secretary General mentioned a number of matters in his presentation.  He noted that the outcome of the mapping exercise will inform the procurement process for State intervention.  He might provide members with some clarification regarding this exercise.  For example, when is it likely to be before the Department?  When does the Department hope to have all this information ready?<\/p><p>  Mr. Dunning also mentioned how Government intervention will only take place when it is evident the market will not deliver.  While members understand the parameters within which the Government must work, what State intervention is proposed under such circumstances?  As for the cost of broadband connection to the consumer, is Ireland's relative position above the European Union average?<\/p> <p> While I welcome the plan announced, I would love to believe we will be able to get to those speeds in the timeframe envisaged.  That would be a great plus for the country.  We are all aware of people with a particular expertise who have developed businesses in the remotest parts of the country, but the one issue holding them back is connectivity to broadband.  The plan is very ambitious, but how realistic is it that we will get to those speeds and achieve the targets set in the timeframe envisaged?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092600009#K00300","speaker":"987","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348652100,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dunning and his officials.

It is achievable and has the potential to do much to bridge the urban-rural divide, but it will require a mix of technologies.  Deputy Michael Moynihan mentioned the gap analysis.  I know the findings of previous gap analyses did not reflect what was happening on the ground because it was not in the interests of some companies to reflect exactly what was happening.  What parameters will apply to the analysis and how will we determine the areas in which direct government intervention will be required?<\/p><p>  I take at face value that what is set out in the plan will be achieved within the timescales outlined.  However, is there any unit of the Department looking at State use of the technology available?  I sometimes refer to our use of technology as being like building a very good road but continuing to cycle instead of taking a car - it might be good for the environment and better for our health, but it does not get us to work any faster.  Is the Government - local, State and semi-State bodies - exploiting the technology available to the fullest extent?  There are huge savings to be made, for example, in terms of paperless offices.  Are we making full use of technology and maximising the savings in terms of Exchequer spending?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092600010#L00200","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1348652100,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I do not want to repeat questions asked.

County and city development plans should include provision for broadband.  There is no point in providing sites for industrial facilities or housing if basic broadband infrastructure, which is as important as water and sewerage, is not available.  With regard to mapping, has the Department engaged with the local authorities in the context of projected housing, commercial and industrial development after we emerge from our current difficulties?  Has it engaged on where the population is likely to increase?  If we are rolling out broadband, it should be rolled out in areas where there will be a demand for it in the short, medium and long term.<\/p><p>  Somebody came to my constituency office a week ago who was infuriated because of the way he was being passed from Billy to Jack and Jim to Mary and back to Billy again in his efforts to find out how he could access a broadband service.  He is at a major competitive disadvantage.  I would like to see provided a one-stop shop, as is in place for water and electricity services.  However, there appear to be a multiplicity of agencies which aspire to become or are involved in the delivery of broadband services around the country, whether they be county councils, enterprise boards, Leader companies, development boards, the Department, commercial entities or telecommunications businesses.  Perhaps there should be just one location in each local authority area at which people could access the technical expertise they require.  There is a disjointed approach in moving the programme forward.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Michael Colreavy that while the national broadband plan is ambitious, it can be delivered.  However, it needs to be delivered in a coherent fashion.  That is not happening because of the multitude of agencies with an input or which want to have one.  They are sticking their shoes in the door and trying to wedge their feet in.  This is making it more difficult to deliver the service.  I again refer to the man who came to see me about broadband services.  His business is at a competitive disadvantage in comparison with similar businesses in Limerick city.<\/p> <p>He does not have access to broadband.  He has access to bog-band, so to speak.  The speeds are slow, it is unreliable and it breaks down constantly.  He told me it depends on whether the wind is blowing in a certain direction, whether someone's hedge grows higher than it should or whether there is a rock in the way.  That is no way to be carrying out business in 2012.  We need to have employers in all the regions.  It is remarkable that in Finland, which has a much lower population than even ours and the population density is even more dispersed than ours, there is high speed broadband in Lapland. We cannot get high speed broadband in west Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092600010#L00500","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348652700,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I apologise for missing the beginning of the presentation.  I have gone through it and I very much welcome it.  I welcome the work that has been done by the Department on the broadband and digital strategies.  I have a few questions, which may have been answered.<\/p><p>  How does Ireland shape up, both globally and in a European context, in terms of broadband speed and bandwidth?  We have heard, for example, that UPC is delivering up to 150 Mbps in urban areas, but that does not give the full picture.  As a nation, in general terms, where are we placed?<\/p><p>  Much of the pressure on us often comes from domestic users of broadband but the focus here should be on the benefits to the economy and on job creation that broadband should be delivering.  We are competing with countries in eastern Europe where the perception, rightly or wrongly, is that they are streets ahead of us in terms of connectivity.  The message is not good.  In my opinion, we are better than the perception but we need to see the figures and get that stacked up.<\/p><p>  The high speed broadband for schools, is a fantastic initiative and is welcome.  In talking about the economic impact in terms of creating jobs of providing broadband at speeds of 100 Mbps, did anyone ever consider looking at industrial parks and technological parks in many areas that have enterprises - not the main urban centres but the smaller provincial towns and villages?  Did anyone look to see whether we could roll out 100 Mbps to those areas to create jobs?  In many of the schools, 100 Mbps may be gilding the lily.  If one is talking about an economic advantage, however, could that be the next strategy?<\/p><p>  Deputy Ann Phelan mentioned co-ordination with the local authorities, as did Deputy O'Donovan.  Further to that, and also on an economic issue, does the Department liaise directly on projects or strategies with IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the enterprise boards?  We all are aware that IDA Ireland looks at the urban areas, chiefly on sites of 80 acres or more where it will deliver projects.  Critical to its projects, as we heard in the previous presentation from e|net, was the availability of the MANs and the success it has had.  If we are to deliver more than 100 Mbps in some other areas, it would seem logical that the Department should be saying to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland that the infrastructure is available in an area which may not be on their radar and in which they could create jobs.  They could get a land bank that may be not as difficult to acquire as in more urban areas and, with some encouragement, be able to deliver industry into places that normally would not have been thought of.  That goes for the enterprise boards as well.<\/p><p>  Following on from that, while it has not been mentioned in the presentation, could the witnesses give members an overview on how we compare internationally on tier 1 connectivity in attracting into the country the large multinationals that need such infrastructure?<\/p><p>  Recently, a large online multinational created 26 jobs in a rural part of west Cork, which is where the focus was rather than bringing them to Sir John Rogerson's Quay or wherever in Dublin and where they would be able to work from home delivering the back office services this company would demand.  While everything is going grand, there is the obvious difficulty of technical hitches.  We should have moved on from that.  I will notify the Department on the matter and hope we can get some resolution.  It seems industry is going ahead in that regard and we want to encourage that type of activity where a new template would be offered to large multinationals to facilitate them in having staff work from home two or three days a week, five or ten days a month, or whatever the case may be.  It would increase quality of life, decrease the traffic on the roads, and so on.  We should encourage that and I would ask the Department to consider it as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092600011#M00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1348652700,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I offer my apologies as well for being late.

I will start with a general comment before getting into the specifics.  It picks up a little on what Deputy Harrington said.  The Government decided on a national broadband plan because there is an acceptance that there must be a step change in terms of broadband speeds and the quality of our broadband infrastructure.  That is because there is a strong acceptance that it is key to economic and social development.  I referred in my speech to the real and tangible improvements that have been made in recent years.  One is seeing increasingly, in terms of foreign direct investment, FDI, that Ireland is proving to be a strong attractor in information and communications technology, ICT, and related areas where high level broadband connectivity is particularly important.  The fact we have improved our infrastructure, primarily on the back of private investment, is a good indicator that we are on the right track, but much more needs to be done.<\/p><p>  On the implementation of the plan and consultation and liaison with the industrial agencies, the Department spoke to the industrial enterprise agencies, Forf&aacute;s and our Government colleagues about the formulation of the plan.  There is general acceptance on their side that this is a good advance for IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland when it comes to selling Ireland in terms of us being serious about upping the game in the provision of broadband at that general level.<\/p><p>  A key commitment in the plan is to address the perceived issue which is undoubtedly a fact, that there is a significant divide between urban and rural areas.  Through the national broadband scheme and other competitive provisions, rural areas have access primarily to basic broadband, which is 1 Mbps to 2 Mbps.  The plan gives a commitment that it will be 30 Mbps in every household, no matter how remote.  That is a major commitment and it will take a little time.  I can go into the intervention and how it will be done.  Unfortunately, one cannot merely wave a wand so that it will happen overnight.  This will be especially important, however, in terms of economic and social development and development of industry in rural areas.<\/p><p>  That is the general backdrop I wish to outline in explaining why the Government has placed such critical importance on this issue.  We spent a lot of time with the task force in putting this together and we consulted widely, both within the Government system and with commercial operators.<\/p> <p>I hope we have found the correct balance in a context of straightened resources.<\/p><p> Deputy Moynihan expressed interest in the mapping exercise, which will be crucial to the Government&rsquo;s intervention in this area.  As we noted in the plan, it is clear that the industry is going to deliver a significant amount of high speed broadband.  It is already doing so, with 150 MBps available to approximately 30% of the population, albeit in urban areas.  Significant speeds are also available via private investment in other parts of the country.  We have to use the resources available to us to ensure, as with all good policy making, that we target our investment at achieving the optimal outcome.  The mapping exercise is important in this regard.<\/p><p> The exercise comprises two elements.  First, it will ensure that whatever procurement results from it will be able to achieve the targets set out in the plan.  That will require consultation with the telecommunication companies to understand their investment plans and subsequently mapping the country to identify the areas in which we need to provide infrastructure.  Second, it will ensure optimal value for money for taxpayers in the procurement process.  There is a third element involving approval for state aid, but I am confident we will manage this once we structure the procurement process correctly.  Any intervention by the taxpayer of a member state has to receive approval from the EU.<\/p><p> We hope to complete the mapping exercise by next year.  It is a major exercise covering the entire country, although we do not expect to begin in certain urban areas.  As I do not want to get bound up in red tape and bureaucracy with the European Commission, we are going to proceed carefully and with expert advice.  On foot of the mapping exercise we will devise a procurement process which will be open to all commercial operators and, from our point of view as guardians of the taxpayer&rsquo;s money, will attempt to derive maximum benefit from the private sector contribution.  Clearly, however, the Exchequer will also be contributing.  We will use co-funding to meet, at a minimum, the targets set down, particularly in the second and third categories of small towns and rural areas.  We do not yet know the level of State intervention required for the project but it will be sufficient to meet the targets while also providing value for money.  The timeframe is realistic, as Deputy Moynihan noted.<\/p><p> In the context of the digital strategy, certain steps can be taken to increase demand for broadband, thereby helping the private sector to develop markets.  By 2015 we will have made major progress on high speed broadband and our aim is to implement the remainder of our targets for smaller towns, villages and rural areas over the lifetime of this Government.  These rural areas are largely covered by the national broadband scheme at present and are being upgraded to 2 Mbps or 3 Mbps in October 2012.  We will commit to provide speeds of 30 Mbps in a few years&rsquo; time.<\/p><p> Deputy Colreavy asked about the State&rsquo;s use of technology.  He is correct that enormous benefits can be derived through the State leveraging the technology facilitated by good broadband connections.  An e-government strategy has been launched by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which has primary responsibility in this area.  At European level we are regarded as relatively advanced with our e-government strategy but the digital divide once again comes into play.  It is easier to access e-government with better broadband.  There is potential for online provision in a range of areas, such as e-health and e-learning.<\/p><p> Reference was made to broadband in schools.  Considerable work has been done by the Department of Education and Skills in primary schools but more work needs to be done on implementation of broadband in secondary schools because speeds at primary level are, understandably, not as fast as at secondary level.  We also need to work with the third level sector.  The State is proactive in leveraging technology and this will be part of the implementation process.  Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony also asked about broadband provision in schools.  His constituency of Mayo is on this year&rsquo;s list for the roll-out of services and by the end of the project a total of 278 second level schools will be able to access speeds of 100 Mbps.  The 78 schools involved in the pilot project have been operating successfully for the past two years and we have been receiving positive feedback on their experience.  This year we are rolling out broadband to 200 schools, most of which are located in the west and mid-west.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092600011#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Dunning","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348653300,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Can Mr. Dunning provide a list of those schools for the benefit of the committee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092600012#N00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348653300,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Yes; 27 secondary schools in County Mayo will get broadband speeds of 100 Mbps.<\/p><p>  Several speakers asked about international connectivity and our position on the scale.  As with all statistics, assessments of our position have varied.  The OECD produced an assessment with which we are somewhat unhappy because it failed to take account of mobile broadband penetration.  None the less, it is accepted as a harmonised approach.  I acknowledge that further work needs to be done in respect of several of the OECD&rsquo;s tables where we lag other countries.  However, Singapore, which is at the top of the tables, has a population of 5 million in an area the size of County Louth.  It is not costly to supply 100 Mbps to every household because the population is very dense.  It would cost billions of euro to supply 100 MBps to every household in Ireland because of our topography and the fact that some 40% of our population live in rural areas.  The population density in Ireland is 67 people per square kilometre, compared to 253 in the UK, 505 in South Korea and 7,000 in Singapore.  These countries look great on advertised speeds but it is not necessarily the case that the offers are being taken up.  There are other ways of measuring broadband provision.  Akamai is an organisation which produces statistics on the speeds made available, as distinct from advertised.  Ireland fares relatively well empirically in respect of the speeds that reach homes and business.  We are ranked 13th globally and seventh in Europe for average peak connection speeds provided as distinct from advertised.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the plan is to move us up the scale.  We will easily beat the targets set out by Commissioner Kroes in the EU digital agenda<\/p> <p>, both in regard to ubiquity, which we already have, and in regard to where we will be on speeds by the mid-term of the plan.  The most difficult part of the plan is the target that 50% of the European population will have subscribed to 100 Mbps by 2020.  It is a very ambitious target because it does not take account of peoples' circumstances or needs.  Certainly by 2020 we hope to have availability up to that level but whether 50% will have subscribed is a matter of choice.  This brings me back to the digital strategy and the importance of convincing people that it is in their interests to subscribe to broadband.<\/p><p> The spectrum auction was mentioned by Deputy Phelan.  We are not involved in spectrum auction, which is a very sensitive issue.  The process is under way at the moment and is being conducted completely by ComReg.  We look forward to a positive outcome.  I hope it will make available a very rich spectrum that will, in time, enable fourth generation broadband to be rolled out.  That would be of huge benefit to rural areas in particular and enable much higher speeds than are currently available in those areas.  It is probable that even with that level of connectivity and speed, there will be some Exchequer intervention required in those areas to make it a commercial proposition.  Apart from the broadband aspect of it, there is also a significant Exchequer benefit in terms of payments made by service providers for the use of the resource.  It is, after all, a national resource.  Hopefully the payment will be significant this year and over the period of the licences.  I emphasise again that the Department and the Minister are not involved in the auction.  It is being run on a sealed basis by ComReg as we speak.<\/p><p> The issue of local authorities was also raised.  In my speech I referred to a number of what I would call complimentary issues to the key issue of speeds, including the digital strategy and the local authorities.  Clearly, local authorities and the planning system are crucial to enable service providers to provide the speeds and to do the work required, whether it be through civil works, the erection of masts or anything else.  We had some very good engagement with our colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the run-up to the production of the plan.  That will be ongoing.<\/p><p> We also have had very good engagement with the local authorities.  I am very hopeful that, as we proceed on the various strands of the plan, the local authorities will be able to facilitate us through planning systems that will be encouraging of the roll-out of broadband.  The local authorities very much recognise the importance of this for their areas.  We see potential barriers, however.  We are all aware that certain controversies can arise from time to time in regard to the location of infrastructure, whether it be telecoms, energy, roads or whatever, but we will be working very hard on this.  We set up a group before the plan was produced to examine this whole area.  That group will remain in existence to scope out guidelines - or something stronger, if necessary - that will enable the planning system to accommodate what needs to be done.  This is something that is very much on our radar at present.<\/p><p> Deputy O' Donovan mentioned the multitude of agencies and the frustration of consumers.  In that context, I would refer members to <i>callcosts.ie<\/i>, a website run by ComReg.  It sets out the broadband speeds and offerings that are available in each county in Ireland.  I have a copy of the most recent data, from July, which makes for very interesting reading.  It shows that across every county there are various packages available.  In the 1 Mbps to 10 Mbps sector, for example, there are 75 plans available in County Clare.  If one moves up the chain to the 20 Mbps to 30 Mbps sector, there are still significant numbers of plans available in every county.  That website is very useful.  However, it does not drill down within each county and I am sure that is what the representations made to Deputies would be about.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092600012#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Dunning","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348653900,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Yes, that is the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092600013#O00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348653900,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I am sure people contact Deputies to say that they happen to be living in a particular place and cannot get broadband there. The national broadband scheme, NBS, was designed primarily to deal with areas where there was no broadband availability.  While it is only basic broadband, it has been a success in terms of making broadband available to over 200,000 premises that did not have it before.  The take-up has not been as high as we would have hoped when we launched the scheme in 2008.  We estimate that there are just over 40,000 customers at this stage of the NBS.  That scheme is operated by service provider 3, with whom we came to a contractual agreement.  A certain amount of Exchequer investment went into the scheme but it has proven to be a success in terms of opening up the broadband world to people who did not have that opportunity before.  We also have anecdotal evidence that the scheme has induced other operators to compete in NBS areas, including Eircom.  That is all to the benefit of those areas.  <\/p><p>  Even after all of that, we are aware that there may be areas that cannot be reached at all.  We have initiated a rural broadband scheme which is being scoped out at the moment but again, under that scheme, we can only go into areas where the European Commission is satisfied that there is no other service provider.  The evidence to date indicates that there is at least one service provider in all of these areas and if that service provider can make an offering available, we cannot go in and offer the rural broadband scheme.  The NBS is working well and the contract lasts until 2014.  We cannot go into those areas until that contract ends but I would envisage them being the target for a minimum of 30 Mb after that date.  The experiential difference that will make, to individuals and particularly to enterprises, will be enormous.  I will provide the committee with details of the aforementioned website, which would be very useful for members to have at their disposal.  <\/p><p>  The issue of broadband for schools and the concept of extending it out to enterprises in business parks or other locations was raised.  The reality is that the broadband for schools project is a contract for high speed broadband for schools only.  We had a certain amount of resources at our disposal in the Department.  As a developmental Department, we felt it was very important that we do our bit, in conjunction with our colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills, to upgrade the digital skills of the work force of the future.  That is what we are doing and we are starting in the areas where connectivity is poorest, mainly in western areas of the country.  Roll out for the next 200 schools will be in those areas.  By the end of 2014 we expect all of the 800-plus schools to have that facility.  However, it will only be for the schools.  We do not - and will not - have the resources to go beyond that.  In any event, in many cases, service providers would be open to speaking to enterprises in towns about providing tailor-made broadband solutions.<\/p> <p>We are trying to improve the speeds in the smaller towns which do not have the requisite speeds they would like.  That is the second segment, so to speak, of the three point targets in the pillar I set out at the start of my presentation.<\/p><p> On the last point from Deputy Harrington, I have dealt with the large multinationals.  Ireland's success in that area in recent years, notwithstanding our economic travails, has been outstanding and that is seen to be the case throughout the world.  Broadband connectivity has contributed to that, as has international connectivity, which was mentioned.  We have Project Kelvin, Global Crossing and some others.  I attended the launch of the EirGrid interconnector last week, which is a fantastic feat of engineering of which this country should be proud.  It will make a huge difference in terms of energy provision, but alongside the electrical cables there is also Internet connectivity.  That will improve the situation in that regard.  For an export oriented country such as ours, it is crucial we have good international connectivity.  All of what I have said will deliver that.  I hope I dealt with most of the points raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092600013#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Dunning","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348654500,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Mr. Dunning said he received co-operation from the local authorities, especially on the infrastructure that will be put in place, and I presume that will include masts that will be erected in different local areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092600014#P00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348654500,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Masts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092600014#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Dunning"},{"type":"speech","time":1348654500,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Yes.

In terms of the interaction between the delivery of the next step under the rural broadband scheme and the national broadband scheme, do those people have to wait before they will be serviced under the rural broadband scheme?  A request was issued for people who did not have broadband access to notify the Department.  Some people did not get to do that.

The World Health Organization, WHO, has done a good deal of work in this area.  This matter does not come directly under the remit of Mr. Dunning's Department, but perhaps he would communicate with the Department of Health on this.  Has that Department noted any rise in the health problems in this respect?  If it is logical that mobile phones have an effect on people's health, more people should be reporting that their health is in danger because of the use of mobile phones.  It is very difficult to deal with this issue because we do not have any hard and fast evidence on  it.  Anecdotally, most people have a major fears of masts in any guise.

It is primarily a matter for the Department of Health, and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to a degree, in terms of their planning role.  We liaise with them.  There are international standards within which service providers must stay, and I understand they are monitored by the United Nations which sets the limits.  They provide guidance to the public bodies, which are the planning authorities, and also to the health authorities.  Those standards are accepted internationally.  There are masts throughout the world.  They are not just in Ireland or the United Kingdom; they can be found everywhere.
