Approximately 7,000 children in Ireland have Down's syndrome.  Having spoken to the family members of many children with Down's syndrome, I know those children are the life and soul of their families.  They are very sociable.  They certainly keep the members of their families on their toes.  They are the root and the centre of their families.<\/p> <p>Many people with Down's syndrome are born with learning disabilities.  They learn much more from life experience.  I would like to point out that the life expectancy of people with Down's syndrome is getting longer.  This means they need lifelong learning and lifelong provision.  Children with Down's syndrome do not qualify for the July provision that is available in many schools.  I know a family that received a letter of refusal even though an autistic child in the same class had received approval for inclusion in the programme.  The teacher who was brought in to deal with one child could have dealt with two children.<\/p> <p>The practical things that are taught during July provision can involve taking children to the shop and giving them money.  They have to purchase something and bring back the change.  They are taught how to use footpaths and the green man at traffic lights.  Such practical things make the life of the child more independent.<\/p> <p>The family in the case I have mentioned was very disappointed to find that the child did not qualify for July provision.  At the end of the day, he is a child like everybody else in the class.  He is in mainstream school.  It is most commendable that he is getting on very well in school.  It is disappointing that this decision has been made.

It is unfortunate that the times have clashed.<\/p> <p>I assure the House that ensuring children with special educational needs are supported and given the opportunity to reach their full potential is a key priority for the Government.  Almost &euro;1.8 billion will be invested in special education in 2018.  This represents an increase of almost 43% since 2011 and amounts to almost 20% of the Department's overall budget.  During the worst years of the recession, the Government not only protected supports for children with special educational needs, including children with Down's syndrome, but it increased them.<\/p> <p>The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, published its policy advice on educational provision for children with autism spectrum disorders in July 2016.  In developing this policy advice, the NCSE reviewed the Department's July provision grant scheme.  The NCSE consulted widely with parents, professionals and other stakeholders and interested parties while also conducting research.  The policy advice, which is available on the NCSE website, recommends that relevant stakeholders should discuss the development of a national day activity scheme that provides a structured and safe social environment for all students with complex special educational needs for one month of the summer holidays.<\/p> <p>The Department of Education and Skills has convened an implementation group with representatives of the NCSE, the National Educational Psychological Service, the inspectorate and external representatives to ensure the recommendations in the report are fully and appropriately considered.  The work of the implementation group is ongoing.  Department officials will engage with officials in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Health and other relevant stakeholders on the implementation of the recommendations, including those regarding July provision.  While that work is under way, there are no plans to extend the existing July provision to all children with special educational needs.

The board of management of the school is determined to stop that from happening.  It mirrors a situation in St. Anne's Park affecting St. Paul's school, in the constituency in which I live, where the order has sold the lands to a private developer.  Those lands were handed to the order by the city council for use as playing fields.  A private developer now owns them and is trying to develop them.  While there is major local opposition, it is spilt milk.<\/p> <p>The issue in Clonkeen College, however, is not spilt milk.  We have the bizarre situation where the patron body is now more than threatening to disband the board of management of the school, whose crime is merely defending the interests of the school and the local community.  The Minister is the only person who can actually make the decision on this.  That might be part of the reason we do not have a representative from the Department of Education and Skills to debate the matter with me.  The Minister cannot hide behind constitutional advice, the Department or an Oireachtas committee.  The decision is his and his alone.  I understand from media reporting that it has to be made by tomorrow.  <\/p> <p>Will the Department of Education and Skills stand beside the patron body and, effectively, by the developer and sack the board of management?  Is the Minister going to stand beside the board and the school community, many members of which are in the Gallery to watch the debate, including one of the local representatives, Councillor Deirdre Kingston?  Will the Minister stand with the community and ensure that the board remains intact?  It is a very simple question and a simple decision.  If it was my decision, I know what I would do.

There is a Minister of State in that Department - who also happens to be a local Deputy - who could be here.  I have received a six-sentence reply.

It is on the far side of the county as far as I am concerned.  To my mind, it is a matter of national importance in which a patron body decided to sell off land in a school in order that a developer could build on local playing pitches.  If the board of management decides to defend the rights of the school, the patron body is going to sack the board.  The Minister has a determination to make as to whether he is going to sack the board.  He did not come in here and did not send in his Minister of State, who happens to be a local Deputy, and then he sent a six-sentence reply on the situation.  We are none the wiser as to what his decision will be.<\/p> <p>I genuinely do not think this is good enough.  I do not like playing party politics when it comes to issues like this.  The matter is extremely important for this individual school and probably every school across the country that has playing pitches.

It is always a pleasure to have him here.  On the weekend of 3 January to 5 January 2014, the country experienced terrible weather conditions.

Millions of euro worth of damage was caused at the time and  Ministers and others visited, including the then Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Mr. Brian Hayes.  Homes and businesses were destroyed and serious damage was done to the streetscape in towns along the coast, particularly Lahinch.

It was agreed that the funding would be made available via the Votes of the appropriate Departments and offices.  These were: for the repair of roads, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport: for piers and harbours other than those in the charge of local authorities, the Department of Agriculture, Food arid Marine; for coastal protection and repairs, the Office of Public Works, OPW; for tourism-related infrastructure as well as certain piers, harbours and other facilities in the charge of local authorities, what has become the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.<\/p> <p>While the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government had an initial role in collating details and costs of damage in the immediate aftermath of the severe weather based on returns and estimates provided by local authorities, the aforementioned Departments and offices liaised directly with the local authorities regarding funding falling within their remit.  In the case of Clare County Council, the Department of Housing, Planning arid Local Government, in its initial co-ordinating role, wrote to the council in February 2014 advising that a sum of up to &euro;16.21 million was available to the council for the repair of damaged public infrastructure.  This was broken down across relevant Departments and offices.  The funding was based on the initial estimates of repairs submitted by Clare County Council.  In these initial estimates, the council included a request for repairs in respect of damage caused totalling &euro;1.64 million under the heading of other facilities.  When more detailed claims for recoupment were received from the council in December 2015, this request was further clarified to be for repair to damage of various seawalls.  In January 2016, Clare County Council was advised by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government that it should refer its claim for funding of these works to the OPW as the works related to repair of coastal protection infrastructure and were deemed ineligible for funding from the Department, which has no role in this regard.  <\/p> <p>Clare County Council has recouped a total of &euro;3.92 million in capital expenditure from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for infrastructure damage arising from the 2013-2014 storms and has been advised on a number of occasions that funding is not available from the Department for coastal protection repairs.

What contingency plans does the Government have to ensure that people will get paid, that third-party claims will be repaid quickly and that individuals may receive refunds in respect of their premiums in situations similar to this - whereby insurance companies are regulated outside the jurisdiction but selling policies here and, like Setanta, they fail and go into liquidation - in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020100002#C00900","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517481000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Donnell for raising this matter.  It is an opportunity to put on the record of the House where things stand in this regard.  He is aware that a Supreme Court ruling in May of last year overturned the Court of Appeal and High Court rulings that the MIBI was liable for such claims.  The Supreme Court clarified that the ICF is liable for third-party claims, subject to a limit of whichever is the lesser of 65% or &euro;825,000.  It is expected that the balance due to claimants, 35%, will be paid from the proceeds of the distribution of assets on completion of the liquidation process.  Following a request from the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, for an actuarial review, this is estimated to be in the region of 22% of the value of claims, thus leaving a shortfall of approximately 13%.  However, the liquidator has made it clear that no payments can be made from the assets of Setanta to third-party claimants until the final claim is settled.  That is a very important point.  This creates further uncertainty for such claimants.<\/p> <p>The Setanta insolvency and the subsequent Supreme Court ruling have highlighted an inequity between awards for third-party claimants from the MlBl in respect of uninsured or unidentified drivers, whereby personal injuries are compensated in full, compared with compensation from the ICF in the event of an insolvency.  That is particularly unfair.  The Senator is aware that the Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2017 is soon to come before the Houses and I will appear before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach for pre-legislative scrutiny in respect of it next week.  As I said, the Minister for Finance requested an actuarial review of the situation.  It was also necessary to obtain legal advice as any Government intervention to compensate third-party claimants beyond the 65% limit could result in the Government having a lower status in the creditor hierarchy and thus significantly reduce the amount it could recoup from the liquidator.  That was a very major concern at the time.  That provides the backdrop to the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s intervention on Tuesday.<\/p> <p>The next step is to give consideration as to whether there is a competition and state-aid issue associated with the final implementation of this decision.  That is a very live concern.  The Department of Finance is currently working with the Office of the Attorney General on the issue.  The House may rest assured that the Government is prioritising this matter without delay and if a legislative approach is required, it will approve the necessary provision as soon as possible.  This will most likely be addressed through the Insurance (Amendment) Bill.  I hope the Bill will be passed in 2018.<\/p> <p>It is important to remember that, in the absence of a settlement by a third-party claimant, no payment can be made by the ICF.  This is a matter over which the Minister for Finance has no control.  However, the Deputy can rest assured that once the detailed arrangements for facilitating the full compensation have been agreed, the Minister will give an indication of the likely timeline for payment, including the payment of the additional 35% to those who have already been paid 65%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020100002#D00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1517481000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Through its announcement on Tuesday, the Government has indicated its willingness to facilitate this issue.  It is important to remember that no payment can be made in the absence of a settlement by a third-party claimant.  In this regard, the current position is that the liquidator for Setanta Insurance has informed the Department that as of 31 December 2017 there were 1,577 active claims, of which 573 claimants have been paid compensation from the ICF, subject to the 65% limit.  Subtracting 573 from 1,577 gives the total number of outstanding claims.  The liquidator has also advised that preparatory work is under way in respect of 275 claims to the value of approximately &euro;5.8 million with a view to the accountant to the High Court making an application before the end of March.  This means that just over 700 claims will be settled, with the remainder unsettled.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Finance and I hope that the announcement will encourage a more rapid settlement of claims as third-party claimants can now work on the basis that they will be compensated in full.  Another benefit of the decision is that it should immediately take the pressure off policy holders, some of whom have been pursued for the shortfall by third-party claimants.  It is a particularly unfair situation for people who correctly and legally got insurance with a correctly and legally regulated entity, met all aspects the law required and, through no fault of their own, have been pursued for an accident for which the insurance company should be paying.<\/p> <p>I wish to briefly mention the payment schedule for third-party claimants that has been raised on several occasions by Members.

It is a very unsatisfactory situation that the insurance compensation fund, ICF, does not conclude in the same way as the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland, MIBI.  Hopefully the Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2015, which I believe is before the finance committee next week, will help to address any future issues such as those that arose in the Setanta Insurance situation.

Broadband is to the economy today what canals were to the economy in the 1700s, railways were in the 1900s, rural electrification in the 1930s and 1940s and telephone connections with the wider world in the 1970s and 1980s.  Now there is another delay in broadband provision.  We are aware that this is somehow being spun as a victory for the Government, which is quite an amazing achievement.  We hear that it is going to be cheaper, or it is going to be the same cost or it is going to be faster, but we all know these are not the facts.  Statistics are pliable but the facts are very stubborn.  The facts do not lie.<\/p> <p>Ireland is ranked at No. 42 in the global index on broadband availability.  High-speed broadband is only available to some 40% of the population.  Why are we delaying so much and so badly? In fairness to the Government, one thing it has not been short on when it comes to this matter is announcements, targets and deadlines, all of which the Government has not met.  The Minister looked very sheepish yesterday as he announced this, somehow or other, victory.  He said that they were now going to be able to roll it out on time.  As they have not met any other targets so far, for the Minister to spin this as a victory is quite unbelievable and audacious.  The spin unit must be working overtime all the time to pretend.<\/p> <p>It is a fact, and we all heard this on morning radio today, that people and business communities in rural Ireland are being affected by their inability to work due to the lack of broadband.  There is no shortage of plans or announcements but there is no believable plan.  The credibility of the Minister of the Department is an issue when one sees very credible companies withdrawing from the process.  Most of this is to do with the process that was put in place by the Minister and the Department.  The Minister has to take responsibility.  I believe that he needs to give an explanation to the people.  Coming into this House from across the way and telling us that he has a new deadline, on top of the other deadlines, is simply not good enough.  How are the people in Roscommon, Kerry and Mayo supposed to maintain and sustain jobs when the Government's plans and targets, upon which people are relying to deliver connectivity, are simply not being met?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020100002#G00300","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1517481000,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I wish to raise an issue relating Coillte and its forest-farm partnerships.

They have complete and utter control over this State agency.  It is important we have a detailed and comprehensive debate about Irish forestry.  While Coillte owns a very substantial land bank across the country, it also attempts and promises to work in partnership with small farm holdings and people who wish to get into the forestry sector.  A lot of people changed their land over to forestry with expectations in the short term, medium term and long term.  There is a long-term gain and it is a long-term enterprise.

The Minister of State, Deputy English, gave a commitment yesterday that he would be happy to come to the House to deal with the disability aspects of Rebuilding Ireland.  Can we formally invite him to do so, given he has stated his willingness to do this?  In that regard, can we have a report from his Department setting out the progress being made on the motion on which this House unanimously agreed in July 2017 regarding housing for people with disabilities?  That would be the prelude to a useful and informative debate here in the House.<\/p> <p>Related to that, it is important and only right for me to wholeheartedly welcome the Government decision to have ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities this coming March.

While there have been delays and missed timelines, I am only stating that this morning to make a point about the future, namely, there is a strong expectation that the Government will crack on with implementation across all the domains, given legislation is required in areas like housing, education, employment, access, transport, jobs and income supports.  The coming budget should be a very strong marker that the Government is moving with intent in this direction.  The Taoiseach and his Department must be the drivers of integrated and complementary action across the whole system.<\/p> <p>On a final point, when the Government got stuck into the issue of unemployment, the Action Plan for Jobs was driven night, noon and morning from the centre of Government and from the Taoiseach.  Every Department was being whipped on it and was being asked what was happening and how was it removing the blockages.  That has been a success because it was a whole-of-Government project and it had that prioritisation.  That is exactly what is needed to move this project and to get the best results from it.  That is what I am asking the Taoiseach to do.  Ireland can become the front runner, and I look forward to that.

Looking forward, the State needs a very long-term approach to re-acquiring that infrastructure so we do not find ourselves in this debacle year after year.<\/p> <p>Another example of this has been the near-privatisation of water.  I raised again in recent times the issues regarding a family in Connemara whose water supply was cut off for days.  Those problems have not been addressed and the family has been getting sporadic tanks of water.  Another case close by has come to hand where a couple moved into a house in Connemara in July of last year.  They paid a fee of &euro;2,650 to be connected by Irish Water to the water system but still have not been connected.  They have been contacting Irish Water and there is no response or any reasoning as to why they would not be connected to the water supply.  People are finding it impossible to get straight answers from Irish Water.  The lack of transparency and accountability is incredibly frustrating for people.  We have asked for the clinics to be resumed but I think there is a need for a debate with the Minister who is responsible for Irish Water or is there a Minister responsible now that it has been set up as a separate entity?  That whole issue of accountability around Irish Water is incredibly important.<\/p> <p>I also want to raise the issue of the Time 4 Us play centre in Galway, which was set up as a pilot project some ten years ago.  It is a play centre for families where one of the parents does not live in the family home and these are referred to as non-resident parents.  It provides a safe, neutral venue where non-resident parents can spend time with their children in a fun-filled, relaxed environment.  It is very important initiative.

Several issues have been raised by previous speakers.  I will focus on the broadband issue which has been raised by many Senators and which is very important for rural Ireland.  Yesterday's announcement was very unfortunate whereby two tenders were reduced to just one.  Originally, there were three tenders but now we have only one.  Broadband and roads are two of the biggest issues for rural Ireland.  There is a disconnect at the moment.  I equate the lack of broadband with the electrification scheme introduced in the 1950s and 1960s.  Broadband has been promised to be delivered since 2012.  Broadband services need to be up and running this year.  Yesterday, the Minister said that he hopes a contract will be signed next September and that works will begin by the end of the year.  We have been given deadlines and guidelines, but has any work been done on the ground?  Broadband must be rolled out sooner rather than later.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to come before the House to debate the issue of broadband.

From Cavan to the heart of Europe, I know he will excel in his role and wish him well.<\/p> <p>I call on the Leader to arrange an early debate on broadband.  This is not a new issue but it is one which gives rise to frustration.  Since I came into this House in 2007, we have discussed the roll-out and availability of broadband.  So far, that has not happened.  The urban centres and populated areas have been provided with broadband but rural Ireland has not.  A lack of broadband in rural Ireland has detrimental effects.  I know that young college students from my county, Donegal, do not travel home at weekends because they cannot study due to a lack of broadband in rural parts of the county.<\/p> <p>This morning, the Minister said that over 80 of the leading experts on broadband provision in Europe are working within his Department on the contract.  Eir was one of the bidders but it pulled out because the contract is too complicated and we have been left with just one bidder.  We have a monopoly situation and the final bidder can seek whatever price it wishes to be paid to provide the service.  Such a situation is unacceptable, ineffective and inefficient.  The State is working on the contract but I am not sure that it is best placed to do so.  The taxpayer may be left to carry the can.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the matter as soon as possible.  Obviously, the wheels have come off the wagon inside the Department.  The officials either have gone with a process that is too complicated and cumbersome or Eir pulled out for commercial reasons.  However, we can only speculate because we do not have the information.  The Minister has an obligation to come to the House and answer our questions.  This could turn into a national scandal of unprecedented proportions unless we deal with it effectively.  We are not looking for a state-of-the-art, world-class broadband in very remote rural homes.  We are looking for a service.  We do not have to be the world leader in providing broadband.  There is no broadband service in certain parts of the country yet there has been talk about a service that is equivalent to that provided in the centre of New York.  People must get real.

As the economy expands, as we try to create jobs and even socially, we are part of a global village.  One is really outside the loop if there is no access to high-speed broadband, which is the standard for which we must continue to strive.  It is incorrect to say that broadband was promised but has not been delivered.  Each week, 300 farms in rural Ireland get access to high-speed broadband.  When this Government took power, only 50% of households and premises had broadband.  The figure has increased to 71%.  I hope it will be 77% by the end of the year as Eir continues to roll out the contract it signed with the Government.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michelle Mulherin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Nonetheless, I am very ambitious for the area I come from, which is a highly rural area.

There are still commitments on this, namely, that we should and ought to have broadband and I am not giving up on those.  There is a will across the House and all sectors that it should happen.  We are attempting to roll out broadband to more than 90% of premises within the timeframe we are talking about.  It is pretty much unprecedented for a state to intervene in this way in the rolling out of broadband.

It is a tremendous honour for him, his family, for Cavan and for the Oireachtas that he has been elected to that position.  Congratulations to him.<\/p> <p>I thank the 13 Members of the House for the their contributions on the Order of Business.  Nine members, Senators Mark Daly, Gavan, Joe O'Reilly, Leyden, &Oacute; Clochartaigh, Wilson, Lombard, Mulherin and &Oacute; Domhnaill raised issues almost stretching from the Old Testament to the New Testament about the need for broadband and it is perhaps apt on L&aacute; Fh&eacute;ile Bhr&iacute;de, on the first day of spring which is a day of hope and renewal, that we commit, as the Minister, Deputy Naughten, has done to the provision of broadband.  We would all agree that we have been waiting far too long for broadband but as Senator Mulherin rightly said, which has been lost by some Members opposite, the provision of high speed broadband increased from 51%, 19 months ago, to 71% and to 77% by the end of the year in many parts of the country.  As Senator Mulherin said, 300 farms per week are receiving high speed broadband.  A point on which I agree completely with Senator Gavan is that we sold off Eircom on day 1 and it has been asset stripped since then.  Therein lies part of the problem in terms of the issue we face today.  I am glad Senator Wilson has belatedly come to the table to recognise the importance of what we have just said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020100002#L00400","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1517481000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I was always of that opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020100002#L00500","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1517481000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Good.

A Sheanad&oacute;ir&iacute;, I am delighted to speak to you today on L&aacute; Fh&eacute;ile Bhr&iacute;de, St. Brigid's Feast Day, a date which also marks the first day of spring. \u00a0 In pagan times today was known as \"Imbolc\" &ndash; a time for making plans and renewing strength.  Today&rsquo;s speech, on my first occasion here as Taoiseach, is inspired by these themes.<\/p> <p>Instead of providing Senators with an account of the business of Government, telling you how well the economy is doing, and how we are facing the challenges of Brexit, housing and health care, issues on which you are already well informed, I want to share with you some thoughts on the renewal and reform of Irish politics.<\/p> <p>Sometimes we have to step back a little to see how much things have really changed. \u00a0Seven years ago when Fine Gael - the party I lead - came into government with its then partners in the Labour Party we proposed a new approach to politics and proposed to do politics in a different way.  This was a promising a new departure in the day-to-day running of political life.  At that time we talked about a democratic revolution. \u00a0To some it might appear that those promises have not been fulfilled, or at least not fully fulfilled.  The truth is that many things have changed for the better in our new politics. \u00a0\"Old politics\" had its charms but it was a much less palatable vintage.  Three Oireachtas reform packages were introduced by the Government between 2011 and 2016 and the vast majority of these reforms have proven their worth and have been retained.  As it happens, some of these reforms have made the business of minority Government easier than might otherwise have been the case, even though they were not introduced with this in mind.<\/p> <p>I shall outline for Senators some of the reforms introduced in that five-year period.  A secret ballot for the election of the Ceann Comhairle of the D&aacute;il was introduced.  This ensures that the Ceann Comhairle is a creature of the House and not of the Government.  I believe we should do the same for electing the Cathaoirleach of this House, as soon as a vacancy arises or the next time around.  Another reform allows for the allocating of Oireachtas committee chairpersons on the basis of proportionality.  In the past almost all committee chairpersons were from the Government parties.   Committees, therefore, were controlled by Government also.<\/p> <p>We have linked the funding of political parties to the number of female candidates in general elections. \u00a0That has made a real difference to the composition of both Houses.  We still have a long way to go to have gender parity.  Further reform is the pre-legislative scrutiny of Bills.  This has opened up the law-making process like never before, and involves politicians before a Bill is drafted and published.  When taken, this is a major transfer of influence and power away from civil servants and Ministers to parliamentarians.<\/p> <p>We have also allowed Deputies an opportunity to bring their Private Members&rsquo; Bills to the floor of the D&aacute;il and Seanad, more of which have been enacted in the last five years than the 50 years before. \u00a0These include legislation to ban fracking and an end to the ban on opening pubs on Good Friday, which was signed into law by the President this week.  Those are just two examples, there are many more.<\/p> <p>The people, perhaps in their wisdom, decided not to extend the remit of Oireachtas inquiries.  While we did put forward the idea, the people also decided not to lower the minimum age from 35 for election to the office of President.  I am aware that this level of reform was perhaps, for many, a case of a lot done but more to do.<\/p> <p>Following the 2016 general election, a D&aacute;il reform committee was established and it recommended a further package of reforms, which I shall outline.  A Business Committee chaired by the Ceann Comhairle sets the D&aacute;il agenda. \u00a0It is no longer set by the Government, but that has not stopped Deputies asking me almost daily to allocate time to debate a particular matter.  A budget committee empowers the Oireachtas to play a more meaningful role in the budget cycle.  An independent parliamentary budget office has been set up.  There is greater use of all-party committees to seek consensus on the best way forward, such as the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, chaired so well by a Member of this House, Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  There has also been an expansion of the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser.  There is an end to the use of the guillotine in debates and more time is made available to the Opposition for Private Members' business.<\/p> <p>Some of the reforms have had unforeseen consequences, including the disproportionate speaking time for smaller parties.  This can often make it difficult for Government backbenchers to have their say.  There has also been a significant reduction in D&aacute;il time available to the Government to pursue its own legislation.  I believe, and I have said before, that a rebalancing is needed in this regard.  I also believe that the significant increase in the number of Private Members' Bills now being published without any form of prior scrutiny or quality control is a cause for concern for all of us.  There are currently more than 100 Private Members' Bills on Second Stage and 25 are awaiting money messages. \u00a0Government Bills do not make it to Second Stage without proper scrutiny from the Office of the Attorney General, pre-legislative committee hearings, the heads of the Bill published well in advance and usually published, in almost all cases, at least two weeks before a Bill is debated. \u00a0We should not accept a lower standard for other legislation from any other source.<\/p> <p>The vast majority of the changes, however, have benefitted Irish democracy and the reforms have helped to reinvigorate our Parliament, our Oireachtas and old institutions.  The Oireachtas has also passed legislation to ensure greater openness and transparency.  The Regulation of Lobbying Act, for example, was a major step forward in terms of transparency.  We now know who lobbied whom, when and about what.  This was clouded and opaque for many decades.<\/p> <p>There is also an effective ban on corporate donations ensuring that powerful organisations and the very rich can no longer use their wealth to influence politics in the way they did in the past. \u00a0It is so different and so much better than other countries where big money has far too much influence on policy.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">The Taoiseach:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2192\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have also had a major reform of the public appointments system with an open call through <i>www.stateboards.ie<\/i>and the appearance of chairpersons designate before the relevant Oireachtas committees.<br\/><br\/>We have also embarked a major programme of constitutional change and reform.  The 1937 Constitution, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, has served us well.\u00a0 As we move closer to 2037 and its centenary, however, there are, inevitably, elements that are outdated and which require renovation and renewal. \u00a0Whereas there were ten amendments to the Constitution in its first 50 years, there have been almost three times as many in the last 30 years.  This year's referendum on the eighth amendment will be the 36th such proposal.<br\/><br\/>To help us to modernise our Constitution, we established the Convention on the Constitution and later the Citizens' Assembly.  Both were bold and innovative exercises in deliberative democracy even though at the time they were dismissed by some as mere talking shops or as a means to long-finger important or difficult decisions.  As it turned out, both allowed representative groups of everyday citizens to consider important issues facing our society.\u00a0 Their work has help helped inform and shape our political decisions.  Often, they proved to be ahead of us in terms of opinion.  We got an invaluable insight into what really matters to people and the conclusions they would come to if given all of the facts and the time to consider them.  The marriage equality referendum and amendment was the most transformative outcome from that process to date.<br\/><br\/>The Government has also accepted the case for a referendum on a number of other issues, namely: giving citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections; removing the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution; and amending the outdated Article on a woman's life within the home.  The Government is committed to holding referendums on these issues over the course of the next two years.<br\/><br\/>The Citizens' Assembly has also submitted reports to the Oireachtas on the eighth amendment and how best to respond to the challenges and opportunities of an ageing population. \u00a0It has\u00a0finalised its discussion of the manner in which referendums are held and how the State can make Ireland a leader in tackling climate change. \u00a0By the end of next month, it will have completed its discussion of fixed-term parliaments, which is an interesting proposal.  It would certainly change the culture of Irish politics as it stands if parliaments were for a fixed term.<br\/><br\/>Recognising the importance of the issue of the eighth amendment to the Constitution, the assembly was asked to consider this matter first. \u00a0The assembly's report was then considered by a special joint Oireachtas committee, ably chaired by a Member of this House, Senator Noone. \u00a0The Government responded earlier this week.  Any amendment of our Constitution requires careful consideration. \u00a0Some of these proposed amendments are matters of conscience and, as such, it is crucial that debate should be respectful of all sides and strands of opinion, and never personalised.<br\/><br\/>In the 18th century, Montesquieu believed that a bicameral legislature was superior because the two parts would ensure that one checked the other through the mutual privilege of refusal. \u00a0That great founding father of America, Alexander Hamilton, likewise believed that two chambers were necessary to prevent a tyranny of the majority.  Nonetheless, many countries, particularly small ones, get by just fine with only one chamber.<br\/><br\/>Following Independence, our forebears decided that two chambers were needed in Ireland and the Free State Senate in particular brought together a diverse collection of men and women, poets and thinkers, specialists and innovators. \u00a0There was also a deliberate effort in the Free State Senate to ensure that minority views were represented, especially Protestant and unionist voices. \u00a0The Senate was a place where courageous and outspoken things were said.  In fact, the Chamber was threatened by anti-treaty forces during the Civil War and 14 Senators were targeted with assassination.  Many had their houses burnt.<br\/><br\/>Times changed.  In the 1930s, there was much debate about whether a second chamber was needed in Ireland and the Free State Senate was abolished by Fianna F&aacute;il.  &Eacute;amon de Valera claimed in 1934 that he had not heard a single good argument to convince him that a second chamber was either necessary or fundamentally useful.  However, he was prepared to listen to other arguments and the proposal for the Seanad was included in the 1937 Constitution. \u00a0It very much followed the corporatist model which was fashionable at the time, deriving from a Papal encyclical, with panels representing industry and commerce, culture and education, labour, agriculture and administration.  Members of this House will be familiar with these panels.  The idea was that the Seanad would not duplicate or impede the D&aacute;il. \u00a0In fact, the Constitution is very clear that the Government should be accountable to the D&aacute;il.  It does not say that about the Seanad.<br\/><br\/>The Seanad's true role is to be a check and balance on the D&aacute;il. \u00a0&Eacute;amon de Valera said he believed the Seanad could be a revising Chamber, taking up measures, criticising them from an independent standpoint and with as great a variety of viewpoints as possible.  Interestingly, he admitted that he worked on the basis that &quot;even if we cannot get an ideal Seanad, then a bad Seanad is better than no Seanad&quot;.  In 2013, when the question was put to the people, a majority felt the same way.  They rejected the Government's proposal to abolish the Seanad but they did not endorse the <i>status quo<\/i>either.  I believe they wanted reform.<br\/><br\/>Many formidable individuals have served in this House since its creation and it has provided a platform for some of the most articulate and determined voices from across the political spectrum.  Nevertheless, I do not believe that the Seanad has sufficiently fulfilled its role as a revising Chamber or as an independent voice in decades gone by.  In 2013, I supported the referendum to abolish this House as I was not convinced by those who argued it was possible to reform it. \u00a0I did not believe this would happen as those opposed to abolition were not united on what a reformed Seanad would look like or how it would function.  However the people have spoken, the matter is settled and it will not be revisited.<br\/><br\/>As is so often the case, everyone it seems supports reform, but they are much less enthusiastic about change; reform being the philosophy and change being the fact of it happening.  As Senators know, an independent working group on Seanad reform was established by my forebear in December 2014 to examine possible reforms of the Seanad electoral system within the confines of the Constitution.  The group, ably chaired by a distinguished former Senator, Dr. Maurice Manning, reported in 2015. \u00a0The Programme for A Partnership Government commits us to pursue the implementation of the report. \u00a0I am happy to do so.  Senators will know that both Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance are keen to press ahead with this.  I want to give reform a chance and to see what we can do to implement, on a phased basis, the Manning recommendations.<br\/><br\/>As such, I have decided that a Seanad committee should be established with an eight-month mandate to consider the Manning report and develop specific proposals to legislate for Seanad reform.  It is proposed that this committee will comprise Members of the Oireachtas with the assistance of outside experts, as appropriate.  I intend to write to party and group leaders inviting them to nominate members of the committee.  It is important that all groups are represented and also that it be representative.  In composition, therefore, it may follow the model of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare and the Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.  This will be done as soon as I can find a chairperson acceptable to all sides.  The proposed timeframe is to facilitate changes that will be used to elect the Members of the Seanad after the next one.<br\/><br\/>Among the recommendations to be explored is the idea of giving the vote in Seanad elections to all citizens wherever they reside in the world. \u00a0There could be universal suffrage using the panel system allowing people to choose which one suits them best. \u00a0There is provision in the Manning report for online registration of voters and the downloading of ballot papers. \u00a0However, the Constitution requires a secret, postal vote election and that creates a complication.<br\/><br\/>The university panels should be retained as recommended. \u00a0They have served us well, although they should be reformed to implement the result of the 1979 referendum and open up the franchise to graduates of all higher level institutions of education.  The Taoiseach will continue to nominate 11 Senators, as that is also a constitutional requirement. \u00a0Councillors will still elect Members to the Seanad, but not as many as they do now.<br\/><br\/>The logistical complications of requiring everyone to register to vote and to select a panel are significant.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">The Taoiseach:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2192\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It will require a major public information campaign and a global postal election will be expensive and cumbersome, so I do not underestimate the difficulties.  People will have to decide for which panel they wish to register, with the most important principle being that one can only have one vote and so can only join one panel.  However, I have absolute confidence that it will be possible to find ways of implementing the resolutions or finding workable alternatives.  The committee may recommend other changes which will also be explored and debated.<\/p><p>When defending the principle of a second Chamber, John A. Costello praised Senators for \"unselfishly placing their experience and their knowledge\" in the service of successive Governments and the country.  Throughout history, the great strength of the Seanad has been the diversity of that experience and knowledge.  That is its shining quality.  We should seek to elect Senators from nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland in order that the Seanad has an all-island dimension and provides different voices on issues which concern us all.  As Ireland takes its place among the nations of the world, the voices of Irish people around the world should also be represented and heard.  I support the election of more Senators to represent our diaspora and add to the good work of people such as Senator Lawless.  One of the finest people to serve in the Upper Chamber was William Butler Yeats.  When defending the Seanad from its critics, he said, \"if you are to create and preserve a habit of service, you must trust that habit and be ready to prefer integrity to any kind of weight and measure\".  It is time for us to do the same. <\/p><p>In ancient times, people on this day, the feast of Imbolc, would look for signs of what the weather would be like in the months ahead.  If a serpent or, later, a badger came above ground, it was a sign of bad things to come.  The tradition crossed the Atlantic and is now celebrated in the United States and Canada as Groundhog Day.  When we talk about renewing Irish politics in a general sense, or reforming the Seanad to give a specific example, it can often feel like Groundhog Day.   It seems we are condemned to do the same thing over and over, often repeating the same mistakes, with little or nothing changing.  In 2018, we have an opportunity to break that cycle and build a new political landscape which will renew the relationship between the Irish people and their Oireachtas.  We can achieve the kind of genuine reforms that people in this Chamber have been advocating for a very long time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020100002#Z00300","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517481000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Ar son Fhianna F&aacute;il, cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Taoiseach go dt&iacute; an Seanad inniu.  Ba mhaith liom freisin comhghairdeas a ghabh&aacute;il leis go pearsanta ar a phost nua mar Thaoiseach.  It is a great achievement for the Taoiseach to be elected to his office and to be the youngest Taoiseach Ireland has ever had.  It is a great personal achievement of which he and his family can rightly be proud.  He has now been Taoiseach for seven months and he and the country have been faced with many domestic and international challenges.<\/p><p>The confidence and supply agreement which facilitates the Fine Gael-led minority Government is new to all Members.  The result of the most recent general election did not allow for a majority Government to be formed and that has introduced a new type of politics, although not necessarily new politics, to both Houses.  There have been some achievements under the agreement, such as the introduction of the first two progressive budgets in five years, but there have also been many disappointments in regard to delivery, in particular in housing, health and justice.  The Government must do more to deliver commitments in those areas.  It is not acceptable to any Member that over 8,000 people are housed in emergency accommodation.  Even if those figures are, as the Taoiseach said, below international norms, it is not and never should be acceptable in Ireland.  Families should not be brought up in hotel rooms and nor should 3,000 children be living for months on end in hotels.  There are over 95,000 people on social housing waiting lists but very few social houses are being built.  Some would say that there have been more announcements made than houses built.  The slowness in introducing initiatives to build social and affordable houses is beginning to impact, in particular on young couples and families paying exorbitant rents.  The Taoiseach is aware this is also impeding our ability to attract foreign direct investment to Dublin and the surrounding areas following Brexit.  The Bank of America, which has recently decided to move to Dublin, has commented that the housing crisis here is causing it a big problem.  This will create a negative reputation for Ireland, which must be avoided at all costs.<\/p><p>As Members know, Brexit is one of the greatest challenges Ireland has faced in many decades but the opportunities it presents should not be lost.  Brexit is not some distant issue; rather, it is already under way and causing damage.  Companies in all parts of Ireland are suffering because of a combination of uncertainty and the chronic weakness of the British currency, which is directly linked to Brexit.  Now that phase one is over and we head into the most difficult phase of Brexit negotiations, it is important to review where we are and the key challenges we face.  In light of the instability in Westminster, the major contradictions in the agreement and the deterioration of key relationships which have been exposed in recent weeks, far more reflection is needed.  It would be an enormous error to believe that everything is settled.  The repeated statements by the Prime Minister, Theresa May, on the United Kingdom's confirmed decision to leave the customs union and the Single Market still pose major challenges in spite of the agreement of 8 December.  The German ambassador to the United Kingdom yesterday gave an interview to <i>The Guardian<\/i>newspaper in which he stated that if the United Kingdom leaves the customs union, there will have to be a border between North and South.  All Members agree that should be avoided at all costs.<\/p><p>Brexit remains a deep and urgent threat to Ireland and I welcome the all-party approach to protecting the interests of the people of Ireland under the Good Friday Agreement.  The core Brexit challenge for us all is how to limit the damage it does because there is no possible scenario whereby no damage is done to Ireland.  The documents that were this week leaked in London illustrated the sectoral damage that would be done in the UK and Northern Ireland and this shows one of the areas that would be adversely affected.  If Ireland were to be given a special or unique status, challenges could be tackled or avoided in many areas.  I ask the Taoiseach to outline whether sectoral plans are going to be published in the Republic and if he can confirm whether work is ongoing on the issue.  I wish him well in his continued endeavours on Brexit and I assure him of Fianna F&aacute;il support on this crucially important issue.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that domestic economic indicators have improved, in particular in the past two years, and that unemployment is at 5.1%  However, behind those positive macroeconomic indicators, many people are still struggling and cannot be ignored.  In large pockets of Dublin, drugs are rampant and crime is on the increase.  All Members agree that the appalling and brutal gangland killings should be condemned outright.  We all agree that the armed response unit should be properly resourced to pre-empt and monitor the gangs.  We also need to tackle the insidious poverty traps that lead young teenagers into the drug and gangland scene.<\/p><p>Many people are still living in or at risk of property, even among those who are working because many are in low-paid and temporary part-time work.  More people now hold down two part-time jobs and job insecurity is far more common.  The ESRI yesterday published research that revealed a notable gap in the rate of persistent deprivation experienced by vulnerable adults, including lone parents and adults with a disability and that experienced by other adults.  The findings show that the persistent deprivation rate is 26 percentage points higher for lone parents and 14 percentage points higher for adults with a disability than for other adults.  Although the Government has committed to signing the UN Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which is welcome, there are more practical supports that would make a world of difference to allow people with disabilities have better independence.  Unfortunately, the way health budgets are negotiated and allocated leaves much to be desired.  Every Senator in the House is inundated with complaints from young and older people who cannot access health services.  Some children in need of assessments for speech and language therapy have languished on lists for over two years before even attending school.  Older people are waiting over 17 months for knee and hip replacements.  Ministers have repeatedly agreed budgets and promised higher levels of service than is being delivered.  The Taoiseach has said that money is not the answer and it may not be, but the consistent problems of waiting lists and overcrowding in emergency departments will not go away without a determination to fix them.<\/p><p>I conclude by welcoming the Seanad reform group.  All Senators and Deputies on the group will make short, medium and long-term achievable recommendations to best reform, improve our franchise and ensure we serve the citizens as best we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018020100002#BB00200","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1517481000,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House.
