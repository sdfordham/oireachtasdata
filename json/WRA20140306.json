The Bank of Ireland at College Green is one of the most iconic buildings in Dublin City.  It was the first purpose-built Parliament in Europe, completed in 1739, and served as Ireland&rsquo;s Parliament until the Act of Union in 1801.<\/p><p>  The space for the Centre will be made available to the State for a ten year period, to run alongside the Decade of Centenaries.  It is envisaged that exhibitions at the Centre will include a significant focus on key events in Irish history &ndash; up to the centenary of the Civil War &ndash; which led to the creation of modern Ireland, whilst also including a strong cultural component.<\/p><p>  Bank of Ireland will cover the costs of refurbishing the space and operating the Centre.  My Department, in partnership with the Bank, will manage, operate and animate the Centre.  I very much welcome Bank of Ireland's decision to make the space available and would like to thank it for strongly supporting this initiative.<\/p><p>  I will shortly be establishing an expert committee drawn from the National Cultural Institutions and other city institutions to advise me on a suitable programme of exhibitions and events at the new Centre.

The nomination process is initiated by the State authorities drawing up a Tentative List of what they consider to be the most important heritage sites within their national boundaries.  A particular criterion is that a site must be considered to be of outstanding universal value, defined by UNESCO as meaning of &ldquo;<i>cultural and or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations of all humanity.<\/i>&rdquo;<\/p><p>  Following a public consultation process and consideration by an expert advisory group, a new Tentative List for Ireland was approved and submitted to UNESCO in March 2010 containing the following sites:<\/p><p>  -  The Burren;<\/p><p>  -  The C&eacute;ide Fields and the North West Mayo Boglands;<\/p><p>  -  The Monastic City of Clonmacnoise and its Cultural Landscape; <\/p><p>  -  The Historic City of Dublin;<\/p><p>  -  Early Medieval Monastic Sites;<\/p><p>  -  The Royal Sites of Ireland, including potentially Navan Fort in Armagh; and<\/p><p>  -  The Western Stone Forts.<\/p><p>  The nomination of a property to the World Heritage List is a significant undertaking that requires the development of comprehensive nomination documentation, including a management plan for the property.  Following submission of a nomination to UNESCO, it is evaluated by three advisory bodies:<\/p><p>  -  the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS);<\/p><p>  -  the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN); and<\/p><p>  -  the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property(ICCROM).<\/p><p>  Once the site has been evaluated, the intergovernmental World Heritage Committee makes the final decision regarding the site&rsquo;s inclusion on the World Heritage List.  <\/p><p>  In order to further progress the nomination process, I hosted a seminar in September 2013 to consider the extent of local interest in pursuing World Heritage nomination for the sites on the current Tentative List and to clarify all the elements involved in applying for and retaining such status.  On foot of the seminar, my Department has been in ongoing contact with relevant local authorities and community representatives to further clarify the significant research and other requirements involved in preparing nomination documentation.  I am confident that this process will create a substantive basis for advancing one or more sites from the current Tentative List towards inscription on the World Heritage list.  <\/p><p>  Against that background, my immediate priority will be to achieve progress with UNESCO inscriptions from the current Tentative List and it would be premature at this point to speculate as to when the next review of the Tentative List might take place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600050#WRA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Natural Heritage Areas Designation","counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600050#WRA01313"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[10560\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600050#WRA01350","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will list the bogs that he plans to close to turf cutting on foot of the publication of the review of raised bog natural heritage areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Turf-cutters on these sites will require consent from my Department before cutting this year. <\/p><p>  My Department has written directly to over 3,600 landowners who may have an interest in these NHAs where consent will be required from this year.

Unfortunately, the ship has deteriorated substantially in the past 20 years and presents a real risk in the Grand Canal Basin, in the heart of Dublin's Docklands. In April 2013, a report on the hull condition of the vessel, commissioned by its owners, highlighted serious safety concerns. Based on the report&rsquo;s findings, the Irish Nautical Trust issued a &lsquo;<i>Notice to Vacate<\/i>&rsquo; to both of the businesses that had been operating from the vessel. I am advised that very significant investment would be required to preserve the already unstable hull of the vessel and to bring the vessel to the point where it would be safe and insurable. I am further advised that the vessel's owners do not have the financial resources to deal with these issues. In the circumstances, Waterways Ireland offered to arrange for the removal and disposal of the ship on behalf of the Irish Nautical Trust.  Waterways Ireland made this offer as the property owners of the Grand Canal Dock because of the continuing serious risk posed by the condition of the Naomh &Eacute;anna, the disruption and expense that would be involved were it to sink in the Grand Canal Dock and the absence of any firm indication that the very significant level finance required to make it safe and insurable was potentially available.

They have since had a number of further meetings with my Department to discuss and clarify various aspects of the detailed conditions set out in consent order with the objective of ensuring that their final designs for the approved works are fully compliant with what I have prescribed.  My understanding is that those designs will be submitted to me very shortly to verify that they are in compliance with the consent order.  They will be assessed as quickly as possible on receipt.<\/p><p>  The National Asset Management Agency has recently confirmed to my Department that it will make the necessary funding available for the works covered by my consent.  This adds considerably to the prospects of a fitting tribute to the 1916 leaders being in place in Moore St in time for the centenary of the Rising.  I understand that Chartered Land has also indicated to my Department that it could be expected to bring the approved works to completion within that timeframe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600051#WRB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Film Industry Promotion","counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600051#WRB02300"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[10702\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600051#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the discussions he has had with the film industry; his strategy to grow the film industry here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>The Irish Film Board (IFB) has primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland, in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions.

Following consultations between my Department, the IFB and the Department of Finance, a number of changes to section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (Film Tax Relief Scheme) are being introduced to ensure that Ireland retains or regains competitiveness in attracting foreign film projects to Ireland. The scheme was extended to the end of 2020 in the 2013 Finance Act and further changes were announced by the Minister for Finance in his 2014 budget speech.  The budget announcement brings forward the new regime for film tax reliefs to 2015, and extends the definition of 'eligible individual' in the scheme for film relief to include non-EU talent.

In order to pilot the HTI, three towns &ndash; Listowel, County Kerry, Westport, County Mayo, and Youghal, County Cork &ndash; were chosen, based on their respective typologies in terms of their geographical locations, form and evolution, and distinct local heritage. The key objective of this HTI pilot is that the cultural heritage of historic towns can be used to create a desirable place in which to live, do business and to visit.  With leadership and vision, this initiative can also help generate economic benefits that will enable the historic town to prosper, such as increased visitor numbers and decreased numbers of vacant buildings and commercial premises.   A framework document was launched in February 2013 and a working group convened to represent the three partner organisations and town councils in order to develop the framework for the implementation of the pilot phase.  The initiative is currently ongoing and my Department has allocated &euro;240,000 in capital funds in 2013 divided between the three towns. Funding was also allocated by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to the towns in 2013 and each town made an additional contribution in the form of direct financial aid or contribution-in-kind.<\/p><p>  To date the initiative has resulted in a series of innovative programmes of works which have enhanced the heritage character of each town.  The pilot phase is due to be completed in mid-2014, following which the operation of the initiative will be reviewed.  At that stage I will consider the future expansion of the initiative to other historic towns, along with participating criteria for historic towns.

The principal peat forming bog mosses require water tables over, at or slightly below the bog surface for most of the year and water levels rarely drop more than 20cms below the bog surface even during dry summer weather. These acid and permanently wet conditions minimise decomposition of the biomass produced by the plants each year. This in turn leads to the accumulation of the partially decomposed plant material known as peat.  Peat accumulation proceeds slowly at an average rate of only 1-2mm\/year or approximately 1 metre every 1,000 years. This habitat now occupies just over 1,210ha in the Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), down from an estimated 1,940 in 1994 and over 99% less than the area it once occupied in Ireland. Even in the raised bog SACs, the active bog habitat now only covers less than 12% of the remaining high bog area whereas, in intact bogs, it would occupy almost 100%.<\/p><p>  This habitat is very sensitive to any changes in water levels caused by the installation of drains, by increases in horizontal runoff rates due to increased surface slopes, or changes in directions of surface flows. Water levels can also be affected by increased vertical losses due to development of cracks or swallow holes or increased hydraulic gradients between the surface and base of the bog. Both drainage and turf cutting can cause such adverse hydrological changes with consequent widespread ecological impacts. These adverse changes cannot be reversed unless the hydrology of the area becomes suitable once more for peat growth. Unfortunately some of the changes arising from drainage and turf cutting are irreversible and can greatly reduce the potential for restoration to active bog habitat. Severe fires can also damage the vegetation and surface peat layers of the bog and temporarily halt peat growth even in actively growing bogs. Fires can also speed up the drying out process if it is already underway and dried out bogs are much more susceptible to further fire damage.<\/p><p>  The area of active raised bog at a national level has been assessed as <i>Unfavourable Bad-Decreasing<\/i> - the lowest possible ranking under the Habitats Directive assessment system. Its extent has decreased in both reporting periods up to 2013 and 2007. These assessments were based on changes in the area of active raised bog mapped during the baseline survey in 1994-5 and two monitoring surveys in 2004-5 and 2011-13. In both monitoring periods almost all bogs surveyed were within the SACs and therefore the results are representative of the condition of the raised bogs in the SAC network. The basic mapping methods were similar for all 3 surveys but the availability and use of GPS microcomputers, in the field, has undoubtedly improved the accuracy of the mapping in the 2007 and 2013 reporting periods. When comparing results from the different surveys, efforts are made to ensure consistency of interpretation between the different survey dates.<\/p><p>  The results of the most recent monitoring survey in 2011-13 showed a slight decrease of approx. 1.5% in the area of active raised bog when compared to the results of the 20004-5 monitoring survey. This loss is substantially smaller than the 25% - 36.8% decrease shown  when the results of the 20004-5 monitoring survey are compared with the results of the  baseline survey in 1994-5. In addition, comparison of 1990s and 2004\/05 vegetation descriptions indicated that there were significant declines in habitat quality as the wettest vegetation types in the active bog habitat were much more severely impacted. Comparisons of rates of loss between sites identified a strong relationship between habitat losses and the location and intensity of major impacting activities such as turf cutting.<\/p><p>  The slow-down in the rates of loss of Active Raised Bog are considered to be due to a combination of factors. These include acquisition of turbary rights by my Department, the implementation of peat cutting cessation schemes which resulted in a substantial decline in peat cutting rates overall and a complete cessation in some sites, the fact that practically no new drainage took place on the high bog in the new reporting period (2007-2012) and the positive effects of restoration works undertaken with many sites developing new active peat forming areas. The adverse effects of extensive drainage works undertaken in the 1980s and early 1990s period would have continued to cause major habitat losses in the 1994\/95-2004\/05 period.<\/p><p>  However, this rate of loss would be expected to decrease over time as all the more vulnerable areas were impacted initially. In addition, the natural blockage of drains by slumping and Sphagnum growth would have further reduced the drainage impact and therefore the rate of loss. It is estimated that there was 51ha of active raised bog lost during this period but that this was offset by the successful restoration of 38 ha of active bog on 12 bogs leaving a net loss of 13ha. In addition, the restoration works on those bogs and on another 9 SACs would have slowed the rate of loss of active bog and improved the condition of the non-active bog habitat. It takes at least a decade for restoration works to restore significant areas of active bog.<\/p><p>  It is hoped that, in the next Habitat Directive reporting period (2019), a stabilisation in the area of active bog can be reported but that will depend on our ability to prevent further damaging impacts and, with community support, implement a program of restoration works. If we can do that we can look forward to significant increase in active bog at the following reporting period in 2025.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600051#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme Application Numbers","counter":54,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600052#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[10744\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600052#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of turf cutters who applied for the turf compensation scheme that were refused; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[10559\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600052#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the steps he is taking to introduce an appeals process to the turf cutting compensation scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 34 together.<\/p><p>  The qualifying criteria for the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, administered by my Department, are that: <\/p><p>  -  The claimant must have a legal interest in one of the 53 raised bog special areas of conservation &ndash; ownership or turbary right;<\/p><p>  -  The claimant must have been the owner or entitled to exercise turbary rights on the land in question on 25 May 2010;<\/p><p>  -  The turbary on the site must not be exhausted;<\/p><p>  -  The claimant must have been cutting turf on the land in question during the relevant five year period; and<\/p><p>  -  No turf cutting or associated activity is ongoing on the property.<\/p><p>  In the event that an applicant is informed that an official of my Department has decided that he\/she does not fulfil the qualifying criteria of the scheme, the applicant may request an internal review of this decision.

Of these, 800 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.    Relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure\/drainage works required, establishing the number that can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements. In that regard, Bord na M&oacute;na has assessed in the region of 100 potential relocation sites at the request of my Department. Bord na M&oacute;na has also commenced negotiations with landowners in relation to the purchase or long-term lease of sites.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding this complexity, progress in relocating turf cutters to non-designated bogs is being achieved in a number of cases.<\/p><p>  Arrangements for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs have been made as regards a group from Clara Bog special area of conservation in County Offaly and a group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog special areas of conservation in County Galway. The group from Clara Bog commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June 2012, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have now been accommodated. Turf cutting for the 2013 season took place on this site in April last.

Russia&rsquo;s actions are in clear breach of international law and of the obligations to respect Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. I conveyed these concerns to the Russian Ambassador when I met with him on Tuesday afternoon.<\/p><p>  On Monday 3rd March, EU High Representative Ashton convened an extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) to discuss the situation in Ukraine and, in particular, on the Crimean peninsula. Ministers adopted Conclusions that strongly condemned the violation of Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty by the Russian armed forces as well as the authorisation given by the Federation Council of Russia on 1 March for the use of the armed forces on the territory of Ukraine. The Council agreed that these actions are in clear breach of the UN Charter and the OSCE Helsinki Final Act, as well as of Russia's specific commitments to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity under the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 and the bilateral Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership of 1997. We called on Russia to immediately withdraw its armed forces to the areas of their permanent stationing, in accordance with the Agreement on the Status and Conditions of the Black Sea Fleet stationing on the territory of Ukraine of 1997.<\/p><p>  The Council indicated that in the absence of de-escalating steps by Russia, the EU shall decide about consequences for bilateral relations between the EU and Russia, for instance suspending bilateral talks on visa matters as well as the New Agreement and would consider further targeted measures.<\/p><p>  The Council also commended the government in Kiev for its measured response so far in the face of this provocation.   In line with the conclusions agreed of the FAC on 20 February, Ministers decided to move swiftly to freeze the assets of those responsible for human rights violations in Ukraine.  <\/p><p>  The EU has called for a peaceful solution to the current crisis and stands ready to engage in talks with all parties to resolve this crisis. We will work with the United Nations and the OSCE to facilitate a peaceful resolution of this dangerous situation. At Monday&rsquo;s FAC, Ministers also agreed that the EU would lend its full support to an international assistance package to address the urgent needs of Ukraine, based on a clear commitment to reforms. We reiterated the EU&rsquo;s offer of an Association Agreement, including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, in order to   bring opportunities for sustainable economic development and prosperity to all the regions of Ukraine, including Crimea, as well as to its neighbours.<\/p><p>  In light of the serious situation in Ukraine, President Van Rompuy is convening a meeting of Heads of State and Government in Brussels today, together with EU Commission President Barroso and High Representative Ashton, in order to exchange views on the ongoing crisis.

Ireland had urged the President to ensure the Bill was not enacted.  I have made it clear that the enactment of this draconian legislation will affect our valued relationship with Uganda.  During my visit to Uganda in December 2013, I met with representatives of human rights groups working on LGTBI issues, and they outlined in stark terms the implications of the then proposed new law for their lives and work.  I assured them of Ireland&rsquo;s continued support in arguing against this regressive Bill.    <\/p><p>  The new legislation is in clear conflict with Uganda&rsquo;s binding international obligations to uphold human rights.  It is in contravention of the principle of non-discrimination in the Ugandan Constitution, in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in the African Charter on Human and People&rsquo;s Rights, both of which have been ratified by Uganda.   It is the responsibility of the Ugandan Government to uphold its international obligations to treat all citizens equally, regardless of their sexual orientation.<\/p><p>  Ireland, together with our EU partners in Uganda, has been actively engaged with the Ugandan Parliament and President Museveni in efforts to halt such discriminatory legislation since it was first proposed in 2009.  We have engaged intensively since the Bill re-entered Parliament unexpectedly in December 2013.  The new law is a threat to Uganda&rsquo;s gay community and an affront to all those who value tolerance, respect and the dignity of all people. It will also undermine public health in a very practical way, including the efforts to combat the scourge of HIV\/AIDS in Uganda. <\/p><p>  Ireland has participated actively in high level discussions within the EU on this issue.  Strong statements have been issued by the High Representative, Catherine Ashton on behalf of the EU and the member states, expressing our deep concern in relation to the legislation. <\/p><p>  When I addressed the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva earlier this week, I highlighted our grave concerns at the enactment of regressive legislation in a number of countries, including Uganda, affecting the rights of LGBTI individuals.  I called on the Human Rights Council to be more vocal on a situation in which the rights of LGBTI people continue to be violated on a daily basis.<\/p><p>  The Government has consistently supported the promotion and protection of the human rights of all persons, irrespective of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and we are strongly committed to combating all human rights violations against individuals on any basis.  Our commitments in this area are fundamental to our foreign policy and our aid programme.  \t<\/p><p>  Our foreign policy approach, our aid programme and our international reputation give Ireland a strong voice, in close cooperation with other partners, on vital human rights issues.  We will continue to work internationally and in Uganda to promote human rights, including LGBTI rights, and to support human rights organisations and institutions, many of which are operating in very difficult environments.  We strongly urge the Ugandan authorities to abolish all laws that contravene human rights obligations, including this regressive new legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600052#WRC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid Expenditure","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600053#WRD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":93,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[11449\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600053#WRD00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the total funding allocation and the likely percentage of GNP he plans for overseas development aid for 2014 to 2016, inclusive, in view of the commitment in the programme for Government to provide 0.7% of GNP by 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, by way of special derogation from the general rule Ireland is permitted to continue to apply the 13.5% reduced rate to the supply of ready-to-pour concrete and certain concrete blocks, but this reduced rate cannot be reduced below 12%.<\/p><p>  I would point out that EU VAT Directive and Irish VAT law provides that building services that consist of the \"renovation and repairing of private dwellings, excluding materials which account for a significant part of the value of the service supplied\" can also benefit from the 13.5% reduced rate of VAT. This means that where a building contractor carries out home improvements and the materials cost does not exceed two-thirds of the cost of the improvements then the 13.5% applies to the total building service.\u00a0 A consequence of this is that a VAT registered building contractor will generally be entitled to recover VAT at the 23% standard rate on most building materials purchased while the contractor is only liable to charge VAT at the 13.5% rate on the total supply (including the materials and the labour elements of the job) to the home owner.\u00a0 The difference in rates between the 23% input VAT and the 13.5% output VAT should normally be reflected in the VAT-inclusive cost to the home owner. In this context, if EU VAT law permitted a reduction in VAT on building materials this would actually favour contractors working in the shadow economy and outside the VAT net as it would reduce their cost base compared to legitimate contractors. <\/p><p>  I introduced the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) to encourage homeowners to carry out a wide range of building work on their home using legitimate, tax compliant contractors. The HRI provides for an income tax credit for homeowners who carry out repair, renovation or improvement work on their only or main residence. Qualifying work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 inclusive of VAT. The maximum qualifying cost for the purpose of the tax credit is &euro;30,000 excluding VAT. Qualifying expenditure is generally services consisting of the construction, demolition, extension, alteration or reconstruction of any building: such services are liable to VAT at the reduced rate of 13.5% unless the value of goods exceeds two-thirds of the total amount charged by the contractor.\u00a0 Where this happens, the contractor will charge VAT at the standard rate of 23% on the total amount and this total amount is excluded from relief under the Incentive.\u00a0\u00a0 Expenditure which is subject to the 23% rate of VAT does not qualify for relief. The effect of the scheme is to give an income tax credit equivalent to the VAT charged on jobs up to &euro;30,000 excluding VAT.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600054#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Loan Book","counter":138,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600054#WRE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":139,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[11446\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600054#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 91 of 13 February 2014, to which he responded by letter on 20 February 2014, if he will confirm the split of the &euro;3.5 billion of par value loans acquired for nil consideration by the National Asset Management Agency, for each of Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide Building Society and the Educational Building Society; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

More than 1,700 posts from the Community Welfare Services and FAS were transferred to the Department. In parallel, I have radically overhauled labour-market activation policies and overseen the transformation of the Department from the passive benefits provider of old to a public employment service that is actively assisting people back to work, training or education. <\/p><p>  Some of the significant reforms to the social welfare and labour market activation systems since I took up office in March 2011 are set out below.<\/p><p>  From welfare to work: Major &ldquo;activation&rdquo; reforms have been introduced to help people back to work. <i>Pathways to Work<\/i>   is the strategy driving these reforms.  The centrepiece of <i>Pathways to Work<\/i>   is Intreo (launched October 2012), the Department&rsquo;s employment service which is replacing old-style social welfare offices. Intreo offices provide jobseekers with both income supports and employment services - like individually tailored personal progression plans and job-search assistance - in the one place.  The Department&rsquo;s staff  have been given powers to reduce payments for jobseekers who refuse to engage with Intreo services. Jobseekers who refuse an appropriate offer of training, or do not attend meetings, can have their payment reduced by up to &euro;44 a week (introduced April 2011). In the first half of 2013, almost 1,500 jobseekers had penalty rates imposed. Jobseekers who continue to refuse engagement, even after a penalty rate has been imposed, can have their payment suspended for up to nine weeks (introduced July 2013). <\/p><p>  Ensuring access to work and that work pays: activation is just one element of the radically new approach to social welfare in Ireland, the purpose of which is to ensure that people are better off in work than on welfare. A progressive new scheme called Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transition was introduced in July 2013 to assist Lone Parents back to work and towards financial independence. The Partial Capacity Benefit scheme was launched in February 2012 to allow people with disabilities avail of employment opportunities while still receiving income support from the Department. The Department is working with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to introduce a Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), to replace Rent Supplement. HAP will subsidise rent for people on welfare and in low-income employment so that they will not lose housing assistance when they move from welfare to work.<\/p><p>  New schemes, more places: this year, the Department will spend more than &euro;1 billion on work, training and education places to benefit 85,000 people &ndash; and the number of such places has steadily increased. JobBridge, the national internship scheme, launched June 2011, has proved a major success. An independent evaluation of the scheme by Indecon Economic Consultants found JobBridge had a progression rate of 61% - meaning three in five participants secure employment after completing their internship. This is one of the best outcomes for such a scheme anywhere in Europe. Almost 20,000 people have participated on JobBridge so far.  Through the Springboard and Momentum programmes, overseen by the Department of Education and the Department of Social Protection, more than 23,000 unemployed people have been able to re-skill for emerging employment opportunities.<\/p><p>   An agreement was secured on an EU-wide Youth Guarantee to provide young people with a good quality offer of employment, education \/ training within four months of becoming unemployed. It will be introduced on a phased basis from 2014.  Internal deployment within the Department will see the number of caseworkers on activation duties doubled by the end of this year.<\/p><p>  Working with employers: the Department now has a dedicated Employer Relations Division, which works with employers to assist them with their recruitment needs and find employees from the Live Register. The Department works hand-in-hand with State agencies such as the IDA to attract overseas investment to Ireland by demonstrating to international companies that their recruitment needs can be met in Ireland.  This is done through &ldquo;job-matching&rdquo; profiles &ndash; matching potential positions with appropriate candidates. JobsPlus is the new employer incentive scheme, launched July 2013, which provides cash grants to businesses which hire persons who have been long-term unemployed. Under the scheme, the State covers approximately &euro;1 in &euro;4 of the typical cost of hiring someone who has been on the Live Register for 12 months or more.<\/p><p>Combating welfare fraud: the Programme for Government commits to maintaining core welfare rates while taking a zero-tolerance approach towards welfare fraud.  The Department&rsquo;s Fraud Initiative 2011-2013 significantly strengthened what is known as &ldquo;control activity&rdquo; &ndash; i.e. rooting out fraud and eliminating overpayments. In 2013, more than 1 million reviews of individual social welfare claims were carried out, and savings of &euro;632 million were achieved through control activity.  Departmental officials have been given a range of additional powers to combat fraud.  Social welfare inspectors now have the powers (introduced in June 2012) to question people at ports and airports whom they believe may be entering the country to claim social welfare payments fraudulently.  Data exchange with Revenue has been considerably enhanced allowing for focused control activity &ndash; particularly in relation to customers who receive means-tested welfare payments but may not have declared all their means to the Department.  The Public Service Card, which involves face-to-face registration and the capture of biometric data to prevent identity abuse, has moved into full production, with well over half a million cards issued to date.  It is now an integral part of claim processing and control activity.<\/p><p>  Legislation was introduced in December 2012 to increase the amount that the Department can recover from an individual&rsquo;s personal weekly payment in cases of overpayment. The Department can now recover up to 15% of a person&rsquo;s payment whereas previously it had been as little as &euro;2 a week.  The Department has conducted a major project to assess the potential of predictive risk analytics to further root out welfare fraud. <\/p><p>  Reforming Existing Schemes: the Department is currently undertaking comprehensive reform of the One-Parent Family Payment (OFP). These reforms are designed to tackle long term welfare dependency and the high rates of lone parents who are at risk of consistent poverty. The reforms see a reduction in the age threshold of the youngest child at which a lone parent is still eligible for the OFP. The age is being reduced to seven years of age on a phased basis to 7 years by 2015<\/p><p>  Changes to the Electricity\/Gas Allowance under the Household Benefits Scheme: recipients of the electricity and gas allowances are now in a more beneficial position as they are currently entitled to &euro;35 per month whether or not they use the energy and any unused portion can either be drawn down and cashed out by the customer or accumulated as a credit on their account.  <\/p><p>  Free Travel variant of the Public Services Card (PSC): the introduction of the new free travel variant of the PSC in December 2013 will help eliminate the fraudulent use of the Free Travel Pass. The new card includes customer photo identification and a number of additional security features. <\/p><p>  The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare: I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare in 2011. This group harnesses expert opinion and experience to address specific issues around the interaction of the tax and social protection systems, and make cost effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes. Three reports have been completed and published:  Child and Family Income Supplement payments (February 2013); Disability Allowance budget changes (April 2013); and PRSI for self-employed (September 2013).  The Advisory Group is now working on its final report, on working age payments (including in work benefits) and is expected to complete this work by mid-year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600057#WRH02000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Guarantee","counter":258,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600057#WRH02050"},{"type":"question","counter":259,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[11249\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600057#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"in relation to the youth guarantee scheme implementation plan, the groups that his Department will be engaging with in the areas (details supplied) for its rollout and implementation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":260,"content":"<p>Implementation of the Youth Guarantee is a medium-term policy of the Irish Government.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 80,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided &euro;403 million in 2013. <\/p><p>  Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme have come into force with effect from Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014. The new rent limits have been determined following an extensive review of the private rental market based on the most up-to-date data available. The Department currently funds up to 30% of the private rented sector so it is essential that the rent limits are kept under review. The new rent limits have been set using the 35th percentile ensuring that sufficient housing is available for recipients of the scheme. <\/p><p>  Under the revised rent limits, there have been increases in the maximum rent limits in Dublin while there have been some reductions across a number of rural counties reflecting the conditions in the rental markets in those counties. Separate to the county limits, higher rent limits have also been provided for in the commuter areas of North Kildare and Bray. <\/p><p>  Recently released figures from the Private Residential Tenancies Board, shows that current rent limits are providing adequate supply levels for both North Kildare and County.  The rent limits in place reflect Kildare&rsquo;s current rental levels agreed between landlord and tenant.  It is recognised that there is a general shortage of rental property available for North Kildare, and to a lesser degree the rest of the County, however, this is in line with national trends and has been factored into the current rent limits in place.<\/p><p>  A key goal of the most recent review was to continue to ensure that rent limits do not distort local market conditions and allow natural levels of supply and demand to set realistic rental values.

The nature of employment within the arts sector encompasses a very wide range of activities, while cultural and heritage tourism is one of the most important elements of Ireland's tourism product.  Its scope can include those engaged in the arts practice within specific artistic genres and can also encompass areas which flow from such artistic pursuits.  It may also embody the whole industrial creative sectors - the foundation of which lies in the pure arts areas.  Accordingly, there are differentiated sets of figures which reflect the differing basis from which employment numbers are derived. <\/p><p>  The arts underpin policies in attracting foreign direct investment, in the creation of an imaginative labour force, in establishing an innovative environment in which the creative and cultural industries can thrive and in the area of cultural tourism.  The arts are a significant economic contributor and employer in their own right and they are also important building blocks for those economic policies which the Government has identified as crucial for our economic recovery.  <\/p><p>  A report entitled<i> An Assessment of the Economic Impact of the Arts in Ireland,<\/i> published by the Arts Council in 2011, updates a previous independent evaluation by consultants Indecon of the economic impact of the arts, published in 2009.  The updated report shows that the arts provide significant direct and indirect employment.  The sector supports 21,328 jobs and contributes &euro;306.8 million in taxes.  The arts also impact on the wider creative industries, such as the advertising sector, architecture, fashion and design, and cultural tourism, contributing &euro;4.7 billion to the economy and supporting 79,000 jobs.<\/p><p>  In April last, Minister Joan Burton and I were pleased to announce a further extension of the successful JobBridge national internship scheme, which will provide for new internships in the arts sector.  In association with the Arts Council, the new strand will provide exciting opportunities for those interested in careers in the arts, allowing them to gain hands-on experience and enhance their skills.  The extension of the scheme will foster emerging talent in the arts and also support local arts groups in theatre, film, visual arts, dance, music, literature and more.  This as an important development because it will help people take the first step towards a career in the arts.  In this sector, there is a long tradition of new entrants working alongside established artists, performers, practitioners and arts administrators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600061#WRM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Promotion","counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600061#WRM01150"},{"type":"question","counter":379,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[11469\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600061#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which he and his Department continue to promote the arts through the education system, with particular reference to primary and second level schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Motor tax classes and rates are provided for in the Schedule to the Finance (Excise Duties)(Vehicles) Act 1952, and changes to the rates of motor tax rates are effected by amendment to the Schedule.  Rates for commercial vehicles are currently based on unladen weight.  Rates for private vehicles registered prior to 1 July 2008 are based on engine capacity, and rates for vehicles registered after that date are based on the CO2 emissions of the vehicle given on the Certificate of Conformity for the vehicle.  All of the foregoing are based on a graduating scale, with higher rates for heavier vehicles or for those with higher carbon emissions.<\/p><p>  There is a separate tax class for large public service vehicles and youth and community buses, where rates are at a concessionary rate of motor tax, depending on the seating capacity of the vehicle.  There are also a number of smaller tax classes, such as hearses, agricultural tractors, vintage and veteran vehicles (i.e. those over 30 years old) etc., most of which carry a concessionary rate of tax, as they are in limited use on the public road.  Certain vehicles are also exempt from paying motor tax, such as ambulances, fire engines and vehicles qualifying under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers )(Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.<\/p><p>  The 1952 Act makes provision for the setting of non-annual periods for taking out a motor tax disc and for the setting of rates for such discs.  Motor tax can currently be paid annually, half-yearly or quarterly.  The half-yearly and quarterly payment options incorporate a surcharge element which covers the administrative and printing costs involved in processing the higher volume of applications. In addition, reminders are issued on each renewal.  The Act also makes provision for the granting of refunds in certain limited circumstances.<\/p><p>  While the operation of the motor tax system is kept under regular review, I have no plans currently to move away from the current basis of charging for motor tax for private vehicles.  A Working Group has been set up, chaired by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, to examine the feasibility of introducing a road charging regime for HGV&rsquo;s in Ireland in the medium term, and I will review the basis of charging for commercial vehicles following the outcome of that review.  Proposals have previously been made to move from taxation of vehicles to taxation of the use of vehicles, through for example increasing the rate of taxation on road fuel.

As the starting point in this process, submissions were invited as part of a preliminary public consultation process. <\/p><p>  540 submissions were subsequently received from private individuals, the wind industry, professional institutes and local authorities. The submissions received were recorded by recipient only as not all submissions were county specific so it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the numbers involved at county level. <\/p><p>  Generally, the industry submissions indicated relatively satisfaction with the 2006 Guidelines. However, the submissions from private individuals sought more specific and stringent revisions of the 2006 Guidelines in relation to noise control measures and the prevention of shadow flicker.<\/p><p>  Three noise related topics were identified as discussion points in the submissions:   <\/p><p>- Setbacks;   <\/p><p>- A-weighted noise levels; <\/p><p>- Special audible characteristics. <\/p><p><b><i>Setbacks<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  A significant number of submissions supported the insertion of a mandatory setback distance and where distances were mentioned, they were generally significantly higher than the 500 metres separation distance referenced in the 2006 Guidelines. Some submissions also suggested that the setback distance should be proportional to turbine size - for example, a separation distance equating to a certain number of rotor blade diameters or multiples of the turbine blade tip height. <\/p><p>Industry submissions were commonly opposed to setting mandatory setbacks, suggesting that they did not provide a means of control which was directly linked to actual noise levels. These submissions also expressed concern that mandatory setbacks at relatively high levels would prohibit the location of wind farms which were otherwise acceptable from the perspective of noise generated at dwellings or other noise sensitive locations. Some industry submissions also stated that setting a fixed mandatory distance would not account for changes in the size or sound generation levels of turbines.   <\/p><p><b><i>A-weighted noise levels<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  The suitability of A-weighted noise limits such as the nominal 43 dB(A) night-time noise limit applied under the UK wind farm noise standards ETSU-R-97 was mentioned in some submissions. In some cases, it was suggested that the A-weighted noise limits did not provide sufficient emphasis on low frequency noise. In other cases, it was suggested that the existing 43 dB(A) limit was inconsistent with recent changes in World Health Organisation Europe&rsquo;s recommended indoor noise levels.   <\/p><p><b><i>Special audible characteristics<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  Infrasound and low frequency noise were mentioned in some submissions where the emphasis was on amenity and the possible health impacts which could arise from these types of sound. The general point was that the 2006 Guidelines did not take these types of sound into account. <\/p><p><b><i>Other Issues <\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  The possibility of negative health impacts from wind farms, relating mainly to noise but also the effects of shadow flicker, was a further issue of concern raised in a number of the submissions. Other issues raised included the perceived deficiencies in the process of assessment of planning applications for wind farms by planning authorities, noise measurement, the lack of information available to the public about proposed wind energy developments, and the lack of adequate public consultation by wind farm developers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600063#WRO00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Priory Hall Development","counter":427,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600063#WRO00450"},{"type":"question","counter":428,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[11434\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600063#WRO00500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the cost to the State to date of resolving issues at Priory Hall; if he will provide an update on the resolution process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":429,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply to Question No 266 of 3 December 2013 which sets out in broad terms the key features of the <i>Priory Hall Resolution Framework<\/i>, as available in the Oireachtas Library, and the implementation group, chaired by Dr Martin McAleese, which has been established by the Government to oversee the effective implementation of the framework.

A report on the consultation is currently being finalised.  Over 200 submissions were received which raised many important issues, including what fishermen themselves see as key to securing a sustainable future for the lobster stocks.  I am advised that three of the submissions received recommended lobster hatcheries to support the fishery.  By contrast, fishermen identified a range of alternatives which received much higher levels of support.     <\/p><p>  Natural recruitment, whereby wild populations are afforded the opportunity to sustain themselves, is the most cost-effective method of stock management in fisheries.  The current v-notching scheme operated by BIM and supported by regulations prohibiting the landing of v-notched lobsters is designed to contribute to natural recruitment. In other countries, hatcheries have been introduced in areas where natural recruitment has collapsed and recovery is unlikely without intervention.  I am advised by BIM and the Marine Institute that, based on the current status of the Irish lobster stocks, management of existing fishing practices in the first instance is considered the most effective means of improving stock levels.  In that regard I look forward to receiving the consultation report and recommendations for future improvements in the management of this fishery.   <\/p><p>  Funding for direct stocking measures such as hatcheries is not available under the current European Fisheries Fund and it is likely that restrictions will continue to apply under the European and Maritime Fisheries Fund regulation to be finalised this year.<\/p><p>  I am favourably disposed to exploring all measures which support stock sustainability. In this context I requested Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) and the Marine Institute for their views on the development of lobster hatcheries. Both BIM and the Marine Institute have raised concerns regarding the efficacy of hatcheries including high operating costs and difficulties in attracting investment on a commercial basis. <\/p><p>  It is therefore clear that, in addition to management of the fishery itself, further careful consideration needs to be given to the potential for lobster hatcheries to supplement wild stocks and I have requested my officials to include recommendations in relation to lobster hatcheries in the report that is currently being prepared for me.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600064#WRP02500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":497,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600064#WRP02550"},{"type":"question","counter":498,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[11396\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600064#WRP02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding headage payments in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":499,"content":"<p>As processing of the application of the person named under the 2013 Disadvantaged Ares Scheme was recently finalised, following confirmation of compliance with the Scheme minimum stocking density requirements, the payment due will issue to the nominated bank account of the person named shortly.<\/p><p>Payments under the 2014 Scheme are scheduled to commence later this year.

The necessary administrative arrangements will be made when the specifics of the legislation are known.<\/p><p>A public consultation process started on 31 January 2014 relating to the content and scope of a new GP contract to underpin the provision of GP care, free at the point of use, for all children aged under six years.  I met with key stakeholders on 31 January - the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP), the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) and the National Association of General Practitioners (NAGP) &ndash; to brief them on Government policy concerning the introduction of a universal GP service without fees and in particular, on the first phase concerning children under 6 years.<\/p><p>  It is my intention to meet with the GP representative bodies in the coming weeks for detailed discussions on the scope and content of the draft contract.  This will afford them the fullest opportunity to raise any and all issues which they may have regarding the draft contract.  It will also enable them to make their own proposals as to how the draft contract may be improved.  Consequently, I have no doubt that there will be changes to the text of the draft contract following the consultation process.<\/p><p>On 27  February 2014, I wrote to the IMO stating that the Department and the HSE are fully prepared to engage meaningfully with them and are prepared to negotiate with them on all aspects of the scope and content of the proposed contract.  However, the ultimate setting of fees must remain a matter for the Minister for Health, though there will be an opportunity for their input on this aspect, and on the fee structure, which it is proposed to address by means of a separate consultation process.  I have formally invited the IMO to meet with the Department and the HSE to commence this process during this week or on another mutually agreeable date if this week does not suit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600069#WRU00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":673,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600069#WRU00950"},{"type":"question","counter":674,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[11369\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014030600069#WRU01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite a full medical card in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":675,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.
