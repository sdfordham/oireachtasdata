The AGRI FISH Council on 15 and 16 December will be the final Council presided over by the Italian Presidency, with Latvia assuming the Presidency role from 1 January 2015.  It is customary for the outgoing Presidency to take stock of developments over the previous six months and this has been reflected in the long agenda for Italian Presidency's final Council meeting.  As is customary in December, Council will be heavily dominated by negotiations on the total allowable catches and fishing quotas for 2015.  Aside from fisheries, the bulk of the items for discussion are progress reports from the Presidency on the state of play of various dossiers discussed during the Italian Presidency or information items from the Commission and the Presidency.<\/p><p>  The fisheries items are of major significance to Ireland.  Discussions will focus on the proposed total allowable catches, TACs, and fishing quotas for 2015.  These discussions are expected to be lengthy, with intense negotiations between member states, prior to agreement on the second day of Council.<\/p><p>  In preparation for the Council, the Department undertook a consultation process with stakeholders seeking their comments on the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for 2015 fishing opportunities, and I arranged a meeting with the stakeholders on Wednesday last, 26 November, to further inform the process.  In line with the programme for Government, I will present a sustainable impact assessment, SIA, to the committee, which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The SIA takes account of the Commission's proposal and the views provided via the public consultation process for all stakeholders.  I will have more to say on this later.<\/p><p>  Turning to agriculture, debates or progress reports are envisaged on a proposed revision of the EU regulations on organics, the school fruit and vegetables and school milk schemes, and the four-part package of proposals on animal and plant health law.  There is also a possible item flagged on the future of the dairy sector.  The Council is also expected to adopt conclusions concerning measures to assist young farmers in the EU &ndash; an issue on which Ireland has been to the forefront - and regarding error rates on expenditure on the CAP &ndash; an issue in which we also have a keen interest.  Under other business, a number of member states will raise the impact of the Russian import ban on EU agrifood products.<\/p><p>  I will be brief on organics as my officials recently provided an update on the progress of this proposal to this committee.  Since then, the Italian Presidency has produced a substantially revised text covering matters such as mixed organic and conventional farming, recourse to non-organic seed and breeding animals and the control regime.  In addition, the incoming Commissioner has indicated a willingness to have a fresh look at its original proposal.  What that means, in practical terms, is that the Presidency will seek at Council to obtain agreement from the Council on these particular issues so that it can open discussions with the European Parliament.<\/p><p>  As to the school fruit and school milk schemes, the Commission proposes to combine the two separate EU co-funded school schemes.  The proposal was introduced under the Greek Presidency, with discussions continuing throughout the Italian Presidency.  There are three main issues outstanding.  There is a difference of opinion between the Commission and the Council as to which article of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union is the correct article for the fixing of the level of aid.  All member states, including Ireland, believe this should be the sole preserve of the Council, while the Commission favours co-decision with the European Parliament.  There are differing views between member states on the scope of products to be eligible for the schemes.  Ireland favours expanding the scope of dairy products to include cheese and yoghurts and fully supports the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to restrict the list of products to fresh fruit and vegetables for the scheme.  There are also differing views on the allocation of funding.  This concerns the method for allocation of EU funding for the milk element of the scheme.  Ireland&rsquo;s view is this funding should be allocated on an objective basis according to the population of school children as a proportion of the overall population, as opposed to allocation based on the historical use of funds, as favoured by some member states who would do well out of it.  These three issues have been the subject of debate for some months without any resolution and it is difficult to see a breakthrough happening at the December Council.<\/p><p>  The Council will also deal with a number of progress reports, the most notable of which are reports on the four-part animal and plant health package.  In May 2013, the Commission launched a legislative package of four regulations dealing with animal health, plant health, seeds and propagating material, and official controls.  The aim was to consolidate existing legislation in these areas into a single legislative framework and, in the course of doing so, to modernise and replace outdated provisions.  The file on animal health is close to being agreed by Council and work is continuing on the plant health and official controls proposals.  After the proposal on seeds and propagating material ran into difficulty in the European Parliament earlier this year, the Commission undertook to engage in extensive redrafting.<\/p><p>  I am aware that a number of Agriculture Councils have taken place since I addressed the committee last May and I would like to mention some of the issues that have dominated proceedings since then.  Since September, the main focus of the Council has been on the impact of the Russian ban on agrifood products from the EU.  The sectors most affected are the dairy and fruit and vegetables sectors.  Mackerel is also heavily affected.  The Commission has taken a number of steps to assist producers in these sectors, including, most recently, a compensation package for dairy farmers in the Baltic member states.  The main issue arising was the funding of these measures.<\/p> <p>Ireland was the first member state to make the point that EU farmers were disproportionately affected by a decision taken on security policy and political grounds.  Thus, funding should not be confined to the EU agricultural budget lines.  Along with 20 other member states, we vehemently opposed the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to deploy the agricultural crisis reserve to pay for these measures.  I am pleased to report that the Commission subsequently withdrew this proposal.<br\/><b><\/b>On milk quotas, earlier in the year there was a concerted attempt by a number of member states, including Ireland, to ensure a more effective soft landing in all member states in the run-up to the expiry of milk quotas next March.  Unfortunately, it has not been possible to reach agreement on this in the Council and we are now facing the unpalatable situation whereby Irish producers gearing up for the abolition of milk quotas, in all likelihood, will face a bill for a super-levy next year.  At this point, I urge dairy farmers to manage their production so as to minimise that bill.  Obviously, we will do what we can to make sure that any super-levy that must be paid will be paid over a manageable period.<br\/>With regard to climate change, in October we had a very useful exchange of views on climate change and agriculture, focused on the need for recognition of the special position of the agriculture sector and the need for coherence between policies on climate change and food security.  Ireland can claim credit for that discussion.  We were the first to raise the issue at the Council last May but it was not long before we were joined by other member states.  Following the exchange at the October Council, the European Council took on board the conclusions of EU agriculture Ministers in their decisions on the climate energy framework to 2030 at the end of October.  This was a pretty good success from our perspective.<br\/>The Council had a number of exchanges on current trade negotiations in which I reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s position on the Mercosur and TTIP negotiations.  To be clear, we have both offensive and defensive interests in relation to the proposed agreement with the United States.  However, when it comes to Mercosur, I have serious concerns about the impact of an agreement on Irish agriculture, particularly on the beef sector.  We should proceed with extreme caution in that regard.<br\/>As I said, much of what is being raised on the formal agenda from an agricultural point of view the week after next really comprises an update on technical issues.  There will be an effort to get a number of those issues over the line.  Some proposals will succeed and some of the more controversial ones probably will not.  The main focus will be on fishing and quotas for next year.  If members have any questions on the agriculture issues, we will try to answer them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014120200003#E00400","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417535700,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am conscious that we will be discussing the fishing sector after this item.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014120200004#F00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1417535700,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.

I raised in the Seanad today the fact that we are 7.1% over quota.  In October 2013, we were only 1% over quota.  We are facing a super-levy bill of &euro;113 million.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister that he may consider a phased payment.  It was inevitable this year with milk quotas disappearing next year that people would go into over-production.  I disagree with Deputy Ferris in that I believe the payments must by phased over a long period.  With the price of milk depressed all the time, possibly going down to 24 cent or 25 cent per litre, it is important for cash flow that the final super-levy bill we are to face in Ireland be phased over a long period.  I welcome the Minister's announcement.<\/p><p>  On the Russian ban, could I have an update on what we are actually doing to get it lifted?

Given that there is a depressed market, will producers be allowed to switch the co-operative or dairy they supply without having to give statutory notice when quotas end on 1 January?  It seems people are able to play with that.  People would have a stronger negotiating position if they had fewer than three months of notice to give.  For quota purposes, it always had to be three months or one quarter year in advance.<\/p> <p> I have a question about producer organisations.  Thankfully, the new Commissioner has welcomed the initiative.  It has been announced that we have a consultation.  Is there agreement at the Council that this will be applied across Europe?  It is referenced in the CAP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014120200004#F00900","speaker":"1103","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417536300,"counter":20,"content":"<p>On the question about producer organisations, this is included in the new CAP regulations.  The Commission is encouraging the setting up and recognition of producer organisations in order to improve and develop the bargaining position of primary producers.  The Commission wants to use them to increase the negotiating power of primary producers versus retailers and wholesalers and so on.  We intend to do this in this country and in the beef sector in particular.  In our view if a structure can be put in place that is farmer-owned, that works and that is a legal entity that can negotiate price on behalf of its members, which is not the case at the moment for farming organisations, we think this will lead to a much better structured beef industry with regard to the relationship between farmer and factory.<\/p><p>  On the three months notice question, that is a matter between farmers and their co-ops and the terms and conditions to which they have signed up.  I cannot instruct co-ops on what they should do with the terms and conditions between them and their members.  I understand the Deputy's point and we can look at it.<\/p><p>  In reply to Senator O'Neill, it is not true to say that a series of countries are doing bilateral deals with Russia to avoid the embargo.  There have been some conversations around beef offal as a particular issue, the importation of which Russia is looking to trying to facilitate.  The position and the policy of the EU with regard to the broader embargo is that we should stick together and that there would be a collective decision on negotiation.  That is what is happening.  A number of weeks ago I met the Russian ambassador to discuss a series of these issues in order to make some progress on removing restrictions applying to some Irish products that are not subject to the embargo.  Examples include some dairy products, such as casein.  The purpose of the meeting was also to ensure that if and when the embargo is lifted we would hopefully be in a position to re-enter those markets quickly.  I hope the embargo will be lifted in the not too distant future although I have my doubts because there is still a very difficult and intractable relationship between the EU and Russia with regard to the Ukraine.<\/p><p>  Pig meat was banned for entirely different reasons long before the embargo was introduced.  It was banned because of an outbreak of African swine flu in Latvia.  There are other issues such as the complications that have arisen from inspections of some of our dairy plants which in our view we can answer without too much difficulty.  The products that have been banned are, live animals other than pedigree animals; beef, pork, poultry, seafood, dairy products, other than products for infant formula; and lactose-free products such as vegetable, excluding seed potatoes, and fruit.  In total, Europe would have exported about &euro;12 billion worth of agrifood products to Russia and between &euro;5 billion and &euro;6 billion of that total is subject to the embargo, while the remaining half is not.  A lot of the Irish exports to Russia could still go ahead but some have not been able to do so.  <\/p><p>  All the members have asked questions about the super levy.  No Minister from any country has been more vocal than me with regard to the levy.  For 18 months, if not two years, we have been talking about the soft landing policy that simply is not working for countries like Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark and one or two others.  In the past six or eight months other countries have been joining in with that concern, including countries such as Germany, which has gone from one side of the argument to the other.  As a result of strong milk prices there has been an increase in milk output in Germany.  Other countries are adamant that it is irresponsible to encourage more milk production at a time when milk prices are weakening, even in the short term between now and when quota ends.  In their view there was an agreement that there would be a quota and that there would be a super levy for those who were over quota, until next April.  The actual agreement was that in the final year of quota there would be a discussion and a decision around a soft landing.  I have made that view known in a forceful way but unfortunately, countries are digging in.<\/p><p>  Some countries are uncomfortable with the prospect of abolishing quotas.  They want to keep a full quota regime in place for as long as possible and they want to discourage countries - or they do not want to be seen to be rewarding countries for over-producing in advance of the end of the quota regime.  This poses a big problem for Ireland, in particular because on the lack of very strong prices up to a few weeks ago.  Irish farmers were calculating a super levy fine at 28 cent a litre on the back of very high prices and some farmers were deliberately making the decision to take the hit for 28 cent a litre if it meant getting 45 cent a litre for their milk and being able to plan for expansion and easing their way out of a quota system.  The problem now is that the price is changing and it is moving in the wrong direction.  There has already been a significant drop in dairy prices and a super levy fine of 28 cent a litre out of 30 cent a litre for milk is a very big hit.  We need to manage that situation but given the strength of feeling, I do not think there will be a compromise agreed on super levy between now and in three months time, which is what we are talking about.  In the absence of that compromise we are talking to co-ops about how they could draw down those super levy payments from farmers over a period of time that would allow for a sensible approach with regard to cash flow in that period.  This is the current discussion.<\/p><p>  Everyone has known about the super levy.  We have been very clear that farmers should be looking to avoid it rather than trying to factor it into their costs.  I have been saying this for three years and my views on this issue are well known in the Council of Ministers.  I am sure I will be expressing them again before the end of quota.  However, I would not hold out a huge amount of hope that we will get a major result. <\/p><p>  Deputy Ferris asked a question about organics.  This has nothing to do with GMOs, genetically modified organisms, but it is really about managing practical things such as if product like stock or crops from a non-organic farm is brought to an organic farm the period of time to be allowed before this is considered organic.  For example, if cows are brought from a non-organic farm to an organic farm which produces organic milk, under what conditions and time-frame will that milk be considered to be produced in an organic way?  These are the kinds of practical definitions required to ensure a common approach to the production of organic products across the EU, as opposed to different countries applying different rules.  It is a significant challenge in Ireland to produce a sufficient volume of organic dairy products, whether that is goats milk or cows milk.  We have to import significant volumes of organic dairy products from the UK because we cannot produce it here - we can produce it here but farmers have chosen not to produce it.  If that situation changes in the future we need to understand what farmers need to do before they can make that transition.  That is my understanding of the main issues around organic farming.  We have a very strong package in the rural development programme to encourage more organic farming.  We have more or less doubled the funding available to support that sector but we need to get that approved by the Commission in terms of the overall RDP package.<\/p> <p> If the Chairman is agreeable, I will deal with the stakeholders meeting under the fisheries heading.  We can discuss it in detail if Deputies so wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014120200005#G00200","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417536900,"counter":22,"content":"<p>That is fine.

The approach the Commission has taken towards penalising countries for error rates has caused a lot of problems for many member states, including Ireland.  I expect we will have a discussion in due course whereby Ministers will demand as much clarity and flexibility as possible when rural development programmes are being signed off, so as to reduce the likelihood of error rates that result in significant disallowances.  The extent of the disallowances that have been applied to some countries is causing serious concern - more than &euro;1 billion for France, &euro;400 million for the UK and similar for Italy.  The penalties imposed on Ireland to date have been among the lowest for any member state, but we are now facing a large disallowance of &euro;181 million, which we are looking to negotiate.  It is a major challenge and we will go through arbitration to seek a solution.<\/p><p>  The other commitment we are seeking - Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will understand where I am coming from here - is for a degree of flexibility in terms of the introduction of new schemes.  For example, if we change the way we measure active farming on a commonage and this results in a transition period, then we will be looking to the Commission for flexibility and a reasonable timeframe within which to introduce new or changed farm practices and so on.  This is necessary to allow farmers to adapt in a practical sense, as opposed to their being asked to do the impossible overnight to maintain their single farm payment.

This year, the arrangements for 2015 are due to be negotiated at the Council scheduled for 15 and 16 December.  The levels of total allowable catch, TAC, and the quotas for Ireland will again be determined at that meeting following negotiations with member states and the Commission.  The Fisheries Council will also decide on the fishing effort, which determines days spent at sea, available for the Irish fleet in the Irish Sea and off the north-west coast for 2015.<br\/>The process of preparing for the Council is well under way, with the publication of detailed proposals for TACs and quotas of key stocks of interest to Ireland in late October and November.  I refer here to the Commission's proposals as opposed to those of individual governments.  The proposals cover stocks which are not subject to third-party international agreements and are, in the main, whitefish and prawn stocks.  Stocks which are subject to ongoing international negotiations, such as blue whiting and whiting in the Celtic Sea, are not included in the proposals.<br\/>Ireland, on behalf of the European Union, is hosting important fisheries negotiations between Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal and Ireland at the National Seafood Centre in Clonakilty, County Cork.  These negotiations, on the annual fishing arrangements for 2015 between the EU and Norway, commenced yesterday and are expected to continue all this week.<br\/>Mackerel quotas were agreed at coastal state level last week, with Ireland given a quota of 89,000 tonnes for 2015.  The latter is a very good result for us in our most important fishery.  In fact, it is the second highest quota we have ever received for mackerel, as far as I can recall.  The highest was last year, but there were specific reasons that it was so high on that occasion.<br\/>The Commission's proposals are based on formal advice received from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, the independent international body with responsibility for advising on the state of fish stocks.  The Commission also takes account of the views of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, STECF, on the economic, technical and social impacts of the scientific advice.<br\/>In order to inform my negotiations at the December Fisheries Council, I have had an assessment undertaken of the impacts of the Commission's proposals.  This is line with the commitment contained in the programme for Government regarding the preparation of a sea-fisheries sustainability impact assessment.  To facilitate and inform these deliberations, an open consultation process was initiated, whereby stakeholders were asked to submit their comments and observations on the Commission's proposals for fishing opportunities for 2015.  From 5 November, an online web portal on was activated to enable the transmission of electronic submissions for consideration.  In addition, I convened a meeting of stakeholders on 26 November, which gave a further opportunity to key stakeholders to outline their position directly to me on the many aspects of this proposal.  Five submissions were received by the closure date, all of which are available in full on the website.<br\/>I agree with the sentiment expressed in most of the contributions, which call for greater adherence to the available scientific advice to enable prudent and appropriate management decisions to be taken, allied with a concern about misapplication of some scientific advice.  To be clear, I do not agree with taking an overly narrow interpretation of some of the scientific advice.  I will not support cuts where additional information is available to inform the decision and where there is a real risk of generating higher discard levels than at present.  The Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara have undertaken an evaluation of the Commission's proposals, which is contained in the sea-fisheries sustainability impact assessment.<br\/>In regard to the biological assessment, while noting an improvement in the status of some fish stocks, others remain a concern, namely in the areas west of Scotland and in the Irish and Celtic Seas.  Much needs to be done for the benefit of our fishing industry to rebuild all stocks to sustainable levels, including, in some cases, further reductions in fishing opportunities and, in other cases, improving selectivity to avoid by-catch.  Implementing a reformed Common Fisheries Policy and ending overfishing will require continued work and commitment from all member states, including Ireland, and the fishing industry itself.<br\/>The impact assessment summarises the pressure on the 73 stocks dealt with in the 2014 stock book.  This is an increase from 59 stocks last year, mainly due to the addition of a number of skates and rays stocks.  There is a higher number - 25 stocks - assessed to be sustainably fished in 2014, up from 20 last year.  That is very positive.  The proportion remains the same due to the higher number of stocks being assessed overall this year.  The number of stocks overfished has increased from 14 in 2013 to 22 in 2014, which is not good news.  This is due to the inclusion of four new stocks - rays and seabass - and four stocks having gone from unknown status or underfished to overfished.  The number of stocks with unknown status is 26, which is similar to last year.<br\/>In respect of the biomass of stocks, that is, the quantity of mature fish in the sea, approximately one quarter, or 17 stocks, are in a positive state with above biomass trigger points.  The number of depleted stocks has increased from seven to 12.<\/p> <p>Now, 16% of stocks are assessed as being depleted.  The number of stocks with unknown spawning stock biomass, SSB, no assessments or an undefined maximum rate of fishing mortality, Fmsy, remains relatively high at 44.  Many of these stocks have good information on biomass trends, informing scientific advice for the stocks.<\/p><p> As part of the negotiations on the European Maritime Fisheries Fund, EMFF, I secured a budget of &euro;32.5 million for data collection.  This will be available to the Marine Institute together with national funding to deliver enhanced data collection work for the period to 2020.  I am confident that we will improve information and provide better quality advice for the stocks around our coast with this commitment to the data collection work of the Marine Institute.<\/p><p> It is also noted that the activities of the fleet have other impacts on the wider marine ecosystem.  Greater efforts are necessary to achieve a more harmonious and eco-friendly interaction with the broader environment and to ensure compliance with the European environmental directives.  These efforts will need to be imposed at European level on all EU fleets fishing in shared fisheries under the CFP.  This is a matter that will receive attention in the reformed CFP.<\/p><p> I will not go into a stock-by-stock discussion now, but the specific details are available in the document that has been laid before the D&aacute;il and in the accompanying stock book, which was prepared by the Marine Institute.  I will of course address any specific issue raised about individual stocks.<\/p><p> Regarding the CFP, the maximum sustainable yield, MSY, and the discards ban, I am committed as a general principle to the ambitious policy of achieving MSY by 2015 where possible and by 2020 at the latest.  This must be implemented in a rational and progressive manner.  In line with the CFP, we will need to phase in the delivery of Fmsy if its immediate application seriously jeopardises the social and economic sustainability of the fishing fleet.<\/p><p> Additional changes being introduced under the reformed CFP include an obligation to land all catches.  This will apply to pelagic species from 1 January 2015 and will be phased in over three years, commencing with some of the main demersal species in 2016.  A further change is the development of a more regionalised approach.  Ireland will chair the north west waters group of member states in the first half of 2015 during which time its six member states will work on the difficult task of drawing up a discards plan for demersal stocks in the waters between the north coast of France and the northern tip of Scotland.  A third change will see a move towards multi-annual plans covering multiple stocks and where and when they are exploited together.  Managing mixed fisheries is a particularly complex ask but we will endeavour to do it.<\/p><p> These changes will result in a major shift away from current management approaches.  This provides a challenge to all stakeholders to identify and apply instruments that are consistent with the overall policy objectives while maximising the potential yield available in line with available quotas.  In particular, the obligation to land all catches means that total allowable catches, TACs, must be set taking this situation into account.  The reformed CFP provides that when the obligation to land applies to a stock, the TAC will be set to reflect catches.  This should involve higher TACs, which is good news for fishermen, because discarding will no longer be permitted from 1 January 2016 for certain whitefish stocks as the landing obligation is rolled out.<\/p><p> There is a serious challenge for our industry in preparing for the implementation of the landing obligation or, as it is more commonly referred to, the discards ban.  I have established a national discards implementation group under Dr. Noel Cawley to help to prepare the industry for the challenges that lie ahead.  The work of this group will intensify next year as we face the considerable challenge of commencing the implementation of the discards ban in our mixed whitefish fisheries.<\/p><p> Crucial to preparing for the landing obligation will be the introduction of improved technical measures to reduce significantly catches of juvenile fish and avoid catches of depleted stocks.  It will be essential to include technical measures such as mesh size changes and closed areas in the regional discard plans to be drawn up by the regional member states and implemented in EU law.  There was some ambiguity from the Commission this year as to whether this was legally possible.  To ensure that it is, I have been working hard to have it specifically set down in an EU regulation.  I am hopeful this matter will be resolved satisfactorily in the near future.<\/p><p> The Marine Institute, together with EU partners, has been working with the North Western Waters Regional Advisory Council to begin the development of mixed fisheries plans to aid the decision making process.  The European Commission has funded two major projects to deal with these mixed fisheries interactions.  Our industry is heavily involved in these projects, which aim to highlight and identify the biological and economic trade-offs between management options.  This work is an investment in the future and will help towards better TAC setting.<\/p><p> It is sobering to read what the economic and social impacts of the Commission's proposals would be were they to be implemented in full.  On the specific issue of the TAC and quota proposals for the December Council, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, estimates that the proposal as it stands would see a net reduction in fishing opportunity for the Irish whitefish sector of 20% by volume.  In financial terms, this amounts to a direct income reduction of approximately &euro;18.2 million on 2014's levels.  Pelagic quotas would also decline, due in large part to decreases in boarfish and herring quotas.  The impact would be a reduction of &euro;13.24 million on 2014's levels.  Overall, the financial loss to Irish fishing opportunities if the Commission proposal was adopted unchanged would amount to a direct income reduction of &euro;31.46 million on 2014's levels.  At a regional level in the Irish Sea, the Celtic Sea and along the west coast, the proposal would result in a 24% reduction in quotas at a value of &euro;18.8 million for the demersal - whitefish and prawn - fleet.  This would directly impact on the ports of Clogherhead, Howth, Dunmore East, Kilmore Quay, Dingle, Castletownbere and Ros an Mh&iacute;l as well as other smaller ports.  However, an 8% increase in quotas for the demersal fleet in the north west would directly benefit the ports of Greencastle and Killybegs.<\/p><p> In addition to the direct losses to the fleet, income would also be lost from the processing sector as a direct result of reduced catches and in a number of ancillary industries, for example, net making, engineering, refrigeration and chandlery.  Based on a total turnover generated per tonne of fish landed, BIM estimates that the full costs, direct and indirect, of the proposed quota reductions in the Commission's proposal pre-Council would be in the order of &euro;78 million.  On the basis of the most recent employment surveys of the catching sector, BIM also estimates that these reductions could impact on between 500 and 600 full and part-time jobs, either through reduced incomes, partial lay-offs or redundancies.<\/p><p> The proposal does not include the Hague preferences, which are a safety net for the Irish fleet on specific stocks where TACs are in decline.  The Hague preferences are negotiated annually at the Council in the face of considerable opposition from a number of member states.  The loss of these allocations in 2015 would amount to 1,351 tonnes of fish with a direct value of &euro;2.9 million.  BIM estimates that the full value, direct and indirect, of losing the Hague quotas in 2015 will be approximately &euro;8.1 million, with an associated impact on 100 or so full and part-time jobs, either through reduced incomes, partial lay-offs or redundancies.<\/p><p> I concur with the findings of the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment.  I will not support cuts where reliable, scientifically vetted additional information is available to inform the decision or where there is a real risk of generating higher discard levels than at present.<\/p> <p>There is a high cost from a social and economic perspective when quota cuts are proposed and we must be satisfied that in every case these cuts are justifiable.  Fishing ports and whole communities around our coast are dependent on these fisheries for their very survival.<\/p><p> I would like to publicly thank and acknowledge all those who contributed to the production of this impact assessment and I look forward to the debate on its conclusions.  In particular, I want to reaffirm my commitment to obtaining a fair, science-based outcome in December, which is in the best interests of our fishing fleet and fishing communities, but also takes a responsible approach to stock management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014120200006#H00600","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417538100,"counter":29,"content":"<p>This is almost an annual event.

What can the Minister do about that at the Council?  I presume it can just be used as a negotiation tactic.  The Minister also mentioned the &euro;32.5 million he secured for data collection in the new CFP and that the Marine Institute will use this to improve the data collection.  How will that feed into future negotiations?  If data collection is improved, is it agreed by the Commission that this will be accepted as reliable data if it is collected unilaterally by us?

This time every year fishing communities look at what the Commission proposes in advance of these meetings.  In my area, Castletownbere, they have seen the Commission's proposals and they have gone beyond anger.  It is terror, almost, for some of the operators, particularly in the demersal sector.  Many of those vessel-owners and families are in a precarious position and the Commission's proposals for some of those species, particularly in the south west and south east, are very concerning for those families and the communities.  They are caught in a whirlwind of scientific advice, what they hear themselves, what they know from their own fishing effort, what they hear from the Commission, what they get from the Marine Institute, what they see in their own specialised media and what they are dealing with in the new proposals, with the discard bans.   It is not an easy time to be in the industry or to be making decisions, to invest or to reinvest, or to see where one's future lies, particularly in the demersal sector.  I know the Minister will be going to Brussels and I agree with what he is saying about the case he will make for Ireland based on the available scientific advice against the Commission.  This is where it is difficult to square some of the Commission's proposals.<\/p> <p>I understand ICES is showing interest in increasing the catches of haddock and cod in the Celtic Sea but the Commission has proposed a swingeing cut in the TAC for 2015, which does not square up.  Similarly, there are data limited stocks.  Pollock is deemed not important enough to invest in information gathering exercises.  The figures put forward by ICES and the proposal the Commission has made for skate, ray and monkfish in area 7 do not add up.  The prawn fishery is hugely significant for Ireland but there are disparate landing figures for the year and the Commission is basing its TAC on them whereas the scientific advice says something different.  We are trying to reassure an industry and asking participants to have confidence in the scientific advice.  We are saying that we must make decisions based on what we know about the sustainability of a fishery but the Commission then makes proposals such as this.  That is not confidence inspiring from its point of view.  There is plenty to put on the table at the upcoming meeting to meet the Commission's proposals head on.<br\/>The Commission says there is insufficient data for some proposals and it has invoked the precautionary principle.  It has in the past proposed a 20% cut in a fishery under that principle and followed up the year after with another 20% cut because it does not have data.  That is hard to take when the fishermen say the stock is strong and recovering and can cope with an increase in the TAC or a maintenance of the <i>status quo<\/i>.  It would be great to know to whom the Commission is listening when it keeps proposing rolling cuts instead of applying a cut and then assessing the fishery.  I welcome the increased investment through the EMFF in data collection measures and I hope that will generate more information on individual fisheries.  The potential loss based on not having the full picture would be catastrophic for coastal communities, particularly on the south, south-west and south-east coasts.<br\/>The proposed discards ban is problematic in the pelagic sector and it is a minefield in the whitefish, mixed whitefish and demersal fish sectors.  The committee will ratchet up its work next year with Noel Cawley.  When will that work reach an apex?  What consultation will there be with the industry?  Will technical measures, closed areas and restrictions on efforts in terms of days be considered?  How can the discards ban be effectively implemented to deal with what needs to be done and to ensure fishing communities can provide for themselves?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014120200008#K01800","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417538700,"counter":47,"content":"<p>There is a great deal of concern, as the Minister will appreciate.

Under the previous CFP, Ireland received a total of &euro;70 million from the fund.  This time we will receive &euro;147 million, which is more than double what we received the last time.  The &euro;32 million for data collection will come out of that.  More than &euro;70 million will be available for sea-fisheries development and investment, mainly through BIM, and it will help fishermen to adapt to the new realities of the CFP.  We should not lose sight of the fact that, ultimately, this is about fishing in a way that ensures there are more fish in the sea in the future.  It is not about stopping people fishing; it is about allowing a maximum commercial return from fishing while, at the same time, ensuring we do not fish in a way that fundamentally undermines the existence of a stock.  The challenge for us is to make that change and to keep fishermen in business while building stocks by managing the volume of fish they catch on the basis of the available science.<\/p><p>  More important, by helping people to change the way they fish, we will ensure we only catch the fish that we want to land and sell and a have a quota to catch.  That is why we are looking at new technology, innovations, net shapes and escape hatches for juvenile fish.  For example, square mesh panels are proposed for the Celtic Sea west of the 8o line to ensure juvenile fish can escape while cod and haddock are predominantly caught in that area.  Significant volumes of whiting and mixed fish are caught on the other side of the 8o line but that is a more complicated problem because we do not want adult whiting escaping while also allowing for cod and haddock to escape.<\/p><p>  This is ongoing discussion to try to find ways to allow fishermen to catch the volume they need to make a living while, at the same time, avoiding catching juvenile fish which should be caught 12 months later as a commercial catch.  In some mixed fisheries, there has been between 40% and 60% discards on the basis of the volume of what was caught.  That is a disaster for sustainability, stock management and future breeding stock and commercial catches.  We are making the switch from a landing quota, which is the essence of the change under the CFP.  Currently, fishermen are given a landing quota.  They are allowed land a certain tonnage of fish.  If they catch twice that when they are at sea, they dump half of it over the side.  They are entitled to do that because that is how the system works.  However, they will not be allowed to do that anymore.  Instead, they will be given a catch quota as opposed to a landing quota, which changes the entire dynamic because now they must be much more targeted about what they catch because they have to land everything they catch.  They are some flexibilities in the context of species for quota management and between years, which fishermen will understand.  However, that is the principle underpinning what we are trying to do.<\/p><p>  This should mean higher quotas in the future.  Currently, quotas are set on the basis of factoring in discards in a fishery and if they do not have to be factored in, fishermen should be able to catch more fish and do so sustainably if they avoid juveniles and other bycatch.  The purpose of this is more profitable fishing, more fish in the sea, a much more efficient way of catching them and avoiding bycatch and damaging stocks.  That is easy to say but it is a big challenge to implement it, particularly in the mixed fisheries.  That is why we have people such as Noel Cawley involved.  He is an experienced character in trying to secure compromise, finding a way forward and so on.<\/p><p>  I understand Deputy Ferris's concerned response to this.  I am also concerned.<\/p> <p>When we met them, the fishing industry representatives were concerned, as could be expected.  We can make arguments to try to reduce a damaging outcome.  We are focusing on two key areas.  First, many of the stocks that have a 20% cut applied are data-limited stocks.  It is a precautionary principle which we will fundamentally oppose.  If fishermen have to live by science and there is no science in this regard, we should not be punishing them.  That is totally unacceptable as far as I am concerned.  If there is science suggesting we have to reduce the quota to protect the stock, we have to do it, but I am not going to ask fishermen to catch less fish if there is no science to back that up.  That is one principle around which we will be making a very strong argument.<\/p><p> The other key area is the Celtic Sea, which is a hugely valuable fishery primarily for cod, haddock and whiting.  There are also some prawns there and a big herring fishery.  Dramatic reductions have been proposed for cod and haddock.  We have a piece of scientific research ongoing which will be finished by the end of next week, so we will have it literally days before the Council.  We believe, or hope, that scientific evidence, although it obviously needs to be accurate, will show a more optimistic picture of recruitment levels in haddock and cod.  We will have to wait and see.  We are not going to make that up.  It has to stand up to scrutiny.  We are going to make a very strong case on the back of that evidence, which is the most up-to-date science on the Celtic Sea, to change the Commission's proposals in that area.  The industry is working with us on that as well as the Marine Institute.<\/p><p> The other big area is prawns.  The  recommendation in terms of the science for prawns is for a slight increase in numbers whereas the actual recommendation is for a 14% cut.  There is a debate to be had on that.  We need to address their reason for proposing a 14% cut.  There are also some pressures on certain prawn fisheries that we have to acknowledge and recognise, especially around the Aran Islands where there is reason to believe that the prawn fishery is under some pressure.  The way in which we set quotas for prawns is by just giving one bulk figure for the whole of area 7, which includes the Irish Sea, the south coast of Ireland, the Porcupine Bank and the Aran Islands.  We manage that by fleets moving at different times of the year to different fishing grounds, which has worked well.  The danger of giving a specific quota to each individual fishing ground would mean that the whole fleet would go to each one, fish it out until the quota is gone and then move to the next one.  The scientific advice we get from certain quarters is that would be very damaging.<\/p><p> We are trying to maintain a whole of area 7 approach towards managing quota, but if we need to look at measures to protect certain prawn stocks, such as we had in the Porcupine Bank, for example, where we had no-fishing periods to protect the stock and allow it to recover, which it has, and it has been a very successful outcome, and if we have to do something similar in other areas, we will have to look at that.  We need to try to work with the industry to make sure we can do that because there are many small boats relying on that fishery around the Aran Islands.  It is primarily - in fact, entirely - an Irish fleet fishing in those grounds so we need to take that into account.  Many of those small boats do not have the capacity to go to the Porcupine Bank and certainly not to go all the way around to the Irish Sea.  We are looking at that and talking to the industry about it.<\/p><p> There are things we can do about data-limited stocks, prawns and the Celtic Sea.  We already have agreement from the industry on some of the areas, for example, the reduction in the boarfish quota, which is accepted, and I am reliably informed by Dr. Cecil Beamish that the mackerel quota is the highest since 1987 barring this year.  It is a pretty decent-sized mackerel quota for next year, although in terms of concerns about factories, I can understand the point Deputy Pringle is making.  This is about more than boats.  It is about factories and jobs on land in terms of volume and processing, and in some cases freezing, shipping and so on.  A figure of 89,000 tonnes of mackerel is high.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014120200009#L00300","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417539300,"counter":50,"content":"<p>The total allowable catch has been reduced since last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014120200010#M00200","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1417539300,"counter":51,"content":"<p>That is a separate issue and the Deputy knows my position on it.  In my view, one of the reasons the TAC was so high last year was to try to get political agreement on accommodating the Faroes and Iceland.  I was fundamentally opposed to that deal and still am, but we should not forget it was a two-year deal that needs to be reviewed at the end of next year and we will be making our point then.  For next year, the agreement is almost 90,000 tonnes and it was actually the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation that said it was the highest since 1987.  Many in the mackerel industry do not want higher quotas because they would cause a lot more mackerel to be caught - potentially unsustainably - particularly given the fact that the Russian market is closed at the moment.  Making sure that we have strong demand for what we are producing is also important as long as there is reasonable volume, which there certainly is next year.<\/p><p>  A reduction is also proposed for herring in the Celtic Sea, but a very responsible approach to management of herring has resulted in a very healthy fishery there.  I think we will see temporary reductions followed by the stock growing again.  Our industry has taken a realistic and very responsible approach.  When there is real science that suggests action is needed, by and large they accept that, but when the science is flimsy and can be contested or when we have new science that paints a better picture, as we hope will be the case with the Celtic Sea, they expect me to make that argument very aggressively, and I will.  I feel a huge responsibility towards this industry.  Over the last three Decembers we have shown a willingness to fight very hard for the industry but also to do what is responsible in terms of the science that is available.<\/p><p>  I met the new French fisheries minister and the French are a very important ally on some fisheries, particularly for the Celtic Sea because we share that fishery with them along with the UK.  We have already had a detailed discussion of the new science that is available.  They are also doing some science in the Celtic Sea about cod, haddock and whiting.  We are also trying collectively to agree on the technical conservation measures we can introduce there to maintain quotas at an acceptable level.

He is right in that the industry is taking a very responsible approach and accepting a number of proposed cuts.

Fishermen realise that if they take hard medicine when they need to, they will get rewards the year after or the following year.  That is the case.  The Celtic Sea herring management committee is not perfect but it has demonstrated a capacity to take decisions that have had very positive results in terms of stock sustainability.

A good job is quietly done every year to try to ensure we get a little more fish in areas where we need it for the socioeconomic development of the fishing industry and take it from other areas, through negotiation, where we may not need it as much.  That might include mackerel when we have a very big quota.  That process will continue but if anybody thinks we get something for nothing in these negotiations, I am afraid we do not.  We are good friends with the French and we have a great relationship but they will not start handing over quota even if they do not use it, as they know they can use it for swapping purposes.<\/p><p>  The only exception is that they do not catch a significant part of their nephrops quota each year and we try to factor that into allocation of quota for nephrops.  If we know 15% or 20% of the prawn quota will not be caught because of a track record over a number of years, should the Commission not be factoring in a slightly higher quota for the others?  It refuses to do so because of the argument it sets a very dangerous precedent.  That is all part of a negotiation process for prawns, which is arguably our most important fishery because of the number of fishermen relying on it.  In value terms, mackerel is ahead of the prawn fishery but when we consider the number of boats and people fishing, the prawn quota species - from a socioeconomic perspective of our coastline - is the most important.

Ireland is committed to that reform and it held the Presidency of the EU when the deal relating to it was done.  Those involved should factor this into their thinking when they are weighing up the social and economic consequences - which they are obliged to do under the CFP - before making choices with regard to quota, as well as taking responsible decisions in respect of science and sustainability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014120200012#O00600","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417541100,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Is it agreed that we will draft a proposal for agreement next week and that when this is ready, we will forward it to the Commission, the Minister and his officials and the organisations represented at this meeting?

As everyone is aware, the committee began by looking at the issue of licensing but during our deliberations we agreed to look also at the issue of developing seaweed farming in Ireland.  The Sea Change strategy of 2006 indicated the processing of seaweed in Ireland will be worth &euro;30 million per annum by 2020.  Accordingly, this activity is of enormous importance in Gaeltacht areas and along the west coast, where it is a very important sector and a source of investment and income.  I would like the witnesses to tell us whether the estimate of &euro;30 million is realistic.  Can we surpass that expectation?  What do we need to do in terms of investment, putting in infrastructure or developing policy?  Can we offer a unique product and can we compete in the international market?  Can we diversify our processes so that seaweed is not shipped abroad but is processed here at home, leading to obvious economic benefits, not least job creation?  Do we need to bring in foreign companies to operate the market for us or are there sufficient indigenous skill sets and know-how to develop the sector?  Is EU funding available to assist and, if so, how can it be accessed?  We have a very large pharmaceutical base in this country, not least where I come from in County Cork, and I believe there are other areas in which we can develop an international reputation and this is one of those areas.  <\/p><p> I would also like the witnesses to comment on how we can protect our marine ecosystems and how we can juxtapose eco-marine activity, the fishing sector and the tourism sector while also developing the seaweed industry.<\/p><p> I will call on the witnesses in the order in which I introduced them, beginning with the opening statement of Bord Iascaigh Mhara.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014120200003#E00500","speaker":"996","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417530000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members.<br\/>Global production of seaweed stands at just under 24 million tonnes per annum at present.  China and the Pacific rim dominate global seaweed production in terms of absolute output and in terms of aquaculture production of seaweed.  In Asia, seaweed is mainly produced using aquaculture with little reliance on the harvesting of natural stocks.  The situation in the rest of the world is quite different, where the harvesting of naturally-occurring resources dominates commercial exploitation, and that is the situation in Ireland at present.  Seaweed production in Latin America, Canada and Europe is almost completely dependent on natural stocks, mainly <i>Ascophyllum nodosum<\/i>and various kelp species.  Aquaculture in these territories has generally been focused on achieving production of low-volume, high-value species and on attempts to overcome scientific and technical obstacles to increasing the production of edible seaweeds like <i>Palmaria palmata<\/i>or <i>Porphyra umbilicalis.<\/i><br\/>In Ireland, there are currently seven licensed seaweed aquaculture sites and 23 licence applications for seaweed cultivation in process.  The main focus of Irish seaweed aquaculture operations has been on the production of edible seaweeds, however some production of non-edible seaweeds for cosmetic products has occurred in the past.  To provide some context, the Irish seaweed industry is dominated by the harvesting of wild resources, mainly, as I have said, <i>Ascophyllum nodosum<\/i>.  Annual production of this seaweed is already approximately 25,000 to 30,000 tonnes per annum.  Recent analysis by NUIG - I hope I am not stealing their thunder by citing it - suggests that the value of the industry is approximately &euro;18 million per annum, about &euro;6 million of which goes to exports, with employment of 185 full-time equivalents.  It may be justified to speculate, based on the number of new entrants and reported expansion, that annual value and employment in the seaweed industry has increased since 2010, when those volume and employment numbers were last collected.  On the other hand, seaweed aquaculture production in Ireland is in its infancy.  It is estimated at current volumes to be less than 300 tonnes per annum and at the moment there are less than ten full-time equivalent posts in the sector. <br\/>Ireland has been at the forefront of attempts to develop seaweed aquaculture in Europe.  Ireland enjoys considerable advantages in terms of the favourable conditions for seaweed aquaculture and there is a high level of scientific expertise within the various third level institutions and development agencies.  Ireland also enjoys strong development and research links with other European nations engaging in seaweed aquaculture, particularly, France, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark and the UK.<\/p> <p>Practical tools including cultivation manuals have been produced for the industry.  BIM and many other agencies and institutions continue to work closely with the industry in terms of aquaculture processing, new product development and innovation.  BIM has worked very closely with the Irish Seaweed Aquaculture sector in terms of providing crucial supports at establishment and early commercialisation stages.<\/p><p> The development of seaweed aquaculture faces challenges.  Some European experts have supported a model in which seaweed aquaculture, shellfish and finfish aquaculture and wind energy generation could all be integrated into what they describe as parks in the coastal zone or perhaps offshore.  In our view, the scale, cost and complexity of such parks may present difficulty in terms of costs and a possible displacement of or interaction with other coastal zone stakeholders.  The proposal, while attractive on the face of it, is unlikely to be suitable for Ireland for a number of reasons. <\/p><p> In our view in BIM, Ireland's opportunity is more likely to lie in a mixed industry comprising of three distinct elements, first, integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, better known as IMTA - a form of seaweed cultivation in collaboration with finfish and shellfish operators; second, on-shore tank culture of very high value species; and third, conventional long-line marine aquaculture in bays where there are long-line farms.  IMTA is particularly interesting in that it would allow integration with the conventional aquaculture industry, such as mussel farming which already has access to appropriate culture sites, the relevant expertise and have completed the significant investment in terms of labour, vessels, equipment and infrastructure.  We held a conference in Limerick recently and from that we are confident that the Irish farm seaweed industry could reach a harvest volume of between 2,000 to 3,000 tonnes per year and that this level of development is feasible in the next five years or so, particularly if private investment is available for aquaculture development, processing and product innovation.  This would generate a first sale value of &euro;10 million per annum and would generate employment for some 150 people both directly and indirectly.<\/p><p> The key issues to realise this vision are the resolution of licensing issues, the provision of grant aid to the industry and encouraging private sector investment.  Private sector investment will also be required to stimulate growth.  The development agencies BIM and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will continue to engage closely with the industry particularly in the areas of technical development, processing, market development and public information.<\/p><p> Significant effort will be required to manage the diverse priorities of various stakeholders and effective communications, consultative fora and information campaigns will be necessary, certainly at least at local and regional level, to ensure that seaweed aquaculture is fully understood by local communities and that an opportunity is presented to entrepreneurs to engage with the sector to ensure that community benefit, ancillary job creation and return on investment are maximised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014120200004#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Maguire","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417530600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Maguire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014120200005#G00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417530600,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to speak to the committee.

I am not sure how much of it falls within the bailiwick of the witnesses.  I will ask my questions anyway and see how many of them can be answered.  I am a native of An Aird Mh&oacute;r, Carna, which is close enough to the Arramara Teoranta plant.  My ancestors were seaweed cutters and winkle pickers, etc.  I was sent off to school early, so I did not do as much as my brothers and sisters.  It is part of our DNA where we come from.  There has been a great deal of concern in recent times about the way the industry is developing.  As we know, Arramara Teoranta, which was in State ownership until quite recently, has been bought by Acadian Seaplants Limited.  Witnesses from that company have appeared before this joint committee.<\/p><p>  My primary concern relates to the harvesting methods that have traditionally been used.  Industry players and semi-State organisations have suggested that we have not capitalised on the potential of the industry because we do not have a big enough player in the international market and we are not adding enough value to this material.  The raw cleaning of seaweed takes place in places like Cill Chiar&aacute;in, but no value is added.  All of it is exported as pellets to other countries to be developed there.  Many seaweed harvesters have made a subsistence-type living from this activity over the years.  They have normally harvested lorries of seaweed while doing other things, if they have other jobs on the side.  This kind of hand-to-mouth existence from seaweed harvesting has been part of the local fabric of life.  There are concerns from a licensing perspective about the major new player in the industry.  We know that a number of bigger players have applied for blanket licences for large tracts of seashore.  There is a fear that this will take the power from the traditional harvesters.  Questions have been asked about who will control the market, what the price will be, how much they will cut and when they will cut.<\/p><p>  Many legal issues have been raised as well.  I know that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has done a great deal of work on the pertinent rights that would be attached to folios and on the legal position with regard to who does or does not have the right to cut seaweed on foreshores.  Can somebody else come into a traditional stripe?  If I had a stripe in Carna, for example, could somebody else legally come into that stripe?  Traditionally, people would have steered away from doing that because of the history of the spite feamainne, etc.  There is a kind of traditional right in such locations.  Other models have been proposed by some of the seaweed harvesters that have come before us.  The development of a co-operative that would act almost like a fair trade model has been mentioned.  It has been suggested that if some harvesters grouped together in a co-operative-style scenario, it might give them some leverage when they are negotiating with the companies in question about when, where and how they can cut seaweed and what prices they might get, etc.<\/p><p>  On foot of the \"Ear to the Ground\" documentary that was broadcast during the week, I have been contacted - most recently this morning - by smaller players who have a niche interest in the industry in Ireland.  They are concerned that the larger multinationals will squeeze them out of the market bit by bit.  They have suggested that large companies are coming in to get these seaweed-cutting rights so they can sell them off again.  Basically, they are worried that there is a move towards the privatisation of the industry.  We have a resource that needs to be used in a way that adds as much value as possible.  We need to develop the industry in a way that will aid the development of the local communities where these people live and ensure they hold a stake in the industry.  I am interested in the potential that was mentioned for the development of onshore, long-line and integrated multitrophic aquaculture.  How could that work?  How might it work in the future?  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' thoughts on those issues if it is appropriate for them to comment on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014120200006#H00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417530900,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I am afraid my answers will probably disappoint the Senator.  Most of the ground he covered falls within the sphere of influence or business of Bord Iascaigh Mhara.<\/p> <p>As the Senator is probably aware, the question of licensing for a gatherer's rights is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and not the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  As a result, we do not have any particular involvement.  The development of that sector is really a matter for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and not for BIM.  Our interest in seaweed is almost exclusively focused on farm seaweed.  <\/p><p> If it is acceptable to the committee, I will move on to the question about integrated multitrophic aquaculture.  As I mentioned to the Chairman earlier, we held a very successful seminar in Limerick a couple of weeks ago where 220 delegates looked at the potential specifically for farm seaweed.  We had an open session the following day on the greater seaweed industry.  A whole range of potential synergies could be achieved by twining up existing mussel farms and turning some of their production space over to the production of seaweed.  That appears to be a good model particularly if we can perfect the culture techniques for some of the higher value red seaweeds which they could grow there.  That is certainly a success.<\/p><p> The other concept is to use seaweed farming in the vicinity of finfish farms because seaweed is a terrific way of soaking up nutrients out of the water.  In areas where there might be some concern about nutrients coming off a finfish farm and a marine finfish farm, the seaweed aquaculture would be an excellent accompaniment and would benefit the speed and lush growth of the seaweed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014120200006#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Maguire","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417531500,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I invite Professor Johnson or Dr. Edwards, whoever wishes, to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014120200007#J00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417531500,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Very briefly, on the harvesting of seaweed, obviously these questions are broadly about how businesses operate and the rights and obligations of people involved.

The Senator mentioned co-operatives.  They seem to work in other contexts.  There are examples in the literature of people harvesting goose barnacles in northern Spain.  There are other inter-tidal resources where there might be something that could be learned but, perhaps, they have not faced the same challenges as outlined by the Senator of changes in the industry and potentially an industrial scale and part of the industry coming in.

As a research institute, we recommend a robust system of monitoring to see what we have and to understand it a little more.  I have noticed from speaking to harvesters that there is a need and a desire for education.  In the west there are many types of harvester.  There is the person who does it as a pastime, there are more professional cutters who cut a good deal, and there are those who are very experienced and some who are very inexperienced.

As Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh stated, the first thing we should do is look at what we have.  It is natural, self-propagating and very valuable.  We should quantify and do an inventory of all the natural seaweed.  In terms of the sustainable harvesting of it, we should get some measure of the possible volumes, values and species.  As I understand it, some seaweeds have much smaller volumes but realise a lot more money on the market.  When one sees a company applying for 40,000 tonne licences - I do not know if this is in respect of wet or dry matter - over parts of the coast, one gets some idea of the sheer volume of natural seaweed around our coast.  This should be the starting point.  The risks are much fewer because we are dealing with something that is naturally available.<\/p><p>  I accept BIM does not have a role in the licensing regime.  However, will Mr. Maguire clarify why BIM does not have a role in the development and promotion of natural seaweed?  It has a role in the development and promotion of natural fish and aquaculture.  Does he think BIM should have a role in respect of that side of the seaweed industry?  It seems strange that it would be involved in farmed seaweed but not in natural seaweed, whereas, in terms of fish, it is involved in both.<\/p> <p>I would be interested in the witnesses' views on that.  Licensing is beyond their remit but a new licensing regime will come in so it is legitimate to ask for their views on possible inclusions in the new regime.  Would they agree that whoever would be granted a licence should be obliged to only hire harvesters who have a tradition of harvesting seaweed in a sustainable way over a long period, in other words, who are experts by tradition and local knowledge?  That type of expertise is often undervalued in our society.  Often people who have lived with nature and done a thing for a lifetime and have inherited knowledge from previous generations do things to a very high sustainable level.  All others coming new to harvesting would have to be educated in the harvesting of particular species in the Irish aquacultural conditions and methodologies.  Should this be part of a condition of licences in the future so that we can be satisfied that anybody harvesting seaweed under a licence from the Department has the appropriate training to do so in a sustainable way?<\/p><p> Can they give some more information on the integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, IMTA?  There seem to be two big ideas, one, to go to somewhere like the Killary and replace the ropes for mussels with seaweed ropes.  In that case are they talking about seaweed growing there naturally or seaweed brought in from outside?  Mussels seed themselves from the sea and are made grow on the rope instead of on other natural structures.  Second, what is the experience of combining seaweed farming with fin fish farming?  I always understood that at the fish farms there is very little growing on the sea bottom.  Fish in the area might get bloated but there are not many seaweeds growing under the farms.  Can the witnesses outline how that idea works? <\/p><p> The witnesses mentioned a figure of 2,000 to 3,000 tonnes per annum, employment of 165 and a turnover of &euro;10 million as being a level of seaweed aquaculture, which seems very small when compared with the massive tonnages people have mentioned in other types of seaweed.  If that is the case why not concentrate on what is there naturally?<\/p><p> Are the witnesses planning to introduce species or forms of seaweed that are not native to Ireland and could that give us unforeseen problems, equivalent to what has happened on the land with invasive species and disease problems?

From what we understand even about the genetics of seaweed, populations can potentially be quite conservative within small regions.  For example, if I was to grow a seaweed in Killary, I would like it to come from Killary because one gets natural competition, which is of benefit as well.  One wants to keep things as close to the natural environment as possible.  I hope that allays any fears.<\/p><p>  We have a lot of experience of growing seaweed and finfish in this country.  I think the two things will co-exist very happily together.  The growing of the seaweed will happen on ropes, as per mussel long line, so it will not grow underneath the cages.  If one is interested in going further, one can add as many different species as one likes to an integrated system.  One can even put, dare I say it, things like sea cucumbers on the bottom.  This is particularly experimental at the moment but they have a very high value and are eaten by the Chinese, for example.  I am not sure it is a delicacy for which Ireland is yet ready, but certainly the seaweed is.  It is all about understanding the flow of nutrients around cages.  The seaweeds will take dissolved nutrients while other animals and mussels will take particle nutrients from the water.  Everything together forms a more holistic approach.<\/p><p>  It is something that is being ramped up in other countries.  It started in Canada in its current form.  In China, it only started about 2,500 years ago, so there are a lot of examples.

It is a historical rather than a policy issue.  Traditionally, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has been the agency which has taken the greatest interest in the gathered seaweed sector, in particular the gathering of <i>ascophyllum nodosum<\/i>, largely because it coincided geographically with its area of interest.  We are particularly focused on seafood for human consumption.  At the moment, the large volume industry that exists in Ireland is targeted more towards veterinary products, nutraceuticals and cosmetic products.  It is not really targeted at direct human consumption, so it is somewhat outside BIM's mainstream of activities.  We have tended to leave that area to our colleagues in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, who have handled it for many years.<br\/>As I said, our particular interest is in the growing of farmed seaweeds and new seaweeds and not exploiting the existing wild resource and, in particular, high-value species of seaweed for direct human consumption.<\/p> <p>On the Deputy's question regarding the 2,000 to 3,000 tonnes of volume, while that does seem very small in comparison to the volume from harvesting of <i>Ascophyllum nodosum<\/i>what we are speaking about are different species of seaweed with a much higher value that would be added to what are known as sea vegetables or additives for human consumption.  Their value is much higher and as a result this generates a greater degree of activity.  A lot of the employment is on the processing and drying side.  There is a huge amount of labour involved in sorting through seaweed after drying to ensure there are no impurities in it.  As members will be aware, people are particularly sensitive about shellfish allergies and it is important to ensure no little crustaceans have come ashore with the seaweed.  <br\/>On the Deputy's question regarding Killary, what we are proposing is the introduction of a new seaweed but, probably, from plants that were gathered from Killary in the first instance.  The first phase is a hatchery phase which involves the impregnation of strings with tiny plantlets which, in turn, are put out on the long lines.  The reason for the attraction in relation to the mixing of mussel long lines with seaweed is because the farmer will already have in place a lot of the infrastructure required to handle large volumes of product, which is expensive infrastructure to put in place.  For a farmer who already has in place that type of infrastructure it makes good sense to augment a mussel crop with an additional seaweed crop.  The next step is ensuring there is sufficient development for someone to buy, process and dry the seaweed.  The seaweeds would not be gathered naturally by hanging the ropes in the water rather a seeded rope would be attached to the long line to allow a single species of seaweed to grow at high volume on that long line.  <br\/>In regard to the experience of mixing finfish and seaweed farming, this is largely experimental at this stage.  Dr. Edwards referred to the anecdotal history in relation to places like China where seaweed cultivation is done in incredibly huge volumes.  Seaweed farms in China stretch as far as the eye can see and thousands of people are employed daily on those farms.  It is a level of development we would not countenance in Ireland.  It is genuinely used to biodepurate China's coastal waters.  Given the human pressure of population around its waters the seaweed makes a significant impact in improving its environment and, as a result, also yields a valuable crop.  As stated by Dr. Edwards, there is no suggestion of anything other than native species being used here.  There is no need to do otherwise.  We have plenty of native species with sufficient value and market demand that we would not need to consider doing that.  <br\/>In regard to the Deputy's question about new entrants into the industry versus traditional handlers, in any situation it makes perfect sense to build up as much social licence as possible.  Nobody wants anybody operating on the foreshore who is not sufficiently trained and expert in this area and who might do damage to rather than improve the situation.  People applying for a licence, be that for an aquaculture licence through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, or a foreshore gathering licence from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government would have to demonstrate their bona fides and background to show they are appropriate persons to hold such a licence and carry out such an activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014120200010#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Maguire","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417532700,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I would like to make two brief comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014120200011#N00200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1417532700,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I must ask the Deputy to be very brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014120200011#N00300","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1417532700,"counter":132,"content":"<p>&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta was referenced many times.

The area of housing and homelessness is one that needs to be dealt with immediately on foot of this week's unfortunate events, which we discussed earlier in the Chamber.  In February 2013 the Government set itself the target of ending homelessness by 2016.  An implementation plan on the State's response to homelessness was published earlier this year.  It set out specific policies, including an implementation team and a central implementation unit, which was established to drive the objectives of that plan.  What reports has that committee issued on foot of its having been put in place?  What commitments did it make to deliver units to deal with the issues that existed then and that have been exacerbated in the meantime?<\/p> <p>What level of co-operation takes place between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Health in terms of addiction services and associated services and in direct housing provision, especially in terms of tackling homelessness?  <br\/>My next question is on the house adaptation grants and housing aid for the elderly.  Is the Minister aware that the schemes recognise the funding commitment made by local authorities?  Is he aware that for every &euro;1,000 raised locally there is &euro;4,000 raised by the Department?  As he will be aware, many local authorities have so little funding that they are unable to commit the necessary resources.  For example, in County Offaly 70 applicants have been informed by their local authority that it will take between three to five years before their applications can be dealt with due to a lack of funding.  It would cost &euro;15,000 per unit or over &euro;1 million to make their homes fit for purpose.  In the event of people not being able to live in their home the only alternative is to provide nursing home care through the fair deal scheme at a cost of &euro;1,000 per week or &euro;52,000 per year for each individual.  That means it would cost up to &euro;16 million for the 70 applicants to avail of such a scheme for a period of five years.  Therefore, the cost to the State for not dealing with the initial issue is &euro;1 million which compares favourably with the cost of &euro;15 million for the alternative option.  The local authority has jurisdiction over this matter, in conjunction with the Department.  If the original &euro;1 million cannot be provided then it will cost &euro;15 million for the alternative option.  It does not make sense to opt for the latter.  I hope some effort will be made to look at pockets of the country where this scheme exists with a view to making funding available that will eradicate the waiting list and save the State money.<br\/>Last week a housing programme was announced.  Local authorities expected to achieve funding from commercial rates <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i><b><i><\/i><\/b>Irish Water but there have been problems.  What communications took place between the Department and the local authorities in the preparation of the strategy for the next four years?  Can the Minister point to such meetings?  Did he have a firm indication of what lands were available in each local authority and what lands had planning permission?  What was the possibility or prospect of shovel-ready projects being in a local authority where one could get a greater awareness of how quick the actions contained in the strategy could be acted upon in various local authorities?  What consultation took place before the publication of the strategy?  What policy emanated from those meetings?  How will the strategy eradicate the problem in those counties?  Was it based on the information made available to the Department?  <br\/>I welcome the announcement made by the Minister today in response to this week's events.  He said he was prepared to facilitate a forum of relevant stakeholders later this week to inspect the potential that may exist for short-term solutions to the grave problem of people living on our streets and not having a home.  Can he indicate that we will have actions rather than more plans which take too long?  He must have some short-term actions in mind.

We will not now have bills based on meters.  I understand that the meters have a 15-year lifespan.  Is that the case?  Are there relevant contractual obligations?<\/p><p>  I will run through a number of other issues that I wish to raise.  I will be jumping all over the place.  Some 90,000 individuals and families are on the housing waiting list.  The extent of the problem varies around the country.  Six local authority areas account for exactly half of the 90,000.  Three are in Dublin, the others being Cork city, County Cork and Kildare.  Needless to say, I have an interest, as I represent Kildare where the situation is bad.  It is proportionately as bad elsewhere.<\/p><p>  Will the Minister take a targeted approach in allocating developments that are ready to build, namely, those that have planning permission and land set aside and are deliverable?  Will he take a targeted approach as regards the worst affected areas?  For example, will he consider permitting local authorities to buy, or even buy to repair?  This could bring accommodation on stream much more quickly.  What initiatives to tackle the homelessness crisis is the Minister considering?  Do they focus exclusively on homelessness or is he working with other Departments on, for example, rent caps?  Has he completely dismissed that issue as part of the problem?<\/p> <p>The Minister dismissed that as part of the problem.  I see it on a daily basis as central to keeping people in their accommodation for another six, nine or 12 months.<\/p><p> Is it intended to complete Committee and Report Stages of the Water Services Bill next week?

The Minister has been confusing people about this for a number of months.  Is he not proceeding with the deduction proposal that he included in his motion two weeks ago?  For example, will council or social housing tenants have water charges deduced by local authorities?  I expected that to be provided in the Bill because Irish Water refers to this in the information it has provided on its website and the Minister included it in the recent motion.  This morning, we heard that landlords would be consulted before proceeding with the Minister's proposal to deduct the charge from deposits.  I disagree with both proposals and I would be delighted if he has backtracked on them but people deserve to know whether that is the case.  The Bill does not contain many of the measures the Minister outlined in the debate on the motion two weeks ago.  Is this because he does not want to add fuel to the fire before the protest on 10 December which everyone in the country is talking about?  I visited four picket lines of teachers this morning and they were talking about finding a way to attend the protest.  If the Minister is trying to calm everything down, that is probably the right decision but people who rent deserve to know what will happen.<\/p><p>  It is incredible that it has taken the death of a man on the streets to bring the issue of housing into the Chamber where it has not been discussed for four weeks.  If this death had not happened in front of the D&aacute;il, nobody would be talking about it.  Why did the Minister express shock that this happened?  Approximately 160 people are sleeping rough in Dublin and hundreds of families are on the verge of homelessness.  The issue has been discussed intensively for a year and a half and it is incredible that any Minister would express shock that a homeless person has died.<\/p><p>  I refer to the Minister's housing document.  The Taoiseach indicated during Leaders' Questions that it will be discussed in the D&aacute;il next week.  Like the strategy on water services, the housing strategy was released without any discussion in the House.  This is the most pressing social problem in our society.  Nothing tops it, including water services.  The reason people are rightly angered about water provision is it affects every person but there is no more serious problem than the housing emergency we are experiencing.  I have spent a week going through the Minister's documentation.  It does not provide for additional capital investment other than that announced in the budget.  The Minister indicated in his contribution to the budget debate that &euro;1.5 billion would be provided in direct capital investment, including &euro;300 million through public private partnerships, which is a failed policy of the past, and &euro;400 million off balance sheet, which seems to involve the outsourcing of house building to NGOs and an attempt to raise money on the markets from speculators.<\/p><p>  There are three pillars in the document.  The first gives the impression that 35,000 additional social housing units will be provided over six years.  Even if that were to happen, it would be a pittance.  That equates to approximately 6,000 houses a year, which is low considering that during the Celtic tiger era between 80,00 and 90,000 houses were built annually.<\/p> <p>People might look at the figure of 35,000 and think it represents a great start, but not all of those units will actually be additional houses.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the breakdown?  The figure includes leasing, refurbishing, outsourcing to housing agencies or approved housing bodies, public private partnerships and provision under the Part V regulations.  As we all know, the Part V provisions did not work in the past.  In short, it is not the case that 35,000 new houses will be built.<br\/>The second pillar refers to our old friends, the private landlords.  This part is really just about moving people about within the private rented sector.  They will either remain in the privately owned home they are already in or they will be moved to another.  Again, there is no additional housing.<br\/>The third pillar is particularly worrying and certainly merits discussion in the D&aacute;il.  There is reference here to a &quot;new framework for rents and related charges for local authority housing&quot;.  This suggests that the Department wants to move to a situation where there is full cost recovery through rents, something that has been hinted at in a range of housing documents going back a long time.  This is in line with the move away from the differential rent schemes towards a different model.  I do not have time to go into all of this now, but I hope to do so if there is a discussion in the D&aacute;il.<br\/>The immediate homelessness crisis is in the spotlight today following the tragic death of Jonathan Corrie.  It is incredible that the National Asset Management Agency owns 12% of all hotels in this country but we can find no room for homeless people.  In fact, the Government is telling MAMA to speed up the sale of those hotels so that the agency can get its books back in balance.  That should stop now.<br\/>The Minister is going around boasting that &euro;55 million is being given to alleviate homelessness.  It is useful to compare this with the &euro;83.5 million that was given in tax breaks to hotel owners and developers this year.  In the third quarter of 2014, Dublin City Council paid almost &euro;2.5 million to accommodate people in hotels, as set out in the report today in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  These hotels include Travelodge, Bewley's Hotel, the Sunnybank hotel, the Inn on the Liffey Guesthouse - I am sure every family is dying to be accommodated there - and Newdara Limited, trading as the Portobello Hotel.  These are far from five star facilities; they have been called a lot of things by a lot of people.  Why is money being shovelled in the direction of these businesses when NAMA has hotels which could accommodate people as an immediate end?  Why, moreover, are we talking about importing containers?<br\/>This Government has an ideological aversion - the Fianna F&aacute;il Party is not much different - to doing what needs to be done.  There were only two decades in the 20th century when a housing crisis was tackled, namely, the 1930s and 1970s.  In each case it was done by public house-building on a mass scale.  This Government, however, has set its face against doing that and is instead relying on the private sector to solve the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014120200016#U00200","speaker":"1195","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417534800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.

The matter has been considered in even greater detail as a result of those meetings.<\/p><p> The Deputy referred to housing adaptation grants.  A total of &euro;38 million was spent on this very worthy programme in 2014.  The programme has helped a range of people throughout the country.  If there are pockets which have issues in respect of the this matter, we will examine the possibility of having these addressed.  To my knowledge, however, the programme is working very well.  We do not want to dilute the impact it is having by pulling funding from local authorities.  Where funding is not used, obviously it can be reallocated.  As I understand it, local authorities are quite happy with the way in which the programme has been operating.  In view of the Deputy's comments, however, I will investigate the matter.  It is intended that the funding relating to this very worthy and very successful programme - by means of which a great deal has been achieved - will be maintained at a similar level in 2015.<\/p><p> The Deputy's next question related to commercial rates.  I have dealt with this matter in the House but I am happy to do so again.  Discussions took place with Irish Water - which, in turn, had discussions with the local authorities - in respect of this matter.  As I indicated in the House, however, detailed discussions with the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, and the local authorities did not take place, primarily as a result of issues relating to timing.  The amount involved is &euro;59 million.  In the preceding year it was &euro;48 million.  Based on revaluations, &euro;59 million is the calculation for next year.  A number of revaluations are taking place.  I refer to that which is taking place in Limerick and which is giving rise to what I might term \"considerable figures\".  That is the process by means of which this matter was dealt with.<\/p><p> The Deputy raised issues in respect of social housing and I have taken these on board.  The strategy in this regard did not just appear out of thin air.  It is a considered strategy and it is the result of a long consultative process involving the various groups, agencies and interested parties.  To be fair, many aspects of that process were taken on board and used in the context of the strategy.  We are happy that the filtration mechanism that was used - and the process relating thereto - dealt with many of the issues of concern to people, including the members present.  Many individuals will have issues with regard to priorities and to how matters are addressed.  In broad terms, however, there has been a collective welcome for the amount of capital - some &euro;3.8 billion - that is being made available and the view has been expressed that this is a step in the right direction.  We can all argue - from a political point of view - that things might be done better or in a different way.  However, I think people are generally of the view that this strategy is a welcome addition.<\/p><p> On homelessness, Deputy Cowen made a specific query with regard to Thursday next.  As already stated, we meet on weekly basis to discuss homelessness and Ms Nic Aongusa meets representatives from Dublin City Council to discuss the matter.  Issues relating to homelessness also affect places outside Dublin.  However, we are very much aware that the acute issues which arise primarily relate to the city.  A range of actions are being taken in respect of this matter and I will comment on those in a moment.  However, the Deputy specifically asked what I want from Thursday's meeting.  The Deputy is correct - I am seeking concrete action.  I do not want any more policies, strategies or anything of that nature.  Those are not what is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014120200017#V00900","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417535100,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting but would the Minister be agreeable to a member of the committee attending Thursday's meeting of the forum?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014120200018#W00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1417535100,"counter":170,"content":"<p>That would be no problem.

We have to adhere to the structure.  It just needs a format to work with.<\/p><p>  In principle I agree with the Deputy that we need to find actions based on it.  We have added a further 20% to the budget for homelessness.  Just weeks ago I gave another &euro;4 million for Dublin alone.  I am not convinced it is all about funding.  There may be isolated issues related to funding that are necessary and if so we will deal with them as they are itemised.  Many of the issues here relate to processes.  NGOs do outstanding work.  The Department is doing a considerable amount of work to address the issue by working with the local authorities, particularly in Dublin.  Work is also being done by various other agencies - through the HSE and others.<\/p><p>  It is not simply a case of providing accommodation.  If it was a case of just providing accommodation, I reckon we could provide it  This issue is about ensuring we have a process in place such that people who find themselves in this vulnerable and difficult situation have their needs met.  It is not just their accommodation needs but on a continual basis there needs to be analysis to ensure they do not slip back into homelessness.  Many of the people have very complex issues that need a wide array of actions and help.  The NGOs are doing a great job in all the work they do.  There is all the implementation that is happening from a local authority point of view and then obviously there are all the agencies, particularly the HSE.<\/p><p>  My real hope is that what happens on Thursday will solidify the processes by which we can ensure people are not slipping through the cracks.  If there are gaps and if there are issues that need to be addressed, we should itemise them and deal with them immediately.  Am I saying that funding is not one part of that?  It possibly could be, but I am not convinced that if it is, it is the only aspect.  I certainly believe the main issue here relates to processes.  We need to get everyone together to ensure people are not slipping between the cracks.  It is not just a case of meeting someone's housing need for one night in emergency accommodation.  We need to have a process of engagement with that individual so that he or she is not homeless again the following night, the following week or the following month and we need a consistent architecture that is always in place.<\/p><p>  I want all these aspects joined up.  I want any gaps that are identified to be addressed as actions coming out of Thursday's meeting.  If there is a requirement for more funding, I am not shy about asking for it.  I will do so and I will give that commitment to this committee.  I will ask for it, if that is part of the fallout from this.  It will be a transparent process.  I was very taken by the archbishop's comments this morning.  I thought they were considered and helpful.  However, there are issues that have to be addressed.  Sometimes they are outside my control.<\/p><p>  In this city one particular group has a number of units which are closed and they will not open in the short term, which is unacceptable.  I cannot control that.  People are not being facilitated because of decisions that I do not believe are fair.  That is wrong.  The local authority is trying to deal with the issue.  Taxpayers' money has been used in this case - many members are aware of it - where the Catholic Housing Trust has 99 units that are not being utilised.  Independent of me having to make some form of decision to go back and chase taxpayers' money, which I do not want to have to do, I would ask that they come together and address this for once and for all because it is creating an issue with supply and the availability of resources.  That summarises what I want to happen on Thursday.<\/p><p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy raised a number of issues that we will not deal with in detail today.  The climate Bill is very important and I know the Deputy has a very considered interest in it, based on previous appearances.  It will be coming through very shortly.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of the planning (No. 1) Bill, which will also come through very shortly.<\/p> <p>It will be a very progressive Bill that will deal with a number of issues raised by many people in these Houses, particularly with regard to vacant sites.  The key question from the Deputy relates to the planning and development (No. 2) Bill, which deals with issues arising from the Mahon tribunal.  This is important legislation from a planning perspective with regard to the architecture of the State and how we ensure what happened in the past does not happen again.  That architecture has been recommended and will be enacted through this Bill.  In lieu of the changes in this Bill, I felt it necessary to announce a full review of the operation of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am the first Minister to do this as it has never happened in the history of the State.  This is not for a defined view but it is necessary as the board has been part of the State's mechanisms for as long as I have been on this Earth, which is approximately 39 years.  The Deputy asked about taking properties in charge.  If legislative change is required for the concerns raised - I share some of those concerns - I will introduce that legislation.  That issue is being worked on now.  If there must be a legislative process, I will deal with it.<\/p><p> There were questions about the Water Services Bill.  The lifespan of meters is in excess of 40 years, not 15 years.  The progress of the Bill will be down to the Whips but I will take Second Stage on Thursday and Friday.  It will then go to Committee Stage.  I can get an update from the Whips but the Deputy is one of those Whips.  The legislation must be in place before 1 January 2015.  I am open to whatever is necessary to ensure it gets the time required.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about targeted investment for housing and \"Yes\" is the answer.  Working with the Department officials, there is a considered approach to the issues arising from this issue.  The implementation will be thorough and there will be an oversight group which I will chair, as that is necessary.  The targeting of where new housing units are necessary is something on which we have spent a considerable amount of time.  There is an acute issue in Dublin and there are issues in the conurbation with which the Deputy would be familiar, as she represents Kildare.  We will target investment in areas where there is the most need and demand.  I have indicated on numerous occasions that I have given local authority managers considerable time since coming into this position to ensure they could deliver this well-flagged strategy, and I expect them to do so.  If they are not prepared to do so, serious questions will be asked.  From the information I have, many local authorities are ready to go.  The process will be targeted and we have heat maps for the requirements of local authority houses throughout the country.  We have heat maps of the maximum amount of interventions across other areas that are progressing, and even in the Dublin area we have heat maps of where we could provide more units.<\/p><p> Deputy Murphy asked about the difference between buying and building.  In some cases it will be necessary to purchase units for short-term requirements.  One must be straight in that there is a necessity in some cases to buy units because a short-term need must be met.  Department officials are working intensely on that issue.  Having said that, when considering whether to buy or build, I will always come down on the side of building because this is about increasing supply.  In the first couple of years we must get the mix right, as building has a lag time which we must respect, although I am trying to shorten that.<\/p> <p> Deputy Murphy asked a question about homelessness.  There are a considerable number of actions ongoing in that regard.  There are 650 units, what we as politicians know as voids, which are social housing units that are boarded up.  They will be brought back into play in the next four to six months across Dublin.  On taking this role as Minister with responsibility for housing, I was very uncomfortable driving around this city, which I know well and in which I lived for almost nine years, and seeing local authority houses boarded up.  If there was one issue we were going to tackle immediately when I took this role, it was this issue.  The local authorities have progressed it significantly.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who was Minister of State, did considerable work in this regard.  Another 650 of these are to be brought into play in the next four to six months.<\/p><p> On housing allocations, because this is a key issue when it comes to homelessness, I have instructed the local authorities, particularly in Dublin, to ensure that 20% of their available allocations will be given towards those who are homeless.  It is an acute issue and we need to change the allocation policy to provide for that.  I am not sure whether everyone is aware of that.  There are 164 extra emergency beds coming on stream in the very near future.  That will bring the volume of emergency beds to well in excess of 1,500.<\/p><p> One measure which has worked well and in which regard I thank Threshold, which does great work, is an intervention mechanism which has been in place in Dublin since the end of July or early August and which takes the form of a tenancy sustainment protocol for vulnerable families or individuals who are in danger of losing their accommodation.  We have a process working with the local authority whereby Threshold will negotiate with the landlord and work with the local authority to try to ensure that these people are not made homeless.  The success rate has been phenomenal - well in excess of 200 - in the cases that have been identified.  This has been in place only for a couple of months.  I want to see that extended across Dublin through whatever means we can and across other local authorities where there are acute difficulties.  We will deal with the acute areas first, across the conurbations of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Kilkenny and so forth.  That has been quite successful.<\/p><p> We have increased the budget to deal with homelessness by &euro;10.5 million to in excess of &euro;55.5 million for 2015.  I repeat that I am not convinced this is solely an issue of funding.  Only last week I gave &euro;4 million to the issues of Dublin.  Supply is the key issue in the long term, but we need to ensure that the necessary short-term mechanisms are put in place, and that is my key issue.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked a question about rent supplement, which as the committee will be aware does not come under my remit.  Rent supplement is something that is being reviewed.  I would not like to say that it is something that is totally dismissed because the Minister is continually reviewing it, but whatever process is put in place, we must ensure that landlords nests are not feathered by any increase of such supplement.<\/p><p> On the work of Threshold in targeting families who are in a vulnerable situation at present, in an absolute majority of cases the rent supplement is increased.  Maybe we need to improve the targeting process to get the rent supplements increased, but I would have a concern in principle about merely increasing the rent supplement because rents would probably just increase.  I do not want to facilitate an increase in rent.  It is not as simple as that.  The targeting of how this is done is the critical issue.<\/p><p> To take away Deputy Coppinger's confusion, there are two Bills and one comes before the other.  I explained what happened here in relation to the Bills Office.  It was merely a human error.  Frankly, I was not even aware of it.  The Deputy has the Bill in front of her.  After Christmas, there will be a further Bill to deal with the issues the Deputy raised in relation to local authorities, landlords, etc.<\/p> <p>She will have to await its publication to see its detail, but the principles by which I spoke two weeks ago will remain.  Given the timeframe, the Attorney General will deal with a number of issues concerning the Bill.<\/p><p> Regarding homelessness, I am not aware of what the Taoiseach stated in the D&aacute;il.  I was not available at the time.  Whatever actions will emanate from Thursday will be brought to a Cabinet sub-committee next Monday to be enacted in whatever way necessary.  In principle, I have no issue with any D&aacute;il discussion on homelessness.  It is just a matter of finding time to facilitate such a debate.  I would welcome it, but all of our time is currently being taken up.<\/p><p> The Deputy's statement that there had been no extra capital investment was bizarre.  We announced &euro;3.8 billion for implementation and that 35,000 new homes would be put in place.  There are a number of ways to bring social housing units that are boarded up back into use.  Those units total approximately 2,300.  The aim is to lease approximately 11,000 units while building and, to a lesser extent, acquiring-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014120200019#X00300","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417536300,"counter":178,"content":"<p>How many will be built?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014120200022#AA00200","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1417536300,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I was just about to give the Deputy that figure.  It will be in excess of 22,000 units.  These figures were in the public domain last week.  The Deputy has read and digested the strategy.  The current figure is 22,273 units, but I would like to increase it somewhat, if possible.<\/p><p>  The Deputy need not have concerns about reform.  The changes being considered are meant to facilitate people.  This is not a question of full cost recovery.  I do not envisage a change in local authorities' differential rent systems, but I want to ensure consistency of approach.  In many ways, local authorities are doing completely different things.<\/p><p>  A range of other reforming steps is necessary.  For example, we are creating a passport.  Housing need does not respect local authority boundaries.  Someone who moves between local authority areas should not have to start the rigmarole all over again.  That is a crazy situation.  We will introduce a new tenant purchase scheme, which will be broadly welcomed across the political spectrum.  It will be sustainable and give people choices.  We are also considering the possibility of tri-space lettings.  Some local authority managements and representatives have raised with me the issue of the amount of time that is lost between the time someone is offered social housing and the time he or she refuses it or, for whatever reason, becomes unable to accept it.  This could happen twice in respect of the same property.  Someone is missing out because of the lost time.  I intend to use a web-based system primarily so that people might see in advance what is available, determine whether they meet all of the requirements and declare their willingness.  If a person or family does not take a unit, another person or family will get it automatically.  These proposed measures are very progressive and necessary.  They should have been dealt with a number of years ago.<\/p><p>  Some 926 units have been provided by NAMA.  By the end of next year, it intends to make in excess of 450 further units available for social housing.

That money works, but of course more is needed.<\/p><p>  The concern I have about the Government strategy is that there is a huge reliance on the private sector.  Without rent caps or some kind of rent control, which are common in other European countries, we are going to fuel the private rented sector.  This is a genuine concern of mine and not an excuse to have a go at the Minister.  This could increase the demand on private rented accommodation.  I know we are locked into a situation where immediate solutions have to be provided, but the Government and the Oireachtas need to do something about rent controls.  We need to grasp this.  I know all the arguments that we cannot impose blanket controls, but there are ways of doing it within the Constitution and so on.  If necessary, we should change the Constitution to do it.<\/p><p>  We recounted earlier on the death of Jonathan Corrie and the appalling situation.  That must never be allowed happen again.

People in rural Ireland are looking for new group water schemes but are being discommoded because the schemes are deemed to be non-viable due to the cost of setting them up.  Will the Minister change the rules and increase the allocation so that these schemes can become viable?  The rules were changed in April, with an extra &euro;1,000 given per house up to a maximum of &euro;7,475.  A lot of these schemes have been awaiting approval for a number of years.  The people involved can neither drink nor wash their clothes.  They are willing to pay for water but they need to get schemes up and running.

On behalf of the Health Information and Quality Authority, I thank the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for giving me the opportunity to discuss the findings of our review of pre-hospital emergency care services  I am joined by Ms Mary Dunnion, acting director of regulation, and Mr. Marty Whelan, our head of communications and stakeholder engagement.  We welcome the opportunity to appear again before the Oireachtas committee and to engage with members.<\/p><p>  Last year we developed a three-year assurance programme, with the aim of providing assurance on the quality and safety of health-care services in line with the requirements of the Health Act 2007, that is, to monitor nationally mandated standards for health and social care services provided by the HSE and other specified providers.  The focus of this programme is to find out how services are performing against the standards and to provide feedback aimed primarily at improving services.<\/p><p>  As part of our three-year assurance programme, HIQA had planned to undertake a review in the final quarter of 2014 of pre-hospital emergency services against the national standards.  However, following a number of reported concerns, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, asked the authority to bring forward its review.  Our work began last March.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the review is to provide assurance to the public that the following are in place: clear strategic direction with implementation plans and control measures for the national service; effective governance and leadership arrangements at all levels within the service; clearly defined schemes of delegation; appropriate controls in place through service level agreements with third parties delivering services on behalf of the national service; appropriate quality and risk management arrangements; workforce is well organised, skilled and there is a culture of continuous improvement; and the use of key performance indicators to include response times and clinical outcomes and other quality assurance metrics to assure the public that the ambulance service is both safe and effective.<\/p><p>  Over the past ten years there has been a considerable range of progress in respect of the following in the services.  There have been clinical competencies developed using pre-hospital emergency care practitioners, increases in the number of paramedics and advanced paramedics, and expansion in treatment options that these health-care professionals provide to patients as the first point of contact, and these represent a very significant advance in patient care.  The service providers, the practitioners themselves and the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council deserve great credit for all of these advancement.  However, many legacy issues associated with the former fragmented nature of multiple providers remain, and the National Ambulance Service has struggled to fully integrate as one entity.<\/p><p>  Significant change to ambulance service provision in Ireland will be vital to improve services for patients.  Our review identifies challenges in relation to: workforce and leadership, the models of care, fleet and fleet deployment, clinical governance and risk management, the relationship between the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade, and dispatch times and emergency response times.<\/p><p>  I will now briefly outline some of the main findings and recommendations of our review.  Our review found a number of challenges in the area of workforce and leadership.  As a result, we believe that there is a requirement for more effective leadership, clear strategic planning and ongoing constructive co-operation between management and their staff.  This is not currently happening.  Investment in management support and training, better management performance and a more comprehensive focus on performance management and quality improvement, should deliver better quality services for patients.  A lot of change has happened within senior management ranks, mainly through internal movement, and in some instances the frequency and rapidity of these changes in the past few years in management appears to have created issues.  These include that some staff in management reported to us that they did not have formal job descriptions that outline the specifics of their roles and their aligned responsibilities.  More worryingly, some staff reported to us that while they have accepted new positions within the service, they do not have the appropriate technical knowledge.<\/p><p>  Our review concludes that strategic planning for the service will require consideration of plans for wider organisational and health service reform.  The draft national ambulance strategy 2014-16 does not fully reflect the impact of wider reform and how pre-hospital emergency care needs to complement new models of care provision, including the potential impact of the emerging hospital group structures and their delivery of unscheduled care.<\/p><p>  When looking at models of care, the authority found that the number of calls received per year for ambulances in Ireland continues to increase and in the past year, there has been a reported increase of 10%.  Increased call volume translates into an ever increasing number of patients being transported to hospital for treatment and we believe this is unsustainable.  This has created delays in patient hand-overs at overcrowded emergency departments, EDs, and creates an inability to rapidly turnaround ambulances from emergency departments and free them up for additional calls.<\/p><p>  We believe that the service model needs to be reviewed.  At present, an emergency vehicle is dispatched to all calls, without examining the potential for treatment or triage over the telephone.<\/p> <p>In addition, following arrival on scene, unless the patient refuses to be transferred to hospital, the vast majority of patients are automatically transferred to hospital emergency departments.  This model of care does not consider the potential for the transportation of the patient for treatment to a setting that may be more suitable to meet their needs such as a local injury unit, or indeed the possibility of treatment and discharge on the scene by the ambulance crew itself.<\/p><p> Both the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade must develop and implement an ongoing community education programme that would promote appropriate use of ambulances.  Such public education should seek to reduce unnecessary requests for ambulances and should increase public awareness and acceptance of the skills and competencies of paramedics.  The strategic direction of emergency ambulance service provision needs to be clearly articulated by the HSE.  The flow of emergency medical admissions by ambulance should be monitored by all, but managed by the National Ambulance Service.<\/p><p> The clinical governance agenda is currently underdeveloped across both the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade.  The appointment of a full-time medical director in the National Ambulance Service has improved clinical expertise at a leadership level.  However, effective clinical governance requires that there should be a collective leadership responsibility.  There is currently no clinical audit in the National Ambulance Service.  Therefore quality assurance of clinical care being delivered is very limited.  That is not acceptable and needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> The National Ambulance Service has only recently started to review adverse clinical incidents.  A new policy, which is aligned with best practice, was introduced in 2011.  The service has good visibility of severe incidents and thoroughly investigates these to identify potential for learning.  The system works less well for more minor incidents and reporting of incidents is not operationally embedded.  Ongoing analysis of the collective experience of such events allows for the prioritisation of improvement efforts on the basis of risk, and is a crucial aspect of any successful risk management strategy.<\/p><p> HIQA observed a fundamental disconnect in the internal organisational mechanisms that are used by the service providers for reporting of risks.  The current infrastructure for proactively capturing and subsequently managing risk in the National Ambulance Service is overly complicated and it is ineffective in its ability to effectively escalate and rapidly address persistent issues.<\/p><p> It is recommended that the National Ambulance Service should improve its patient advocacy approach, including its responsiveness to the handling of patient complaints.  When looking at the relationship between the National Ambulance service and Dublin Fire Brigade we were concerned to note there was no evidence of integrated management of pre-hospital emergency care in Dublin, the most heavily populated region.  The current governance arrangements between Dublin Fire Brigade and the National Ambulance Service is disjointed with inadequate quality assurance and accountability controls.<\/p><p> The provision of safe and effective pre-hospital emergency care services by two distinct agencies, with a critical interface, requires a rigorous service level arrangement, which clearly articulates governance responsibilities for both parties.  Both service providers must address the operational inefficiencies that our report identifies and must publish an action plan outlining proposed steps to improve individual and collective performance in call handling, dispatch and co-ordination of calls between both services.  For necessary performance improvements that are identified in HIQA&rsquo;s review and which rely on co-operation between both services, a joint action plan between both service providers should be produced and published.<\/p><p> As a matter of urgency, both the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade must put the necessary corporate and clinical governance arrangements in place to provide a fully integrated ambulance service in the greater Dublin area.  This should include a binding service level agreement that includes formal quality and performance assurance reporting mechanisms.  In addition, the HSE must immediately involve Dublin Fire Brigade in the National Ambulance Service control centre reconfiguration project to ensure a seamless and safe transition of services in Dublin.<\/p><p> One key issue we looked at in this review related to dispatch and emergency response times.  HIQA supports the decision to move towards one national ambulance control centre, which will be located over two sites in Ballyshannon and Tallaght.  Significant change in many other areas will be vital to improve services for patients.  Three different computer-aided dispatch systems were in use at the time of HIQA&rsquo;s review but the systems were not integrated, which meant that the National Ambulance Service continued to operate as six different services within defined geographical areas, rather than as one national entity.  This means that there appears to be limited visibility of ambulance resources outside the geographically defined areas.<\/p><p> There is considerable potential for improvement in ambulance service response times if efforts are directed towards improving the operational efficiency of call handling and dispatch by control centres.  In addition, both ambulance service providers should improve response times by looking to match available resources to anticipated demand over the calendar week and through more tactical, dynamic deployment of resources away from station, based on predictive analysis of ambulance need.<\/p><p> Regular monitoring of the service&rsquo;s ability to meet targets helps to deliver quality assurance, improvement and public accountability.  Both the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade must monitor their performance through a consistent, reliable, accurate and balanced system of measuring and reporting against key performance indicators.  These should include the seven minute 59 second first response times for all ECHO and DELTA calls, which are currently not reported.  We also believe that the specific response times for cardiac arrest, stroke and heart attack and for ambulance turnaround times at hospitals should be introduced and reported upon.<\/p><p> When examining issues concerning the ambulance fleet we noted a lack of ongoing investment increases the probability of an ambulance breakdown impacting on patient care in an emergency situation.  The National Ambulance Service replacement policy clearly outlines that once a vehicle has been in use for seven years or has reached mileage in excess of 500,000 km, it should be replaced.  Despite this policy, 18% of the current fleet is eight or more years old.<\/p><p> Geographical challenges in rural and sparsely populated areas present difficulties for ambulance services that strive to achieve timely and appropriate responses to ECHO and DELTA calls.  To achieve timely and appropriate responses to ECHO calls, which account for 2,500 to 3,000 calls per year relating to the sickest patients that require ambulance services, the National Ambulance Service must as a priority develop and support a comprehensive national programme of community first response schemes in all rural and sparsely populated areas.  Efforts should be focused initially on those communities that are most challenged in achieving rapid responses and do not have schemes in place.<\/p><p> Our report contains 12 crucially important recommendations which relate to aspects of service provision in the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade.  In addition, further areas that require improvement are also included throughout this report.  It is expected that on foot of these recommendations and this report, both service providers should formulate written plans aimed at driving the necessary improvements in the quality and safety of the State&rsquo;s pre-hospital emergency care services.  Eight of the recommendations relate to the provision of emergency ambulance services nationally and must be addressed collectively as well as individually by the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade.  Four of the recommendations relate specifically to the National Ambulance Service, and these must be addressed by the National Ambulance Service and the HSE.<\/p><p> The Irish health service is undergoing a period of significant change.  As the acute hospital service moves towards a model of hospital groups, ambulance services must be fully included in this strategic planning process and must operate as a clinical service that is embedded in the unscheduled care system.  This change should be reflected in the strategic plans of both the HSE and emergency ambulance service providers.<\/p><p> There is scope within current resources for significant improvement for patients in pre-hospital emergency care services.  Many of the required changes that this HIQA review outlines can be achieved with strong leadership, effective management, staff buy-in and a detailed and strategic approach.  There is scope too for other changes which would make a significant difference to ambulance service performance.  I refer, for example, to effective management and staff co-operation, improvements in operational efficiency in the practice of call handling and dispatch, combined with dynamic deployment and matching resources more effectively to anticipated demand.<\/p> <p>We believe they will make a difference.  Changes in these areas could translate into measurably better response times with current resources.  It is important that the HSE, the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade act now to address the findings of this report.<\/p><p> I thank the members of the committee for inviting us here to discuss the report.  I look forward to their questions and their views on how HIQA can work with service providers and the committee in the interests of improving the quality and safety of pre-hospital emergency care services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200003#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1417537800,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Quinn for his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200005#E00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1417537800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I join the Chairman in extending congratulations and best wishes to Mr. Quinn in his new role and responsibilities.  I ensure him of our co-operation and good wishes always.<\/p><p>  I have read the report's executive summary.  I would like to know the methodology of the review.  Where was the engagement?  With whom did HIQA engage?  I ask that because I do not get a sense from the report that it considered matters in a geographically dispersed way.  I think it might be more particular to the centre, but that may be just my impression.  How was it carried out?  With whom did HIQA engage?  Was it geographically inclusive?  I can understand Mr. Quinn saying in his contribution that geographic challenges in rural and sparsely populated areas will always present.<\/p><p>  My family have experienced three incidents in the past 12 months.  I live in an area within a mile of which there is an ambulance station.  There is another one 15 miles away from that and another 30 miles away.  In each of the three incidents, one of which resulted in a death as a result of a heart attack, another of which was my heart attack - I am sitting here before Mr. Quinn and the details are all verifiable where it took place in a GP's surgery - and the other, last Saturday week, where I had to kneel before my mother, who had collapsed, and was unable to lift her, in all three incidents and despite the three ambulance stations being close to us that I mentioned, including one in my home town, the ambulance came from more than 45 miles away.  I am just one citizen sitting here today.  I should be very thankful that I am.<\/p><p>  My point is no criticism of HIQA.  It is all to do with how it goes about its business.  I have gone through the recommendations and I have some comments and questions on those.  Mine is just one family.  My wife's brother might not have lived in any event if the ambulance had come from any of the other three closer stations than the one from which the ambulance was dispatched.  The general practitioner and the support nurse where I had a heart attack last January were incredulous at the time.  When they came from Virginia to Monaghan town they could not even find it.  It is no reflection on the ambulance crews, who are wonderful people, as I can attest to.  My mother is a hospital patient as we speak.  Again, only in the past fortnight, I was on my knees because I could not move for a full hour waiting for that ambulance to come.<\/p><p>  That experience is replicated for many families throughout the country.  We need to get serious about the issue.  I do not accept it is about geographic location or anything else.  There are no excuses in the wide earthly world for what happened in the incidents to which I can personally attest.  This is not second-hand information; I was present at all three.<\/p><p>  How was the review carried out?  With whom did HIQA engage?  I will raise the matter again.  In respect of my patience and holding back on making any comment about my experiences, I have just lost it with the third and most recent incident with my mother.  It is no longer good enough for me to hold back.  I am saying it out and sharing it here today with colleagues as well as with representatives of HIQA.<\/p><p>  Will Mr. Quinn explain recommendation No. 2 in the report.  There is almost a question as to whether the national ambulance office is to operate as a distinct entity, under the remit of the acute hospitals directorate of the HSE.  Does Mr. Quinn still see the national ambulance office as a separate, distinct and continuing entity?  What does recommendation No. 2 spell out for the future of the national ambulance office?<\/p><p>  On recommendations Nos. 1 and 3, recommendation No. 3 is more prescriptive in terms of the relationship between the HSE and Dublin Fire Brigade.  Recommendation No. 4 in the same context uses the words \"safe transition of services in Dublin\".  Is HIQA proposing in the recommendation a cessation of the situation where the greater extent of ambulance cover is provided quite efficiently through the Dublin Fire Brigade service?  Representatives of Dublin Fire Brigade have appeared before the committee in the past.  It is a big issue.<\/p><p>  Recommendation No. 5 refers to reviewing the current practice of 100% delivery to hospital emergency departments.  That is worth considering.  While not in the three incidents I shared with the witnesses, I can cite other incidents where it might have been more appropriate on the assessment of the individual patient concerned that a more local minor injuries unit in one of the non-acute hospital settings could have been a more appropriate delivery point, rather than adding to the untold distress that is the reality in emergency departments in acute hospitals.  I think the review is worthwhile and I ask Mr. Quinn to comment further on it.<\/p><p>  Recommendation No. 7 refers to a seven minute and 59 second first response time for patients who are in cardiac or respiratory arrest.  The incidents I have cited will have the recorded times for notification and response.  They were off the Richter scale.  Two of those were cardiac arrests, including mine.  I was transported from Cavan initially and then on the St. James's and operated on that evening.  Seven minutes and 59 seconds sounds all fine and good.  It was achievable if the ambulance had been dispatched from the station closest to each of the three situations I have cited.  However, the ambulance passed that station and passed two others also closer than the station from which the ambulance was dispatched.  I find that intolerable.<\/p><p>  When Monaghan Hospital lost its acute services, we were promised that we would be compensated by a fully staffed state-of-the-art ambulance service to cater for all emergency needs.  We have not got within an ass's roar of it.  I say that with great vexation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200005#E00300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1417538400,"counter":253,"content":"<p>To be fair to Mr. Quinn, it is not in his remit to grant, provide or procure services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200006#F00100","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1417538400,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I am aware of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200006#F00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1417538400,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Quinn and thank him for his presentation.

I am sorry to refer back to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's tragic personal story.  The report mentioned that people do not have technical expertise.  Is Mr. Quinn saying that people in the ambulance response unit do not have the technical expertise to deploy an ambulance that is closer than the 45-mile distance to which Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred?  If so, that is outrageous.  I know it is not Mr. Quinn's responsibility but that is a worrying finding from the report - that people are in positions but do not have the technical expertise to carry out their functions.  Who appointed these people?  Did the report look into that?<\/p><p>  Mr. Quinn spoke about challenges regarding leadership.  I would like to know a little bit more about that aspect.  Who are these leaders who are challenged?  The way in which they are managing and deploying resources within their service is obviously inadequate.  How can somebody be given a job that they do not know how to do?  We would not ask an occupational therapist to carry out surgical procedures.  If it is the case that people are being appointed to posts for which they are unqualified, that is outrageous.  It is a serious finding.  If that is the case, I thank Mr. Quinn for unearthing it.  <\/p><p>  As regards the relationship between the Dublin fire brigade and the ambulance service, it would appear that there is little or no communication and they operate in a disjointed manner.  Nearly half the population lives within the greater Dublin area, although there are challenges in rural areas.  If that is the case, why is it happening?  That potential duplication of services seems ludicrous when we know it is difficult, in some places, to get an ambulance to a crisis within the required time.<\/p><p>  The report referred to community engagement concerning ambulance services.  Can Mr. Quinn explain that to me because I do not understand it?  Is he talking about Order of Malta services, the Civil Defence or other first responders?  I would like to know a little more about that and what can be done to improve it. <\/p><p>  What jumped out of the report for me was that we have people in positions who reported to HIQA that they do not have the appropriate technical knowledge.

It involved meeting in excess of 200 members of the national ambulance service staff.  They ranged from leadership levels down to front-line care providers.  Reciprocally, we met 10% of the Dublin fire brigade staff.  <\/p><p>  Our meetings with staff were conducted through focus groups which were randomly selected.  We randomly selected them from their duty rosters.  It referenced and brought together staff from all sites all over the country.<\/p><p>  Each control centre was visited and a lengthy time was spent in each control centre run by the national ambulance service, and the one control centre run by Townsend Street.  In addition, the review team went on ambulance trips and responded to emergency calls across the country with the ambulance service.  That was the on-site component of the review. <\/p><p>  The methodology associated with that was in line with the terms of reference which we published in April.  Mr. Quinn outlined them in his presentation.  In tandem with that we had an extensive documentation request which mostly looked at governance, management and workforce issues.  We then looked at the data.  We used the data in the context of response times which are nationally published.  They were 18 minutes and 59 seconds.  We also looked at unpublished data, which is the seven minute and 59 second response.  We also pulled 24-hour data ourselves on St. Patrick's Day.  In the timeframe of our review it was our opinion that would have been a busy 24 hours.  <\/p><p>  We took those data from all over the country and analysed and reviewed them.  We came to our conclusions through that whole process.  In that context, we were assured that we covered the geographical terrain.

Two Deputies raised the substantive issue of appointing managers who do not have technical skills.  I assure them that our description referred mainly to the senior management staff of the National Ambulance Service whom we interviewed.  They reported to us that they had been appointed mainly through internal movement within the service and, at times, without appropriate job descriptions matched to the strategy of the National Ambulance Service.  On a couple of occasions they also reported to us that they believed they had been appointed to senior management positions without the relevant technical skills.  I do not want it reflected here that specific on the ground the staff or middle managers had reflected they were inappropriately appointed on the basis of the possession of technical skills.  It was senior management staff, in the main, who had reported that particular deficit.  The deficit is important and key because such staff are charged with strategically leading and operationally managing the service.  The range of deficits and challenges that we found are very complex and require technical skills to achieve positive outcomes for the service and for service users.<\/p><p>  Recommendation No. 6 highlights our other recommendations to extend the role of paramedic staff and advanced paramedic staff.  We believe, at the minute, that there is not a sufficient number of advanced paramedic staff working in the services that would allow them to expand into a wider scope of practice.  We have also unearthed, through the course of the review, the fact that a number of paramedical staff have left the service but have not been replaced in an appropriate way.

One issue raised was the relationship and ongoing communication between the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade.  During the course of this review we evidenced that an ongoing difficult or fraught relationship appears to have existed between the two services.  The two services appear to operate in specific silos.  In some instances that is evidenced even in the relationship within the control centre which is a shared building.  We have specifically recommended that their relationship needs to be worked on as a matter of urgency.  Recommendations Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, stipulate a need for a jointly created action plan to force co-operation and joint communication by the two services.  That element is key for us.<\/p><p>  We have also conducted a major programme on the ambulance control centre's reconfiguration.  We have evidenced a lack of co-working with Dublin Fire Brigade for this major project.  Recommendation No. 4 is based on the involvement of Dublin Fire Brigade in the national call centre reconfiguration programme which is essential to iron out  operational inefficiencies moving forward.  As I have heard Ms Dunnion mention on a number of occasions, unless we address some of the operational inefficiencies before the move to the singular call centre model, all we will do is carry them from the old model to the new one.  Therefore, we have asked for the involvement of Dublin Fire Brigade in that respect.<\/p><p>  We have covered the issues of general workforce development and planning.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in mentioned our recommendations for Dublin Fire Brigade to move forward.  We have definitely not made any specific recommendations to discontinue the service being provided by Dublin Fire Brigade.

It was commissioned by Dublin City Council and we believe it will be published in February 2015.<\/p> <p>We were again asked about community engagement and first responder schemes.

This year there has been a 10% increase in the number of people calling an ambulance and the natural pathway for patients is that once they call, an ambulance is dispatched and they are dealt with and transported to a main emergency department.  If they consent to a main emergency department, 99.9% of patients will be transported.  That model is not sustainable nor is it in line with what is happening in other jurisdictions.  For example, elsewhere some services have managed to reduce by 40% the number of patients transported to a main emergency department.  That is not simple to do because it requires investment and planning and embracing the concept and moving with it.  We have made a recommendation that a properly trained person should triage people over the telephone to find out exactly what is happening and whether they need to go to a hospital or whether there is another pathway for them.  Trained practitioners can go to see the patients and treat them there, discharging them if appropriate.  This is based on the development of the competencies of advanced paramedics and paramedics and involving medical staff in taking calls and the management of patients.  That opportunity is there and it needs to be worked towards.<\/p><p>  I refer to community first responders.  When something tragic happens to somebody such as in the cases cited by the Deputy, an ambulance with advanced paramedics needs to be dispatched.  Equally, however, somebody who is trained and competent as a first responder is also required.  He or she can be a trained lay person, an advanced paramedic in a fast mobile vehicle, a GP, a garda or whomever.  The response times in the west and the south are the least good but they are also the areas, particularly, the west, that have the lowest number of community responders.  The areas with the biggest problem have had the least local investment in the context of community responders.  We have made a recommendation that the NAS immediately begins the training of people as responders and, aligned with that, introduces a communications system at local level engaging with the public to bring them on stream to work towards an effective first response scheme.<\/p><p>  In that context, first response in seven minutes 59 seconds is not publicly reported.  We looked at the data, which is collected, and it shows that are poor response times to the seven minute 59 seconds target.  It is for that reason we have made a recommendation in that regard because we firmly believe as a review team that unless the service providers are collecting data, there is no way they will drive improvement.  We have, therefore, made a recommendation specific to that for all Echo and Delta calls, which are the critical calls, and we have said the service providers, NAS and Dublin Fire Brigade, must specifically report heart attack, cardiac arrest and stroke response times.  It is to create momentum to drive improvement that we are requesting the implementation of that recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200008#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Dunnion"},{"type":"speech","time":1417539600,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Every time HIQA officials appear before the committee, the quality of the information they provide is superb.  From an efficiency perspective, I wish we had more statutory agencies that worked along the same lines as it.  I wish Mr. Quinn the best of luck in his new role.<\/p><p>  Both the NAS and Dublin Fire Brigade have appeared before the committee singing the praises of the services they offer but HIQA's report is blistering about them.  According to the report, there is a senior management skills deficit, no technical expertise in certain areas, no clinical audit of the NAS, no strategic directive, no effective governance, insufficient advanced paramedic staff to allow the service to progress and an internal transfer of posts without interview and with skills deficits on the part of those who are moved, which is the killer.  This is a blistering report compared to the picture painted for us over the past number of months.<\/p><p>  The data are key.  HIQA's focus groups were drawn from personnel around the country.  Following the committee's previous hearing in this regard, I visited two centres - one run by the fire brigade and one run by the NAS.  I was struck by the difference in morale and self-esteem in both establishments.  There is a vast and stark difference in the reported numbers by both organisations.  On the basis of the focus groups, does Ms Dunnion agree there is a much higher level of esteem among the fire brigade personnel than among the NAS staff?  There is also a much greater difference in staff attendance.  Can she see reasons for the stark differences between the fire brigade and NAS in the data?  I acknowledge HIQA uses a hierarchical structure and treats them both as providing the same service.  However, they do not provide the same service and they perform at different levels with vastly different budgets, yet the organisation with the lesser budget is performing at a much greater capacity than the organisation with the larger budget.  Are there obvious reasons for that other than the stark issues I referred to?<\/p><p>  Arising from my visits, we conducted research in the Houses of the Oireachtas with our own research team into best practice in other countries, which offer what may be termed \"all singing, all dancing\" emergency services.

Once a vehicle has been in use for seven years or has reached mileage greater than 500,000 km, it is replaced but the officials stated that despite the policy, 18% of the current fleet is eight years old or more.  Louth County Hospital is located in my home town of Dundalk.  Over the past 12 to 18 months, there has been a great deal of concern about the ambulance service at the hospital.  The paramedics, advanced paramedics and the drivers all do a fantastic job but many vehicles have broken down over the past number of years and the public are concerned.

There is clinical audit in the Dublin Fire Brigade but it requires much more development.  The reason the clinical audit is in the Dublin Fire Brigade is that it has had a medical director on a part-time basis for a longer time than the National Ambulance Service.  The latter's medical director was appointed only in 2011.  Notwithstanding that, there are significant opportunities for a clinical audit to already take place and those opportunities need now to be taken.<\/p><p>  There was a reluctance on the behalf of the National Ambulance Service to conduct a clinical audit because it was waiting for an electronic record and was not using the paper record.  We would have seen that as a deficit and that the paper record should be used for clinical audit because many places do not have electronic records and are using paper records.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200009#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Dunnion"},{"type":"speech","time":1417540200,"counter":303,"content":"<p>For the person watching at home as we debate this who does not understand some of the jargon, can Ms Dunning explain what is meant by the statement in HIQA's report that there is no clinical audit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200009#J00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417540200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>What it means for the public is that although they may experience good care, there is no system in place to assure those who manage the service that there is good care, there is no assurance for those who deliver the care that it is being monitored and that lessons can be learnt where there may not be good care, and there is no way to assure members of the public formally that there is care in respect of their individual experience.   Of course, the big loss is that if there is not good care, it cannot be detected and it is not possible to manage, change it and learn from it.  That is probably the most important example.<\/p><p>  There is a difference between those whom the committee met from the Dublin Fire Brigade and those whom it met from the National Ambulance Service.  Dublin Fire Brigade is a uniform service and by its nature it has the constituents of that.  It is well organised, there are clear communication pathways and the staff are responsive to any issues, or to recommendations or direction given through their management line.  In the National Ambulance Service, there are a lot of legacy issues, which we saw.  In the groups that we met - as I stated, we met quite a large number of staff - there was dissatisfaction.  It permeated through.  Probably the biggest manifestation was the poor communication processes that they perceived to be in place.  They would, for example, have cited areas where information was passed down by memo as opposed to somebody talking to them.  What we saw is that although staff were complaining, it was in a desire to improve the service.  That was tangible through all the groups that we met and is noted in the report.  We recognise the need for good communication processes and the dissatisfaction that happens when those are not in place, which is what we witnessed.  As a consequence, we have a recommendation related to that within the report.  They were two different groups of staff.  They are structured differently.  One is a fire service and emergency service, and it is in existence a long time and has probably the cohesiveness which arises from that length of time.<\/p><p>  On staffing, the review would recognise that there are not enough advanced paramedics.  Also, we would have seen that in the attrition rate within the ambulance services, particularly the National Ambulance Service, for paramedics more than advanced paramedics, the replacement factor does not match the attrition.  When paramedics are recruited, it takes two years before they are able to function on their own.  If one does not have a good replacement practice then there will be shortages.  That is why we made the recommendation regarding workforce planning because we would not have seen that such was in place.  As Mr. Quinn stated, we have been informed by the HSE that the capacity review which, because it was happening in tandem with our review, looks specifically at resources and what is required in the service moving forward, will be ready for publication at the latter end of December.  That review should give a more comprehensive view of what is required but we saw deficits in the numbers that would be required for the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200009#J00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Dunnion"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417540200,"counter":305,"content":"<p>In respect of the question asked by Senator Crown, the capacity review should also provide us with some specific comparisons with ambulance resources in other jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200009#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Quinn"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1417540200,"counter":306,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417540200,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I am not sure-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200009#J01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Quinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417540200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>In the context of Ireland, there are 266 ambulances and 57 response vehicles.

We also saw that the timelines for its replacement policy were behind schedule so that is a challenge.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200010#K01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Dunnion"},{"type":"speech","time":1417540800,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Is there a HIQA national standard for ambulances?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200010#K01700","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417540800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>There is a certification of vehicle roadworthiness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200010#K01800","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Dunnion"},{"type":"speech","time":1417540800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Is there a national standard for ambulance services in general?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200010#K01900","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417540800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>It is just a national policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200010#K02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Quinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1417540800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>It is just a policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200010#K02100","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Dunnion"},{"type":"speech","time":1417540800,"counter":335,"content":"<p>If there are no standards then there is no minimum requirement and no measurement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014120200010#K02200","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1417540800,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I take the point made by the Deputy.

The debate has been very enlightening.  We all recognise there has been a significant change in the ambulance service.  As Deputy Maloney has said, it is important that we pay tribute to the staff who have changed the <i>modus operandi<\/i>of the service, from transporting people to now responding, taking care of and looking after people.  We should acknowledge the work done by the people who work in the ambulance service, and very often in difficult and trying services.  It is right to express our appreciation to them.<br\/>In terms of reports, we have today's report and there are two further reports in the pipeline.  It is in that context that I propose, and as a result of this meeting, pending the review and subsequent to the review, we should invite the National Ambulance Service, the HSE and Dublin Fire Brigade to attend a meeting at a date to be finalised.  The purpose of the meeting would be to continue, as HIQA has done already, monitoring the ambulance service.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br\/>Having listened to today's report three issues arose.  First, a need for co-operation and integration between the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade.  Second, an audit must take place.  Third, we should focus on improving measures. <br\/>HIQA cannot compel anyone to act on its recommendations but it is important that they are acted upon.<\/p> <p>I hope the culture within the Health Service Executive, HSE, will be to accept, as Mr. Quinn noted, the recommendations with a view to improving the service.

This probably is the key starting point as to why the service being provided is as it is, notwithstanding the wonderful people who, while desperately lacking in morale, are trying to provide those services.  Consequently, I am unsure whether waiting until January is sufficient.<\/p><p>  My second point concerns the lack of authority of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to make sure the recommendations are enforced that was mentioned earlier.  That is the job of the joint committee and arising from this meeting, the strongest of letters should be sent to the Minister stating it is not the case that the recommendations should be implemented but that they absolutely must be implemented.  Moreover, if they are not - within a period of perhaps three months - somebody should appear before the joint committee to explain why they have not been implemented and if delays have arisen with regard to the implementation, what steps are being taken to make sure they will be implemented.
