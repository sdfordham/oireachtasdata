The results of that borrowing activity are reported in the agency's national debt account, which is also reproduced as part of the finance accounts.  However, the account does not reflect the total indebtedness of the State.  Consequently, one of the main objectives of chapter 2 is to provide a more complete picture of Government debt than that reported in the accounts of the NTMA.<\/p><p>  General Government debt is the standard measure used to report Government debt under the Maastricht treaty.  At the end of 2011, the general Government debt stood at approximately &euro;169 billion - an increase of &euro;25 billion, or 17%, year-on-year.  The end-2011 debt represented 106% of gross domestic product, compared with 92% a year earlier.<\/p><p>  The principal components of the general Government debt are borrowing by the NTMA on behalf of the State and promissory notes issued in 2010 by the Minister for Finance to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation and the EBS.  The balance outstanding on the promissory notes at end-2011 was just over &euro;28 billion.  <\/p><p>  Borrowing by the NTMA is referred to as the national debt.  The gross national debt stood at &euro;137 billion at the end of 2011 and increased to just under &euro;151 billion by the end of June 2012.  The first tranche of funding under the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland was provided in early 2011 and by mid-2012 borrowing from this source accounted for a third of the gross national debt.  <\/p><p>  Approximately 90% of the debt is now in the form of medium to long-term debt.  Figure 2.4 in chapter 2 presents a maturity profile of that debt as at June 2012.  This indicates that approximately &euro;42 billion falls due for repayment between now and 2016.  A further &euro;58 billion falls due for repayment in the period 2018 to 2020.  I should point out that repayments due on the promissory notes are not included in this analysis since they do not form part of the borrowing by the NTMA.<\/p><p>  Between September 2010 and July 2012, the NTMA did not actively seek funding in the bond markets because the cost of borrowing would have been too high.  Since mid-2011, there has been a sharp fall in the cost of borrowing.  For example, yields on Irish ten-year bonds declined from a high of 14% in July 2011 to just over 6% by the end of June 2012.  This has allowed the agency to re-enter the market.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee on the current position in that regard.<\/p><p>  At the end of June 2012, the NTMA estimated that the weighted average cost of servicing the national debt stood at approximately 4.1% per annum.  The average interest rate on Government bonds was estimated to be just under 4.8%, and the average rate on borrowing under the EU-IMF programme at 3.35%.  In contrast, the average annual interest rate on the promissory notes is estimated at just under 6%.<\/p><p>  As the committee is aware, the National Treasury Management Agency is a complex organisation with multiple functions that extend beyond its original and core role in managing Ireland's national debt.  The additional functions include management of compensation claims on behalf of certain State authorities through the State Claims Agency.  Awards and costs of settling claims amounted to &euro;110 million in 2011.  At the end of 2011, the estimated future costs for settling outstanding claims was estimated at almost &euro;1 billion.   <\/p><p>  The NTMA also carried out certain banking functions on behalf of the Minister for Finance in the period March 2010 to early August 2011.  In August 2011, the delegation to carry out those functions was revoked and the NTMA banking unit was seconded to the Department of Finance.  Under a direction from the Minister, all costs of the unit, comprising staff and certain consultancy costs, continued to be met by the NTMA until the end of 2011.  The unit's costs for the final five months of 2011 amounted to &euro;6.3 million.  The NTMA continues to bear the salary costs of the staff seconded to the Department while the unit's consultancy and other costs are borne by the Department since the start of this year.<\/p><p>  Other functions and services of the NTMA, which are outlined in chapter 25 of my report, include: the management of the National Pensions Reserve Fund; provision of staff and services to the National Asset Management Agency; and the provision of financial advice in respect of PPP and other large capital projects through the National Development Finance Agency whose role now also includes the procurement on an agency basis of certain PPP projects.  <\/p><p>  The New Economy and Recovery Authority, called NewERA, was established within the NTMA in late 2011 on a non-statutory basis.  The total costs of running the NTMA, as reported in its administration account, amounted to almost &euro;95 million, of which the agency recouped &euro;51 million.  This comprised just under &euro;28 million from the National Asset Management Agency and &euro;23 million recovered from credit institutions receiving State support.<\/p><p>  The third chapter under review by the committee concerns the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  I will deal first with contributions to the pensions fund.  The 2000 Act which established the fund required an annual Exchequer contribution of 1% of gross national product.  For the period 2009 to 2011, this requirement was met through the provision in 2009 of &euro;3 billion in Exchequer funding towards the cost of the fund's recapitalisation of Bank of Ireland and AIB and by the transfer to the fund in 2009 and 2010 of &euro;2.1 billion in pension scheme assets from universities and some non-commercial semi-State bodies.  Some &euro;1 billion was repaid from the fund to the Exchequer in 2011 at the direction of the Minister for Finance.  Under the Credit Institutions Stabilisation Act 2010, the Minister may direct that no contribution be paid into the pensions fund in 2012 and-or in 2013.<\/p><p>  The value of the fund at the end of 2011 stood at &euro;13.4 billion.  The NPRF holds two types of investments.  First, it holds a discretionary portfolio where investments are made in accordance with a strategy determined by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission.  This portfolio delivered a return of 2.1% during 2011 and its value was just under &euro;5.5 billion at the end of the year.  Second, it holds a directed investment portfolio used to fund investments in Bank of Ireland and AIB at the direction of the Minister.  <\/p><p>  During 2011, &euro;10 billion was transferred out of the discretionary portfolio to the directed investment portfolio.  This was used to bring the fund's gross investment in the two banks to &euro;21.6 billion, including the effective investment of &euro;819 million in dividend returns received in the form of ordinary bank shares.  <\/p><p>  Following the disposal of shares to the value of &euro;1 billion in Bank of Ireland in July 2011, the fund's net investment at cost amounted to &euro;20.6 billion.  By the end of 2011, the value of the holdings in the two banks stood at just under &euro;8 billion - a drop of 61% relative to the net investment amount.  When income, gains and proceeds of sales of warrants attached to preference shares are taken into account, the decline in value was 53% of the net investment.<\/p><p>  In order to raise the &euro;10 billion required to meet the 2011 investment in the two banks, the NPRF was required to liquidate the assets transferred out of its discretionary portfolio.  When a large-scale liquidation of this nature occurs, the NTMA, following standard fund management practice, engages transition managers to dispose of the assets.  The purpose is to enable market risks, operational risks and costs to be minimised and managed systematically.<\/p><p>  Chapter 4 reports on charges applied by one of the firms appointed as transition managers.  The firm was selected from a panel created by NTMA following a 2007 tender competition.  The transition management firm - UK-based State Street Bank Europe Limited - was contracted to liquidate &euro;4.7 billion of assets.<\/p><p>  The disposals took place between February and May 2011 and the agreed fixed rate for the service was &euro;698,000.<\/p> <p>However, in addition, the firm applied commissions of &euro;2.6 million for which there was no contractual provision and earned a further $790,000, equivalent to &euro;600,000, in profits from the disposal of NPRF&rsquo;s holding in an index fund.  In doing this, it acted as a principal, rather than as an agent, but without taking the risk of loss.  The additional charges were deducted from the disposal proceeds before these were remitted to the NPRF.  The effect of the additional charges, while representing just 0.07% of the value of the assets sold, was to increase the amount earned by the transition manager to over five and a half times the contractual payment. <\/p><p> The unauthorised commissions came to light in late 2011 in response to inquiries made to the transition manager by the NPRF, arising from media reports about problems with transition services they had provided to other customers.  The profits earned from the disposal of the holding in the index fund were notified by the transition manager to the NPRF in July 2012 following internal investigations the firm carried out.  The transition manager has refunded the NPRF in respect of both of these amounts, a total of &euro;3.2 million.<\/p><p> The performance of transition managers is generally measured by what is referred to as an implementation shortfall outcome.  This compares the outcome against a pre-transition estimate within an acceptable level of deviation.  The NPRF&rsquo;s review of the transition executed by the transition manager found that the outcome was comfortably within the estimated range.  Our examination concluded that while the implementation shortfall outcome provides a reasonable basis for benchmarking and evaluating the overall performance of a transition, its suitability for checking commission costs is questionable, given what occurred in this case.  In addition, reliance by NPRF on the normal internal controls of regulated service providers may not be sufficient to prevent or detect non-contractual charges when assets are disposed of.<\/p><p> Chapter 4 contains a number of recommendations that aim to address this situation, in particular the commissioning of independent third-party reviews of the outcome of a sample of transactions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012112200005#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353580200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Corrigan for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012112200006#E00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353580200,"counter":56,"content":"<p>On my own behalf and on behalf of the NPRF commission chairman, Paul Carty, I welcome the opportunity to meet with the committee today.  We have already forwarded a briefing note to update the committee on recent developments relating to the NTMA and the NPRF.  I propose to make a few short opening remarks highlighting some of the main issues dealt with in the brief.<\/p><p>  I would like to refer to the debt management area.  It is a little over a year since I and members of my team last appeared before this committee and we have made very considerable progress in our re-engagement with the markets over the year.  The NTMA's funding goal is to achieve a sustainable re-entry to the markets.  Our working plan throughout 2012 has been to begin to return to the markets on a phased basis, mainly through shorter-term issuance but also by taking advantage of suitable opportunities to issue long-term debt, as and when they arise.<\/p><p>  During 2012, our engagements with the debt markets have included bond switches; the issuing of conventional bonds; the issuing of a completely new debt instrument, Irish amortising bonds, tailored to meet the needs of the domestic pensions industry; and a return to the short-term debt markets through the regular holding of three month treasury bill auctions.  We began these T-bill auctions in July and have conducted four in total this year, the most recent of which took place only last week.  It is illustrative of improving market sentiment that while the yield on the July bill was 1.8% and the cover was 2.8%, the yield on last week's bill had fallen to 0.55% and the cover had risen to 4.1%.<\/p><p>  Our re-engagement with the markets needs to be viewed in the context of the EU-IMF programme, which provides funding to the end of 2013.  A smooth exit from the programme requires a parallel programme of market funding alongside funding under the programme.<\/p><p>  A key concern for investors had been the fact that in mid-January 2014 and just after the end of the programme, Ireland was faced with a maturing bond of &euro;11 .9 billion.  Addressing this funding cliff has been a priority for the NTMA.  The successful long-term capital market operations we have undertaken during the course of the year have effectively reduced this funding cliff to just &euro;2.4 billion, a reduction of &euro;9.5 billion.  This has been viewed very positively within the investment community and has given many investors greater confidence to lend money to us.  Addressing the funding cliff and demonstrating that we can raise funds in the market have been factors in the continuing fall in Irish bond yields.<\/p><p>  The amortising bond that we issued for the first time in August aims to meet investor demand for products that enable pension funds match their pensions in payment and also that could help with the construction of sovereign annuities.  These annuities, based on Irish Government bond yields, will be less expensive to purchase than annuities based on French and German Government bond yields which have been the norm for pension annuities up to now.  In response to investor demand, particularly from the Irish pensions industry, the NTMA is also planning its first issue of an inflation-linked Irish Government bond.  Between amortising bonds and inflation-linked bonds we estimate there is potential demand for combined issuance in these categories of some &euro;3 billion to &euro;5 billion over the medium term.<\/p><p>  There has been some public discussion about domestic investment in our bonds.  In keeping with every country issuing bonds, we need a diversified investor base which includes both domestic and international investors.  An active and stable domestic investor base is not only important in its own right, but is also an important signal to overseas investors considering investment in Irish bonds.  From our experience, it can make our job to persuade some foreign investors to buy Irish paper more difficult if they do not see Irish investors doing so.  During the years of the economic bubble , some investors in Irish debt were not \"natural holders\" of the product and sold when the crisis hit.  It is in our interest to have as deep a pool of buyers of our bonds as we can, the more diversified the better.<\/p><p>  Of course, there are risks to achieving sustainable market re-entry.  Some are within our control, such as the country continuing to meet its commitments to the troika.  Others, particularly those affecting the wider eurozone area, are not.  That said, we have made very significant progress since July 2011, when Moody's downgraded Ireland to sub-investment grade.  Indeed the announcement by Fitch Ratings last week that it was revising Ireland's outlook from negative to stable was the first positive action by a ratings agency on Ireland since the start of the financial crisis.  We will continue to engage with investors at home and abroad, presenting the case for investing in Irish paper in an open and upfront manner, and act as flexibly and imaginatively as we can to achieve our goal of a sustainable market re-entry at the earliest possible opportunity.<\/p><p>  Turning to the NPRF, the discretionary portfolio, the fund excluding the public policy investments in Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, was valued at &euro;6 billion at 31 October 2012.  In light of the Government's stated intention to refocus the fund's investment towards Ireland, in mid-2011 the NPRF commission determined that management of the fund should become more focused on capital preservation while still having the capacity to participate in gains if markets performed well.  This de-risking strategy is being implemented through the purchase of options.  From the fund's inception in April 2001 to 31 October 2012, the annualised performance of the discretionary portfolio was +3.6% per annum.  This compares over the same period with the performance of the average Irish pension fund, as published by Mercer, of +2.0% per annum and with Irish inflation of +2.3% per annum.<\/p><p>  The NPRF has taken a lead role in the development and implementation of a number of investment initiatives in Ireland.  These include the Irish infrastructure fund, Innovation Fund Ireland, the Silicon Valley Bank transaction, a commitment to the financing of water meters and the provision of a stand-by facility to enable the recently announced schools bundle 3 PPP project to proceed with EIB financing.  The Minister for Finance has announced that he will propose amendments to the NPRF statutory investment mandate to enable it to focus its investments in Ireland.<\/p><p>  With regard to the State Claims Agency, the recent decision by the Government to establish a legal costs unit within the agency is significant. <\/p> <p>The purpose of the unit will be to deal with third party costs arising from the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals with a view to ultimately extending the unit's remit to the Smithwick tribunal.  Recruitment to the unit is under way.<\/p><p> NewERA has been operating on a non-statutory basis within the NTMA for just over a year.  It is providing advice for Departments on a range of financial activities in the commercial State companies within its remit, including investment proposals, corporate plans, capital expenditure projects and funding proposals.  It is also assisting in the development and implementation of Government plans for investment in energy, water and next generation telecommunications projects.  In addition, it is carrying out advisory and oversight roles in the possible restructuring or disposal of commercial State company assets.  Its role in disposal processes is to represent the Government's financial interest and ensure Government agreed timelines on financial objectives are clearly communicated to the relevant parties and achieved.<\/p><p> While representatives of the National Development Finance Agency will appear separately before the committee on 13 December, it recently awarded the contract for schools public private partnerships bundle 3.  When completed, the eight schools in the bundle will provide accommodation for approximately 5,700 students and the project is expected to provide employment for up to 1,100 people.  The agency was also instrumental in securing the &euro;100 million loan from the European Investment Bank for the traditional schools capital programme which was drawn down in August.  It is actively preparing to procure PPPs announced under the Government's stimulus package.<\/p><p> While it is not the subject of the meeting, the NTMA continues to provide staff and business supports for NAMA.  Of our overall staff of 500 at the end of October, 227 were assigned to NAMA.  I trust my remarks and the more extensive briefing note which we forwarded to the committee last week, have given members an overview of developments and the range of activities engaged in at the agency.  I look forward to answering their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012112200006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Corrigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353580800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>May we publish the statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012112200007#F00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353580800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012112200007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Corrigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1353580800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Corrigan and his officials.  The NTMA has assumed a role in society it probably did not foresee five or six years ago.  Its name is well known and the agency is very much in the public eye.  I refer to an issue mentioned in the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement regarding transition management services and the State Street corporation.  It is a complex issue, but my understanding is that a decision was taken in 2010 to liquidate some of the assets in the National Pensions Reserve Fund for investment in the banking sector.  To do this, the NTMA used a panel of fund managers to transition them, one of which was State Street.  Its employees were responsible for &euro;4.7 billion in funds and the NTMA agreed a price with them for that work of &euro;698,000.  In October 2011 the NTMA wrote to State Street asking it to clarify the fee that had been paid based on reports.  Why did the agency write at the time asking for further information?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012112200007#F00400","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353580800,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I would like to comment generally in the first instance on the State Street transaction to put it in context.  To be clear, what had happened was fraudulent in nature and totally unacceptable.  That is the view of the commission which oversees the pension fund and also the view of the NTMA.  We have communicated this view regarding the fraudulent nature of the transactions very clearly and in unequivocal terms to State Street.  I have personally met the global vice chairman of State Street who came to Dublin to explain the circumstances and apologise for what had happened.  Nonetheless, State Street, in its performance of this transaction, fell well below what was expected of it.<\/p><p> What happened, as the Deputy said, was that a decision was taken to liquidate a sizeable portfolio in connection with the recapitalisation of the banks.  Again, as acknowledged in the Comptroller and Auditor General's statement, State Street was appointed from a panel of transition managers, managers who specialise in dealing with large transactions to ensure that in executing these transactions, the market does not move against them.  By any definition, a sum of &euro;4.7 billion is a big transaction and, as acknowledged in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, it was clearly employed in an agency capacity.  To be clear about it, an agent is somebody who is employed for a fee who takes no position in the matter and passes straight back to the client the sale proceeds if the transition involves a sale.  In this case, fraudulently, within State Street, approximately 0.7% was clipped off the sale price when it went to the open market to transition the shares.  To put it simply, if it realised &euro;100 from a sale, only &euro;99.30 would find its way back into the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  This clipping applied not only to the fund but also to a number of other major clients which were being transitioned by State Street at the same time.<\/p><p>  We received an invoice in the agreed amount from State Street and having verified that there was no commission charged, we paid the invoice.  It became apparent in late 2011 that there was an issue with the transition management arrangements in State Street which wrote to us to notify us of the issue.  We had already heard about it in press speculation and, in answer to the Deputy's question, then took it up with State Street.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012112200007#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Corrigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1353580800,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Therefore, the first contact was from Mr. Corrigan's side.

The first contact was by us.<\/p><p>  State Street has refunded us the amount improperly taken, but we have taken that refund without prejudice.

Fraud is specific.  The word \"fraudulent\" was used.  It implies this was intentional, that State Street employees knew what they were doing and that there was a premeditated plan to steal or engage in theft of money.  Who was responsible for this?

Let us say the shares were sold to broker X.  Broker X then sent the contract note into the internal brokerage in State Street, which then clipped 0.7%, on average, off the price.  In the case of a normal investment manager who is not a transition manager, the process is different.  In the case of an investment manager who is managing funds on a day-to-day basis, if he, as the investment manager, buys or sells securities on one's behalf, the contract note goes to an independent corporate set of eyes known as the funds custodian.  There is, therefore, a check in place to make sure the price reported is the price secured.  Until now, market practice in the transition management area has not involved this second set of corporate eyes.  One of the proposals we made in our response to the Comptroller and Auditor General was to move away from industry practice which did not involve the custodian and to require in any future transitions that the contract notes be routed back through the global custodian.  This would give us a triangulation and would have meant that the 0.7% could not have been clipped off the price.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012112200009#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Corrigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1353582000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>On the issue of fraud, has the National Treasury Management Agency had any contact with the Garda or the police in the United Kingdom?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012112200009#H01000","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353582000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>On legal advice, we formally advised the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of what occurred.

We have dramatically increased in numbers because of the additional responsibilities that have been given to us, mainly represented by the NAMA project.  As I stated, NAMA has over 230 employees.  We must recruit in the market and the salaries are what the salaries are.  I can understand people's anger over salaries in the financial services sector but we must operate in that sector.  Solving the perceived problems associated with high salaries is really a wider issue than the NTMA issue.  When we recruit people, for example, we do not go after them with open chequebooks.  We try to keep what we have to pay people to a minimum.  A common sense requirement we have is that people must produce their P60s if a job offer is made to them so we will not be hoodwinked by people who are over egging what they claim to have earned.  The salaries are what the salaries are.  There is a job of work to be done, which is important from the State's point of view.  There is a wider policy issue, which one may call an ethical issue if one wishes, with respect to salaries in the financial services sector, but that spreads much wider than the NTMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012112200018#R02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Corrigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1353587400,"counter":342,"content":"<p>We cannot go into it because it is policy but I must state the payment of that type of salary to people in the context of the public debate occurring on what is paid to those generally described as bankers is significant.  The public and I wonder how it can be justified.  In so far as policy is concerned, it is a matter for another committee, but I am expressing my point of view.<\/p><p>  When the NTMA recruits staff, it obviously looks at what they were paid in the private sector in their previous employment.  It considers their skills and compares them with the range of skills the agency requires.  I fully appreciate the very positive work the agency does and that it can be difficult to recruit people with the necessary skills at a lower cost.  However, the salary costs do not sit well in the public debate.<\/p><p>  I want to link this subject to what Mr. Corrigan stated on the State Street issue.  Mr. Corrigan used the words \"collusion\" and \"fraud\" and said people cannot be trusted.  I do not wish to take him out of context but I believe these are the words he used.  This territory is not dissimilar to the world of high finance.  It has happened before and will certainly happen again.<\/p> <p>However, in the context of what is being paid to people with a range of skill sets dealing with contracts like the one the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, had with State Street, I would have thought they would have been ahead of the curve with regard to how fraud and collusion can happen and would have built into the contract some oversight of the transactions to ensure what happened could have been caught much earlier or could have been prevented from happening although it is difficult to prevent collusion and fraud by the nature of the transaction itself.  Notwithstanding this, however, I am surprised by the lack of control.  While I heard Mr. Corrigan's explanation earlier, given the range of people his organisation employs one would have expected greater controls within that organisation that would have anticipated this or certainly would have had some sort of oversight and would have prevented this from happening or would have built such oversight into the contract, as I suggested earlier.  I seek Mr. Corrigan's views in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012112200018#R02500","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353588000,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I have gone through what happened and when someone sets out to wilfully commit a fraudulent act of the nature that occurred here, it would have been very difficult to spot.  As I stated, the fraud was not just perpetrated on the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It is not as though they picked us out because we were some sort of patsies.  The fraud was perpetrated on a number of funds and we certainly are aware of two of the names involved.  It certainly was masked from us.  We examined the invoices and perhaps, with the benefit of hindsight, we should have done more.  However, from an institution of the standing of State Street, one would have a high level of expectation that it would deal honestly with the matter and would have dealt with it in accordance with its contracts.  When I say \"collusion\", for any fraud to take place, there clearly must be collusion and I have no doubt but there was collusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012112200019#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Corrigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1353588000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I understand the explanation from the other side of the argument.  Collusion, fraud, theft or anything one wishes to describe, happens in business. It happens everywhere and whatever is the enterprise, it takes the appropriate steps at the various levels within the organisation to anticipate what might happen.  Regardless of whether it is in a shop where someone has taken stuff off the shelves, where there is pilferage of one kind or another in a business or where someone simply is putting his or her hand into one's till, one will anticipate it and will try to do something about it.  One puts in cameras, or has officers in place to deal with it.  Given the substantial amount of money the NTMA handles and manages, as a non-qualified person looking in I simply would have expected, by way of either contract or oversight, to have seen something better from the organisation.  It has been a learning curve for me that all of this could have happened, particularly when such vast sums of money are involved.  Moreover, as others from outside Mr. Corrigan's organisation were involved, from a public accounts point of view, I expect greater oversight of all this for the future, because that is all we can do now.  I encourage Mr. Corrigan to seek the full report and to make efforts with the Financial Services Authority, FSA, in respect of that investigation.<\/p><p>  I will now turn to a paragraph from the earlier remarks of the Comptroller and Auditor General in which I was interested.

I worry that we cannot dig into this and find out, first of all, precisely what people are getting and, second, whether they are worthwhile, particularly as they are not recruited in the market.<\/p> <p>What is the advantage to the NTMA of having NAMA as part of the family?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012112200020#T05700","speaker":"953","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353589200,"counter":452,"content":"<p>That was the basis on which NAMA was set up.

The report I asked my officials to prepare - with outside assistance - on fur farming can be found on the Department's website.  I also have some briefing notes on hare coursing.  This is despite the fact that my Department is not responsible for the licensing or running of these various activities.  It is obvious, however, that there is a connection between them all.  I refer, in particular, to amendment No. 26 in this regard.  We have approximately 80 minutes for our deliberations and if members are in agreement, I suggest we use this time to try to deal with all the issues around blood sports and fur farming and also the matters to which amendment No. 26 relates.  I suggest this would allow members to air their concerns on this matter and would also permit us to tease out some of the issues in the context of where the Government is coming from in this respect.<\/p><p> There are some amendments in this group with which I have a great deal of sympathy.  I refer, for example, to amendment No. 92, which was tabled by Deputy Pringle.  I do not believe we should proceed in the way outlined in the amendment but I accept the principle of being able to use technology to identify animals.  I would be happy to introduce an alternative amendment on this matter on Report Stage.  The Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 contains a requirement to the effect that establishments which have in excess of a certain number of breeding bitches must microchip dogs over a certain age.  In my view, all dogs being sold or purchased should be microchipped and I would be happy to legislate in this regard.  There should be a proper implementation process in this regard and we should not, if members will excuse the pun, hound people who have had dogs for many years, who are looking after them very well and who may not have got around to having them microchipped.  We need to introduce this on a phased basis and in a way that is consistent with the Dog Breeding Establishments Act in order that it will become normal practice that any dog which is being purchased or which someone is taking from an animal welfare organisation should have identification mechanisms fitted in order that they might be traced.  In such circumstances, it would be possible to identify and trace puppies which are being exported to the UK or which are being abused in any way and also those who are supposed to be responsible for them.<\/p><p> If, for technical or legal reasons, an amendment does not make sense, then I am not going to accept it.  However, this does not mean that I do not agree with the spirit of such an amendment.  I will try to accommodate members in respect of amendments of this nature.  It will not surprise colleagues that there are other amendments which I simply do not propose to accept.  I am sure they will not be happy about that but I would at least like to provide a description of the way in which the Department is treating some of the issues to which those amendments relate.  This will clarify the position and ensure our debate will not be based on rumour or on individual examples of cruelty which may be extreme and which should not be happening.  We might then discuss my view, on behalf of the Government, in respect of some of the issues relating to hunting in order that we might tease out, from a legal perspective, what we should and should not be doing.<\/p><p> I will now read into the record some of the briefing notes that were circulated to members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012112200002#A01100","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353583800,"counter":493,"content":"<p>Before the Minister does so, I wish to point out that most, if not all, the amendments in this group are in Deputy Pringle's name.

In that context, I will read into the record the briefing material that has been provided and also some additional information on approved traps, snares and nets which emanates from the Wildlife Acts.  I am of the view that it would be interesting for people to know the legal position in respect of the latter.  When I have read all the information into the record, perhaps we might then discuss the amendments individually and I will indicate why I can or cannot accept them.<\/p><p>  The first matter with which I will deal is badgers.  This is an extremely controversial issue in the UK and also for some people in Ireland.  A considerable amount of research, conducted over a period by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and other entities, has shown that the eradication of TB in cattle is not a practicable proposition in the short to medium term because of the reservoir of infection in wildlife, particularly badgers.  In view of this research and to limit the spread of TB from badgers to cattle, the bovine TB eradication programme implemented by the Department contains a wildlife strategy involving the removal of badgers by culling when an epidemiological investigation associates a TB herd breakdown with the presence of badgers.  In other words, this is a targeted programme and we are not concerned here with a widespread culling of badgers.  I will provide the actual numbers involved towards the end of my contribution.<\/p><p>  The Department continually monitors damage and injury to badgers captured under the badger removal programme to ensure the programme is as humane as possible.  Badgers are captured by trained farm relief service contractors who use a particular restraint.  Those contractors are monitored and supervised by my Department.  The restraints used in the capture of badgers are constructed and approved to comply with the Wildlife Act 1976 and the 2003 regulations made thereunder.  They are specifically designed to include a \"stop\" in order that they will not tighten beyond a predetermined point and will not, therefore, cause death by strangulation.  All restraints are monitored daily and badgers are removed within a maximum of 24 hours of capture.  A condition of the licence is that restraints are checked before noon the next day.  Capturing of badgers is not permitted during the months of January to March, inclusive, in new capture areas.  Research undertaken by Denise Murphy at the centre for veterinary epidemiology and risk analysis, CVERA, in UCD in 2009 has shown that damage or injury to captured badgers is none or minimal while they are in stopped restraints.<\/p><p>  The Department is satisfied that the badger culling strategy has contributed to a significant reduction in the incidence of TB in recent years.  TB reactor numbers have fallen significantly in the past three years, and it is anticipated that numbers for 2012 will be similar to those for 2011, when there were 18,500 reactors.  The latter is the lowest recorded number in any year since the commencement of the eradication programme in the 1950s.  The number of badgers captured in recent years is less than half the number captured in 2000.  In other words, we are making significant progress.  If members consider the position in the UK and Northern Ireland, they will discover that such progress is not being made in the context of reducing TB reactor numbers.  In my opinion, this is partly because they do not have a badger removal programme such as that which obtains in this jurisdiction.  If we are serious about eradicating TB over time, then I am strongly of the view that it is impossible to avoid the issue of badgers.<\/p><p>  It is the Department's intention to replace badger culling with a vaccination programme as soon as research demonstrates that vaccination of badgers is proven to be as effective as the current wildlife programme.  I am very anxious that we should move to a vaccination programme as soon as possible.  Nobody likes killing animals.  I certainly do not like killing them.  If we can establish a link between TB outbreaks and the presence of badgers and move from culling to a targeted vaccination programme, that will be a very good development for badgers.<\/p> <p>If we can continue the progress with our broader TB objectives to try to eradicate this disease that we have had for 70 years, we will do that.  The eradication of TB must be my first priority for many reasons, including animal welfare.  That is the reason we are doing what is necessary and we are trying to put parameters around how we do that to minimise the suffering of animals and to reduce the number of animals we have to cull in the first place by being as targeted as we can be.  We will move to a vaccination programme when it is appropriate to do that and hopefully that time is not too far away.<\/p><p> With regard to fur farming, the farming of mink in Ireland is currently regulated by the Musk Rats Act 1933.  Section 9 of that Act prohibits the keeping of musk rats in Ireland unless the keeper is licensed by the Minister.  It also provides that the animals must be kept at the premises specified in the licence and that the keeper must comply with conditions attached to such a licence.  The Act empowers the Minister to attach any conditions as he or she may think proper to a licence and, in particular, conditions regarding (a) the nature of the premises where the animals are kept, (b) the manner in which they are to be kept, (c) the precautions to be taken to prevent their escape, (d) the duration of the licence and (e) returns to be made by the licensee.<\/p><p> The methods authorised for slaughtering fur animals on fur farms are set out in the European Communities (Welfare of Farmed Animals ) Regulations 2010 and it is detailed how that can be done to ensure there is consistency with the provisions of the regulations.  <\/p><p> Methods outlined in the Council regulation, the number of which is outlined in the briefing material, on the protection of animals at the time of killing, which comes into effect on 1 January next year, and which is a new regulation, will be based on scientific references and the EU Commission has performed very detailed research on all the scientific literature on the subject. This new legislation will require any person involved in the killing of animals to take the necessary measures to avoid pain and minimise the distress and suffering of animals during the killing process, taking into account best practices in the field and the methods permitted under the regulation. The new regulation will also require people supervising the seasonal killing of fur animals to have a certificate of competence relevant to the operations they perform.  This new EU regulation driven by the Commission will come into effect to deal with welfare issues around the killing of animals generally  and also in regard to fur farming.<\/p><p> The report on fur farming undertaken by my Department in 2012, which is available on the Department's website for anyone who might want to read it, made a number of recommendations regarding fur farming.  They include recognising that fur farming is a lawful farming activity undertaken in many areas of the world, including in a number of EU member states, and having considered all the submissions made, the legislative controls that currently exist and having evaluated the data assembled, the review group, on balance, did not find the arguments in favour of banning the farming of fur animals in Ireland compelling.  For this reason the group recommended that fur farming be allowed to continue under licence and subject to enhanced official controls.  The group recommended that all fur farming should be subject to licence by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and it is noted that there are extensive powers available to the Minister in legislation to enable him to revoke licences where welfare standards are not met. It further recommended that the new Animal Health and Welfare Bill should include a provision requiring new entrants to fur farming to hold a licence, as well as existing licence holders.  It recommended that the Department's veterinary and agricultural inspections should be doubled from the current level to allow for enhanced controls in order that additional confidence can be gained in respect of compliance with animal health, animal welfare, environmental requirements, greater security on the farms and contingency planning.  Veterinary controls should include a review of the checks carried out by the private veterinary practitioner engaged by the licence holders.  The Department's programme of inspections should also include some unannounced inspections.  The group also recommended that in order to ensure that the health and welfare of the animals is protected, licences should require increased direct engagement of private veterinary practitioners on the part of fur farmers to provide professional input into operational practices.  Private veterinary practitioners engaged by fur farmers should be requested to provide written verification of the effectiveness of the operational systems in this regard.  The group recommended that operators should adopt best practice and embrace developments with respect to improved methods and systems for the killing of mink.  It also recommended that codes of practice should be established to promote sound welfare and management practices for the care of fur animals.<\/p><p> It is proposed to repeal the Musk Rats Act 1933 under the Animal Health and Welfare Bill.  The new Animal Health and Welfare Bill should include a provision requiring new entrants to fur farming to hold a licence as well as existing licence holders.  It is not proposed to ban fur farming under the Bill.  What is proposed is that we would examine both regulation and codes of practice in this respect in order that we can stand over everything that is taking place on fur farms and that we would significantly increase the levels of inspections taking place.<\/p><p> With regard to hare coursing, under the provisions of the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, the regulation of coursing is chiefly a matter for the Irish Coursing Club, ICC, subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon, which is the statutory body with responsibility for the improvement and development of the greyhound industry, greyhound racing and coursing.  Coursing meetings can only take place during the open season, namely, between 26 September and 28 February of the following year.<\/p><p> The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has responsibility under national and EU wildlife legislation to ensure the conservation of the populations of certain species, including the hare.  In December 2007, Ireland submitted the first baseline assessments, under the habitats directive, to the European Commission, on the conservation status for all 59 habitats and some 100 species that occur in Ireland.  It was reported at that time that the range and future prospects of the hare were considered favourable.  The hare is not regarded as an endangered species.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under section 34 of the Wildlife Act 1976, has responsibility for the issue of an annual licence to the Irish Coursing Club and its affiliated clubs to capture live hares in accordance with the conditions of the licence granted.  The licence conditions are set out in the briefing material and there are some 26, which I do not need to read out as the members have them set out in front of them.<\/p><p> With regard to hare numbers, the coursing clubs affiliated to the Irish Coursing Club catch in the region of 5,500 hares each coursing season.  To put these numbers in some context, the report, Status of Hares in Ireland - Hare Survey of Ireland 2006\/07, estimates that the population of Irish hares in the Republic of Ireland was approximately 233,000 hares in early 2006 and 535,000 in early 2007.  Therefore, hare population is significantly increasing.  It should be stated that an extremely high proportion of the hares captured for hare coursing are returned to the wild each year; an average of 98% of the hares used at hare coursing meetings have been returned to the wild over the past four coursing seasons.  There is no current evidence that hare coursing has a significant adverse effect on total hare populations.  I know people's objections to hare coursing are different from being merely about the hare population and I will hear those shortly but it is important to read these figures into the record.<\/p><p> With regard to the monitoring of hare coursing, a monitoring committee on coursing was established in 1993-94 comprising officials from the Department and representatives from both the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the ICC to monitor developments in coursing.  <\/p> <p>The position in that regard is kept under constant review to ensure coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interests of both animal welfare and standards.  Veterinary inspectors from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will attend and monitor a minimum of eight coursing events in 2013.<\/p><p> Anything done in the ordinary course of hunting does not fall within the remit of the Animal Health and Welfare Bill.  If, however, a hunted animal is released in an injured, mutilated or exhausted condition, that is an offence under section 12(3) of the proposed legislation.  In order to properly regulate hunting, there will be a strict application of codes of practice which will be established under section 25.  Again, the approach I am taking is not to ban this activity but to ensure that when hunting, hare coursing or fur farming, which is a separate category, takes place, we have standards that are imposed in terms of codes of conduct that can be implemented and enforced.  The purpose of amendment No. 26 is to ensure we have a political discussion as there is some legal difficulty with elements of it.  <\/p><p> Section 34 of the Wildlife Act is the primary source of legislation applicable to the use of traps, snares and nets.  Among other things, this section of the Act gives the Minister the power to make regulations to declare traps, snares and nets to be approved under section 34(4).  The Minister has done this and the resulting regulations are SI 620 of the Wildlife Act 1976 (Approved Traps, Snares and Nets).  One of the key components of the regulations is Regulation 3 which describes the types of traps, snares and nets that are legally approved.  It goes through them in some detail.  The priority is to try to reduce, minimise or eliminate unnecessary suffering when one is capturing an animal for the purposes of either pest control, disease control or other purpose.<\/p><p> It is unusual for me to read a long dissertation on anything, but it important that people understand that on this issue we are not proceeding in the way we always have on blood sports, fur farming or hare coursing.  Codes of practice are being implemented.  If we need to add to them by introducing new codes of conduct and make them mandatory, or even if we need to consider introducing regulations under the Bill, I am willing to do this, but what I am not willing to do is to introduce legislation to ban activities that provide many people across the country with a livelihood, and also are traditional in rural areas and have been for generations.  I will not wipe them out with the stroke of a pen, but I will insist on standards being imposed and we will act when people behave in a totally irresponsible way in regard to these standards.  We will ensure we have the power under the legislation to act.  That is a balanced approach in dealing with these issues.  I am happy to speak to people who are involved in hunting or coursing and have already done so, as well as people who have concerns about these issues.  I will endeavour to accommodate their concerns as best I can, but, ultimately, we will have a difference of opinion on what we should do with the legislation.  It is important people understand the perspective from which I am coming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012112200003#B00600","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353585000,"counter":500,"content":"<p>In the event of a vote being called, I wish to nominate Deputy Michael McCarthy as my substitute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012112200005#D00200","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1353585000,"counter":501,"content":"<p>First, I acknowledge the work of Deputy Thomas Pringle in allowing the amendments to be tabled because he had difficulties with some of them.

We have had reports on the number of hares injured, mauled and killed during coursing events.  Greyhounds also suffer injuries because of the muzzles they wear.  I do not advocate for one minute that the muzzles should be taken off, but there are situations where a greyhound is affected.  Greyhounds are gentle animals.  I was involved with a greyhound group when the issue of them being taken to China arose.  We know what might have happened to them.  Coursing involves the deliberate hunting and targeting of the hare, which is also a gentle creature.  Before a coursing meeting, greyhounds are blooded and nobody need tell me that does not happen.  There is no way greyhounds will run after a hare unless there is a reason to do so.  Hares are netted in order that greyhounds can be blooded.  Therefore, a greyhound thinks it is going after a hare to kill it because that is what it has been bred to do in coursing meetings.  There is huge cruelty in the two aspects I have described before a coursing meeting and inherent cruelty during it.<\/p><p>  Coursing clubs are monitored by coursing officials, which is completely illogical.  The Minister made a point about countries in Europe allowing various practices, but only three countries in Europe allow coursing, of which Ireland is one.  There is a very profitable drag coursing industry in Australia and betting takes place at such events.  The hare is not a pest species.  Various animal welfare organisations tell us what goes on at coursing meetings.  There is no doubt that there is cruelty to animals, particularly the hare but also the greyhound.<\/p><p>  I accept what the Minister said about the eradication of TB.  Is there independent peer-reviewed scientific evidence on the efficiency of badger culling as opposed to pursuing a vaccination programme?  Is it true that &euro;70 million of our money went on the TB eradication programme in 2011, which involved the culling of badgers?  I am not aware of a current survey of the badger population.  Badgers are being caught in traps and left to starve to death.  The young badger population is also suffering as a result.  I welcome the positive statement by the Minister that there will be a vaccination programme which I hope comes sooner rather than later.  I accept that TB in cattle must be eradicated and nobody wants to see it continue.  However, I have grave issues about the culling of badgers.<\/p><p>  Many countries in Europe are banning fur farming, including the Netherlands, the third largest mink breeder after China and Denmark.  Other countries have examined the phasing-out of fur farms.  I ask that it also be considered here.  In the meantime, there are serious issues about the welfare of mink on fur farms.  I refer to the way they are kept in cages and what happens in these cages.<\/p> <p> Issues also arise regarding the manner in which mink are gassed with carbon dioxide.  Various reports from a variety of veterinary associations discuss the effects of carbon dioxide, including the stress caused, the manner in which it impairs welfare and the amount of pain caused.<\/p><p> An environmental study shows that, by comparison with textiles, fur has a higher impact in respect of 17 of 18 environmental themes, including climate change and toxic emissions.  The climate change impact of 1 kg of mink fur is five times greater than that of the highest scoring textile, wool, owing to feeding requirements and the nitrous oxide emissions from mink manure.  Significant issues associated with fur farming have not been considered.  Obviously, I would like to see the practice banned.<\/p><p> I cannot understand why, in this day and age, anybody would want to wear fur because there are so many alternatives.  Irrespective of my sympathy for past generations of hunters who needed fur in extremely cold climates for a variety of reasons, in this day and age, in a so-called developed world, killing animals for their fur is just appalling.<\/p><p> I welcome what the Minister said about codes of practice.  We know, however, that regulations and rules are not worth the paper they are written on unless they are implemented and seen to be implemented.  While there may be some rules on animal welfare, they are not being implemented.<\/p><p> I welcome what was said about the chipping of dogs.  Feral cats present a major problem.  There are many cat lovers in the country, but a very simple programme could solve the problem.  We spoke about the cost of accepting some of the amendments that were ruled out of order, but if we spent a small amount in addressing the problem presented by feral cats, it would be much more cost-effective than having to allocate resources when the problem grows to major proportions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012112200005#D00500","speaker":"1005","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353585600,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I apologise on behalf of Deputy Martin Ferris who had to attend a funeral unexpectedly.  He asked me to deputise for him.  <\/p><p>  I thank the Minister for the outline.  There is compelling logic behind badger culling, as mentioned in the report thereon.  I have no issue with it.<\/p><p>  With regard to fur farming and hare coursing, the review group found that, on balance, there were no compelling arguments in favour of banning the farming of fur animals in Ireland.  The only question to be addressed is probably not one in respect of which numeric logic is required; it is simply a question of whether it is right to put animals at risk of death, serious injury or serious stress for reasons other than disease control or food production.  We need to examine this issue.  Many argue that it is not necessary to kill an animal to create an overcoat and that it is not necessary to put hares under stress or at serious risk of death or injury for sporting purposes.  I am not sure a review group can present a mathematical equation to show whether the practices are right or wrong; it is a moral question.<\/p><p>  Badgers are to be captured using restraints which are monitored by departmental staff.  It is recommended that fur farming be allowed to continue under licence and subject to enhanced official controls.  The third recommendation is that the frequency of the Department's veterinary and agricultural inspections be doubled.  The fourth is that veterinary inspectors from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine attend and monitor a minimum of eight coursing events in 2013.

If I leave before he responds, it will not be because of disrespect, as I have a double booking.<\/p><p>  I appreciate the efforts of the Minister and recognise that improvements are being made.  However, the essence of the discussion is whether we should proceed in a piecemeal manner.  Can we not make some really radical improvements that would alter circumstances dramatically?<\/p><p>  While the Minister has spoken about addressing welfare issues and dealing with cruelty and while some measures are, undoubtedly, being put in place in this regard, some of the activities about which we are talking are inherently cruel.  In this sense, regulation is only minimising the damage.  The root cause of the problem is the actual activities.  I refer to digging for foxes, hare coursing, fur farming, etc.  This must be recognised up-front.<\/p><p>  There are 11 amendments to the section.  One, on the tracing of dogs, has been accepted in principle, which we welcome.  We accept that there will probably be some form of amendment on Report Stage; we accept the Minister's bona fides in this regard.  Of the ten remaining amendments, four deal with fur farming.  The Minister has stated this practice is lawful in a number of jurisdictions and that, as a consequence, we will keep it lawful here.  He did not say it was banned in more countries than in which it was actually legal.  We should not be following the countries that permit the activity.  The industry is very small in Ireland and one of the five registered mink farms is probably in jeopardy.  While we accept the Minister's point that he will increase regulation and double the inspection frequency, will he, if he is not going to ban the practice and accept an amendment in this regard, address amendment No. 73 which calls for an independent inspectorate?  Would this fit in with his idea of increasing the frequency of inspections?  Could we have an independent animal welfare inspectorate?<\/p><p>  Humane eradication could be achieved.  Is there a contradiction between our amendment, No. 57, and the Minister's opening statement?  All we seek in this regard is a more humane method of killing the animals.  If the Minister is not going to ban the activity, will he, please, agree to the animals not being gassed and being disposed of humanely?  If we are to have enhanced codes of practice and better regulation, the Minister could, through the Bill, regulate the manner in which animals are exterminated.  There could also be a facility, by enhancing the Bill, to deal with the conditions of the animals.  If animals are to live in horrendous conditions and, ultimately, to die for their fur, we could at least upgrade their housing, increase the height of cages, improve nest boxes, ban wire mesh floors, provide enrichment toys, etc., as happens in Germany, in order that there would at least be some semblance of decency where animals are interned and, ultimately, destroyed.  We could make the process as painless as possible.<\/p><p>  There is no contradiction between amendments Nos. 57 and 73 in terms of the Minister's provision in this regard if he is not going to accept our points on providing for a ban.  A large number of citizens in Ireland believe fur farming should be banned.  We do not really accept that it should not be.  The industry is not a significant employer and does not engage in a worthy activity in this day and age.  We, therefore, ask the Minister to reconsider his position on the issue.  As he seems adamant, we will not waste members' time.<\/p> <p>However, I appeal to him to consider amendments Nos. 57 and 73 as they could incorporate some of his desires to better regulate this area, while, at the same time, moving to appease our concerns.<\/p><p> The foundation amendments are Nos. 25 and 26 which deal with activities which in and of themselves are inherently cruel to animals.  Dealing with animal welfare while allowing these activities to continue is a contradiction.  It would be preferable to remove the exclusion of hare coursing from the Bill's protection.  The very fact that it is excluded means the activity is recognised as cruel and hares are not getting the benefit of the legislation's protection.  I disagree fundamentally with the Minister when he says he will not get rid of this activity because it provides many people with a livelihood and is a tradition.  I thought he was a little more enlightened than this.  Both counts really do not stand up.  On the one hand, there is definitive evidence that the number of coursing clubs is in rapid decline and that the number of people following this appalling activity is, thankfully, falling.  It is confined to a minority of counties.  There are some who may make a living from coursing.  However, other jurisdictions have proved these jobs can be maintained by switching to drag coursing.  It does not make the activity any more appealing, but it does remove the cruelty aspect.  In fact, the introduction of drag coursing may actually see a rebirth of the activity with more participants.  Those who are appalled by the bloodlust attached to coursing may follow drag coursing.  The idea that coursing is a tradition is just too bad.  It was a tradition to throw people to the lions in the Colosseum on a Friday night in downtown Rome, but that did not mean it was a worthy activity.  Traditionally, there were freak shows at which people with abnormalities were put on display for public ridicule and some form of entertainment.  In a modern society, getting entertainment out of the pain and degradation of animals is not a worthy tradition and is an activity from which an enlightened society would move away.  To protect cruelty and barbarity in the name of tradition does not add up.  All the statistics from the National Parks and Wildlife Service about the cruelty caused to hares in the run-up to coursing events, how they are terrorised and released to be captured again are unacceptable.  I will be pressing this amendment as many in society find it reprehensible.<\/p><p> For similar reasons, I will be pressing on some of the other activities highlighted, most particularly the digging out of foxes.  The Minister has said he has been engaged with some organisations to regulate this activity.  Allowing dogs to go underground to dig out foxes is in no way acceptable.  These points need to be taken on board.<\/p><p> I know the Minister does not agree with the principles in these two amendments.  However, it is important to highlight them in order that he knows from where we are coming.  The issue will not go away.  If it is not addressed in this Animal Health and Welfare Bill, I am sure we will be discussing it in the next one.  Why will he not address the issues involved as enlightened society is moving towards our view?<\/p><p> Amendment No. 67 concerns monitoring greyhounds and coursing.  I cannot see why the Minister would have a problem with this.  While I do not agree with animals being involved in any form of entertainment, amendment No. 13 concerns the care of animals before and after certain activities.  Does the Minister have an objection to this provision which could be incorporated in the legislation?<\/p><p> The remaining amendments concern the use of animals in circuses and the protection of wild birds.  Fingal County Council was the first local authority to move to prohibit circuses.  Many will not go to a circus if it has performing animals.  I have no problems with trapeze artists and other performers &ndash; I do not really like clowns, to be honest &ndash; but I do have a problem with exploiting animals, particularly wild ones.  It is not natural for an elephant to put its foot on a ball, stand on a stool dancing to a whip or raise its leg on demand.  Getting an elephant to do this requires barbaric cruelty.  To have them transported as they are in inhumane conditions in an unnatural terrain to them in the name of entertainment is appalling.  We have circuses with performing penguins, which is abhorrent.  The argument that a child would never have seen a tiger or an elephant years ago except at a circus may have some merit to it.  However, in this day and age of enhanced travel, Internet access and better education, people can see animals in their natural environment.  In many countries the use of animals, particularly wild ones, in performing circuses is outlawed and a growing number of local authorities is taking up this call.  When Fingal County Council moved on it several years ago, we were inundated with support.  I would like to take my children to a circus, but I am not going to one in which an animal is exploited.  Some circus providers have stopped using animals because of this.  In this day and age when funds are tight and we have all been lobbied by community arts projects to protect the Arts Council budget from further cuts, the idea that the council still funds circuses with performing animals is appalling.  We are hoping the Minister will take on board our amendment.<\/p><p> We also want to limit the hunting of birds.  BirdWatch Ireland has pinpointed several concerns about putting in place protocols for reporting on the species hunted and their numbers to allow us to monitor the levels of hunting on a national level.  There is a need to ensure changes in hunting pressures can be monitored by the Department.  What mechanisms are in place to monitor them, as well as the number of licences awarded?  We need to review the list of bird species which are allowed to be hunted.  Protecting our natural environment is important for its tourism potential.  I agree with Deputy Michael Colreavy that if we are talking about serious regulation, we must remove the public sector recruitment embargo in this area.  Otherwise, many of these measures will be unsustainable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012112200006#E00300","speaker":"1015","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353586200,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be able to attend the select committee.

We all support animal welfare.  Farmers and pet owners are custodians of their animals and want to look after them.  The notion that some of us are not interested in animal welfare is disturbing because anyone who was reared on a farm or lived in rural Ireland understands that.  The rural hare is a very intelligent animal.  We all know about the March hare.  He observes everything and is totally aware of what goes on around him.  He is well able to mind himself.  That is his inherent breeding.<\/p><p>  I did not table amendments to the Bill, although perhaps I should have done so.  I knew from my discussions with the Minister and his officials that the legislation is in safe hands.  The Government is doing its best to strike a balance between sensible legislation and permitting sporting and leisure activities.  The impact on industry and employment is also important.  I do not know how much it costs to eradicate TB but it is epidemic among livestock and we have to cull animals to ensure it does not spread.<\/p><p>  I have spoken previously about coursing meetings and so-called ill treatment of hares.  Two and a half years ago a coursing meeting in my county was disturbed by so-called anti-blood sport people who released the hares and let them escape onto the motorway where they were slaughtered by traffic.  They could have caused accidents.  I do not know how that can be described as animal welfare.<\/p><p>  I pay tribute to a local gun club which does great work across four parishes to promote animal husbandry and restocking grouse and other species of bird that might otherwise go extinct.  I commend the Minister and offer him my support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012112200008#G00700","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1353586800,"counter":516,"content":"<p>The approach we have taken to debating these amendments has been reasonable.  I thank the Minister for providing us with the detailed briefing we requested.  I do not think we will reach agreement on fur farming, coursing and hunting, where fundamental differences of opinion apply.  I indicated on Second Stage that I am not in favour of an outright ban on these activities.  However, they must be governed by codes of practice that ensure people do not abuse their rights in a way that is disagreeable to the vast number of people.<\/p><p>  I agree completely with the Minister's approach on badgers.  As science evolves, trapping reduces and vaccination increases.  On fur farming, I can never get my head around the logic that it is all right to farm for food but not to farm for clothes.  The vegetarian would argue that we do not need to kill animals for food or clothing.  I take the view that the production of animals for food is a reasonable activity and that it is also reasonable to choose to eat meat.  I cannot understand why the same logic does not apply to clothes.  The question around fur farming is whether the standards applied are as high as we would expect among animals farmed for food.  Are the methods of killing the animals humane and are the farming practices fair?  Our standards for intensive farming of fowl and pigs have evolved and improved over time.  I was interested in hearing the Minister's recommendations on improving standards in fur farming.  Leaving aside the end use, which I do not regard as an issue, it is important the sector is well regulated.<\/p><p>  I have one brief question on hunting and hare coursing.  The codes of practice under the Bill are enforceable in that they will have to be taken into consideration by a court when making a judgment on a prosecution.  The people who carry out these activities want to operate to high standards and, therefore, the development and enforcement of strict codes are important.  I agree with the approach that the Minister has taken because it allows him to protect against any abuse that may occur among a small minority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012112200008#G00800","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1353586800,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I thank members for the spirit with which they are approaching these issues.  I appreciate that people have strong opinions in this area but I am glad the discussion has not turned into a slanging match.<\/p><p>  I do not like fur farming.  I would rather it was not practised but the issue is whether we should make it illegal.  As a Minister and a legislator, I have to take account of the impact of the decisions I make on livelihoods, industries and acceptable standards internationally.<\/p> <p> With regard to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's comments, whether somebody should be allowed to produce fur on a farm legally should not necessarily be determined by whether I find that a tasteful method of farming.  The issue is whether we are applying the same standards we apply to the production of food and farming practices.  The legislation proposes to provide a higher level of inspection of fur farming because many people have more concerns about that type of farming than about other types.  Through a voluntary code of practice and-or regulation to make the code enforceable in law, which could be taken into account in a court of law but not necessarily used to determine a legal outcome, we will examine making sure Ireland represents best practice in stocking rates in cages, the size of cages and the way in which animals are killed.  If the Deputy considers pig or poultry killing, there is nothing pleasant about killing an animal whether or not it is for food.  Rules, regulations and codes must be implemented to minimise pain and suffering but it is still a gruesome business for anyone who has visited an abattoir or a factory.  This is about imposing standards to ensure we reduce unnecessary pain and suffering while, at the same time, allowing an industry to be maintained.<\/p><p> I will examine the ways in which mink are killed.  My understand is they are gassed.  If there are more humane ways to do this, we will consider that and, if necessary, we will require that.  That is happening under EU legislation anyway.  For example, at European and domestic level, battery cages have been done away with on poultry farms.  Provision has been made for more space and perches for chickens to create a more humane environment.  We are doing the same in pig farming as we do away with the tethering of breeding sows.  Significant money has been put into grant aiding pig farmers to meet the new regulations next January to have loose housing for breeding sows.  I strongly stand over the Department's standard setting and implementation of the rules for animal welfare and farming generally and we will do the same for fur farming.  If fur farming is an exception, we will watch it even more closely because of the concerns many people have with the sector.  Should we just ban it because people will not buy fur products as they do not want to support the industry?  That is their entitlement.  It is a consumer decision but I do not agree that should result in the banning of the industry.  That is where I am coming from.<\/p><p> We will move to a vaccination programme for badgers as soon as we can.  It will be a positive story when it happens.  It was stated this would cost the taxpayer &euro;70 million.  What is costing the taxpayer is the incidence of TB and every time we take a reactor out of a herd or shut down a herd preventing a farmer from taking cattle to the market because of a TB outbreak, including the clampdown on neighbouring herds, it costs the farming sector and the national purse a great deal of money every year.  It will cost approximately &euro;40 million to compensate farmers for taking reactors out of their herds and to run the eradication scheme this year.  Four years ago, the figure was &euro;60 million.  We have, therefore, saved in excess of &euro;20 million over the past four years because we have been successful in reducing the incidence of TB in our herds and we will continue to do that.  By taking a targeted approach on the basis of independent advice from UCD, which recommends this approach because it works, and constant monitoring both inside and outside the Department confirming year after year that it works, we are saving the taxpayer significant amounts and we are also improving the reputation of the quality of food production in Ireland.  That is an important target, to which we should be committed.  As soon as we can switch from the culling of badgers, albeit as humanely as possible because it still involves suffering, to a vaccination programme, we will.  The programmes in the UK are not working.  If members can provide evidence to the contrary, I will happily examine it.  I am not closed to this but I will go on the advice of officials and the independent assessments and numbers I am seeing regarding the incidence of TB.  I have a responsibility to farmers and to the food industry to continue along the road we are on.<\/p><p> I have never attended a coursing meeting.  I did not grow up in the tradition of coursing but I would like to go to Clonmel to see it for myself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012112200008#G00900","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353587400,"counter":519,"content":"<p>The Minister would be welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012112200009#H00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1353587400,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I have attended many greyhound meetings and Bord na gCon does a great job linking a good night out with the sport of greyhound racing.  I have read a great deal about hare coursing and I have spoken to many people involved in it.  We have made huge strides over the past decade to deal with welfare issues.  There will be exceptions, as there will be in any sport that involves animals competing against each other and being aggressive.  Our job is to manage that by putting codes of conduct in place regarding how the meets are run in order that everything reasonable is done to reduce pain, suffering and unnecessary welfare problems.  It is also our job to put inspections in place to back that up and that is what we are doing.<\/p><p>  Deputy Colreavy referred to fur farm inspections and the eight inspections of coursing meetings next year by our authorised officers.  That does not require significant resources.  The number of fur farms in Ireland is in single figures and doubling the number of inspections will not be a big deal in terms of resources but it will send a strong message to those engaged in this activity that they need to abide by the standards we insist upon.  I will think about whether we should include someone who has a background in animal welfare independent of the Department on the inspection team but I would not like to undermine my own officials.  They have a balanced view on what it acceptable or not.  We have good authorised officers, inspectors and veterinary staff who are capable of determining what is acceptable.  They do not necessarily have to have a so-called animal welfare specialist looking over their shoulders.  I would argue that we have the best animal welfare specialists in the State in my Department and if did not, we should have.  I will think about that; I will not rule it out.<\/p><p>  With regard to the shooting of wild birds, my understanding is the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is examining the Wildlife Acts against next year.  I have sympathy for the argument that we need to ensure we have a list of protected birds that cannot be shot for sport.<\/p> <p>We should be working with BirdWatch Ireland and many other NGOs which put a great deal of work into this area.  We have a responsibility to protect species that are in trouble, and many bird species in Ireland are under severe pressure.  Whether it is under the AEOS programme on conservation and biodiversity that we implement or whether it is under lists of protected species, my Department and the NPWS have a responsibility to work together on that, and we will.<\/p><p> If the Deputy has suggestions as to how we should deal with feral cats, I would very interested to hear them.  In case Members think I am a bluffer, one of the few areas in which we increased expenditure last year in the budget - there are those in the audience here who might find this difficult to hear because we had to cut budgets in other areas - which is not large but which we increased significantly in percentage terms, was the amount of <i>ex-gratia<\/i>payments to animal welfare organisations across the country, and we will do the same in the budget this year.  Unfortunately, one of the casualties of recession is animals and pets that people cannot afford to keep any longer and place into the care of animal welfare organisations.  Many such organisations are set up by well-meaning persons who put all of their resources into looking after animals.  We have taken two actions.  We have put a code of conduct in place for the welfare of animals in welfare organisations and we have stated that we will fund welfare organisations as long as they apply that code of conduct.  We have linked the two.  We have significantly increased the level of <i>ex-gratia<\/i>payments to animal welfare organisations.  We have also been quite supportive of local authorities in the case of abandoned horses because that has been a big problem of the recession to which we have a responsibility to respond.  We are putting our money where our mouth is.  I am not saying it is a vast sum but it represents a significant increase in percentage terms which is contrary to our expenditure programmes in almost every other area.<\/p><p> I have probably answered Deputy Colreavy's arguments on whether fur-farming and coursing are absolutely necessary.  They are not.  When something is not necessary for people to live and eat, it is a judgment call whether that means one should ban activities such as coursing and fur-farming, whether or not one likes them.  It is my judgment that we should regulate rather than ban them.<\/p><p> I would share some of the concerns that have been expressed about animals in circuses.  Under the present Act, we can do a great deal to ensure that animals that are part of a circus are being looked after in a way that requires significant responsibility on the part of their owners.  Animals in circuses must be looked after in accordance with the welfare provisions of section 12 of this Bill.  Circuses are also subject to regulation at an EU level.<\/p><p> Other countries have had a political debate on whether to ban circus animals.  It is something into which I want to put a little more thought before we make a final decision.  My sense is that probably we should be trying to deal with this through regulation as in other areas but I do not want to rule that out entirely.  Let me think about it between now and Report Stage.  If Deputy Pringle wishes to press the amendment in the meantime, that is a decision for him.  I have some sympathy with the argument that animals should not be on tour for the purposes of entertainment but my sense is that, like in other areas, we should probably be dealing with this through animal welfare regulation rather than an outright ban.<\/p><p> On Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's comments, he is correct that there are essentially two principled approaches here.  One is that we opt for an outright ban and deal with its implications and the other is that we put in place standards that will evolve and improve over time.  The latter is the approach that we are taking and I thank him for his support on that.<\/p><p> On codes of practice, in order that members are clear because I do not want to pretend that we are doing something that we are not, there is a clear provision in the Bill on codes.  I can put in place codes of conduct for almost anything that deals with animals, including coursing, hunting and fur-farming.  There is a difference between a voluntary code of conduct and a mandatory code of conduct.  There is a difference even between a mandatory code of conduct and a regulation which is a legally enforceable instrument that changes the law, and there is a legal definition that differentiates between the two.  My understanding is that a code of practice, even if it is mandatory, cannot be the basis for changing the law but that a regulation can be.  That is why we may need to use a combination of both ministerial regulation and codes of practice to ensure that we can stand over the implementation and the practical reality of the effectiveness of codes of practice.<\/p><p> I have looked at the codes of practice that are currently in place, and enforced in the vast majority of cases, particularly around hunting and the use of terriers, etc., in Ireland.  It is also worth noting that in the United Kingdom, even after they banned fox hunting, they did not ban the use of terrier work.  The code of conduct on terrier work being applied in Ireland is the code of conduct that has been taken from the United Kingdom, where there has been a high level of political focus on animal welfare standards, etc.  There is a pragmatic reason for the use of terrier work, in vermin control and in controlling fox numbers.  What is not often spoken of is the impact of foxes, in particular, on sheep and poultry farmers where, for example, there can be dozens of lambs with their throats ripped out and a farmer looking for a professional to deal with an expensive fox population problem causing animal welfare concerns on a farm.  We must allow for that and at the same time ensure that when there is terrier work used as part of fox hunting, for example, with the use of horses and dogs, there is a code of conduct that is used in reality.  In the vast majority of cases, it is so used.  I have spoken to many involved to get a sense of what is happening on the ground.  The codes of conduct being implemented on a voluntary basis are fairly good.  The question is whether we want to ensure that they will be legally enforceable in the future under this Bill.  That is something I will have the capacity to do at a later stage by introducing regulations or codes of conduct.  There is a subtle difference in that regard between mandatory codes of conduct and regulations or statutory instruments.  I have probably answered most of the questions.  If members want to come back on anything, I will happily try to answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2012112200009#H00300","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353588000,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I welcome all that the Minister has said but it is still disappointing that we are looking at further regulation rather than an outright ban on practices that bring about suffering and cruelty to animals.

From the time my Department was established, I have stated that we needed to have an expenditure control Department that also had at its heart a reform agenda.  That was agreed in the negotiations on the programme for Government, and hence my Department exists.  We have embarked on the programme.  We published the plan in November last and we are expeditiously advancing that plan.  It is ambitious, and doubly so at a time when we are downsizing considerably the numbers involved in the public service and the payroll bill.  As the committee will be aware and as I have stated repeatedly, we want to reduce the numbers by 38,000, compared to peak levels, by 2015 and to reduce the total payroll bill by 20%.<\/p><p>  I received Government approval this week - it might be more topical for me to talk about this - to re-examine the Croke Park agreement process.  I have had ongoing dialogue with the unions on the implementation of the Croke Park agreement.  I commend the engagement of all public servants with the reform and transformation agenda.  We have done a remarkable amount in a short period of time, but we need to do much more because the volume of money to be saved from the public pay bill between now and 2015 is insufficient to address unallocated savings.<\/p> <p>In particular, unallocated savings in the multi-annual financial framework for next year and 2013 pose a challenge.  In light of the additional &euro;800 million in unallocated savings and given the profile of savings expected in the major spending areas of social protection, health and education, it would be an extraordinarily challenging job to make further cuts to those and all Departments.<br \/> For this reason, I have been minded for some time to re-examine the public sector pay bill.  Some 35% of public expenditure is on public pay, as many services - in the health sector through nurses and doctors and in the education sector through teachers - are people focused and people delivered.  It is quite understandable that the pay bill would be a large chunk of expenditure in those areas.<br \/> I have something in mind.  As I told the D&aacute;il yesterday, I want an additional &euro;1 billion on top of the net &euro;3.3 billion, &euro;3.8 billion gross, that we have targeted by 2015.  I want to do this while maintaining core pay as best I can.  I do not want to be overly prescriptive, as I have not met the unions yet.  They responded positively yesterday evening to my invitation.  The public sector committee of congress will meet officials from my Department next week to shape out the discussions that I hope will be embarked upon.<br \/> I will give this committee the flavour of my thinking in this regard.  I am seeking a transformation of the working week - more hours worked for the same pay and a broader window of normal working from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. so that, if someone works within that framework, one does not attract premium pay.  I am also considering how we pay for Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, particularly for services that are provided on a 24\/7 basis.  This is another challenging body of work on which we have embarked.<br \/> I have set out the core philosophy behind the reform plan, namely, placing the citizen at the core of everything we do; maximising new and innovative service delivery channels via, for example, new technologies or new approaches; radically reducing our costs to drive better value for money in everything from shared services to procurement; leading, organising and working in different ways, the agenda to which I just referred; and focusing strongly on implementation and delivery.  The action plan that we published last year had timelined actions.  We need to deliver them within the timelines as set out.<br \/> The Cabinet sub-committee on public sector reform is the main driver to which we report periodically.  It is supported by an advisory group of Secretaries General and a reform delivery board of assistant secretaries.  Designated senior officials in all Departments, which are responsible for every agency, are driving the change agenda.<br \/> We established a reform and delivery office in my Department.  Mr. Paul Reid is its director and has responsibility for driving that agenda.  I wish to pay public tribute to the Minister of State with responsibility for public service reform, Deputy Brian Hayes, who has been an extraordinary collaborator with me in this work and has done remarkable work, particularly on the procurement side.<br \/> I will touch on a few points quickly.  We have published the e-Government strategy and launched Ireland Stat, a performance measurement website that is currently in pilot mode.  I have asked people to look at it and provide feedback.  We have established a senior public service.  The idea is to build from all of the different silos of government an integrated public service so that we have free movement of people across the service, better collaboration in the delivery of policy objectives, etc.<br \/> A significant reform of the performance management and development system has been agreed and is under way.  We have introduced a range of expenditure reforms, some of which I explained to the committee previously.  As I stated in my parliamentary dialogue with Deputy Donnelly in the D&aacute;il yesterday, these are elements that we need to advance further.  We must take stock of how to undertake the budgetary situation in a more open way, for example, what data are required in a timely fashion and provided via a useful mechanism.  We might embark early next year on determining how to deliver the data to the Deputy so that he can embark on an <i>ex ante<\/i>, rather than <i>ex post facto<\/i>, analysis of expenditure items.<br \/> Yesterday, I told the D&aacute;il that a medium-term expenditure management Bill would be enacted.  To date, our multi-annual framework has been implemented on an administrative basis.  In accordance with the EU-IMF agreement, however, we will put it on a statutory basis.  We have published the legislation to do this.<br \/> I have mentioned the whole-of-year budgetary statement and process.  Previously, I discussed the public spending code.  I have also indicated our establishment of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES.  I was about to say that it would involve bright new economists.  I hope they will be bright, but that remains to be seen.  Given their curricula vitae, they are competent people and will be placed across government so that we can have sharp economic advice.  In any analysis of the old Department of Finance, the lack of economic analysis is an element that has been criticised.  Economic analysis should not reside in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Finance.  Rather, economic advice and evaluation should be undertaken at line Department level.  I have spoken to colleagues about this matter.  Some have indicated a willingness or even an anxiety to have this resource.<br \/> I have discussed the Croke Park agreement and do not propose to say anything further only to answer members' questions.<br \/> I will bring the committee up to speed regarding political reform.  Members know our agenda.  The Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 has been signed into law by the President.  It is the most significant advance in the Ombudsman's remit since the office's establishment 30 years ago.  I thank Deputies and Senators for their co-operation in this regard.  The Seanad in particular held a useful Committee Stage debate.<br \/> Following Government approval, drafting of the protected disclosure in the public interest Bill, what we call the &quot;whistleblower's Bill&quot;, is well advanced and I hope to publish the Bill early next year so that it can be before the House in the next D&aacute;il session.  In July, I received Government approval for the drafting of a Bill to reform freedom of information, FOI, legislation and to extend it to all bodies.  A general scheme was submitted to this committee, which can make a significant contribution to refining the proposals.  I presume it is doing so.  I expect to be in a position to publish the FOI Bill when the committee has reached its conclusions.  We can reflect on those.<br \/> Following the publication of the final report of the Mahon tribunal, I stated that we would examine all existing legislation on the governance of ethics, which is a major job, and consolidate the existing legislative framework.  This challenging body of work is under way in my Department.<br \/> Recently, I announced that the Government had approved the drafting of a Bill to provide a comprehensive statutory framework for Oireachtas inquiries.  I thank the Chairman and the committee for engaging with this process.  Some members viewed the timeframe as being tight and would have preferred a longer consideration period.  I am mindful of the public demand for an inquiry into the banking sector in particular.  We need to have the legislative framework to allow that.  Clearly, the Government had hoped to be able to do it in a different way, but the people in their wisdom determined otherwise in the referendum last year.  We must do it within the confines of existing constitutional arrangements.<br \/> In crafting the new Bill, we have taken great care to be mindful of the Abbeylara judgment and the constraints implicit in previous discussions from In re Haughey to all legal cases.  Members will find it to be a robust piece of work.<\/p> <p>I am anxious to have that enacted in order that we can move to the inquiry phase.<\/p><p> I am a parliamentarian fundamentally and I like the business of Parliament having oversight and control.  I acknowledge the view that once someone migrates into the Executive, his or her view of Parliament becomes more jaundiced and as soon as he or she migrates back, he or she becomes robust in his or her defence of the role of Parliament.  The inquiry role of Parliament is a fundamental function that we have not done well here, with some honourable exceptions.  I do not know whether a committee member was part of the DIRT inquiry but there is scope for both Houses to be involved in inquiries in a way that not has happened to date and I hope that legislation will enable us to do that.<\/p><p> The general scheme of the Bill on the registration of lobbyists is being prepared and it is on my desk and I hope to bring that to Government in the next week or two.  Unfortunately, I will be sending that in the committee's direction for more scrutiny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012112200003#B00800","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353577500,"counter":544,"content":"<p>The Minister might give us a little notice.

If the Oireachtas is to have any integrity, we collectively need to recognise that phenomenon and say categorically that it cannot sit side-by-side with people who are grossly overpaid.

I was speaking to a senior member of the Garda recently who pointed out that it has been in place for four years.  He said that if it continues for another two and there are two years training in Templemore, it will be close to a decade in which there will have been no new recruits.

Such recruitment is in the programme for Government.  There is some debate about it and I would be interested to hear the Deputy's view.  My view is that Secretary General level is too high a grade, because it means coming in without knowing the structure.  Principal officer level is probably the best grade at which to come into the service, although we have recruited a very capable assistant secretary to be a director of the office of reform on a contract basis.  Our new recruits are on contracts.  The new procurement officer will be on contract.  Again, the officer is from the private sphere.  Virtually all recruits to the senior positions in my Department have come from the private sphere, to run the business end of what we must do.  Perhaps that must be replicated elsewhere.<\/p><p>  However, I refer back to a point I made earlier.  We must also make the public sphere attractive.  Some of the analysis we have carried out shows that it is not only the money that is relevant.  It is also the spotlight and the critique that falls upon people who move into the public sphere.  That does not apply in the private sphere.  Scrutiny and accountability are important, as long as they are balanced.<\/p><p>  I fully subscribe to the notion that there must be far more cross-pollination between the public and private sectors.  We are working on that.  The Government recently agreed to proposals to second people from the public service to the private sector for a year to gain experience there.  That is a good thing.  Obviously, there are issues with this.  Often some of the big accounting companies offer to let senior people come in and work with the Department for six months, for example.  However, there are issues surrounding what line of work they can work on before they go back.  Might they have insider knowledge when they go back?  That is a balance we must get right as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012112200007#F01300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1353578700,"counter":606,"content":"<p>Transparency would help with that.

What I have in mind is a career path whereby one could do five years in the public sector, five years in the private sector and so forth.  It would be useful to look at the public service contract on that basis.

It requires a referendum but, within the political reform context, if it could be changed it would massively increase the effectiveness of all Deputies and Senators to have an input to the legislative process.  Will the Minister consider providing legal expertise to the Oireachtas, akin to the Attorney General?  When we propose an amendment, one of the problems we have is that it is virtually impossible for a Minister to accept it because it has not been passed by the Attorney General.  Seeing as we cannot propose anything that creates a charge on the Exchequer, at least half of the amendments we consider are ruled out of order.  In addition, the amendments we table cannot be accepted by the Minister because we do not have access to a body of experts similar to the function of the Attorney General, which says that the proposal can stand up in law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012112200008#G00400","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1353579300,"counter":611,"content":"<p>Deputy Donnelly managed three questions.

The actual disposition of it falls to a line Minister, which is why we have line Ministers accountable to individual committees.  It would be difficult to see how that could be disaggregated.  Members of this committee would end up asking me questions about decisions made by line Ministers, for example Deputy Phil Hogan, in respect of expenditure by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It is better done at sectoral level, where there is a framework for it, with Ministers making decisions at that level.<\/p><p>  With regard to the points about the ability of politicians to change legislation, I know the frustration of not being able to submit amendments that create a charge on the State.  Bluntly, if it were possible, most Deputies would constantly propose spending more and taxing less and all of that manifests a charge on the State.  There would always be a political imperative to do so.  One can creatively draft an amendment that passes muster, which is a parliamentary skill that must be learned.  It involves crafting amendments that do not fall foul of creating a charge on the State but allow the Deputy to make the argument.  If it is compelling, the Minister can accept it.<\/p><p>  The Office of the Attorney General has a team of very senior law officers and is the legal authority on which the Government depends.  Like all advices, they are advices until they are tested by the courts.  Ultimately, the Supreme Court is the ultimate decision-maker on what is a robust constitutional provision.  There is a case to be made for it.  In my time, we looked at having a parliamentary counsel in the D&aacute;il the first time.  We do have a law officer here and the question is whether that can be augmented.  I would not like a situation where a Deputy stands up and says that the parliamentary counsel to the D&aacute;il says one thing and the Minister responds that the Attorney General says something different.

On the investment side, Ireland has done extraordinarily well in recent times.  I have instanced the level of foreign direct investment, which is unprecedented.  There is an extremely healthy flow of investment from foreign companies which want to build a stable platform here, with not just an important knock-on effect in the construction sector but also an important long-term employment effect.  If we look at the bond issue by Bank of Ireland this week, it managed to yield &euro;1 billion and was oversubscribed by multiples of this figure.  People want to invest in an Irish bank, which is extraordinary when we consider the situation a year ago.  If we look at Irish sovereign bond yields yesterday, we could have gone to the market yesterday and funded Ireland at an affordable rate for the first time since 2010.  Whatever formulation we are using, it is working.<\/p><p>  People ask if austerity is working, as if we could decide that it is not and that we will not do it anymore.  That is not the choice the Government has.  If we were to determine that we were not going to meet the reduction thresholds agreed with the troika, it would stop giving us money.  It gives money on a conditional basis and if it stopped doing so, we would have to meet current expenditure from current income, leaving a gap of &euro;15 billion, which would be horrendous to try to close in one year.  In getting money from the troika we have gained a period of time in which to work towards a balanced budget and we are doing so successfully.  Last year the deficit target was 9.6% and the outturn was 9%.  Although growth figures for this year are lower than anticipated because of external turbulence in the eurozone, the deficit target for the year is 8.6% which we are confident we will comfortably meet.  Our target next year is a figure of 7.5%.

We are getting closer to having a single view of what is happening across the entire public and civil service.  Second, the Minister brought proposals for an overall ICT strategy to the Cabinet earlier this year and an e-government strategy has been agreed by the Government and published.  There has been a great deal of engagement with the industry on that strategy.  Third, the Government recently approved a cloud strategy for the future provision of Government services.  In essence, that provides a facility for us to consolidate some ICT infrastructure into more single computer centres and single data centres.  That will lead to a reduction in the costs associated with the provision of services.  It will also allow us to move towards paying for services on demand, or on tap, at some future stage.  The cloud strategy allows one to buy what one needs from a private vendor on top as required, rather than buying a bulk architecture and being responsibility for its maintenance.  That overarching strategy will enable us to reduce costs, get a wider oversight of the ICT infrastructure and provide more services on-line.  Citizens can engage with approximately 400 services on the e-government website.  There has been a dramatic improvement in that regard over the last 18 months.  This is covered in the plan.  It was recently noted in an EU report that Ireland has moved from being capable of providing 37% of services online to being capable of providing 44% of services online.  We have moved from being below the average for the 27 EU member states to being above it.  There is an overall strategy.  A wider view is being taken.<\/p><p>  Deputy Fleming asked about shared services earlier.  That will be part of our ICT infrastructure in the future.  One of the emerging issues in our plan for shared services is the need for multiple releases of similar systems around the various centres.

I am always confused by the distinction between the Civil Service and the public service.  I think I have a handle on the difference now.  I wonder whether it is useful to distinguish between them as we try to work with unions to get more from less while delivering better public services to the public.  Is it time for that archaic distinction to be looked at?  The Minister spoke about the free movement of people across the public service.  I think there are over 300,000 people in the public service.  Do we not need greater flexibility to provide for cross-agency movement of staff between the Civil Service, the public service and the local authorities, etc.?  I am often contacted by people who are working in Dublin and looking for a transfer down the country.  The obstacles and barriers they encounter when they try to secure that kind of movement are misplaced in today's circumstances.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge that the Croke Park agreement has delivered in some respects.  I am also of the opinion that some of the so-called achievements could be seen as box-ticking.<\/p> <p>From recent personal experience, I am irked by the difficulty one has in arranging a parent-teacher meeting outside school hours.  Despite teachers working an additional 2 million hours nationally, the number of contact hours has not increased in most primary and secondary schools.  It appears that teachers are starting the working day earlier with a meeting or roundtable discussion before teaching of classes commences.  Many teachers will acknowledge that they have ticked a box in this regard.  I am not sure what additional hours have been provided for members of the public.  We need tangible outcomes.  <\/p><p> In the context of the further engagement on the Croke Park agreement sanctioned by the Government, I welcome the commitment to engage in dialogue given by the public service unions.  Is the Minister factoring into the arithmetic for the budget which will be announced on 5 December additional savings in 2013 pending the outcome of this engagement, even though it has not yet commenced?<\/p><p> The Minister indicated that recent borrowing rates would have allowed us to fund the State at an affordable cost.  While these are important indicators, unfortunately, the trickle down effect in terms of how such barometers deliver for citizens is a more longer term prospect.  The worst manifestations of the crisis are unemployment, emigration, etc.  We need to get a real handle on the profile of the live register in areas such as youth unemployment and the long-term unemployment rate.  Prospective employers should be able to log on to the Department's website and find out how many IT specialists, plumbers or other specialists are available in their locality.  This type of profiling of the live register is long overdue and a glaring defect which needs to be addressed.  Are there proposals to address this matter through reform?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012112200011#K01800","speaker":"986","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353581700,"counter":672,"content":"<p>I remind members that the Minister must leave at 11.15 a.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012112200012#L00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1353581700,"counter":673,"content":"<p>The Deputy raised a question regarding the difference between the Civil Service and the public service.  Civil servants - \"servant\" is a lovely word - are those who work in government, while the term \"public servant\" refers to everybody else who is employed in the public service, including garda&iacute;, teachers, nurses and doctors.  Our ambition in the programme is to build an integrated public service for the first time.  We started by trying to build an integrated Civil Service and we have established the senior Civil Service for the first time.  I probably embarrassed somebody when I referred at a previous meeting of the joint committee to an occasion when all of our ambassadors were called home.  Most ambassadors are at assistant secretary level, with a small number at principal officer level.  I used the opportunity to bring together all of the assistant secretaries in the public service to discuss the reform agenda.  One of the issues about which I spoke to them was integration and free movement across the public sphere.  The meeting attracted a good audience and I went through the reform agenda.  Following the meeting, one distinguished ambassador who I will not embarrass by referring to him by name followed me out and said, \"You did not mean us, of course.\"  He had the notion that it would not be appropriate for civil servants from uncouth Departments to be arriving in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Barriers must be broken down to achieve the integration we seek and move people across Departments.  This is a work in progress.<\/p><p>  I do not share Deputy Michael Creed's scepticism about the Croke Park agreement being used as a box-ticking exercise. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012112200012#L00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1353581700,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I am sceptical in some respects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012112200012#L00400","speaker":"986"},{"type":"speech","time":1353581700,"counter":675,"content":"<p>The agreement is a fantastic enabler of change.  The Deputy will remember the old days when moving people to a better office meant paying them a movement allowance and one would have a work-to-rule and God knows what else.  All of that has been blown away.  We are moving people up to 45 km from their base and thousands of public servants have been moved on that basis.  We have also changed rosters to fill gaps.  This has worked well where management has been proactive.  Problems have only arisen where middle management has been inactive in driving change.  We need to get on top of this issue.  One will always hear anecdotes about whether extra hours in teaching are being utilised in a practical way.  One of the things I have to do is ensure extra hours we secure across the public service migrate into pay savings.<\/p><p>  On the trickle down reform agenda and unemployment, the latter is a significant issue.  The joint committee may wish to examine the structure of the live register, on which I agree with Deputy Michael Creed.  For example, I know of people who have retired from the main banks, having paid a class A stamp throughout their careers, and because they are not old enough to receive an old age pension, they are obliged to sign on to maintain their stamp.  They are not looking for work in any real sense, yet they are counted as being unemployed.  We need to disaggregate those who are really unemployed from those who are not really unemployed and dig down into the live register.  This is a process in which the Departments of Social Protection and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are engaged. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012112200012#L00500","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1353581700,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his briefing and engaging in a lively discussion with members.

Our meeting this morning will be divided into two parts.  The first part will be a discussion to coincide with World Prematurity Day.  I welcome members of the Irish Premature Babies organisation, in particular Ms Mandy Daly, Dr. John Murphy and Ms Hilda Wall.  Members will be aware that last Saturday marked international World Prematurity Day.  Almost 5,000 babies are born premature in Ireland every year, equating to one premature baby born every two hours.  Premature births are defined as those of less than 37 weeks' gestation, and the most vulnerable of these children in terms of survival are those born at less than 28 weeks' gestation or more than three months early.  As someone who was born ten weeks premature and who weighed in at 2 lbs 11 oz, I am glad to say I survived and I am here.  I welcome our guests this morning.<\/p><p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.

Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice or ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>  I pay tribute to Ms Mandy Daly for the outstanding work she has done in promulgation and advocacy and I compliment her on it.  By coincidence, Dr. Murphy and Ms Daly are both from Cork which gives them an extra benefit at this morning's meeting.  I call on Dr. Murphy to begin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012112200003#E00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353576600,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak this morning.  This is a fact-finding mission to inform the committee about a group of patients that one may not come across in one's everyday work, although at the far side of Merrion Square there is a large unit in the National Maternity Hospital.  Newborn babies are defined as those in the first month of life.  Believe it or not, often this is when the greatest problems occur for small babies.  It is a difficult hurdle for children to get through the first month.<\/p><p>  As the Chairman noted, we marked World Prematurity Day on 22 November.  The idea of World Prematurity Day is to highlight the issue of prematurity for the stakeholders, including doctors, nurses, paramedics and health care professionals who look after these babies.  However, it is also a matter for the public because most members of the public have been touched either directly or indirectly by prematurity, whether in the case of a brother, a sister, a father or a grandchild who was born prematurely.  I will discuss the issues that affect a large number of babies.<\/p><p>  One year ago I was appointed as the national clinical lead in neonatology.  Clinical lead programmes are a collaboration between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  The purpose of a clinical lead is to set standards and then to implement strategies to allow these standards to be brought into being throughout the country.  On my left is Ms Hilda Wall, a nursing manager in the hospital in Holles Street and a clinical lead for neonatal nursing.  Ms Wall will discuss some aspects of neonatal nursing later on, including the complexity of the speciality.  On my right is Ms Mandy Daly, who represents the Irish Premature Babies association and who is doing a great deal of work to help families who have had pre-term babies and to highlight the issues for pre-term infants.<\/p><p>  The first slide on prematurity will give the committee a flavour of the speciality.  Our speciality is different from others in that it is rather visual with small babies and the things that are done.  One can see in the top panel the remarkable amount of intensive care provided to these babies, who are either pre-term or term babies who are very sick.  The lower panel shows the more human side.  There is a picture of a mother who is giving a baby skin-to-skin kangaroo care, which is an effective way of interacting with the infant and keeping him or her warm.  There is also a picture of a baby with a mother and father.  That is probably the smallest baby I have ever brought out of hospital, born at 23 weeks' gestation.  There is also a picture of pre-term twins and slightly older children.  There is a complexity to the intensive care involved but these children emerge as normal children.<\/p><p>  The next picture shows a map of Ireland.  I decided to use it as a challenge for the committee.  There are approximately 75,000 births annually in the country.  There are 4,800 premature babies born, a total of 19 neonatal units used to look after these babies and 300 neonatal cots.  These are the figures for the country.  In the North of Ireland there are approximately 25,000 births and, therefore, on the island of Ireland there are approximately 100,000 births.  This is equivalent to the number of births in Sweden, which has a population of 9 million.  Therefore, clearly we have a large number of children born, thankfully so, because they will grow up and be part of a young population in the country.<\/p><p>  The Chairman referred to the definition of prematurity as being less than 37 weeks' gestation as well as the associated issues.  A term baby is one of 40 weeks' gestation.<\/p> <p>The more pre-term the baby, the more troublesome the case.  Members will note from slide 5 that the incidence of prematurity in Ireland is 7%.  The percentage in other countries is much higher.  For example, in the United States it is 12%, which is a big problem.  During World Prematurity Day, an international speaker pointed to the real problem in the United States in terms of prematurity.  We are fortunate in that the percentage in Ireland is a little lower, although overall it is rising.  Members will see from the slide that  some babies, although pre-term, are relatively big in size and others are relatively small and vulnerable.  As such, the care required varies.<\/p><p> Slide No. 6 deals with one of the most important issues we would like to discuss this morning.  Not all units in the country are the same size.  As shown on the slide, there have been more than 8,000 births in four particular units, which is a large number of births by international standards, a smaller number in four others and 2,000 births between the remainder of the units.  This is important in the context of the delivery of care.  Level 1 care involves basic care of babies, including resuscitation on a needs basis.  Level 2 care, which takes place in more regional centres, involves the provision of supportive or intensive care.  Level 3 is intensive care for infants.  It is important to be able to interact these three levels, using them quickly and effectively.  This is where the term &quot;network&quot; comes in.  In this regard it means professional connectivity.  We have been working on how to make connectivity happen and on getting all of the units in the country to work together, in terms of the management of premature babies, in a cohesive fashion.<\/p><p> In trying to determine best practise, we visited all the units in the country and met with all the doctors in all the hospitals.  We learned about what is being done on a daily basis and of the main problems being experienced.  It is important all these hospitals, in terms of the provision of care of infants, work effectively and cohesively.  I will comment further on that issue later.  <\/p><p> Slide 8 shows how successful the speciality has been.  The reduction in mortality rates has been divided according to birth weight panels.  In some cases, there has been a drop in mortality of up to 28% or 36% over ten years.  It would be a challenge to any group in society to achieve a reduction in mortality of patients of 30% over ten years.  It has been a great success.  Members will note that the diagram contains information in regard to babies weighing 500 and 750 grammes, which is 1lb to 1.25lbs in weight.  These babies are the new challenge for us.  These are very much wanted babies of mothers who have undergone IVF treatment and have difficulties around getting pregnant.  The challenge over the next five to ten years will be trying to get a better outcome for this group of infants.  <\/p><p> Slide 9 relates to the benchmarking report of last year, which was mentioned at the first World Prematurity Day event last year.  While many medical services in Ireland have in the past developed in an <i>ad hoc<\/i> fashion what is needed now is a much more planned approach to neonatal services.  The structure of these services needs to planned and implemented.  When there is a structured system in place new developments can be applied rapidly.  Where there is not a structured system in place and new developments occur they are not quickly implemented countrywide.  This is important for the future.<\/p><p> The second last sentence of slide 10 states the philosophy of the lead programme, namely, bringing expertise to the baby or bringing the baby to the experts.  In other words, we want these babies to be cared for as locally as possible, by their local doctors with their families as close by as possible.  They should only be moved to a bigger centre where necessary and as soon as possible after they have received that care they should be returned to the local hospital.  The next slide highlights the importance to neonatal care of a seamless transfer across the system from level 1 to level 3 care and back to the local hospital as soon as possible.  We are trying to eradicate post code disadvantage and want every baby in the country to get the service they need in the time they need it.<\/p><p> Slide 12 deals with my final point, which is on one of the most important issues in this area, namely, transport.  We are lucky to have a neonatal transport system in Ireland.  It operates from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  However, no service is available after 5 p.m.  The service includes a dedicated ambulance and specially trained doctors and nurses, who collect babies from any unit in the country and take them to whatever facility is selected for the treatment they require.  This service needs to be developed further.  We would like to have a 24\/7 service.  Babies are regularly born outside of office hours, with some born in the middle of the night and requiring transfer by a dedicated team of staff.  During our visit to hospitals around the country the need for a 24\/7 service was highlighted.  My main priority is to make this happen.  A 24\/7 transport service would be life saving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012112200003#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353577200,"counter":686,"content":"<p>I would like to reiterate what has been said by Dr. Murphy.  We are here as a united front today to outline the current situation and to put forward proposals to tackle some of the blockages in the system.  With respect to the neonatal ambulance service, money has been ring-fenced for the provision of a 24\/7 service.  To have it implemented will require a lifting of the moratorium on recruitment.  That is one of our key issues today.  As a parent organisation we are privileged to work with the medics.  Huge strides have been made in the past number of years by the medical community who cater for our children.  One of the biggest challenges we faced is the lack of understanding of pre-term birth in the broader community, including among the stakeholders in the field.  For every child born, there is a journey for an entire family.  As stated by Dr. Murphy, whether we bring the expertise to the children or the children to the expertise, it is vitally important this is done where appropriate and in time so as to prevent life long disabilities which have social impacts on the family and can have a financial burden on the State in general.  By adopting the guidelines of Dr. Murphy's working group in relation to the structure of the neonatal system in the country we alleviate the financial and emotional impact on families.  We also ensure that each unit has the appropriate skill set to care for the children in their care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012112200004#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mandy Daly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353577200,"counter":687,"content":"<p>As a manager in the National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street one of my biggest concerns is the availability of space.  We want to ensure we provide the best possible care.  This requires that babies be managed by skilled personnel, namely, nurses who are delegated to the transport team and dedicated physicians.  The bottleneck in the service is returning babies, following care, to their local hospital because often the local hospitals have to get nurses in and arrange for special ambulances, which delays the whole process.<\/p><p>  I agree with Ms Daly that transport is a huge financial and emotional burden on parents.  A mother who is breast-feeding would be required to travel every day to do so.  This involves huge costs in terms of travel, car parking and overnight stays.

Is anything being done to increase co-operation between smaller and larger units in regard to training programmes for junior doctors?  For example, a junior doctor could work for two years in Dublin followed by a year in one of the smaller units.  In fairness to the big units in Dublin and Cork, they are very supportive of the smaller units and are on call on a 24-seven basis to provide assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012112200005#G00800","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1353577800,"counter":698,"content":"<p>What are the weakest regions in terms of geography and to what extent are premature children born in them at a disadvantage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012112200005#G00900","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353577800,"counter":699,"content":"<p>The main issue is distance from a bigger centre when help is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012112200005#G01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1353577800,"counter":700,"content":"<p>We will take questions together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012112200005#G01100","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1353577800,"counter":701,"content":"<p>Is any region particularly exposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012112200005#G01200","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1353577800,"counter":702,"content":"<p>As a mother of three healthy children who were born on time, I do not have the experience of giving birth to a premature baby but I know others who have gone through the experience and how it affects their extended families.

If that is the case, and perhaps I am not great on the maths, is it not a no-brainer to suggest that the savings which could be generated from not needing to pour substantial health and medical resources into families, over the lifetimes of the between eight and ten children who would lead normal lives, would immensely outweigh the cost of running an ambulance that is already available?

What types of person completed the survey?   I have been a Deputy for 18 months and this delegation is definitely one of the most impressive delegations I have met here.  In my view, the delegates are beyond their years, so to speak.  I am very impressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012112200009#L00900","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speech","time":1353580200,"counter":787,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their opening presentation.  I am a mother of teenagers.  They tell me that as a politician I should get my head around issues.  They have other sayings but I could not repeat them here.  Mental health and sexual health issues have been taboo subjects for a very long time.  I remember a teacher in my school handing out a book in the classroom about sexual education matters.  She told us to bring it home and read it.  In my view, it should not be part of a teacher's job to teach classes in relationships and sexuality education, RSE, or social, personal and health education, SPHE.  This work should be done by specialists such as doctors and other professional health care workers who could come to the schools for as little as half an hour a week.  This would be preferable to asking teachers to deal with these matters in religion class or as part of the SPHE programme.  Young people today have very different views from mine.  I have four children at home who are constantly on my shoulder.  They think differently about things.  They look at the space differently, whatever that means.<\/p><p>  I note that 91% of young people surveyed think that participating in RSE at school is either important or very important.  If nothing else comes out of the presentation, we should take note of that survey result and the number of young people who regard this programme as important.  Qualified people who can speak openly and honestly to young people should be teaching these classes.  In the case of my teenagers, they had no intention of discussing anything about themselves or their friends with a teacher who was also teaching them maths or religious knowledge.<\/p><p>  I used to give talks to transition year classes in my local schools.  The previous Government introduced a science education policy.  A bus used to travel around the country to introduce science subjects to schoolchildren.  I suggest using a bus which could travel to both primary and secondary schools and would be staffed by qualified personnel.  I suggest it would only need half an hour's class time during the week for students to use the resources on the bus and to ask questions.  Booklets are available in doctors' surgeries and in maternity hospitals - such as in the Coombe in my neighbourhood - which describe sexually transmitted diseases.  Young people are very aware of these dangers but they need to be educated about them.  <\/p><p>  The duty of the Government is to consider changes in educational programmes.  The SPHE and RSE classes are past their sell-by dates and need to be replaced.  I suggest that professional people should be involved rather than leaving it to the teacher who teaches religion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012112200009#L01000","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353580800,"counter":788,"content":"<p>On the question of whether the stigma features throughout the country, I was at a presentation on Tuesday delivered by a member of Headstrong, which is planning on starting a Jigsaw initiative in Limerick.  The organisation surveyed young people across Limerick city on mental health, and on the simple question as to what constitutes mental health, the majority of answers referred to drugs, alcohol, depression, suicide and schizophrenia.  There was not one positive answer; they were all purely negative.  It is difficult to state directly what can be done about it.  In Limerick, we are trying to put a pack together promoting positive mental health.  At our annual general meeting, we focused solely on what one can do to deal with stress and stay positive.  It is a question of going out to promote the fact that there are ways of coping with problems.  It is not a question of showing the various illnesses or their symptoms.  While doing so is important, it is more important to educate people on how to stay positive at school and deal with stress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012112200010#M00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. &Eacute;amonn &Oacute; Briain"},{"type":"speech","time":1353580800,"counter":789,"content":"<p>Does Mr. &Oacute; Briain believe his peer group is listening and prepared to offer support and have people look after one another?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012112200010#M00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1353580800,"counter":790,"content":"<p>Definitely.
