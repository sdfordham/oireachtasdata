Few organisations are as active in the area of European Union affairs as European Movement Ireland.  I have dealt with it during the years and it is very familiar to the committee and its members.  It explains to citizens how the European Union works and encourages many to engage and work with its institutions.  We are delighted that its representatives are with us and thank them for coming in such inclement weather.

We were impacted on by the sneachta which we have braved to be here.  We thank the committee for the invitation to engage with it on the very important topic of transparency and accountability in European institutions and Ireland's involvement in them.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Nora Trench Bowles, our policy and advocacy manager.  The committee is to be commended for deliberating on this important issue which is crucial in bringing decision-making closer to EU citizens and increasing democratic accountability.  <\/p> <p>  By way of background, it might be helpful if I outlined the origins of European Movement Ireland.  Having being founded in 1954, it is Ireland's longest established not-for-profit voluntary membership organisation dedicated to furthering and connecting Ireland and the European Union.  That is the mission that underpins the organisation and forms part of our values.  It has been key to much of its work as a civil society organisation for more than 60 years, as it endeavours to promote and ensure transparency and engagement at all levels in Ireland's ever-evolving relationship with the European Union.  As such, the issue on which I will engage with the committee is of particular significance to the organisation and permeates and underpins many of its endeavours.  <\/p> <p>  The last time I presented to the committee was in October 2017 when I was accompanied by the chairman of the organisation, Mr. Maurice Pratt, and we had a very fruitful and timely discussion with the distinguished members on the future of the European Union.  As we said then in welcoming this engagement, the input of national politicians, institutions and parliaments on European issues was a crucial bridge between citizens and the European Union and certainly amplified and attached greater significance to our voice in the European Union.  As part of its presentation to the committee in October, European Movement Ireland called for a greater national debate on the topic of the future of the European Union, emphasising the limited window of opportunity to have an input into this critically important and very fast-moving process, coming as it did at a crucial juncture in the evolution of the Union.  We believe this engagement also helps to promote transparency and engagement as vital in lessening any connection deficit between EU institutions and citizens. <\/p> <p>  I am very pleased to report that the future of the European Union has since been the principal focus of our work, as it will continue to be for several years.  We have been working in partnership with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in carrying out a country-wide public consultation process on the topic of the future of the Europe which was launched in November 2017 in the Science Gallery by the Taoiseach; the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade who has special responsibility for Brexit, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee.  We welcome the ongoing commitment by the Government to furthering and facilitating this vital debate, in which we are very pleased to play our part, particularly considering European Movement Ireland's long-standing aim and intention to encourage and promote Ireland's contribution at all levels to the debates on how to progress and develop European issues, particularly in Ireland. <\/p> <p>  We steadfastly believe Ireland's future remains within the European Union.  Each year we commission Red C to conduct an independent survey of the public's views on the European Union.  Public opinion on Ireland's membership of the European Union has remained very positive and fluctuated little since 2013, peaking at 90% support in 2016 but remaining in the high 80s ever since polling began.<\/p><p>Public opinion on Ireland's membership of the European Union has remained very high and has fluctuated little since 2013, peaking at 90% support in 2016 but remaining in the high 80s since we began polling.  There is little evidence that the Irish public supports the view that we should follow the UK out of the European Union.  Indeed, support for this idea has dropped by 13% since 2013 and recent Eurobarometer reports underpin the various Red C polls.  However, reasoned and robust debate on what we, as Irish and EU citizens, would want a reforming European Union to look like is important.  It helps us to formulate our own views and thoughts on these multifaceted issues and helps us to progress, input into and influence the European Union-wide debate which will shape our future for decades to come.<br\/><br\/>In that light we are proactively engaging with people around the country by hosting a series of citizen dialogues.  These regional events have been designed with a bottom-up approach in mind to garner, hear and listen to people's needs, concerns and positions, which are very complex and nuanced.  People are encouraged to get involved and have their say and, through a variety of different platforms across social media and in face-to-face citizens' dialogues, we have engaged on critically important questions such as a prosperous and competitive European Union; a safe and secure European Union; a sustainable union; a socially responsible union; and shaping globalisation.  Spearheaded by the Minister of State for European Affairs, we have already hosted very lively and robust citizen dialogues in Galway in Connacht, with the Munster event taking place in Cork last week.  These are conversations about how we wish the European Union to develop and what Ireland's role can be.<br\/><br\/>I assure committee members that the meetings have been frank, enlightening and informative.  Rather than concentrating solely on Brexit, which will undoubtedly create many challenges for Ireland given that we will be the remaining member state most adversely affected by the UK's decision to leave the EU, people are thinking of the bigger picture and asking themselves what they would like the European Union to look like in ten, 20, 30 or 40 years' time.  How do we, as a country and as a people, want to shape and influence it?  We hope this process will help to spark a nationwide debate on the future of Europe and we call on distinguished members of the committee to continue to lead and guide that debate.  Further citizen dialogues will take place in Ulster in Donegal next week and in Meath on 19 April, followed by a major event in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham on Europe Day, 9 May.<br\/><br\/>There has been widespread interest in the series of national citizen dialogues and we were very pleased that it was recognised at European level when the European Commission recently referred to Ireland as an example of best practice in communicating with EU citizens as part of the wider future of Europe debate.  Discussion at these dialogues has touched upon the need for more awareness and understanding of, and engagement with, European initiatives and the need to better communicate and explain what the European Union does.  European Movement, EM, Ireland is firmly of the view that these elements, which form the foundation of much of our work, feed into the wider context and the importance of transparency.<br\/><br\/>Another area where Ireland has been referred to as an example of best practice across Europe is the mandatory lobbying register.  The European Commission and the European Parliament have jointly operated a lobbying register since 2011, of which European Movement Ireland is one of nearly 12,000 registrants.  Following on from a European Commission proposal, negotiations on a mandatory EU transparency register covering the Commission, Parliament and Council are due to start in the coming months.  European Movement Ireland welcomes this development, which will further transparency requirements across the EU decision-making institutions.  We will follow, with interest, the results of these upcoming negotiations.<br\/><br\/>I am aware that the Joint Committee on European Affairs is investing considerable time in hearing from experts on the topic of transparency in European institutions, including from the European Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, earlier this month.  It is great to see an Irish woman at the helm of this important body, leading work which impacts the lives of EU citizens when it comes to their dealings and engagements with the different EU institutions.  EM Ireland welcomes the recommendations of the European Ombudsman to increase the level of transparency in the Council legislative process.  As she advocated in her address to the committee, better facilitating public scrutiny as to how member state governments position themselves in EU law-making could go some way to enabling stronger accountability in those laws.  European Movement Ireland will follow with interest the Council's response to the European Ombudsman recommendations, which is due before 9 May.  We hope the Council's response allows for the value in deepening the transparency and accountability of that institution.<br\/><br\/>We will also follow, with interest, the progress and impact of the Dutch Parliament's paper on transparency in the Council.  As the paper outlines, the role of national parliaments in overseeing and scrutinising the Council's actions puts them in a very privileged position to act and we call on distinguished members of the committee to support this impetus in an effort to increase accountability and democratic legitimacy in EU decision-making.  Greater transparency and accountability can also help address the tendency for member state governments to Europeanise failure and nationalise success, a subject on which I have often spoken before this committee.  It is crucial that we all take responsibility for the role we play in EU matters and for how actively we engage with Europe and the EU institutions.  Our role in disseminating factual information about Europe, in language that is clear and understandable, includes explaining the decision-making structures of the European Union.  It is not the case that faceless bureaucrats decide on EU laws - it is our democratically accountable and nationally elected Ministers who do so, as well as MEPs directly elected by EU citizens.  In this light, we regularly produce Just the Facts policy briefings and all-you-need-to-know explainers.  This week, the committee will have received our Just the Facts briefing on the informal European Council meeting which took place last Friday and we recently issued a series of explainers on the composition of the European Parliament post Brexit and the <i>Spitzenkandidaten<\/i>process.<br\/><br\/>The accountability campaign is another example of our work related to our belief in promoting transparency and accountability at all levels.  For many years, European Movement Ireland has tracked a variety of statistical indicators covering the Oireachtas, the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council of Europe and has looked at Ireland's EU engagement through these institutions.  Beyond these statistical indicators, European Movement Ireland continues to shed light on, and work to explain, Ireland's engagement at European Union level.  This is particularly the case in regard to Brexit which has been a principle focus of our work since late 2015 and remains so.<br\/><br\/>As developments around the Brexit negotiations have shown, engagements outside the formal EU institutions and structures are also crucial.  The Government's programme of strategic engagement with EU partners across the different EU member state capitals and on the margins of Council meetings is a strong and productive example of this.  The efforts of this diplomatic push, as well as the push made by many political, business and civil society organisations through their European networks, are important and are to be commended on ensuring that Ireland, and particularly the Border on our island, was one of the top three priorities of the first phase of the Brexit negotiations.  This success made clear, once again, that when Ireland actively, constructively and transparently engages at an EU level, the impact we can have can be great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018022800002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519812000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Connell.

Ms O'Connell referred to the RedC polls.  I believe there has been more of an appreciation of the EU since Brexit by citizens right across Europe and in Ireland.

For the benefit of the committee will Ms O'Connell outline some of the issues being raised at those meetings?

Perhaps Ms O'Connell will give a summary of the issues raised within the citizens' dialogues. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018022800002#D00200","speaker":"1360"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519812000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Haughey for his very warm words on this very cold day.  We are grateful for his support.<\/p> <p>  I shall first address the Vice Chairman's question on transparency and accountability at Council level and the issues coming up in the citizens' dialogues.  It is very interesting that one of the topics and themes emerging through the debate is the continued desire and interest of citizens to have greater accountability and transparency across all levels and across all the different institutions.  Citizens have not focused on or mentioned the Council specifically but there has certainly been the interest, the wish and the desire to see continued efforts in promoting accountability and transparency across the different institutions, regardless of which institution it may be.<\/p> <p>  We would absolutely agree with Deputy Haughey that Brexit has been a wake-up call.  It is interesting to see, across the different citizens' dialogues - so far we have been to Galway and Cork - that a desire is expressed to have better communications by our Government and the EU Parliament around the various European Union initiatives at play in Ireland and how they affect all our lives as citizens.  The main topics and themes emerging are on the areas of security, climate change, the Erasmus programme, the rural-urban challenges and how to promote and develop Ireland's infrastructure.  PESCO has also featured.  The debates are very lively, robust and well informed.<\/p> <p>  We model the example of the Citizens' Assembly.  People are seated at tables and they go through a series of five topics.  The participants' pack will be given to this committee for reference.  The groups of participants discuss each of the topics in detail for ten minutes and their views are then fed back to the wider group.  It is certainly an interesting and lively debate.  It is very encouraging to see the level of commitment and engagement by people.  The meetings take place after work on cold evenings at 6 p.m. and we do not allow people to leave until they are all talked out at about 8.30 p.m. or 8.45 p.m.  The level of commitment, debate and dialogue is really encouraging.  People want to have their voices heard on what Ireland's relationship with the European Union should be like.  We are delighted to see that people are inputting in to this continuing process.  We shall garner all the views and feed it back in to the Parliament and to the Government, in order to shape and influence Ireland's position on the European Union as we face the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018022800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1519812000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Connell very much.

Getting out of my driveway was the problem.  Once I was on the road it was easy enough to get in.  I am sorry I missed the presentation.  Ms O'Connell speaks of providing factual information which is a really important aspect when considering the future of Europe.  It is great that the roadshow is going around the country, engaging with people and listening to their concerns.  It brings Europe down to the ground to the people who have an interest in it.  The EU is currently under threat.<\/p> <p>  The European project that we know and love is under threat and I believe that the threat is not as great from Brexit as it may be from misinformation and migration.  Let us deal with both of these separately if we can.  On misinformation, the key thing coming out at the moment is Ireland's membership of PESCO.  I am not sure if this is what European Movement Ireland is hearing around the country.  I hope to join the citizens' dialogue in Donegal on 8 March.  I would like to attend at least one of the meetings in rural Ireland to hear what goes on.<\/p> <p>  The notion of a European army is being bandied around the place.  None of the people who speak against PESCO speak of the fact that it is a menu of choices.  None of the people who speak against it speak of the fact that our nation could not possibly afford either the investment or resources to protect ourselves, for example in the area of cybersecurity.  I do not believe that any EU country, apart from Germany or France, could fund that type of protection.<\/p> <p>  The benefits from PESCO are massive.  With regard to defence in the State, I try not to use with word \"defence\" when we talk about PESCO and I try to only talk about security.  When one mentions defence in Ireland people immediately think of uniforms, boots, guns and all that goes with that.  As a small, open economy the capacity of the Government to negotiate deals for the purchase of hardware is a significant factor.  There is a benefit in becoming part of a collective.  Has there been any positive information on the ground around the benefits that would accrue from PESCO as against the downside?<\/p> <p>  I shall now turn to migration.  We all want to play our part when it comes to refugees.  The EU has mistakenly identified the crisis the Mediterranean Sea as a refugee crisis.  Do not get me wrong, I am very supportive of free movement across the world and not just across the EU, but I believe there are those who are sitting in very poor circumstances who will nearly all have a television set and a mobile phone.  They can see the relative luxury in which we live in the western world.  Some people in Ireland, however, might not agree there is luxury living but when we compare it to where some others live, it is luxurious.  There is a natural desire to come here and to sup at that well.<\/p> <p>  We have to find a way within the EU system to facilitate the movement of economic migrants.  Has there been any discussion or debate at local level on that, especially around the notion of short-term visas for three to five years to allow people to come and pick up a skill set and then move back to the country they came from?  We know that education raises the economy in every country.  Those people who would come to the EU to get specific skills could go back home and raise their own economies.<\/p><p>Has there been any discussion on Europe's role, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and north Africa?  Europe needs to take a proactive role in building those economies.  By that I do not mean giving moneys to military juntas and the like but we need to be proactive in terms of education and encouraging companies that relocate in those countries to invest in them.  I have raised on many occasions at this committee the massive multinationals that have moved from Ireland to cheap labour economies.  Are any of us paying any less for their products now that they have moved to a cheaper manufacturing base?  We are not.  What are those multinationals doing with their super-normal profits?  They are skimming them off and keeping them.  Tens of billions of euro and dollars are being held.  Is that an issue people around the country are talking about in the debates Ms O'Connell organisation has arranged?  I commend her on what her organisation is doing.  It must be tough at times facing the public at these debates.  I apologise for being late and I thank Ms O'Connell for her commitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018022800002#D00600","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519812000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Craughwell for his comments.  We were also slightly impacted by the sneachta on the way here.  The Senator certainly hit the nail on the head on the defence issue.  I can only speak about the Connacht and Munster debates that have taken place so far.  When we bring together a group of approximately 100 people from across the different provinces at each venue, we try to split them up in order that they engage with people they do not know.  There are a diversity and plurality of views, even among the smaller groups of eight to ten people around the tables on topics, including those of the PESCO defence and security.  That reinforces the complexity and the nuanced nature of the topics people are discussing.<\/p> <p>  The responses have been very nuanced across the two dialogues that have taken place to date.  I remember the people at one table during the debate we had in Cork were fully in favour of there being greatly increased collaboration on security and defence issues and were fully behind Ireland's position on PESCO whereas the table next to them, table F, were completely against it.  The level of debate on that issue was interesting.  Certainly, some people are calling for a rethink on the issue, which is also interesting.  There were calls for an evolution of Ireland's traditional long-held position on neutrality, while at the same citizens' dialogues people were very strongly of the view that this position must be maintained and upheld regardless of the challenges.  The issues of cybersecurity and terrorism were also discussed.  We noticed the complexity and nuances of the views at the debates we have had to date.<\/p> <p>  The Senator's point regarding migration and the visa process is interesting.  It has been encouraging that a mixture of people have attended these dialogues.  It has not only been citizens form Ireland.  Citizens from different EU member states and further afield have come along and inputted in the engagement on how they view Ireland's relationship with Europe and the way they want it to develop.  The gatherings have been very diverse and multicultural and that has enriched the dialogue, debate and also the discussion and the findings.  We have noticed that there is no one-size-fits-all view.  I am sure members of the committee could attest to that being the case.  There is no one view on any one particular topic.  If we have 100 participants at a debate, I can guarantee we will have 100 different points of view, which is to be commended.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is right in pointing out that it is not an easy task to moderate this engagement.   My colleague, Ms Nora Trench Bowles, is involved on the communications and multimedia side.  She probably has a harder job than I do.  The hardest job I have is to make sure people do not go over the allotted time.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, county councillors, Members of the European Parliament, MEPs, and Members of the Oireachtas have attended these dialogues and are to be commended.  We appreciate the support and any assistance members of the committee can give us.  We would love to see the Senator Craughwell at the debate is Letterkenny next week.  Hopefully the snow will have thawed by that stage.  We are hoping for a good turnout in Ulster and the north west.  We believe such dialogue is extremely important.  This is an important body of work.  The depth and intensity of the dialogues and debates taking place are affirming and enriching.  People are very engaged and that is to be commended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018022800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1519812000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Has anybody put forward the thesis that Ireland is not a neutral country?

Should we have to finish up early, I would be more than happy to have my office arrange a further engagement with the committee at the earliest possible date.  I appreciate the opportunity that this committee provides for a cross-party and cross-group approach to mental health.<\/p><p>It is welcome that we now have this important forum within the Oireachtas.  I see this as a committee for the sharing of information and good ideas, for oversight and for suggestions.  It sends an important message that the Oireachtas has decided mental health is such an important issue it should have a dedicated stand-alone committee.  That was a view shared by many, including the Chair, who sought the establishment of this committee. <\/p><p> While there is a dedicated Minister of State at the Department of Health with special responsibility for Mental Health and Older People,  I am pleased to be here as the Minister with responsibility for mental health and take on my responsibilities in respect of a number of the issues the committee has been discussing, and will discuss, very seriously.  I look forward to having an ongoing engagement with the committee.  <\/p><p> This Government is committed to developing our mental health services.  I think that commitment is well documented.  It predates this Government, the last Government and the Government before.  In general, this country, regardless of who is in government, wishes to do all it can to develop our mental health services.  Since 2012, we have seen significant increases to the HSE's mental health budget.  I refer to an increase of over &euro;200 million or about 28%, with further increases that I have already pre-committed to in a letter to Mental Health Reform.  It was also sent to the director general of the HSE.  <\/p><p> I have been conscious, from watching coverage of some of the committee's meetings and following the transcripts, that from the committee's perspective and mine it is not just about the budget.  The budget is terribly important and it important we continue to invest.  However, it is also about how we best use the budget to achieve the best outcomes in developing the services we have.  As part of our considerations in this respect, as the committee knows and is familiar with, we are working on developing a successor policy to a \"Vision for Change\".  <\/p><p> An oversight group has been established to look at where we are now in our mental health services in Ireland, where we want to be and, most important, how we get there.  The oversight group will provide us with a blueprint for the provision of mental health services in the future.  The group is currently finalising its work plan.  This will outline its objectives and the work completed to date.  I expect the chair of the oversight group will shortly be in a position to share the group&rsquo;s work plan with the committee.  I welcome the committee's engagement on this.  I know the committee is looking forward to this body of work.   <\/p><p> The text of the general scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act is currently being prepared in my Department.  This Bill is a comprehensive revision of our existing legislation and I know that Oireachtas members have a particular interest in improving legislation in this area.  If I was ever in any doubt about that, I think the number of Private Members' Bills we have seen in recent months has signified that.  We are in the process of addressing four Private Members&rsquo; Bills which will propose more immediate changes to the Mental Health Act covering areas such as consent to admission; replacing \"best interests\" with new guiding principles; introducing safeguards regarding admissions of children to adult units, an issue the Chair has been working on; ensuring mental health has equal parity with physical health; and, ensuring that advance health care directives apply to persons detained under mental health legislation.   <\/p><p> Much work has also been done in the critical areas of suicide reduction and youth mental health.  The implementation plan of the national suicide reduction strategy, &ldquo;Connecting For Life&rdquo;, has now been published.  The strategy will be implemented on a cross-sectoral basis.  The cross-sectoral aspect is important.  I hope this will help to decrease further suicide rates in this country.  The report of the national task force on youth mental health was launched by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health with special responsibility for Mental Health and Older People, Deputy Jim Daly, and myself last December.  Many of its recommended actions have been incorporated into existing service agreements with various Departments, the HSE and Tusla.   <\/p><p> Other actions will be driven by a new interdepartmental initiative currently under consideration, called the youth mental health pathfinder project.  The pathfinder project aims for effective collaboration across three Departments in the area of youth mental health.  These are the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Education and Skills and my own Department of Health.  While the importance of planning cannot be overstated, it is equally important we now work to address any existing gaps between mental health services demand and supply.  We are all aware that is a real situation.  We are also aware it is a situation not equal in its existence across the country.  It is more of an acute problem in some areas than others.  It is important, as we plan, to look at how do we address those existing gaps.  <\/p><p> With this in mind, we have taken a number of steps to increase the supply of services across the country.  We have provided funding to increase the annual number of psychiatric nurse undergraduates by 130.  In addition, we have introduced an assistant psychologist grade in primary care and have provided funding for 114 posts and an extra 20 psychologists.   This can be a significant positive development for our community mental health services.  <\/p><p> If this works properly, and if we make sure the posts are allocated to the areas most in need and on the basis of need, what we can see is these posts working hand in hand to try to relieve pressure on our child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, while ensuring quicker access to services for those with mental health issues.  If we can have a situation where this new grade can deal with some cases that perhaps are lower complexity or acuity, it can free up more capacity within our CAMHS services to try to drive down our waiting times there as well.  <\/p><p> I will also make a point the committee will be familiar with from engagement with the HSE and the chief officers from across the country.  There is a particular challenge with recruitment and retention at the moment.  It is an issue I have discussed with many people here in different fora over recent months.  We have a number of funded posts within our mental health services that we have not been able to fill.  <\/p><p> I have outlined some of the measures we are taking to address this issue, including the additional psychiatric nurse undergraduate posts and the new assistant psychologist grade.  However, there is also a body of work being done by the Public Service Pay Commission.  I think that is important.  It came up with an analysis of public sector pay that led to the public service stability agreement.  There was a view within the Government that there are some sectors of the public service where there are particular challenges in recruiting and retaining staff.  They are not generic right across the public service.  <\/p><p> Health was, thankfully, one of those areas where Government recognised a particular challenge.  I and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, asked Government to approve a phase two of that commission to look specifically at health recruitment and retention.  I refer to how we recruit in the first place and, more important, retain staff in the Irish health service.  That is due to report in June of this year with recommendations and what I hope will be a roadmap in respect of what more can we do to help recruit and retain our staff.  That will be a significant piece of work.  I look forward, either now or on the next occasion, to any questions the committee may have.  I assure the Chair and the committee that in terms of any information needed, attendance from my officials, or anything we can do to collaborate, I am keen to make sure that happens.  If on any occasion it is not happening please do let me know directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018022800002#B00800","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519824600,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I do appreciate that.

At the beginning of our remit here as a committee we were confused about what we were supposed to be doing.<\/p> <p>  There seemed to be an incredible overlap between us and the oversight group.  One of the things that probably comes to all of our minds is that the oversight group is now eight months old.  There still is not a work plan.  We have been asking for that.  It is taking a long time for that plan to come in.  We are also not quite sure what the Minister thinks we are.  We know ourselves what we are and we really want to support the Minister.  One aspect in which we can support him is in looking at accountability and by looking at the questions the Minister may not be able to ask.  That is what this committee has to offer, as well as dedicated members who want to make things happen in mental health services.

I am encouraged by the way the committee has carried out its work to date because I happened to see some of the meeting where the chief officers were in from the HSE.  All too often as politicians we just look at the resourcing issue, and that is not to excuse myself from the resourcing area.

My specialist training took place in the NHS in London and I currently work in the HSE as a consultant obstetrician, as well as being the medical director of a large IVF unit.  I am here today to represent the interests of the patients I care for.  As president of the Irish Fertility Society, I have contributed to the submission to the joint committee made by the society and the majority of the views I will express today are shared by the majority of its members.  I am very concerned that some elements of the Children and Family Relationships Act, although not implemented, and of the legislation which is now before the joint committee are insensitive to our patients&rsquo; needs and unreasonably coercive.  I want to thank the committee for the opportunity to present my views today.  I cannot overemphasise the vital role the committee plays if legislation is to result which is fit for purpose.  A list of more specific technical issues is included in my opening statement but I do not have time to dwell on those now.  However, I would be very happy to answer questions about them afterwards.  I will only address key issues now.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the issue of statutory legislation versus practice guidelines, many clinical issues such as the number of embryos which can be transferred at a time in IVF treatment should be the subject of practice guidelines and not of statutory legislation, which is too inflexible.  The guidelines involved are going to be formulated by the new regulatory authority, the assisted human reproduction regulatory authority, HPRA, which the draft legislation has proposed.  This means that the composition of this new authority is important and it is important to consider how the functions of this new authority will overlap with the functions of the Health Products Regulatory Authority.  The joint committee needs to understand that all IVF units in this country are already strictly regulated, licensed and inspected by the Health Products Regulatory Authority and it implements the EU tissues and cells directives.  All the processes that take place in our IVF units and any adverse reactions that occur after treatment must be reported.  Control is already very strict.  <\/p> <p>  After a decade of activity, the HPRA has accumulated valuable practical experience with regard to inspecting IVF units.  It is vital that the functions currently carried out by the Health Products Regulatory Authority are not duplicated by the new authority.  Unnecessary duplication will generate unnecessary costs which are likely to be passed on to our patients and to the taxpayer.  It is important that the new regulatory authority be effective and in order to be effective the exact composition of its 11 strong board members is vital.  I would urge the joint committee to scrutinise carefully both the specifications for board membership and the manner in which people are appointed to that board.<\/p> <p>  The joint committee needs to know that assisted reproduction has become extremely commercialised and to understand that IVF treatment, even at the best of times, is expensive and often is not successful.  Patients deserve safeguards which promote success and which protect against financial exploitation.  An additional specific function of this new regulatory body which I have suggested is regulations to safeguard patients against financial exploitation and I am happy to dwell further on that issue afterwards.<\/p> <p>  With regard to restrictive human reproduction legislation and conscientious objection, in general in northern and western Europe the legislation concerning assisted reproduction has been restrictive, particularly with regard to financial compensation of egg and sperm donors and of surrogates and also with regard to anonymity versus identifiability of donors.<\/p><p>The committee should be aware that every year hundreds of thousands of European citizens travel to other jurisdictions in Europe and beyond to escape restrictions in their own countries.  This huge amount of reproductive tourism exemplifies the fact that mechanisms to regulate assisted reproduction in Europe are failing citizens.  The draft legislation before the committee, although in the main progressive, is restrictive with regard to egg and sperm donation and surrogacy.  The danger is we may slavishly imitate mechanisms of controlling assisted reproduction that have already proved a failure in other jurisdictions.  Unduly restrictive legislation will give rise to ethical dilemmas on my part and on the part of colleagues in assisted reproduction in Ireland because we may have conscientious objections to unreasonable restrictions on our patients' reproductive rights.  Clinicians insist on our rights to such conscientious objections. <\/p><p> This brings us to Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act.  Outsiders might wonder why two Acts are necessary to control assisted reproduction in Ireland.  I am happy to go into the details of the history of how this came about.  In retrospect, Parts 2 and 3 of the legislation are regrettable and only came about as a result of a lack of appropriate oversight in the Department of Justice and Equality.  The legislation sets out to totally ban anonymous gamete donation in Ireland, to ban the payment of any sort of financial compensation to donors and to give the State the right to intervene and inform 18-year-old children who are the product of gamete donation that they were donor-conceived and to give them identifying details of the donor concerned even though it may be against the wishes of the parents involved.  To me and my colleagues who think as I do, it is an unacceptable degree of coercion and is unconstitutional.  I will not be able to comply with these stipulations on conscientious grounds.<\/p><p> Together with my colleagues in the Irish Fertility Society, including Jenny Cloherty who is sitting in the room today, we have the following view about how donor sperm and donor egg treatment should take place in this country.  We feel that donor egg and donor sperm treatment are good things.  They allow couples who would otherwise never have been able to enjoy the fulfilment of family life to have children and, as they are good things, we need to facilitate the process.  We feel that in order to do so some degree of slight financial compensation is allowable and ethically justifiable for the donors concerned.  We feel that gamete donation should be identifiable or anonymous; we feel that both are ethically acceptable.  We support identifiable donation but we also think that people have the right to anonymous donation.  It should be left up to the people concerned, the donors and recipients, to decide which form they want and which is appropriate for them.  <\/p><p> We feel the parents of donor-conceived children should be very strongly urged to tell the children concerned as they grow up that they were donor conceived but we do not think it is the function or duty of the State to intervene and give the children involved that information.  We certainly do not think it is the role of the State to forcibly intrude into the private family lives of citizens and to tell donor-conceived patients about the identifying details of donors against the wishes of the parents involved.  We feel it is going too far.  We strongly urge the committee to consider Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act and suggest they are replaced by more acceptable and workable legislation.  <\/p><p> I urge the Joint Committee on Health to devise mechanisms for bringing the opposite sides of the coin together in this legislation.  It should bring together representatives of the Department of Health, who drafted the legislation, and representatives of the IFS and the IOG, which Dr. Wingfield represents, so we have a coming together of the people who formulated the legislation and of the people who must apply it and who represent the patients whose lives would be impacted by the legislation.  We urge the committee to take its time because it needs due consideration.  The committee needs to ensure the issues concerned are given the consideration they deserve in order to bring about a better future for parents, families and children.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Waterstone","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519808400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I am delighted and honoured to have this opportunity-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Wingfield"},{"type":"speech","time":1519808400,"counter":49,"content":"<p>There is mobile phone interference.

I am a consultant in Holles Street hospital and the clinical director of Merrion Fertility Clinic, which is affiliated to Holles Street hospital.  I was a member of the commission on assisted human reproduction, which produced its report in 2005, and I am delighted to see that except for the proposals on parenthood in surrogacy the draft Bill accords with the recommendations of the commission.<br\/><br\/>Before I talk about specifics of the proposed Bill, I will mention some important issues related to infertility and assisted human reproduction.  The first thing I want to say is that the experience of infertility is one of the most distressing and painful experiences one can have.  People who have not been through it often do not appreciate it and can be relatively unsympathetic.  <br\/><br\/>For many years now, infertility has been recognised by the World Health Organization and other medical bodies as a medical condition.  Assisted human reproduction is a medical treatment.  It is not an optional luxury.  IVF is probably one of the greatest medical advances of our time.  Sadly, however, assisted human reproduction is an area of medicine that has become extremely commercialised, partly due to the lack of public funding in countries such as Ireland and partly due to the involvement of multinational commercial companies in the area.  Merrion Fertility Clinic, where I work, is the only not-for-profit fertility clinic in Ireland and the only one linked to a public teaching hospital.  We definitely need more public engagement in this area.  People with infertility are often desperate to have a child and this makes them very vulnerable.  They are vulnerable to financial exploitation, to spurious treatments with no proven value and they are vulnerable in our courts.  For all of these reasons we need legislation. <br\/><br\/>The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has made a submission to the Joint Committee on Health regarding the Bill.  I chaired the working group, which prepared the institute document and I have authority to present that opinion, which mirrors my own.  I have also submitted the institute's submission to the committee.  <br\/><br\/>It is impossible in five minutes to cover everything in the Bill but I will outline some of the key issues that concern us.  Assisted human reproduction is one of the most rapidly evolving areas of medicine and science so it is important that any legislation we introduce is not overly prescriptive and that it does not prevent future adaptation to new medical developments, which are happening all the time in this area.  Particularly in the context of the forthcoming referendum on the eighth amendment, it is important that assisted human reproduction treatments are not confused with those of early pregnancy.  Assisted human reproduction concerns only the <i>in vitro<\/i>or pre-implantation embryo to which Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution does not apply.  <br\/><br\/>We all agree it is essential to avoid multiple pregnancies following assisted human reproduction treatments.  However, the recommendations in the Bill regarding the number of embryos to transfer are not entirely appropriate and we would like to discuss it further.  It is suggested that a person can donate gametes - that is, eggs or sperm - at the age of 18 but cannot receive treatment until the age of 21.  We recommend that those ages are reversed.  <br\/><br\/>We are delighted to see that posthumous assisted reproduction is being legislated for.  The proposal, however, allows this only for women and we feel it is discriminatory to men.  A surviving male partner should be allowed to use his deceased female partner&rsquo;s eggs or their joint embryos, if she consented to this prior to her death.  <br\/><br\/>Counselling is an essential part of assisted human reproduction treatment and must be encouraged.  However, in line with international opinion we do not agree it should be mandatory for everybody having AHR treatment.  It should only be mandatory in cases of donor-assisted conception, posthumous assisted reproduction or surrogacy or where health care staff have particular concerns about a patient&rsquo;s emotional well-being.<\/p><p>We agree that a pre-implantation genetic diagnosis should be allowed.  Pre-implantation genetic screening should also be included and, while it is a very new technique, mitochondrial donation should not be banned.<\/p><p> With regard to surrogacy, it is clear to us that the restrictive provisions proposed would mean that the demand for surrogacy by Irish citizens would not be met by domestic surrogacy.  Irish patients will continue to travel overseas and bring their children home to Ireland.  The legal position of these children and their intended parents is not addressed in the Bill.  We believe it should be.  A worrying suggestion made in the Bill is that professionals not be allowed to aid people in planning surrogacy abroad.  I would certainly find it unethical as a doctor not to be able to help my patients in that regard and suspect counsellors and lawyers would feel in a similar way.  Regarding the legal parenthood of children born after surrogacy, we support the recommendation of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction that the intended parents, rather than the birth mother, be the legal parents from the outset.  We also make other suggestions to protect the health and legal status of the surrogate.<\/p><p> Regarding donor conception and surrogacy, I personally wholeheartedly support the view that a donor conceived person has a right to know his or her biological parent.  However, with regard to the proposed national surrogacy register and the donor conception register under the Children and Family Relationships Act, we are totally opposed to the notion that a donor-conceived person who applies for a birth certificate would be told by the State that he or she was donor conceived without ever seeking that information.  We believe that would be irresponsible, dangerous and a gross invasion of privacy.  It is important that donor conception and surrogacy services be provided altruistically and non-commercially.  However, if we want them to be available in Ireland, as we do, we need to look at ethical ways of encouraging the practice.<\/p><p> I will stop there, but in the institute's document there are other suggestions relating to age limits for treatment, storage limits for gametes and embryos, consent procedures and the proposed regulatory authority.  My colleagues and I in the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists hope we can have an input into the final Bill, as we are the doctors most intimately connected with this issue and who will need to deliver the services to be provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Wingfield","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519808400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Wingfield.

I was called into the clinic this morning and it was not until the eleventh hour that I realised I would be able to make it here.  I certainly do not mean any disrespect.  <\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to talk to it about something that I think is critically important to us and our patients.  I am the medical director of the Rotunda Hospital IVF unit, the National Fertility Centre.  I am also the medical director of Sims IVF in Clonskeagh and Cork.  Between the three clinics, we probably account for over 2,000 IVF cycles per annum in Ireland, which is not quite half but as close to it as to make no odds.  The statement I will make is not just my own work but that of the medical teams at the three clinics, the embryologists, compliance specialists and nurses, all of whom had a great input in determining what we thought of the proposed legislation.  I echo the sentiments of my colleagues who have already spoken to the committee that we very much welcome the introduction of the legislation, but there are a number of points which cause us to pause and cause us concern.  We would like to have an input in perhaps changing them as time passes.<\/p> <p>  I have submitted a document on this issue, but there are specific concerns that I would like to address, many of which arise under head 6 of the draft Bill and which mainly concern the age at which we can treat patients.  There seems to be a minimum age of 21 years and a maximum age of 47.  They appear to us to be very arbitrary figures.  The legal age of consent and at which one has voting rights in Ireland is 18 years, the time at which he or she becomes an adult.  I struggle to think of any other circumstance or event in which one cannot partake between the ages of 18 and 21 years.  Fertility treatment is uncommon between the ages of 18 and 21 years, but it is not unheard of.  There are associated medical conditions which preclude somebody of that age from conceiving spontaneously and which necessitate the use of assisted human reproduction if she wants to have a child.  The upper limit of 47 years is also heavily prescriptive.  We have audited our practice in the past five years.  Not many patients over the age of 47 years come in for treatment, but there are a few.  We counted approximately 160, of whom over half had a successful treatment.  Over 80 children have been born in the past few years who would not have been born had this legislation been passed.<\/p> <p>  We have concerns about the restrictions on male patients.  While there is no age range, in particular, it is stated in the proposed legislation that to proceed with assisted human reproductive technology the man must reasonably be expected to survive until the child reaches adulthood.  This would have a major impact on many people, especially our oncology patients whom we look after in the Rotunda Hospital, who come with a cancer diagnosis and where the timelines for their survival are very much in doubt.  <\/p> <p>  I echo the concerns of Dr. Wingfield about counselling being non-mandatory and of Dr. Waterstone about the requirements in respect of single embryo transfer.  It is something to which the field is moving and that we most commonly do and that we believe should be down to practice guidelines, not the focus of legislation.  There does not appear to be any provision in the legislation on double donation - the use of donor eggs and donor sperm.  There is provision for the use of surplus embryos, created in other cycles, but it is prescriptive.  We have same-sex couples where a donor egg is required and in respect of whom there may also be a need for donor sperm.  Iit looks like these patients will have to travel abroad for treatment as they have done in the past.  We would, therefore, like to see proposals introduced to allow for double donation.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the limitations on the storage of embryos but wonder if they will be applied retrospectively to embryos already created.  Will there be a five-year storage limit?  How will it apply to oncology or younger patients where five years may not be a relevant timeline?<\/p> <p>  I share and echo Dr. Wingfield's concerns about the surrogacy portion of the Bill.  It appears to us that patients will travel to avail of surrogacy and that we may be liable for fines or face criminal action if we advise or help patients in that regard.  Furthermore, if we treat patients and there are surplus embryos frozen, will we be permitted to release them to the care of patients to do with them as they will, even if it involves travelling to avail of surrogacy?<\/p> <p>  There are other provisions which I hope to address during the question and answer session.  We welcome the formation of the assisted human reproduction regulatory authority, but I share Dr. Waterstone's concerns about how it will be made up, who will be on it and how they will be chosen.  My other concern is the cost that may be incurred by the patient.  In the United Kingdom the maintenance of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, the equivalent UK authority, is funded by an additional charge on every single cycle.  Is this the proposed mechanism to fund the new organisation, as it would put further financial strain on an already difficult process for patients?  <\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for its time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Kennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1519808400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Kennedy.

As the assessment of the general scheme of the assisted human reproduction Bill is ongoing, we want to engage with those who have a professional opinion, but there are also varying views on the issue.  In that context, Dr. Wingfield who sat on the commission says she is, by and large, happy with what is proposed in the general scheme of the Bill because it includes all of the recommendations of the commission.  Of what expertise did it avail in assessing what it considered was appropriate?  Did it look at the position and legislative imprint in other jurisdictions in assessing what should be done here?<\/p><p>Did the commission make comparisons with Europe and elsewhere regarding the regulation of AHR?  The reason I ask that is there are varying views on AHR.  The US has a liberal, commercialised regime whereas the UK and other European countries have adopted restrictive practices.  Within Europe, there is a disparity in legislative underpinning and regulation.  Will Ms Wingfield elaborate on the commission's research, recommendations and findings?<\/p><p> The broader issue of surrogacy has been mentioned a lot and the fact that people have to travel abroad.  Is that because there are not sufficient surrogates available in this country or is there another reason for that?  Is there potential for the exploitation of surrogacy by using women from poor countries?  What are the ethical, moral and clinical guidelines to make sure surrogates are observed, have medical support and so on?  Given the scheme of the Bill recommends no form of compensation should be made available to surrogates, how does that fit with the requirement to have surrogates for this purpose and to ensure they have resources available to them to look after their own needs, health care and so on?<\/p><p> The issue of financial exploitation is another concern.  People go to extraordinary lengths to find alternative medicines to survive if they are diagnosed with a terminal illness and they also to go to extraordinary lengths to conceive or to have a baby.  Is the current legislation strong enough or should other provisions be included in same to ensure there is no exploitation through the commercialisation of the fertility industry not only in Ireland but globally?  Should we depend on the ethical and moral standards of the clinicians involved or do we need to ensure they are strengthened?<\/p><p> Consanguinity is an issue that is raised sometimes, primarily by people opposed to IVF and AHR, given the potential for sexual relationships with brothers, half brothers, sisters and all that flows from that due to the anonymous nature of the treatment.  Is that issue being raised to a level that is unnecessary in this debate or should we be conscious of it in view of that fact that there are varying views on it?<\/p><p> The age profile or limit is 21 to 47.  Are the witnesses saying there should be no upper age limit for women, in particular?  What should the age be if that is the case?  At some stage, women can no longer conceive naturally.  Where is the boundary in this regard?  Recently, a woman in Italy who was approaching her 70s was impregnated and had a child.  Is there a medical cut-off point at which it becomes dangerous for both the baby and the woman carrying the baby?  In the age of surrogacy, what age limits should be applied in that context?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#E00500","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519808400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions and for the work they are doing in this complex area.  Deputy Kelleher has put many of the questions I wanted to ask, but I would like to address the issue of people travelling abroad.  How many people travel abroad for IVF treatment, surrogacy and egg donation?  Is there any way to establish the figures?  One of the complaints that is made relates to the cost of treatment in Ireland compared to other jurisdictions.  Why is the cost higher here compared to other EU member states?  What are the figures for the number of people travelling to EU member states and outside the EU?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Waterstone said the legislation may be overly restrictive.  Is there a particular jurisdiction we should examine where he believes that the correct structure is in place, which we should try to follow?  I do not just refer to Europe; it could be Australia, New Zealand, Canada and so on.  Are there countries we should consider that we have not examined previously to put in place a comprehensive system that is not overly restrictive but, at the same time, has the necessary structures to deal with this complex issue?<\/p> <p>  I presume all clinics provide counselling where it is deemed appropriate.  Some people say it should be mandatory but the witnesses said this should be at the discretion of those managing the patient.  Should that remain the position?

Is the current legislation sufficient to deal with it or is it overly restrictive as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#F00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519808400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>There is a great deal to get through.  With regard to age, which is a subject close to my heart, of course there should be age limitations and nobody disputes that.  The average age of the menopause is 50.8 and that is a natural barrier.  The chance of conceiving spontaneously as a woman approaches her late 40s is low and the risk of miscarriage is high.  Advances in medical technology, specifically with regard to donor eggs, have overcome these limitations and, therefore, it is possible for women to conceive as they get older, but medical risks are associated with that.  Our clinic has an age cut-off of 50.  It is self-imposed and we adhere closely to it.  If somebody is in or around that age or if they have embryos created and they are looking to use them but they have passed the age of 50, we involve a multidisciplinary team.  We get the input of obstetricians in a pre-pregnancy phase to assess the risk and deem whether the patient is suitable.  One of the issues is we do not have much data on women pregnant in their 50s.  The numbers are low and we do not know what the risks of high blood pressure or pre-eclampsia are but we certainly think they increase.  There should, therefore, be age restrictions.  The UK, for example, has an age restriction of 50 but it is 55 for oncology patients.  We would be comfortable with that in our organisation but 47 is arbitrary.  At the other end of the age profile, the number of patients seeking treatment aged between 18 and 21 is low but it is not zero.  One would not want to tell a woman who is 19 or 20 years old, who wants to conceive and has gone through appropriate testing and counselling but who is unable to conceive spontaneously, that she should wait for no reason when she could conceive spontaneously if she did not have an underlying medical condition.<\/p> <p>  Counselling is available and encouraged.  There are certain instances where it is mandatory.  For example, when somebody is using donor egg or donor sperm, we require them to attend at least one session.  That is called implications counselling.  It is about information gathering as well as exploring some of the issues that we want patients to consider.<\/p><p> Therapeutic counselling, which is counselling after a negative outcome with fertility treatment or beforehand if we feel the patient is struggling, is something we encourage and that is available for our patients.  In one of the clinics in the past, counselling was a mandatory requirement for a number of years and the feedback we got from a significant number of patients was that they did not believe it was either necessary or helpful.  Many patients did find it helpful, but we found that the patients who self directed counselling got more from it than the patients who were forced into doing it.  It is something we encourage and make available, but is not something I believe should be a requirement.<\/p><p> With regards to surrogacy, nothing is being done in Ireland.  If someone wants to avail of surrogacy, they have to go abroad.  They have to go to the United States or Canada, where they will be looking at paying upwards of &euro;100,000 for treatment, to eastern Europe, where they may pay approximately &euro;40,000 for treatment, or to India, where there is a great deal of exploitation, and nobody is in favour of that.  The problem with this legislation is that it does not govern those patients except to say they cannot do it.  However, patients are still going to do it because it will be virtually impossible for couples in Ireland to avail of surrogacy.  As it is not advertised and is non-commercial, they need to have a close family member who is willing to give up nine months of their life for nothing in return.  It is not feasible.  It is also not feasible for certain other subsets like homosexual couples.  They will require surrogacy to have a family.  Unless a close family member or somebody else volunteers, that will not be a viable option for them.<\/p><p> The notion that we cannot facilitate, test, treat or advise those patients is ridiculous.  It will not work in practice.  These are patients who are coming to us.  The women who require surrogacy generally have been through an incredibly tough time.  Invariably, they have had a number of failed cycles and there are major issues which can only be overcome with surrogacy.  We would ask that something be put in place to help facilitate care for these women.  We are not allowed pay surrogates.  If that is the decision of the legislative body, that is fine, but we cannot advertise so we cannot even try to recruit surrogates.  I have absolutely no doubt that there is a shortfall of available surrogacy in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519808400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>What about the clinical oversight of the surrogate?

I believe couples who avail of surrogacy and women who are used as surrogates in Ireland enjoy a very high standard of care.  I believe the complication rate will be low comparative to international figures and that they will be very well looked after.

The first comment I would make is that the commission reported in 2005, which is 13 years ago, and so much has changed in assisted human reproduction in that time medically and also legally.  There have been some High Court cases and a Supreme Court verdict on matters to do with assisted human reproduction.  One issue that exercised the commission was the status of the embryo, and that has been clarified in legislation.  That just emphasises the way the area is changing so quickly and how important it is that whatever legislation we put in place is not over detailed because in terms of issues we have been discussing such as the age limits for treatment, medicine is moving on.  Ten years ago, nobody would have countenanced a 47 year old woman being pregnant whereas now, not just in assisted human reproduction but in medicine generally, it is much safer for people to conceive in later life.  In the past, we would not have conceived of people with cystic fibrosis getting pregnant.  Now, in certain circumstances, they do.  This legislation has to be flexible so that it can be adapted as time goes on.  We do not want to have to come back here every year or second year looking to change legislation.  That is just wasteful of everybody's resources.<\/p> <p>  There was a wide range of expertise on the commission - medical and nursing, science, genetics, legal ethicists - and we consulted with people internationally.  Experts from Italy were invited.  Since that time, Italy has had to change its laws because some of its laws at the time were deemed to be against the European Court of Human Rights human rights legislation.  That again shows that it is a very complex area, and the legislation needs to be very carefully thought out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Wingfield"},{"type":"speech","time":1519808400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Do we need another commission at this stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#G00600","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519808400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>We cannot afford another 13 years-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Wingfield"},{"type":"speech","time":1519808400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>We cannot afford to act on an issue that is 13 years old?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#G00800","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519808400,"counter":67,"content":"<p>The commission met for three years and cost a great deal of money.  It produced an excellent report but it was then left on the shelf.  That is a total waste of taxpayers' money and all our time.  This matter needs to be carefully debated.  On the other hand, those of us working in the field believe that Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 were rushed through because of the same sex referendum.  There was a need to clarify legislation for that and they were rushed through.  We certainly believe that the aspects concerning donor conception were not debated sufficiently.  We would like there to be a debate, but it cannot continue forever.<br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health have also committed to introducing public funding for <i>in vitro <\/i>fertilisation, IVF, treatment.  We desperately need that, but they have made it contingent on dealing with the legislation first and setting up the regulatory authority.  That is another reason we need to move on this, and it needs to be done in the next year or so.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the matter of financial exploitation, in terms of the provision of IVF treatment outside Ireland, if we consider other countries similar to Ireland such as the Scandinavian countries, Belgium, Holland, France and Germany, IVF treatment is not cheaper in those countries or the United Kingdom compared to Ireland.  It is cheaper in other southern eastern European countries and many people are travelling abroad to access that.  Many of those couples come back with multiple pregnancies and most of the high risk multiple pregnancies related to assisted human reproduction that we see in Holles Street and the other big maternity hospitals in this country tend to be related to couples having donor egg treatment abroad with multiple embryos transferred.  If we introduced public funding in Ireland, it would help many of the people who cannot afford treatment here to have their treatment here and would reduce some of that reproductive tourism for financial reasons.  I believe they would be getting a better service.  It is a stressful treatment and to have to travel to another country where they do not have the support of their family or friends around them while they are having treatment is not easy.<br\/><br\/>Mention was made of consanguinity and anonymity.  Over the years, Irish embryologists have been very responsible in that regard.  Ms Jenny Cloherty is a member of them.  They have self regulated for donor sperm treatment in Ireland and have monitored among themselves the number of families that were created from any one sperm donor.  There are proposals in the legislation to limit that.  For treatments occurring in regulated clinics it will not be a problem, but we cannot control people travelling overseas, particularly for donor egg treatment, and it would be very difficult to get any numbers on that.<br\/><br\/>We spoke about the upper age limits.  I do not know that the actual ages should be specified in the legislation because that is one of the detailed items that could come back to haunt us in a year or two and we would have to come back and change the legislation.  We would prefer to see that implemented by the regulatory authority.<br\/><br\/>As regards surrogacy, we in the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists felt that the Bill proposes that surrogates should be allowed do surrogacy up to the age of 47.  We believe there should be a younger age limit for surrogates because they are carrying the pregnancy altruistically and they will not have a child at the end of it.  There are increased risks in pregnancy over the age of 40, which couples and women are willing to take on if they get a baby from it.<\/p><p>As the surrogate would not have a baby from it, we felt the upper age limit for surrogacy should be 40 years.<\/p><p> Senator Colm Burke asked if any jurisdiction had the correct structure.  I attended a meeting last week with the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology at the Council of Europe which discussed legislation in place around Europe.  It is safe to say no jurisdiction has ideal legislation.  Many of the countries that introduced legislation in the past ten years have had to change it and there are many parliaments looking at assisted human reproduction legislation.  If we have a debate and were to take on board most of the comments made in the document of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, we could lead the way by having some of the best legislation in Europe.  We are all very aware of the position in different countries.  One of the advantages of the process having taken so long in Ireland is that we can benefit from the experience of other countries.  For example, in the United Kingdom any payment for an egg or a sperm donation was banned, but it has subsequently had to row back on this provision.  A small amount of compensation is now paid to people who donate eggs and sperm.  It is not something from which somebody could make a living.  This issue was discussed at the meeting of the Council of Europe and there is a very strong opinion that a person can be altruistic and also receive financial compensation, not just to cover expenses such as the bus fare to the clinic but also for the inconvenience of donating eggs.  To donate eggs, a woman has to go through the equivalent of the first part of an IVF procedure.  She has injections and scans and sees the side-effects of treatment.  There is egg collection which, although safe, is still a surgical procedure which brings a risk of complications.  The United Kingdom has rowed back on its original legislation and had to introduce a small payment.  At last week's meeting when the comment was made that somebody could be altruistic and compensated, the example of doctors was given.  They do their work primarily as an altruistic act, but they are paid for doing it and we do not think there is anything wrong with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Wingfield","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519808400,"counter":69,"content":"<p>It is the same with politicians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#H00200","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519808400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Exactly.  If a woman is willing to be a surrogate to help another person have a child - a really good act - or to donate some of her eggs, bringing a risk to her, or if a man is willing to donate sperm to help others, it is only fair that they should receive some compensation.  However, we must ensure it will not be like what happens in some countries such as India and others in Africa where people are exploited and the companies running the surrogacy service get the money.  In these places the surrogate receives very little money.  We can do it ethically if we discuss the issue properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Wingfield"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519808400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Most of the matters have been addressed by colleagues, but there are a couple to which I would like to speak.  We have not really delved into the financial exploitation of patients everywhere, including in Ireland, who undergo assisted reproduction treatment.  It might be worthwhile pointing out to members of the committee what we are talking about.  The problem is we do not currently have controls in Ireland for the successful outcome of treatments available to couples; therefore, it is very hard for couples to know which clinics do better and which do worse.  Most clinics in Ireland have reasonably acceptable success rates, but some do not.  However, the general public does not know that.  In other jurisdictions - I single out the United Kingdom and the USA, in particular - there are mandatory and transparent reporting systems.  There is pressure on the clinics involved to keep up their success rates.  That is important as otherwise it is hard for patients to know how to avoid clinics that, to be frank, are not doing well enough.  If there are no controls in place, it means that clinics can advertise exaggerated success rates to attract patients under false pretences.  Once patients are in them, it opens the possibility that couples may spend thousands of euro more than they had originally budgeted for because of expensive add-on investigations and treatments which cost a lot of money and make more money for the clinics involved but which do not necessarily improve the chances that the couple will go away with a baby.  These are the matters the joint committee must address.  It is a difficult area to police and recently in the United Kingdom the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority seemed somewhat powerless to speak out against add-on investigations and treatments.  It is, therefore, a matter that must be addressed.  It is not easy, but one of the major problems legislation in Ireland needs to address is financial exploitation.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher wondered about unwitting consanguinity in surrogacy, or the possibility that a half-brother and half-sister could unwittingly have babies together if they are the product of the same gamete donor.  It is a theoretical possibility but I point out the elephant in the room, which in this case would be misattributed paternity.  There are many people out there who conceive quite naturally without assisted reproduction at all and whose daddies are not the men they think they are.  Even conservative estimates indicate that between 2% and 5% of children are in this position because of extra-marital affairs and such.  Already in society, there is the possibility of unwitting consanguinity and it is not just assisted reproduction that can bring about that possibility; there is a far more common situation of unwitting consanguinity for children naturally conceived.  It is a point for the committee to consider.<\/p> <p>  I echo the sentiments of my colleagues on age limits.  The age limit of 47 years is ridiculously low as in the natural course of affairs very occasionally women will conceive naturally up to the age of 48, 49 or 50.  I will not dwell on the issue further.  <\/p> <p>  The legislation proposes a lower age limit of 21 years for donors.  Some of my colleagues have said it should be 18 years.  In my clinic we have a known donor programme or, in other words, the sister or a friend of a woman in a couple can donate.  It is an identifiable form of donation that we promote in our clinic and successful.  It usually is a sister, but we once had a donor who was the 21 year old niece of the patient who wanted to have a baby.  We went ahead and a baby was produced.  There was counselling which is mandatory in this position.  We felt afterwards that it was ethically slightly questionable in that she was too young.  Perhaps 21 years would be a sensible lower age limit to volunteer as an altruistic donor of eggs and not 18.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the upper age limit, the programme to which I refer in my clinic has a fairly generous upper age limit of 37.  We allow the donors, usually sisters, to be as old as 37 years.  We assess them to ensure they would have good prospects to be a donor - they might have good egg numbers and perhaps they might have had children - and if they are, we allow them up to 37 years of age.  The draft legislation indicates that donors can be no older than 35 years.  It would certainly restrict the programme we have in operation and is unreasonable.  It should be at least 37 years, not 35.  That is enough about age limits.<\/p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke asked about international examples of the ideal regulatory system.  In Ireland we should aim to have something between the overly restrictive regulations that are the norm in some European countries and America where it is very open and there is little statutory legislation in place and having more guidelines.  We should aim to end up somewhere in the middle.  As I said in my opening statement, we should not slavishly copy some of the European examples as they are too restrictive.  That hundreds of thousands of Europeans must travel to other countries to avail of reproductive services illustrates the fact that European citizens have been let down by these practices.<\/p><p>We can speak of ethics and bioethics in the area, particularly about donor anonymity and paying donors.  It needs to be evidence based and much of the argument in the past has not been evidence based but more dogma.  I think we need to proceed more with an evidence based model for the ethical standards we propose.<\/p><p> I agree with Professor Mary Wingfield, that the joint committee should understand that we should not feel that the impetus for this assisted reproduction legislation is because we are ashamed that we are the last people in Europe to regulate.  The only point of introducing legislation is that it does good rather than harm.  This is a valuable opportunity as we have the luxury of being able to look at the other countries that have legislated in the past and pick and choose.  There is no reason that we should not punch above our weight as we do in rugby and end up with the best regulatory system in the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Waterstone","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519808400,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Before I bring in some other contributors, will those present remove their phones from close to the microphones because there is interference with the recording of the meeting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#J00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1519808400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Chairman, in respect of the numbers travelling abroad, do the witnesses have any idea of the number who travel abroad?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#J00300","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519808400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>It is difficult to get exact figures on this because many patients who travel do not tell us.

I welcome the recent media coverage on infertility.  I refer to the advertisements on television and I think that raises public awareness of the whole issue.<\/p> <p>  I agree this is a complex issue because medicine is moving fast in this very sensitive area.  I concur with my colleague Deputy Murphy O'Mahony.  I am a GP.  I listened to the contributions on the concept of counselling.  I understand that it is not mandatory with the exception of implication counselling for sperm donors.  Most couples who embark on infertility treatment have had a rough road prior to that and invariably they have attended their GP on multiple occasions.  All of the blood samples would have been sent off initially and the results would be back and the usual investigations would have been carried out.  Personally I think much of that counselling would have already taken place in the primary care setting.  This is an important point to highlight.  Many GPs may not be familiar with or comfortable in this area because one cannot have an expertise in everything, and the primary care setting is the place for this counselling to occur, prior even to a referral for or to a recommendation on infertility.  I would like to hear the views on that.<\/p> <p>  The issues on the ground are the cost of such treatment for couples.  Couples compare fertility clinic services on cost.  They will google for information and then come to the GP and discuss it.<\/p><p>Most clinics cost around the same for a service.  However, we all know the different levels of treatments can be complex be it ovulation induction or intracytoplasmic sperm injection, ICSI.  There is a wide range.  I am often told that when people have embarked on a treatment they feel they are hooked and have to complete that treatment.  There are many hidden costs which concerns me.  I had a patient recently who was informed of a cost but was not informed it was necessary to go to the UK for a test for natural killer cells in the womb.  The travel was a greater cost as was paying the separate clinic for the test.  <\/p><p> There many discrepancies from clinic to clinic.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses.  Can we regulate this more stringently?  The other thing Dr. Waterstone alluded to, and I agree, was reporting systems and rates of success.  It is a moveable feast.  We can all have great success rates if we limit the couples we take on to simple cases.  We need to have some kind of regulation.  <\/p><p> I refer also to the reproductive tourism sector and couples going to eastern European countries, especially for donor eggs and the implanting of multiple embryos.  I know it is outside our jurisdiction and impossible for us to regulate.  However, inevitably our obstetrical system is going to deal with any outcome, fallout or complications from that.  That is not proper.  The medical staff here might be dealing with a multiple pregnancy and the mother's life could be at risk or that of the babies.  We need to have some kind of control on that issue.  <\/p><p> There is also a great deal of discrepancy in the cost of storing embryos.  While the costs generally for the treatments may equate from clinic to clinic, I heard recently there is a big discrepancy in the cost of the storage of embryos.  I am not sure if that is correct and I would like the opinion of the witnesses. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#J01400","speaker":"1373","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519808400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>With regard to the posthumous use of gametes, there is a provision in the proposed legislation that people would have to wait a year after their partner had died before they could use those embryos.  That, in conjunction with an age restriction of 47, seems ridiculous.  I have had women come through whose partners have passed away.  Most would have waited over a year because that is what happened organically.  I have had one who has not.  She went through counselling.  The counsellor, myself and the team deemed she was fit for treatment and she went on to have treatment.  I thought it was a good thing.  One year seems arbitrary to me.<\/p> <p>  A couple of the questions referred to how we curb the worst excesses.  It is simple: provide the care here in Ireland in an affordable way.  Publicly fund IVF.  Make donor eggs available, in a cheaper sense, in Ireland, both anonymous and open.  Then we will stop people travelling.  People are travelling because of costs and availability.  It is not purely about cost.  People are travelling because they want to avail of anonymous egg donation or they want to do it in a cheaper fashion.  Many of the eastern European clinics are going to be persistently cheaper.  There may be some diminution in terms of quality and care.  There is certainly not anything at all like the follow up that Irish clinics have.  The European clinic does the treatment.  Then the patient goes back to her own country and never the twain shall meet again.  <\/p> <p>  If we want to curb the worst excesses of travel and people shopping around, provide it here.  We know most European countries have some degree of publicly-funded IVF and AHR programmes.  Israel is the example that springs to mind.  There is free IVF for everybody up to the age of 45 or until a woman has two children, after which seven free cycles are provided.  That is very idealistic.  However, it shows the differing priorities.  We need some form of publicly-funded IVF.  <\/p> <p>  Another question was on costs and add-ons.  Publicly funding IVF would go a long way to curbing that as well.  I think publication of success rates for all of the clinics is a great idea and that is something the AHRRA will be able to do.  It will designate the parameters by which success rates are published.  It will not be possible to pick a good patient cohort or a good six months.  That is going to be fantastic.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of add-ons, one of the problems is IVF and AHR have become very commercialised.  Most IVF and AHR success rates, in my experience, come down to having a good lab collecting eggs, creating embryos and storing them.  If we have a patient in front of us, 90% to 95% of the success that is possible will be within that framework.  There is a place for a number of add-ons.  Some have a degree of evidence, others less so.  We are looking for the small margins, the small percentage points to try to improve a couple's chance.  <\/p> <p>  In our practice, and I cannot speak for other clinics, I do not believe there is exploitation of couples.  I refer to appropriate counselling, care, attention and explaining the pros and cons, and specifically the limitations and lack of evidence associated with the tests.  Natural killer cells were mentioned.  There is a good theoretical basis they may make an impact.  There is no evidence to suggest they will increase the chances of having a baby.  Patients need to be clearly informed of that.  However, these patients are self funding and the cycles are expensive. Costs are between &euro;5,000 to &euro;6,000 or &euro;7,000 for a cycle of IVF.  If there is an extra test which costs &euro;200, that amount is a demand even if it is only on a theoretical basis that it is going to improve the outcome.  <\/p> <p>  If we publicly fund IVF we will get to take control of that situation.  We get to say we are paying for the treatment and a couple will not get a test.  We can do a side-by-side comparison of the success rates and see if there is any value in the add-ons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Kennedy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519808400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>There was a question about how we avoid the commercialisation of IVF.

It is up to the regulatory authority, when it evolves, carefully to do its best to protect patients.  However, I am afraid commercialisation is here.  We know there is no State funding for IVF treatment in this country <i>per se<\/i>, even though the drugs concerned are funded nationally which is a great advantage for our patients.  The Department of Health undertook a useful exercise, it is out there and can be googled, looking at how IVF is funded worldwide and particularly in Europe.<br\/><br\/>What surprised me looking at many of the other jurisdictions was that there is funding but it is not unlimited.  Most countries that I thought previously had unlimited funding have limitations.  The State pays for a proportion of the treatment but not all of it.  Even in the UK, where I worked for 12 or 13 years, even though there is a good standard of care generally, for fertility it only pays for 40% of the IVFs undertaken.  It does not pay for everybody.  There are strict limitations about the number of treatments couples can have and the age of the couple.  It is restricted to younger people, whose chances of success are better, to try to get better value for the taxpayers' pounds, so it is not unlimited.  However, it would help the least fortunate people in our country economically if we can have some State funding for sure.  It is, however, over-enthusiastic to think that all IVF treatment in Ireland is going to be paid for by the taxpayer.  That is never going to happen realistically, particularly with budgetary restraints.<\/p><p> Deputy Durkan asked about Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act.  I urge the committee to scrutinise them.  The fact that it had occurred at all was due to an oversight in the Department of Justice and Equality.  That is inescapable.  Dr. Wingfield referred to the report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, but that was 15 years ago.  When the commission looked at the advisability of the State informing donor conceived children of the manner of their conception, the advice was that it would be a step too far and that, in fact, it would be against the constitutional rights of citizens.  However, the Department of Justice and Equality did precisely that and went too far.  As far as many of my colleagues in the IFS and I are concerned, this must be challenged.  It is intolerable and has gone too far.  The advice given at the time by the institute, particularly by Dr. Wingfield and others, was that it was going too far, but our warnings were not heeded and the legislation was enacted.  I strongly make the point that it must be replaced by something that is constitutional.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Waterstone","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519808400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Regarding commercialisation in the sector, I agree with Dr. Waterstone that it is unstoppable.  There is big money and big business involved.  It is a problem in every country in the world.  We have private medicine in Ireland, which is fine as the State would not be able to cope if there was no private medicine.  However, the difference between assisted human reproduction and other types of medicine is that one can go public or private in the case of any other medical condition.  One can choose to go private, but the State will also provide a public service.  Many politicians do not realise there is no public IVF or assisted human reproduction service available, even if one has a medical card.  Unless someone can find a charity to help - there is a charity attached to Holles Street Hospital and our clinic; there are some other charities also available - there is no public funding available.  People go into debt, sell their houses, relationships break up or people borrow from their parents and if the treatment does not work, they will have to go back again to their parents with nothing to show for it.  On any ethical basis, there must be some public funding available.  That would help in dealing with the commercialisation.  It would be more similar to the private-public mix in other areas of medicine.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony asked if there would be services available for children born through surrogacy.  Again, it goes back to the Children and Family Relationships Act.  Children born through donor conception often need counselling as they grow older, but it is provided in very few jurisdictions.  There is certainly no provision for it.  That brings us back to the draconian measure contained in the Children and Family Relationships Act whereby somebody who is over 18 years of age, going along happily in his or her life or, perhaps, very vulnerable in his or her life, on applying for a birth certificate is told by a civil servant that there is more information available on him or her and that he or she was donor conceived.  If the person's parents have not told him or her this fact already, he or she has spent his or her life up to that point thinking his or her parents are his or her biological parents.  There is no provision in the Act for counselling for such a person or even for who would give that information.  The person who will be giving it knows nothing about the individual or whether he or she has a psychiatric history or attempted suicide last week.

However, the Bill proposes that nobody have treatment without first seeing a counsellor.  That is very prescriptive.  Counselling is something that must be individualised.  Many receiving fertility treatment find that starting it is a source of huge relief.  They are finally getting to have treatment which is successful for most.  It is often during or after treatment that they require counselling.  There must be some leeway for the doctors and nurses looking after those involved.  Even the embryologist in the laboratory would sometimes discuss things with them.  Last week we carried out a quick survey of our patients in advance of this meeting.  Some 170 people responded to the questionnaire, of whom 80% felt counselling should be offered, while 60% felt it should not be mandatory for everybody going through treatment.  That would be the feeling of most people in Europe and around the world.  In the past one clinic in Ireland insisted on everybody receiving counselling before they underwent treatment and many hated it.  It was really a box ticking exercise.  As people were not allowed to receive treatment unless they saw a counsellor, they just went to see the counsellor for the sake of it.  Making it mandatory is not the way to go.

The safest thing all <i>in vitro<\/i>fertilisation, IVF, clinics could do is bar their doors closed.  Nobody needs IVF treatment.  It is not oncology or cancer treatment.  However, the trauma and hardship suffered by these couples in their desire to have a family is what we are about in our work.  All treatment has risk attached to it.  With respect to a woman who has associated risks, Dr. Wingfield mentioned cystic fibrosis earlier and in the past we could not have let a woman with such a condition get pregnant.  Their risk of dying would have been astronomically high.  However, with advances in medical treatment, one is mindful there is a risk associated with this treatment, it might have an impact on the woman's lifespan, on their lungs or kidneys if they have kidney issues.  There are many conditions in this respect.  One would work with the patient and the medical community at large and one would take a multidisciplinary approach and give recommendations.  Ultimately, and this is an opinion, not a fact, I try to be non-paternalistic.  I give the best advice I can and then the patient feeds back to me.  Of course, there are limitations to that.  If somebody comes into me and says &quot;I want four embryos transferred into my uterus&quot;, I am absolutely not going to do that ever.  I am not going to put three back in at this point.  However, if at the end of my consultation process with that patient, she still says &quot;I want four embryos put back in&quot;, that probably represents a failure on my part.  One has to work with people, with one's colleagues and with multidisciplinary teams to make sure that the treatment one is providing is both safe and efficacious.  I believe, in the main, that is already happening in Ireland.  I do not know if there is a huge need for legislation.  I do not believe so, my colleagues may differ but I do not know if they will.

That is basically it.    In the case of some couples the woman will not be ovulating and may need fertility drugs to help her ovulate but if her partner has a sperm problem as well, then IVF may be a better treatment.  In the vast majority of male factor fertility where there are sperm issues, IVF is often the only treatment and people are often surprised about that.  The first test one does on a man is a semen analysis and one can see straightaway that for many men no other treatment will work except IVF.  People are often surprised about that and will ask if they could not try some other treatments first.  Therefore, male factor infertility is a very big cause of the necessity for IVF treatment.  If a woman has damaged fallopian tubes or has had ectopic pregnancies and has had her fallopian tubes removed, then the only way she can get pregnant is with IVF treatment, or in the case of women who have endometriosis or who have had many surgeries for Crohn's disease or other conditions, their pelvis will not be normal and they will need IVF treatment.

When scientists are learning the ropes and need to be trained, they need material on which to train.  We must emphasise that they will be practising on eggs and embryos that are not viable.  It is not that we are giving them viable eggs or embryos on which to practise.  Rather, those eggs and embryos are ones that would otherwise not have been kept or used for the treatment of the couple concerned.  They are surplus to requirements and are not viable.  Obviously, it is ethically admissible for those to be practised on, but we would not use any other material that is viable for those purposes.<\/p> <p>  There was also a question about pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, PGD.  I am unsure as to whether the committee is familiar with this area.  In general, we in assisted reproduction services treat people whose problem is that they cannot get pregnant, but there is a subsection of society that can get pregnant naturally but where people are afraid to do so because they know that they are at high risk of transmitting a genetic condition to their offspring.  The obvious condition that springs to mind is cystic fibrosis, given that it has such a high carrier rate in this country.  There are other conditions as well, for example, Huntington's disease, fragile X and haemophilia.  There are many conditions, some of which we have heard of and others that are very rare individually but, in aggregate, are significant.  Unfortunately, the couples concerned only find out that they are in that situation because they have already had an affected child.  All of a sudden, the penny drops and they know that they are carriers and that, if they have another child, there is a 25% or 50% risk of that child having a condition.<\/p> <p>  What do these unfortunate people do?  Either they can play Russian roulette and take a chance or they can get pregnant and have the pregnancy tested by prenatal invasive diagnosis, which then puts them in a very difficult dilemma - do they terminate the pregnancy if it is affected by the condition?  They can use donor sperm or donor eggs to get away from the fact that one of them is a carrier.<\/p> <p>  The most elegant solution is pre-implantation diagnosis.  The idea is that, although the couples can get pregnant naturally, they try to get pregnant through IVF treatment.  We collect a bunch of eggs, hopefully from the woman concerned, and we produce embryos.  Before we choose which ones to put back, the embryos that look promising are analysed genetically by removing three to six cells from each embryo at a stage where there are approximately 150 cells present.  It is a delicate process.  The embryo concerned then has to be frozen to afford the time to do the analysis.  The biopsy cells that have been removed are sent off.  There are units in the country carrying out PGD, namely, us in Cork and another unit in Dublin.  We use a genetics lab in the UK because there is no genetics lab in Ireland capable of doing the analysis.  We send the biopsy cells over there, where the lab multiplies their DNA a hundred thousandfold, which gives it enough to analyse.  The lab reverts to us in due course and tells us, for example, not to put embryo No. 1 back in because it is affected by cystic fibrosis and that No. 2 is safe to put back.  The lab is able to identify which embryos are safe for transfer and which are not.  As such, this is the most elegant way for these at-risk couples to avoid passing on a condition.<\/p> <p>  There is good funding for IVF generally in the UK, including a provision whereby if couples have a condition for which PGD is felt to be ethically applicable, up to three cycles of PGD will be funded by the state.  That is reasonable.  We in Cork who already carry out the treatment - other clinics will follow in our footsteps - feel that the State should be funding this because it is one of the purest forms of preventive medicine.  If couples are proactive and paying for this treatment, which is even more expensive than straight IVF treatment, surely they need some sort of support.  They are trying to take active steps to prevent transmitting a disease.  If they do not and another affected child is born, that immediately means lifelong care is involved, and the cost of that could be hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of euro.  There is an argument for supporting PGD.  I strongly urge the committee to further as much as it can the provision of financial support for units carrying out PGD and the couples concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Waterstone"},{"type":"speech","time":1519808400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Would this legislation as drafted allow for that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#N00700","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1519808400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>It makes provision for PGD, but there is an omission to which Dr. Wingfield and I have drawn attention in the various reports in which we have been involved.  Provision is made for PGD more or less along the lines of what obtains in the UK, but obviously without any declaration of an intention to fund it.  There is a subsection called pre-implantation genetical screening, PGS, which involves genetic analysis of embryos.  The draft legislation has made no provision for it, which is a glaring omission.  In PGS, embryos are analysed genetically, but it is not for a specific condition that people know they are at risk of, for example, cystic fibrosis.  Rather, it is for sporadic chromosome abnormalities that anyone can have and cannot be predicted.  Many human embryos are chromosomally abnormal.  We call the ones that are aneuploidy.  In general, these embryos do not implant at all or, if they do, they tend to end up in miscarriages.  The tip of the iceberg that we are all aware of is Down's syndrome, which is an aneuploidy that proceeds all the way through pregnancy without miscarrying and resulting in a viable baby.  PGS is done to detect aneuploidy, and it is becoming part of IVF provision.  There is considerable debate about whether it should be furthered and whether it is an unnecessary add-on treatment.  There is significant dispute between Europe and America about the merits of PGS, but it is taking place already.  We carry it out in our unit to a limited extent.  It is also being carried out in Dublin.  PGS is a reality in Ireland already and it needs to be catered for in the legislation, but it is not at the moment.

There are situations in which one would want to select a girl rather than a boy so as not to transfer a known medical condition.  That would be allowed for in the legislation.  However, people are discussing family balancing.  For example, should a family with three girls that is going through fertility treatment and is analysing the embryos anyway be allowed to select a male embryo preferentially from the pool of good embryos?  That is one situation.  The other is where there is a family history of a medical condition that, while not necessarily being absolutely on the male or female side, would have a preponderance in one gender more than the other.<\/p><p>Certain disorders on the autism spectrum would have more of a male preponderance so one might have a family with a child who is severely autistic and they want to have another child but they want to reduce their risk of that happening again so they want to have a female.

We can produce a baby so long as we have a few sperm to work with and as long as the woman is fertile enough.  What about the children that are the result?  Because this whole area of medicine is so young the children have not grown up yet but when they do, one could predict that many of those will not be able to reproduce naturally either because they will have poor sperm, if they are boys, and therefore, we are in a sense perpetuating a problem.  We are creating a generation of people who will rely on assisted reproduction to reproduce themselves.  Is that good or bad?  I do not know.

Reference was made not just to IVF but to other treatments that are out there and that are available.  One point that was made in the Irish Fertility Society submission, which others may have made also, is that simple treatments like ovulation induction which are carried out by GPs with Clomid fairly regularly are not covered by any controls at the moment.  There is a lot of fuss about how many embryos we can put back on IVF treatment.  If we put back too many embryos we get too many twins and sometimes we get triplets.  We do not want that.  There are simple treatments like Clomid that are dished out by GPs and general gynaecologists, often without any supervision at all, that can also generate multiple pregnancies.  Luckily, with Clomid one does not often get triplets but one does sometimes.  I have seen audits of the numbers of triplets in the UK a number of years ago and a third of them were due to IVF but another third were due to Clomid.<\/p><p>Therefore, if we are to be regulated in terms of how many embryos we can put back, which is very controllable, the practice of ovulation induction by Clomid should also be regulated as part of the whole system of regulation because it, too, can cause triplets, which are a problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#O03600","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Waterstone","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519808400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee, I thank Professor Wingfield, Dr. Waterstone and Dr. Kennedy for coming through the Irish snow to be with us this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018022800002#P00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1519808400,"counter":172,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 11.25 a.m. until 9 a.m. on Wednesday, 7 March 2018.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality","time":1519808400,"counter":173},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>The Joint Committee met at 09:00<\/p><p>MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Deputy Colm Brophy, Senator Frances Black, Deputy Jack Chambers, Senator Niall \u00d3 Donnghaile.

My fellow commissioner, Mr. Kieran FitzGerald, was to be present, but the weather has defeated him.  We are to be joined in the future by a third commissioner as the recruiting process finished recently.<\/p> <p>  Representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, were last before the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on 21 September 2016, at which stage a number of the issues raised by the commission were discussed.  We were glad to see the committee include many of those matters, together with other recommendations, in the report on Garda oversight and accountability published in December 2016. <\/p> <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission can confirm that since late 2016 the statutory landscape has not changed for it.  However, there have been intervening events, some of which were external and others internal to the commission.  On 16 May 2017 he then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, announced the establishment of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  In its terms of reference the commission has been tasked with addressing, with other areas, &ldquo;the appropriate structures for governance, oversight and accountability, to ensure ... that there are open, accessible and independent means of investigating and adjudicating fairly upon complaints against the police...&rdquo;. <\/p> <p>  By May 2017 the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission had embarked on its own internal review of its structures as an organisation, while also commencing a review of the current legislative framework.  In doing so all staff in the organisation participated in a business improvement process, leading to proposals for adoption by the commission.  That was done having regard to the expertise that had grown among the staff, in some instances during the ten years plus of GSOC&rsquo;s existence.  GSOC has a staff who have operated the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 with all of its challenges and failings and in so doing have had constant contact with the public.  The commission considered it was extremely important to take all views into consideration in looking at how, as an organisation, it could serve the public better and also how it could move forward, with or without legislative change.  As a result of the internal work done in 2017, the organisation has revised its working process, although the current statutory requirements dictate how that work is ultimately done.  The commission was also conscious, as were staff, that in working better, should there be statutory change, the organisation did not want to have to restructure all over again.  Therefore, internal changes were undertaken with a view to being able to adapt to any future legislative developments. <\/p> <p>  Alongside the internal work, the commission undertook to make a submission to the Department of Justice and Equality on legislative change.  That was done in conjunction with the internal work in order that the proposals would not only make sense in terms of good governance and accountability but that they would also make sense in operational terms within the organisation. <\/p> <p>  Consideration was given to the process of taking back more work from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the current legislation which would add to the necessary experience and skills for legislative change in confirming such a change.  Again, as part of the business improvement team's work and the legislative change proposals, consideration was given to strengthening the trained team of investigators who would be available and able to take on existing legislative developments and into the future.  To that end, GSOC provided a business case proposal for the Minister for Justice and Equality earlier this month.  It envisages both short-term and medium-term staffing demands, with a longer term business case, dependent on legislative change.  The business case has been provided for members of the committee. <\/p> <p>  One of the main concerns of the commission is building an operational team of investigators that will be adaptable enough to allow GSOC to deal with the unexpected.  Ten years of experience has shown that there is a relatively constant level of complaints in or around 2,000 per year.  What cannot be planned for are incidents that occur unexpectedly &ndash; a road traffic incident involving a garda or garda&iacute;, a serious criminal allegation against a garda or garda&iacute;, and a decision to refer matters to the Garda ombudsman by the Minister or the Policing Authority.  Let me give an example.  In June 2017 the then Garda Commissioner unexpectedly sent the commission correspondence which included an audit report on EU funded training programmes-projects at the Garda College in Templemore.  There was a clear public interest in an independent investigation into this matter, but the Garda ombudsman was not in a position to carry out such an investigation on its own.  For the first time in its history the commission had to make use of the provisions in section 74 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and seek the &ldquo;special assistance&rdquo; of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to move forward the investigation.  Otherwise, it would have had to discontinue its involvement.  The commission can confirm that five members of the Garda joined the GSOC investigation team, with the final member only joining in December 2017.  The services of an accountant from Revenue have been also engaged to assist the investigation team, but that secondment will come to an end on Monday, 5 March.  While the involvement of garda&iacute; is not the most desirable way forward, in this instance, the commission has been impressed by the professionalism of the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who volunteered to come to work in this investigation and the skills they have brought cannot be underestimated.  The absence of ombudsman investigators in this instance directly illustrates the importance of building a resilient workforce.<\/p><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, was not aware that the Garda Commissioner was sending the audit report for investigation or the scope of such an investigation when considering the demands on the organisation at the start of 2017.  This is a prime example of the unexpected that can arise in Garda oversight.<br\/><br\/>The business case proposal seeks a total of 37 extra staff in the short to medium term.  Twenty four of that additional staff would be for the investigations-operations side of the organisation with the remaining 13 being the necessary additional administrative staff to support the investigations side.  It will be necessary for one of the administrative complement to take on the increasing data protection responsibilities that every organisation has to have regard to, particularly having regard to the implementation in May next of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, through the Data Protection Bill.  The cost of employing the additional 37 people is estimated at in excess of &euro;1.7 million per year.  In our business case proposal we point to the amount of money spent on tribunals looking at the actions of garda&iacute; over the years as an indication that GSOC&rsquo;s proposals represent good financial value for the proposed investment of public moneys. <br\/><br\/>As part of the Garda Ombudsman legislative proposals we have sought to be independent from the Department of Justice and Equality.  The current legislation provides that the Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer for the organisation.  The undoubted benefit of the current position is that the Secretary General oversees the organisation&rsquo;s financial health allowing GSOC to deal with other issues.  The organisation is still accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts but, in effect, the Secretary General of the Department minds our money. <br\/><br\/>After ten years, however, the organisation feels it is time to cut the umbilical cord.  We no longer need the parent to decide our funding and our financial planning.  GSOC is ready to take on the responsibility of seeking its own budgetary needs and planning and being accountable for its expenditure.  It is ready to fight its own corner with other Departments and can answer to the Committee of Public Accounts if so required.  We look to the fact that two recent statutory bodies, namely, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Policing Authority, have had encompassed in their legislation their own Accounting Officers as part of their corporate structure.  GSOC has built up the experience over ten years of accounting for public expenditure and we are ready to take on this role wholly separate from the Department. <br\/><br\/>Since our last appearance before this committee the Garda Ombudsman has seen significant development in its role under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  During 2017 the organisation received 22 protected disclosures from Garda members across the country.  We currently have 25 protected disclosures undergoing examination or investigation.  Contact has continued in 2018.  The commission decided that the kind of protections required for such cases and the other work being undertaken within the organisation meant that we needed a dedicated unit for this work.  At this stage it is public knowledge that our proposals for the requirements of such a unit were not met in full and the inability to put our case to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform directly is an example of the organisation&rsquo;s desire for independence.  GSOC became aware only through the freedom of information request made by RT&Eacute; recently that a departmental view had been offered that our proposals were excessive.  If we had been in the position of having our own Accounting Officer, GSOC would have been directly dealing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and perhaps in a position to argue why the proposal was not excessive and merited consideration in full by that Department. <br\/><br\/>The protected disclosure legislation is a new area.  Across private and public workplaces people are finding their way.  Is a complaint a grievance or a protected disclosure?  GSOC has taken legal advice to guide us and some of the people who come to us may find, as will GSOC, that what troubles them is not in law a protected disclosure.  At this stage we have a low bar.  GSOC feels it is important to build trust, and time will tell how this area of work develops.  However, the feedback we have received from the protected disclosers has been positive.  Contrary to the view that garda&iacute; would not turn to the body which deals with complaints about garda&iacute;, we have found members have come looking for help and support and when it has been provided it has been embraced.  This very important work has been done by a full-time senior investigating officer and two part-time investigators who have other organisational responsibilities to date.  Two full-time protected disclosures investigators will finally commence working with GSOC on Monday next, 5 March 2018, with two more in the pipeline. <br\/><br\/>On 12 October 2017 we provided GSOC&rsquo;s submission to the review of the Protected Disclosures Act to the reform unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of its public consultation.  It is clear from the Department&rsquo;s website a number of submissions were received but to date there has been no further contact about the review. <br\/><br\/>On 17 January 2018 the Garda Ombudsman Commission provided its submission to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  This is available on the GSOC website and included our proposals for legislative change.  Included in that proposal is reference to a new initiative undertaken in consultation with Pearse Street Garda station.  I will quote directly from the submission.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>GSOC has commenced, in conjunction with the Chief Superintendent from Pearse Street Garda Station, a local intervention initiative from the 1st of January 2018.  The objectives of this pilot programme are to reinstate the ability of local garda management to deal with inappropriate behaviour, encourage positive behaviour in garda&iacute;, build and keep public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in dealing with complaints, deal with appropriate &quot;service delivery&quot; complaints effectively and efficiently, provide immediate intervention at a local level which will not result in unnecessary, lengthy investigation, and strengthen relationships with GSOC.  As part of the pilot, where practicable, all persons that attend at the Garda Stations in the DMR South Central wishing to make a complaint will be dealt with by a member of sergeant rank.  The complainant will be given the opportunity to have their complaint dealt with by &quot;local intervention&quot;.  <br \/><br \/>Similarly a complainant from the DMR South Central division who contacts GSOC directly will be asked, if appropriate, whether they wish to have their complaint dealt with by way of &quot;local intervention&quot;.  <br \/><br \/>In each case if a complainant is willing to deal with their complaint in this fashion, the written complaint is forwarded to a nominated inspector who, having appraised himself\/herself of the matter, will meet with the complainant.  Contact is then made with the member concerned who is given an opportunity to provide an explanation and\/or offer a solution to the complaint.  A timeframe of six weeks is envisaged for the process to resolve matters with all parties&rsquo; agreement.  <br \/><br \/>Failure to resolve the matter still allows the complainant to continue with the process through GSOC.  <br \/><br \/>The business owner of the pilot programme is the Chief Superintendent.  This initiative was agreed between GSOC and the DMR South Central as an effort to meet all the goals of the project and in particular to build confidence in both organisations in the process.  There is clear leadership and management envisaged throughout the proposed structure.  There is to be an evaluation in June 2018 to see how this pilot is working.  Currently it is a project outside the legislative framework but one that leaves open to the member of the public all his\/her rights under the legislation.  <br \/><br \/>GSOC sees this as a valuable and worthwhile project to undertake.  It is a way forward for both organisations and would be part of a legislative change as proposed by GSOC.  <br \/><br \/>It is also a programme that should instil &quot;ownership&quot; of poor performance and response to the public&rsquo;s needs where it belongs, and will also instil &quot;ownership&quot; in changing that performance and response.<\/blockquote><p>The commission will be reviewing this project over the next few months to see whether it provides a way forward for the public, the Garda and GSOC.<\/p><p> Last year saw our ten-year anniversary.  While there has been little Government action in that time, the organisation has used its time to build up its staff, review its practices and propose credible proposals for statutory improvements and the necessary financial consequences in a responsible fashion.  A new website went live in 2017 and will be able to provide us with a more user-friendly platform of information for the general public.  We have met the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and forwarded to it our proposals for change.  Building on ten years of experience, GSOC is in a good position to ensure that, whatever changes come to policing in the future, independent oversight will continue to be an integral part of policing and GSOC will play an important role in providing that oversight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018022800002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519808400,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Justice Ring.

Here, it is more fluid and we often have to explain in detail and a number of times why we want something before we get it.  In fairness, the system in place has proved to be much more effective than it was at the beginning.

We want to see results.<\/p> <p>  Recommendation No. 2 refers to former members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I note from the report compiled by GSOC last December that there is a slight variation in the solutions or recommendations.  We have indicated in our recommendation No. 2 that \"the Police Ombudsman in the North can investigate officers who have retired\".  In the solution offered by GSOC on page 26 of its submission entitled Proposal for Legislative Change, solution No. 10.3.2 it states:  \"In other jurisdictions it is permissible to delay the retirement of a member under investigation, including non-criminal investigation.  Consideration should be given to such a provision.\"  Did this committee adopt the wrong position in terms of the situation north of the Border?

One of the practical realities that we have seen over time is that we have started investigations and in the course of the investigation someone retires, whether he or she retires as always planned or whether the investigation has caused him or her to reconsider his or her career options.  They go outside the Garda service and that often brings an investigation to a halt.  We seek both.  In the Metropolitan Police Force, for instance, if an investigation has commenced and somebody decides that it is an appropriate time to retire he or she can have his or her retirement delayed so that a full investigation can take place.  Such a provision here would deal with a lot of issues.  Sometimes the problems about retired members, who are already retired, is there are old complaints.  The investigation may grind to a halt in any event because of the delay in making the complaint.  We would like more flexibility across the board.  We would like clarity so that we can carry out an investigation on retired people.  Delayed retirement is an issue that can also be considered.  What we have done in our proposals throughout is indicate a problem and a solution.  We are open to discussing how that is put into some sort of statutory framework.

We believe 12 months is a reasonable amount of time but that period takes into account a belief that the public knows about GSOC.  Many members of the public are unaware of the existence of GSOC or they do not see it as being a separate and independent authority but attached to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and will not come to us.  There have been delays due to ignorance, and I do not mean that in a pejorative sense, but ignorance of our role and independence.  There have been delays because of personal circumstances.

I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss this short but very significant Bill.  In 2010, we overhauled our legislation on drink driving.  The measures brought in then have largely worked well.  In particular, we quite rightly reduced the permitted level of alcohol in drivers from 80 mg to 50 mg per 100 ml of blood.  This was an important step in bringing the law into line with the scientific evidence that even small amounts of alcohol can have a potentially disastrous impact on people's reaction times.  When the person in question is behind the wheel of a car, that difference can be the difference between life and death.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, there was a concession made at that time which, frankly, screams off the pages of the legislation.  This was the decision to allow some people who are over the limit and in the 50 mg to 80 mg range to receive penalty points in place of disqualification.  This makes no sense as law or policy.  It flies in the face of the supposed principle that all drink driving offences should lead to a disqualification.  The Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017 provides that the three penalty points which people currently receive in these cases be replaced by a three-month disqualification.  This is entirely reasonable and proportionate.  It will finally ensure that the law takes drink driving seriously and is seen to do so.  It is not about changing the alcohol limits; those remain the same.  It is about changing the consequences of breaching those limits.<\/p> <p>  During the debate on Second Stage, I indicated my intention to address a number of matters by way of amendments to be introduced on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>In 2016, the Oireachtas decided to introduce a measure making it an offence for the owner of a mechanically propelled vehicle to allow a learner to drive that vehicle without an accompanying qualified driver.  As anyone who has followed this issue will know, I support this measure as do, I think, a large number of Deputies.  However, a point which we must always bear in mind when dealing with legislation is that it is one thing to intend to do something in law and quite another to get the wording correct and ensure that the provision makes sense as law.  Unfortunately, the amendment, which was introduced in 2016 in this case, contained a number of flaws and I indicated that I would take the opportunity, posed by the present Bill, to introduce an amendment to ensure that the provision could be repaired and made workable.  What has happened since is instructive.  The work of making revisions to this provision has revealed a number of other significant issues.  One matter which had not been taken into account or, indeed, addressed in the original amendment was that if we are saying it is to be an offence for an owner to allow an unaccompanied learner to drive his or her vehicle, what about an owner who lends a vehicle to a person who is not licensed at all?  That should surely be addressed too and I am going to do so.  Besides this important addition there have been several significant legal issues to be overcome in order to get this provision right.  As a result the Office of the Attorney General has not been in a position to provide a draft in time for the committee to consider today.  I shall endeavour to present this amendment on Report Stage.  At the same time, I shall propose an amendment to section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 to allow garda&iacute; to detain a vehicle driven by an unaccompanied learner, as well as technical amendments to correct errors in section 78(<i>a<\/i>) of the Road Traffic Act 1961 and sections 13(1)(a) and (b) of the Road Traffic Act 2010.  <br\/><br\/>I would like to take the opportunity to clarify a point about the detention of vehicles.  There has been a great deal of ill informed and alarmist publicity in recent days about the detention of vehicles with suggestions that it would involve going into farmyards and seizing tractors if they were driven by unaccompanied learners.  I would like to set the record straight and explain that the requirement for a learner to have an accompanying driver does not apply to tractors nor does road traffic law apply to farmyards or any other private land.  It applies to public places.  I trust in the farming community to know better than to be alarmed by this inaccurate publicity.  I am glad to avail of this opportunity to put the truth on record. <br\/><br\/>On a more general point, my own experience of how much work is necessary to get provisions like this right is a lesson that I hope we can all take to heart.  There is a world of difference between wanting to do something in legislation, particularly in road traffic legislation of this sort, and getting the actual provisions right.  If we legislate in haste we may not be able to do what we intend, or worse, create unintended consequences.  <br\/><br\/>The Bill has attracted a fair amount of interest.  The overwhelming reaction that I have encountered from both the public and road safety experts has been positive.  It has not been unanimously positive but it has been generally very positive.  It is interesting that public support is even higher in rural areas in spite of unsustainable claims that this Bill will somehow damage social life in rural Ireland.  People in rural Ireland evidently see through that.  They know that rural Ireland has suffered more than urban Ireland from the damage caused by drink driving despite the claims to the contrary.  They also know that rural social isolation is a real problem and has nothing to do with drink driving.  Nothing could be more insulting than to suggest that rural Ireland needs a bit of drink driving as a cure for social problems, and the people of rural Ireland know that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018022800002#A00300","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519824600,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement.

The Minister initiated the process in January 2017 and it has taken a long time to come to this stage.  My position has not changed and I believe the penalty being introduced by the Minister is disproportionate to the offence.  I put it on record that I will bring forward an amendment on Report Stage that would see somebody falling within the 50 mg to 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood category receiving a &euro;500 fine and five penalty points.  The Minister is targeting the wrong bracket in trying to bring down road deaths.  That is if automatic disqualification is the deterrent it is claimed to be by the Minister.  Based on the figures he supplied in pre-legislative scrutiny, 8,063 people were caught over the legal alcohol limit, and of that number, 617 were in the 50 mg to 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood category.  The vast majority of the people detected for driving a car over the legal limit had measures in excess of 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.  They are the people currently facing an automatic disqualification for breaking the law.  I asked the Minister the following questions on a number of occasions but he has not responded in a satisfactory manner.  If automatic disqualification is the deterrent he says it is, why were 94% of the people caught in 2016 in a category that brings automatic disqualification?  That contrasts with the 6% in the category bringing fixed penalty points and a fine.<\/p> <p>  I accept the Minister present is not responsible for justice but this is a justice-related matter.  On 7 March 2017, I asked the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality the number of mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints performed in each of the years between 2012 and 2016, the number of breath tests performed, the number of drivers under the influence and the category, and to provide the information in tabular form.  We are now 12 months on and there have been repeated parliamentary questions and follow-up calls to the Minister but we do not have the information.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is basing what he brings forward today on figures supplied by the Road Safety Authority between 2008 and 2012.  Those figures do not take into account the new laws introduced in 2010.  If the Minister is serious about reducing fatalities on the roads, why are we not targeting the category of people committing the greater offence?  The Minister might look to target the lower category as well but he is ignoring the larger percentage of people who drive and have been caught over the upper limit.  That is based on the Minister's figures for 2016.<\/p><p>He is ignoring that category.  There is nothing in the legislation to address the category of persons three and four times over the limit.  In previous evidence to the committee the Minister stated the overwhelming majority who committed this offence were in that category, yet in this legislation we are providing that those who do the right thing and take a taxi home at night but who drive the following morning and are found to be marginally over the limit will also have their licences revoked.  That is disproportionate to the offence committed.  During the debate on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il I proposed that a person in the latter category be fined &euro;500 and awarded five penalty points.  I propose to table an amendment on Report Stage to that effect, but I would welcome a response now from the Minister on why he is ignoring the category in which the greatest number of deaths have occurred.  As I said, 94% of those convicted of this offence in 2016 fell into the over 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood category.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018022800002#C03300","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1519824600,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputies Kevin O'Keeffe and Catherine Murphy to speak to the amendment, I advise the committee that sometimes enabling motions are required for amendments to be considered.

As always, the Deputy's questions are legitimate, but they are not relevant to the purpose of the Bill.  On his point about the figure of 94%, I presume he is asking why the penalties for those in that category are not more severe.  The idea of grading of offences may be worthy of consideration, but this is a very narrow Bill, deliberately so, to enable it to be enacted quickly.  However, that has not happened for various reasons, but it is my intention to introduce a road traffic Bill every year I am in office.  Such a Bill was introduced last year and the previous year and we are now dealing with this Bill.  I am grateful for the Deputy's contribution on the announcement made this morning which was all to do with road safety.<\/p> <p>  The aim of the Bill is to address a practice which we have identified as being totally and utterly inconsistent and wrong, whereby some people found to be over the limit are not being disqualified.  Had we chosen to introduce a much more comprehensive Bill to address drink driving, it would, undoubtedly, have taken longer to get it through than this Bill.  When one is in the business of trying to save lives, it is immensely frustrating to be delayed in that mission.  Whether members believe this legislation will save lives - I have no doubt that it will - it is difficult to accept delays.  If we were to extend the Bill to address a lot more complicated questions, we would meet far greater resistance to it from predictable quarters.  There may come a time, however, when we will be able to address all of the issues raised more comprehensively.  I would like to be far more radical in a lot of the legislation I am introducing, but this Bill is deliberately narrow in order to address quickly the issue arising in the case of the other 6%.  I do not think it is implicit in what the Deputy said that because we are not addressing the 94%, dealing with the other 6% is not legitimate.  The argument in that regard has pretty well been accepted.  It establishes the principle without a loophole that everybody over the limit will be disqualified.  That is the message we want to send.  There will be a time elsewhere to review the penalties.  I am sure it is the case that they are never up to date or consistent.  Road traffic law is full anomalies, but this is one issue we wanted to address quickly.        <\/p> <p>  The Deputy cited particular figures.  I could produce figures too.  Some people keeping saying the figure is only 6%, but a figure of 6% is huge in the context of the number of people who are dying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018022800002#D00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1519824600,"counter":419,"content":"<p>My reference to the figure of 6% was not in the context of the number of lives lost; rather, it was in the context of the percentage of motorists detected in 2016 in the 50 mg to 80 mg category.
