The Department stated there was a management response to the audit findings and recommendations sought from Rehab as a routine element of the audit process and this was not received.  We also have in our pack from the Department a letter from the chief executive of the Rehab Group to the head of internal audit, Mr. Walter Johnson, on 23 August 2012.

The ultimate beneficiary of the payments was NAMA.  Chapter 6 was compiled primarily to present a coherent account of the circumstances that gave rise to the payments.  The High Court decision awarded &euro;32.6 million to a firm of house builders now in an arrangement with NAMA in a case taken against the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The case arose after the State was unable to deliver a Dublin city centre site in accordance with the terms of a land swap agreement.<\/p><p>  In 2004, the Government decided to pursue land swaps as a means of delivering affordable housing.  The plan was that high value parcels of land in State ownership would be exchanged with developers in return for the delivery of affordable housing on sites owned by the developers.  Being already zoned residential and serviced, the developers' sites would effectively be ready to go.  The site involved in this case was at Harcourt Terrace in Dublin.  It was owned by the Office of Public Works and at that time accommodated a Garda station and the Irish Film Censor's office.<\/p><p>  In 2006, the Affordable Homes Partnership carried out a feasibility study and decided that a land swap of the site offered the best opportunity to deliver affordable housing.  In May 2006, the OPW wrote to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government expressing its reservations about the proposed timescale for the delivery of vacant possession of the Harcourt Terrace site.  Nevertheless the site was advertised.  The successful bidder offered a price considerably in excess of other bids.  It already had control of an adjoining site which it had previously purchased from the State.  <\/p><p>  In December 2007, an agreement was signed between Affordable Homes Partnership and the firm setting out the terms of the swap.  Some 215 affordable housing units were provided by the Affordable Homes Partnership at discounts valued at &euro;31.2 million in total.  As part of the agreement, the freehold title of the Harcourt Terrace site would transfer to the successful bidder when all the affordable units had been received and the site would be leased back to the State until the end of 2008.  However, by the end of 2008, the site was still occupied by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na due to delays in delivering the planned alternative accommodation at the junction of Kevin Street and Bride Street.  <\/p><p>  Further negotiations between the parties took place in 2009 in order to put extended transitional arrangements in place.  By late 2009, the broad shape of an agreement was in place, providing for the firm to lease the property back to the OPW for a five-year term.  However, there were further delays in completing the transfer documentation.  In 2010, the firm served a completion notice under the terms of the contract.  As the site was still unavailable, the firm subsequently instituted legal proceedings in the High Court and demanded payment of the amount of the discount together with &euro;4.2 million for penalties.  Affordable Homes Partnership was dissolved at the end of 2010 and its assets, liabilities and outstanding litigation transferred to the Department.  Ultimately in July 2012 an award was made for &euro;32.6 million plus court interest and costs.  The Department and the OPW have agreed to apportion the payment, with 60% being charged to Vote 13 for the Office of Public Works and the remainder being charged to the interim housing and sustainable communities agency subhead in Vote 25 for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>  In effect, the full payment relates to the provision of affordable housing in 2007-2008, which in the normal course would have been expected to be charged in full to the relevant subhead in Vote 25.  By agreement with NAMA the award is being over a period of five years commencing in 2012, when a total of &euro;11.3 million was paid.  Both Appropriation Accounts reflect the respective outstanding financial commitments.  I understand that the Accounting Officers will be in a position to outline payments made since 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014013000006#E01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1391077800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

The Comptroller and Auditor General's report provides a useful overview of the events from 2004 to end 2012.  A briefing paper from the Department and OPW was provided earlier this week to update committee members on the situation.  To provide an overall context for the committee's discussion today I would like to make a number of points.  First, the Harcourt Terrace land swap was a Government intervention aimed an enabling first-time buyers to get on to the property ladder at a time when the Irish housing market was undergoing a period of dramatic growth.  While young, middle income affordable house purchasers, would historically have been able to acquire a starter home without assistance, in the housing market conditions of that time these households were no longer in a position to realise their home ownership aspirations.  Given what has happened in the property and housing markets in Ireland and internationally since 2007, it is hard now to imagine a situation where annual rates of double-digit price appreciation and successive years of record housing output were the norm.<\/p><p>  An intervention in the market ten years ago to deliver 10,000 affordable homes to meet burgeoning demand for a particular demographic cohort might seem extreme to us in 2014 when demand remains sluggish outside of a limited number of years, overall housing output remains at record lows, mortgage lending is weak and property values have decreased by over 50%.  It would not be appropriate therefore to consider affordable housing delivery mechanisms such as the land swap arrangement under discussion only through the prism of the last few years.<\/p> <p>Second, even the most simple property transaction can be quite a complicated and protracted process.  The land swap proposal for Harcourt Terrace was an innovative approach to leverage the value of assets held by the State to deliver on a key public policy objective of supporting home ownership for middle income first-time buyers priced out of the market.<br \/>Like many innovative public policy interventions, it was also complex.  There were many moving parts and participants.  What is now the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government was responsible for setting the policy and supporting the statutory affordable homes partnership in delivering on the affordable housing initiative.  The Department of the Taoiseach chaired a group to provide further co-ordinating support to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The justice Minister proposed the site at Harcourt Terrace for possible use under the initiative.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was then <i>in situ<\/i>in Harcourt Terrace.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, owns the site and building and was also involved in the proposal to develop a new Garda station at Kevin Street to allow for the station at Harcourt Terrace to be vacated.  The Office of the Chief State Solicitor was involved as the legal representative for the OPW.  Various external entities from the legal and property sectors were also involved and provided their expertise, and the developers - Durkan New Homes - were party to the transaction as the successful bidders.  They provided significant discounts to the State and they were to become owners of the site for redevelopment.  In this organisational context, my Department's critical interest was in the timely delivery of the affordable housing.  All of these parties acted in good faith throughout the period from the launch of the affordable housing initiative in 2004 right up to the point at which court proceedings were initiated.  All parties sought to avoid going to the courts but unfortunately that proved not to be possible.<br \/>Finally, by way of overall context, it should be noted that for the land swap at Harcourt Terrace, the State received discounts from Durkan New Homes of over &euro;31 million in value on 215 affordable homes in the south Dublin area.  While this has to be set against the High Court award of &euro;32 million made in favour of Durkan New Homes, those earlier significant discounts had enabled 215 households, in 2007, to realise their aspirations to own their own homes.<br \/>There are three points.  The world has changed radically since this process was initiated; this property market transaction was particularly complex, with many players; and the State received very significant discounts which should be balanced against the court award.  These points are essential to a full understanding of the land swap arrangement at Harcourt Terrace.  I am, of course, with my colleagues, happy to elaborate on these points or on any other issues that arise in the course of the committee's work in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014013000006#E01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Tallon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391078400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>May we publish the statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014013000007#F00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391078400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014013000007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Tallon"},{"type":"speech","time":1391078400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Will Ms McGrath give her opening statement on this chapter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014013000007#F00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391078400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for the invitation to attend today.  The Secretary General has already set out the background and the context of the affordable homes initiative.  I wish to outline to the committee the role of the Office of Public Works, specifically relating to the lands at Harcourt Terrace which are the subject of the Chapter 6 report published by the Comptroller and Auditor General in September last year.<\/p><p>  The site in question remained until 2012 occupied by a Garda station.  As stated in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, at the end of 2008, the Garda station continued to be occupied because of delays in delivering the planned alternative accommodation at a new station on Kevin Street.  As a result, the OPW was not in a position to provide vacant possession by the due date to the developer which supplied the affordable homes.  Conscious of the fact that the site at Harcourt Terrace would not be vacated so that it could be transferred, the OPW, advised by the Chief State Solicitor's office, together with the Affordable Homes Partnership and, later, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, entered in to negotiations with the developer with a view to the transfer of the site taking place and a lease-back arrangement being put in place that would allow continued occupation of the Garda station until a new divisional headquarters at Kevin Street was built.<\/p><p>  In reply to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Accounting Officer of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor has confirmed that, while agreement had been reached in principle on the outline terms of the transfer and lease-back arrangement, it took several months for the detailed terms to be finalised, by which time the developer was unwilling to complete the deal.  The Accounting Officer noted that there had been ongoing correspondence between the parties and that the length of time taken to reach agreement on the terms was not unusual for a transaction of this complexity.<\/p><p>  As pointed out by the Secretary General, the developer provided significant value - in excess of &euro;30 million - to the State by way of affordable housing.  As the transfer of the site to the developer was not concluded, the State did not have to find and fit out temporary accommodation for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and neither did the State pay rent on the Harcourt Terrace site for a period of up to four years, during which time it continued to be occupied by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is important to note the State has retained ownership of the valuable real estate in Dublin 2, which will be used for State purposes or disposed of at the appropriate time.  The amount awarded by the High Court, as has been mentioned, was ultimately transferred to NAMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014013000007#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McGrath"},{"type":"speech","time":1391078400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>May we publish the statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014013000007#F00600","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391078400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014013000007#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McGrath"},{"type":"speech","time":1391078400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I thank the ladies and gentlemen for being here today.

What is curious about the judgment, and this chapter emanates from that, is that the Affordable Homes Partnership - this is from paragraph 18 of the judgment, which might not be before the Committee of Public Accounts but is a public document in the High Court - was on the one hand asking Mr. Durkan to withdraw the completion notice he wished to serve on the partnership and, at the same time, the partnership, which was a State body, served a completion notice on the Office of Public Works.  We now have the two State organisations, the Affordable Homes Partnership and the Office of Public Works, dealing with this and serving legal notices against each other.

The judge says that the commissioners attended a meeting with the Department on 28 September, and the Department changed its position, for the reason that the Affordable Homes Partnership had agreed to provide an indemnity relating to any potential stamp duty liability.<\/p><p>  This is how it appears to me.  One State body, the Affordable Homes Partnership, was having an argument with another State body, the Office of Public Works, regarding the issue of who would be liable for stamp duty.  I believe the Department has some type of exemption that might not have applied to them.<\/p> <p>The Chief State Solicitor was involved, and Eversheds, which acted on behalf of the one State body, joined the OPW in proceedings.  All this wrangling went on and on, and at the end of the day the taxpayer paid &euro;14 million over and above what the site was valued at its highest peak, because of the way the process was managed.  We know the background.  The houses are fine, people are living in them - and I hope they are good houses - and we are all happy with that.  It is a question of how the case was managed such that the developer ended up getting an extra &euro;14 million over and above his highest expectation.  A lot of this was because of the way the various State bodies dragged it along and did not come to an agreement much earlier because they were having their argy-bargy among themselves.

We would have been giving effect to that but when we realised we were not going to be in a position to give vacant possession we engaged with all stakeholders, including the developer, to put in place a lease arrangement.

I will take the opportunity to refer to some important aspects of the work that was funded through the 2012 appropriation account and provide the committee with an update on the current position in some areas.  The 2012 appropriation account was structured in line with the new format for the Revised Estimates under three main programmes, as referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General, namely, flood risk management, the National Procurement Service and estate portfolio management.<br \/>The Office of Public Works, the lead agency for the management of flood risk, expended &euro;52 million on the flood management programme in 2012 and a total of &euro;367 million from 1996 to 2013.  Works in 2012 included schemes completed at Fingal, Mornington and Johnstown and ongoing works at Mallow, Clonmel, Bray, Fermoy and Waterford city.  A sum of &euro;4.8 million was also provided to local authorities under the minor floods and coastal protection programme in 2012.  The OPW continues to work with local authorities to ensure there is sufficient capacity to undertake flood mitigation measures in their administrative areas as promptly as possible.  In the aftermath of the recent flooding, the Office of Public Works sought applications for funding from local authorities to remedy damage caused and reinstate coastal flood defence assets.  The Government has reaffirmed the priority for funding in this area by committing &euro;45 million per annum over the five year period from 2012 to 2016.  This funding will be prioritised to allow for the reduction of flood risk to the greatest possible number of households arid businesses.<br \/><b><\/b>The National Procurement Service was established within the Office of Public Works in 2009 and tasked with centralising public sector procurement arrangements for common goods and services.  During 2012, efficiency savings in excess of &euro;39 million were achieved as a result of contracts initiated by the National Procurement Service and included savings of &euro;10 million on energy costs and &euro;8 million on fuel charge cards.<br \/>As members will be aware, a Government decision of April 2013 agreed the outline plan for the development of an expanded central procurement function.  From January of this year, the Office of Government Procurement will continue the work currently done by the National Procurement Service and previously done by the Government Supplies Agency.  This will be done under its own Vote as part of the public expenditure and reform group.<br \/>The largest programme in terms of funding is the estate portfolio management programme.  This programme encompasses the management, maintenance and development of the State's property portfolio, including the care, protection and presentation of national monuments and historical properties.  The programme, as an integral part of this function, comprises a wide variety of services, including, as the Comptroller and Auditor General noted, professional services such as architecture, engineering, valuation, quantity surveying and project management.<br \/>The main areas of expenditure under the estate management programme in 2012 included the following.  The payment of rents on behalf of all Government Departments to the value of &euro;107 million.  The committee will be interested to note that the Office of Public Works has achieved savings in annual rent each year since 2009 and reduced the outturn to &euro;97 million in 2013.  This reduction in both the annual rental bill and the State's property footprint has been achieved through a targeted lease rationalisation programme and a robust approach to rent reviews.  Some &euro;36 million was spent on the property maintenance subhead which includes the facilities management function of the office and the management and maintenance of certain prestige buildings.<br \/>From 2013 onwards, the Office of Public Works assumed additional responsibility for the funding of all non-elective building maintenance on departmental property, with an additional allocation of &euro;19 million being provided from other departmental Votes.  Essential maintenance will now be provided on a shared service basis to Departments from one central maintenance fund managed by the Office of Public Works.  The reformed service will produce savings both directly through the OPW prioritisation of planned and preventative maintenance and indirectly through the centralisation of the professional expertise and administration of maintenance for all Departments.  The management, conservation and presentation of 780 national monuments and 26 national historical properties with a combined provision of 70 visitor centres accounted for an output of &euro;36.2 million in 2012. <\/p> <p>I am glad to say that visitor numbers are steadily increasing with more than 4 million recorded visitors at our heritage sites in 2013 compared to 3.4 million in 2011.  It is estimated that the total number of visitors to heritage sites is in the order of 10 million but the recorded numbers are 4 million.<\/p><p> Although the capital provision for new works has reduced significantly in recent years the outturn was &euro;39 million on the capital works programme in 2012.  This included refurbishment works at Swinford and Dundrum Garda stations, major projects at the Phoenix Park, Castletown House and Dublin Castle in readiness for Ireland's hosting of the EU Presidency for the first six months of 2013.  The Office of Public Works paid &euro;51.6 million in 2012 in unitary payments on behalf of the Government in relation to the Convention Centre Dublin.<\/p><p> With regard to more recent developments under the Government's reform programme, currently I chair a steering group on property asset management.  I have mentioned this earlier.  This group is working to review existing property management arrangements across the public sector and to develop standard frameworks to drive efficiency and value from the State's property portfolio.  In addition, a cross-disability committee within OPW is developing a set of standards for office accommodation and space norms in accordance with international best practice.  <\/p><p> One other area of activity to which I wish to draw member's attention is the public service energy conservation initiative for which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has provided funding from the carbon levy fund of &euro;9 million over the coming years.  This is the continuation of a programme we have been doing on our own portfolio.  This new programme will roll-out energy saving measures already introduced to more than 200 buildings to a further 500 large buildings from various public sector organisations.  We hope to repeat annual energy savings for public sector clients of up to 18% over the next three years.<\/p><p> The gross outturn for the Office of Public Works Vote was &euro;366 million.  The property and project management services which the OPW continue to provide are not directly funded from the Vote but absorb considerable administrative resources.  We are a shared service and in this role we act as agent on behalf of other Departments and agencies, managing contracts and services which exceeded &euro;79 million in 2012.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its attention.  Perhaps I can introduce my colleagues as I omitted to do so at the outset.  I am accompanied by Mr. Tony Smyth, chief engineer, Mr. Michael Long, accountant with OPW, Mr. John McMahon, commissioner with responsibility for maintenance and heritage services, and Mr. John Sydenham, commissioner with responsibility for property management.  <\/p><p> I am happy to take questions on the account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014013000015#P00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McGrath","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391083500,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Mr. Dermot Quigley and Mr. Frank Griffin are also present.

My question relates specifically to any overlap that might have arisen.  Perhaps Ms McGrath will speak to Mr. Quinn about this.

When Ms McGrath provides the information I have requested, will she include the cost per copy under the old system compared with the cost under the new system?  I am told that in terms of the national spend, it may look as if we are getting value for money but, in fact, a significant number of locations were getting better value under the previous system.  I would like to tease out that argument at some stage with either Ms McGrath or Mr. Quinn, but it requires me to obtain the necessary information from both of them.

I am delighted to be here today on behalf of the Irish Cancer Society to present to them the evidence already available, which demonstrates that the plain packaging of cigarettes does, and will, work.<\/p><p>  Our vision and ambition in the Irish Cancer Society is nothing less than a future without cancer.  That is the why we fight tobacco with everything we have got. Smoking is the single biggest preventable cause of cancer in Ireland.  Almost one in five deaths is attributable to smoking.  If we tackle smoking, as a country we will have delivered the single biggest blow possible to cancer.  We fully support the efforts of the Minister for Health in his ambitious target to make Ireland tobacco free by 2025.  It can be done, and the key is the next generation.  It is possible to have a generation that does not start smoking.  In terms of how we do that, to successfully protect them from the tactics of the tobacco industry, which needs to recruit 50 new smokers a day in Ireland to replace those who quit and those who die, the answer is the plain packaging of cigarettes.<\/p><p>  Plain packaging has four impacts.  First, and crucially, it reduces the appeal of tobacco to young people; second, it stops smokers believing that some brands are less harmful than others; third, it encourages current smokers to quit; and fourth, it increases negative feelings around tobacco.  I want to focus today on that first point, namely, reducing the appeal of tobacco to young people.  We wanted to show members a short video &ndash; two minutes long &ndash; in which the children of Scoil Aonghusa in Tallaght demonstrate their response to branded cigarettes and plain packs.  We made the video in the Irish Cancer Society.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to show it in this room but yesterday evening we sent members a link to the video.  We would ask them to view it because the message in the video is very clear: plain packs significantly reduce the appeal of cigarettes to children.<\/p><p>  In terms of young people and teenagers who are also the target of the tobacco industry, 78% of smokers start before they are 18 and even though the rate of those starting to smoke is falling among young people, it is clear we have more to do to protect this particular group.  The Irish Cancer Society together with our collaborators, the Irish Heart Foundation, commissioned research into the impact on young people of tobacco branding and standardised packaging.  Focus group research was conducted last summer among a group of 15 and 16 year olds, both smokers and non-smokers, who were first shown branded packs.  These sleek, expertly designed, coloured packs influenced everything from the teenagers' perception of the quality of the cigarette to the likely users of the brand and, ultimately, their likelihood to try them.<\/p><p>  They were then shown examples of standardised packaging.  These packs, with their dull colour and graphic health warnings, are immediately rejected by teens.  The images showing the health effects of smoking strip away any glamour or fun attributes imbued by branded packs.  We can make that report available to the committee.  <\/p><p>  For those teens who have tried smoking, most reported that the introduction of plain packaging would be enough to prevent them from trying cigarettes again.  For those who smoked on a daily basis, plain packaging would encourage them to give up sooner.<\/p><p>  The findings of our research mirrors similar research carried out in different parts of the world.  Time does not allow me to name them all but I would like to refer to a study published in September 2013 by the Centre for Tobacco Control Research in the University of Stirling, in the United Kingdom, which sets out a comprehensive overview of 17 studies carried out between August 2011 and September 2013 across the UK, New Zealand and Australia.  The findings of these 17 studies confirm that the plain packaging of cigarettes would reduce their appeal, enhance the effectiveness of health warnings, and ensure that smokers are not misled about the level of harm done by cigarettes.  <\/p><p>  Australia was the first country to introduce plain packs just over one year ago.  Interestingly, very soon after the introduction of plain packs smokers began to complain about the taste of their cigarettes, convinced that they had changed for the worse but the recipe had not changed.  It was the effect on the smokers of the removal of colour and branding, and the impact of stark pictorial warnings that were now enhanced.<\/p><p>  A recent study published in the <i>British Medical Journal <\/i>showed that those smoking from standardised packs perceived their cigarettes to be lower in quality; perceived them to be less satisfying than the previous year; were more likely to have thought about quitting at least once a day; rated quitting as a higher priority; and tended to support the policy on standardised packaging.  A more recent study published two weeks ago by the Cancer Council of Victoria into the impact of plain packs on the behaviour of smokers in caf&eacute;s showed that pack display on caf&eacute; tables declined by 15% after the introduction of plain packaging.  That was due mostly to a 23% decline in the percentage of patrons who were observed smoking. <\/p><p>  All these studies show that the inclusion of a Quitline number on packs in Australia is essential.  The<i> Medical Journal of Australia<\/i> recorded a massive 78% jump in the number of calls to the Quitline since plain packaging was introduced.  On that basis, the Irish Cancer Society would strongly recommend the inclusion of a Quitline number in the legislation being brought forward by the Government, in other words, that the packs would have the Quitline number on them. <\/p><p>  It is still too early to analyse some of the long-term effects on smokers in Australia but these early studies confirm the findings of our own research and the research conducted in the UK.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to have had the opportunity to share with the Chairman and the members this evidence demonstrating that plain packs work.  No one wants to see their child smoking.  As legislators, the members have the power to ensure that children and young people are protected from the tactics of the tobacco industry, which does target them.  We urge them to take this opportunity to protect the lives of the next generation, and to make smoking history in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000004#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen O'Meara"},{"type":"speech","time":1391074500,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Meara.

I will address the bogus arguments used by the tobacco industry and its funded groups to oppose the proposed legislation to protect a business model which, given that 80% of smokers start before they are 18, relies on replacing dead smokers with children and young people.  In addressing their claims, it is useful to first look at Big Tobacco's broader strategy to maintain profit levels by subverting national and international health policy.<\/p><p> Given that the industry has been so discredited, not least by years of lying about the health impact of smoking, it needs others to make arguments on its behalf.  For many years it has provided funding to a diverse range of hidden persuaders to achieve its aims, including retailers' groups, business and trade organisations, fake grass roots organisations, assorted lobbyists and others.<\/p><p> It is virtually certain, in our opinion, that every organisation opposing plain packaging at these hearings will have a funding link, direct or indirect, to the tobacco industry, even if some do have genuine, if misplaced, concerns.  While its coffers are empty in terms of credibility, the industry has no shortage of cash to pay for support.  The five biggest tobacco companies alone make profits of over $37 billion a year, making them bigger than Coca Cola, Microsoft and McDonalds combined.<\/p><p> The model of who the industry funds to make its case is strikingly similar from country to country.  Likewise, the arguments it makes against policies to protect the public from smoking tend to be recycled for repeated use regardless of the specific policy intervention.  For example, on issues ranging from increasing taxation, legislation banning shop displays and now plain packaging, the industry claimed that each would increase smuggling and hit retail jobs without reducing smoking, but these initiatives have spearheaded a decline in smoking rates, from 29% six years ago to 22% last year, a reduction of 200,000 smokers, without any of the industry's dire predictions coming true.<\/p><p> As regards smuggling, plain packs will still carry current security markings, health warnings and other labels.  Consequently, the Garda and Revenue told this committee categorically there was no evidence plain packaging would increase smuggling.  Clearly, it is not in their interest to make such a clear assertion if there is room for doubt.<\/p><p> The truth has not deterred the industry.  Even since then, tobacco companies, at least one of which has a plain packaging campaign co-ordinator, have visited retailers claiming plain packaging will reduce their sales by 20% due to increased illicit trade.<\/p><p> One constant industry claim is that plain packaging will be a \"counterfeiter's charter\".  Anyone making this argument, particularly in the Irish context, either has no idea what he or she is talking about or is not telling the truth.  Research by Revenue and the HSE, which is the only measure of tobacco smuggling not produced for the industry in this country, shows that our smuggling rate is 13% - slightly above the EU average.  Of this, 1% is counterfeit and virtually all the rest is the product of the legal industry.  Counterfeit tobacco in an Irish context is virtually irrelevant and, therefore, provides no valid argument on plain packaging here.<\/p><p> Even aside from the absence of any difference in the level of difficulty between counterfeit in current or plain packs, the fact is that while the industry has cited concerns about smuggling to prevent budget tax increases and then hicked up its own prices in each of the past ten years, there is growing suspicion that the legal industry is again involved in smuggling.  This was echoed in the D&aacute;il in November last when the Finance Minister, Deputy Noonan, said he suspected that the legitimate trade is involved in the production of illicit cigarettes.  Stronger concerns have been voiced in the UK Parliament's Committee of Public Accounts and just this week in Europe, MEPs met international experts to discuss smuggling and the role still being played by the big tobacco manufacturers.  Consequently, any organisation coming before this committee expressing fears about smuggling that takes tobacco industry funding should be asked if it understands what it is doing.<\/p><p> There is also no evidence the proposed legislation will negatively affect the retail trade.  Plain packaging is primarily intended to discourage young people from starting to smoke and is not likely to have as much impact on current smokers.  Therefore, sales reductions resulting from the policy will be gradual, giving retailers considerable time to diversify their business.<\/p><p> In addition, tobacco sales only account for a small proportion of small retailers' profits.  While tobacco may account for up to one third of a small retailer's turnover, profit is minimal as, according to one representative organisation, retailers receive an average of 8.7% of the price of tobacco products.  The size of this income stream is reflected in assertions by retailers' representatives that it will not be worth their members' while selling cigarettes when the licence fee increases to &euro;500.<\/p><p> Another industry claim is that introducing plain packaging is tantamount to the Government appropriating their trademarks.  Apart from the grotesque notion that intellectual property rights for tobacco firms are more important than our children's health, this is legally without foundation.  The Australian courts ruled plain packaging did not represent an acquisition of property by government from which it could benefit.  Here, a legal challenge cannot succeed once the State shows plain packaging is rationally connected to improving public health and is a proportionate response.<\/p><p> Finally, when all else fails, the industry and its supporters complain that tobacco control legislation is an attack on individual freedom and interference from the nanny state.  This is their most ludicrous argument of all.  Tobacco is quite possibly the greatest usurper of individual freedom in the history of the planet.  Not only is it among the most addictive substances known to man, it kills half its regular users.  What more conclusive denial of freedom is there than your premature death?  Similarly, if we really had a nanny state, would 5,200 people be allowed to die each year from smoking?<\/p><p> By measuring the strong evidence supporting plain packaging against the industry's lists of baseless claims recycled from other lost battles, a simple choice emerges between protecting our children's health or industry profits regardless of the human cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000004#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Macey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391075100,"counter":628,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Macey.

We representing the hundreds of thousands of people living with asthma in Ireland and we welcome the opportunity to share our views.<\/p><p>  As many members will be aware, asthma is the most common chronic disease in the country and affects one-in-ten adults and one-in-five children.  Tobacco smoke is one of the most common and dangerous asthma triggers.  As others have said, tobacco is a unique product in that it causes the death of half of its users and is more addictive than any other product available legally in this country.<\/p><p>  We are members of the Irish Lung Health Alliance, a coalition of 14 organisations working to improve lung health in Ireland.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of respiratory illness in Europe, at almost double the EU average.  One-in-five deaths in Ireland is from lung disease and smoking is the leading cause of respiratory death.  The Irish Lung Health Alliance also fully supports this proposed legislation.<\/p><p>  Tobacco not only adversely affects the user but also those around him or her.  Passive smoking is particularly problematic for those with chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma.  The 2004 workplace smoking ban allowed people with asthma to work, study and socialise without fear of an attack, and yet those with asthma are still exposed to tobacco smoke every day and our members tell us smoking poses a problem day to day, even when going to their hospital appointments.  Most worrying is that children with asthma are often exposed to tobacco smoke in the home and in cars.<\/p><p>  Breathing tobacco smoke increases the risk of asthma.  For every 1% increase in smoking prevalence, asthma admissions rise by 1%.  Babies born to mothers who smoke while pregnant are more likely to develop asthma.  Tobacco also worsens asthma control and lung function, reduces the effectiveness of medication, and increases the risk of virus and infection.  Smoking with asthma greatly increases the chance of developing irreparable life-threatening conditions such as COPD.<\/p><p>  One quarter of Asthma Society of Ireland service users, both on our advice line and at our clinics, in 2013 were smokers and despite the risks, those with asthma still smoke.<\/p><p>  As to why one should introduce standardised tobacco packaging, it is that branding works.  Those with asthma feel the adverse affects that tobacco has on their health the minute they smoke their first cigarette, and yet they smoke.  This is because branding works.  Parents of children with asthma smoke in their homes and in their cars, despite the risk to their children's health.  This is because branding works.  The tobacco industry is fighting to defeat this proposed legislation in order to maintain its profits and its power to recruit new smokers.<\/p> <p>Branding sells products and is so powerful that it can even sell a 50:50 chance of death.  Addiction keeps people smoking and branding entices them to start.  Countless research studies throughout the globe show that standardised tobacco packaging reduces smoking prevalence by reducing the appeal of smoking and increasing awareness of the health risks.  Furthermore, plain tobacco packaging is found to be even more effective on young people than the rest of the population.<\/p><p> The tobacco industry and other interests may argue that this legislation will cost the economy and reduce the approximately &euro;1 billion in State revenue from the sale of tobacco products.  Yet the costs of maintaining the<i>status quo <\/i>are much greater.  Lost work days due to asthma alone costs the economy &euro;262 million each year.  The total cost to the State of respiratory illness is estimated at &euro;1.036 billion, with asthma accounting for &euro;501 million of this.  It is estimated that the overall cost of smoking-related illness to the State is in excess of &euro;4 billion.<\/p><p> The example set by Australia is inspiring countries throughout the world to take action against tobacco.  Public opinion is also in favour of plain packaging.  A recent survey carried out by an alliance of health and children&rsquo;s charities found that the majority of Irish people support this legislation.  Ireland was the first European country to introduce a workplace ban on smoking.  It is now time for Ireland to again take the lead in protecting the lives and lungs of future generations.  We in the Asthma Society of Ireland fully support this legislation and urge its speedy implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sharon Cosgrove","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391075700,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cosgrove.

This legislation will contribute to saving thousands of lives in future decades and protecting further thousands of young people from the scourge of tobacco and related nicotine addiction.<\/p><p>  The only agenda of ASH Ireland is health.  We are the only single-issue anti-smoking advocacy group in this jurisdiction.  We have been deeply involved in supporting this and previous governments in the introduction of anti-smoking legislation which contributes to saving lives and protecting people from the harmful effects of environmental tobacco smoke.  My colleague Norma Cronin has worked in smoking cessation and advocacy for tobacco-related legislative change for many decades.  She has a deep knowledge of the effects of smoking and the industry which promotes it.  I am a respiratory physician by profession and on a daily basis I treat many people who are suffering ill health for one reason only - they smoke.  This week, 100 people will die from smoking-related lung disease.  We must help these people with every avenue open to us.  In my view effective legislation is perhaps the most powerful tool in tackling the smoking dilemma.  Almost every one of my patients who smoke wants to quit and virtually all wished they had never started.  The vast majority started smoking in their teenage years and continue to smoke because nicotine addiction quickly takes hold.  It is specifically in this area that we believe the proposed legislation would have most impact. <\/p><p>  This legislation is essentially about restricting a specific industry in marketing a unique product which costs this State well in excess of &euro;1 billion annually in treating a raft of related diseases and which kills 50% of those who use it.  New users must be recruited and it is young people who are the primary target of tobacco industry marketing.  In this context, I wish to offer the committee a number of quotations from tobacco industry representatives.  From RJ Reynolds Tobacco we have the following: &quot;Brands which fail to attract their fair share of younger adult smokers face an uphill battle&quot;.  The quote continues, &quot;if younger adults turn away from smoking, the industry must decline just as a population which does not give birth will eventually dwindle&quot;.  I offer the committee another quote from this company dating back to 1974.  When talking about young people, RJ Reynolds said, &quot;They represent tomorrow&rsquo;s cigarette business.  As this 14-24 age group matures, they will account for a key share of the total cigarette volume for at least the next 25 years&quot;.   Market research conducted by Philip Morris in 1981 states the following: <blockquote>  It is important to know as much as possible about teenage smoking patterns and attitudes.  The smoking patterns of teenagers are particularly important to Philip Morris. The share index is highest in the youngest group for all Marlboro and Virginia Slims packings.  At least part of the success of Marlboro Red was because it became the brand of choice among teenagers who then stuck with it as they grew older. <\/blockquote> I have another quote from a marketing and design executive representing Lorrilard, another large tobacco firm:<blockquote>We have been asked by our client to come up with a package design, a design that is attractive to kids.  While this cigarette is geared to the youth market, no attempt (obvious) can be made to encourage persons under twenty-one to smoke.  The package design should be geared to attract the youthful eye, not the ever-watchful eye of the Federal Government.<\/blockquote>The committee should note the number of times that brand, marketing and worryingly, young people and teenagers are mentioned by an industry which tries to convince us that it does not market to and target young people.  This is untrue.  For every smoker that dies, the tobacco industry is determined to replace that smoker with a young person who will quickly become addicted and thereby continue to smoke for the remainder of their lives.  When we consider the current challenges facing our health services, both here in Ireland and elsewhere, the committee will find it interesting to note that in 2006 alone, the five largest tobacco manufacturers in the United States spent $12.49 billion on marketing their products.  This marketing is entirely centred and focused on brand promotion and awareness.  It goes without saying that if the tobacco industry is spending $12.5 billion dollars on supporting brand awareness and promotion, it is fully aware of the vital importance of branding in enticing young people to smoke and encouraging brand loyalty and continuance of the practice among smokers.  <\/p><p>  It is clear that the legislation which is now before the committee is running directly contrary to the highly expensive and focused marketing campaigns of an industry which supplies a product which is highly addictive and which is the leading cause of premature death and disability in our country.  I expect that in the later stages of the committee's hearings the Irish tobacco Industry will enter this room and try to convince the committee that it has a right to market its product and will probably try to say that this important legislation will have no impact.  In my view, no industry has the right to market in a normal fashion a product that is known to kill 50% of those who use it.  Tobacco is a unique product in terms of addiction, which is often referenced as being similar to the addiction to heroin.  It is not a food or beverage that can be life sustaining.  It is not a product that has a threshold of effect, a safe level of use or a product that can be used safely in moderation.  It is unique in regard to related mortality.  No other product on sale worldwide costs the health services such massive amounts of money in treating its related diseases. <\/p><p>  I have no doubt whatsoever but that the introduction of plain packaging will make it more difficult for the industry to market its products to young and old.  The committee has already heard the evidence in favour of plain packaging from the Australian experience, which I will not repeat.  I urge the committee to proceed with this legislation.  In our written submission we have put forward a number of proposed amendments under heads Nos. 3, 4, and 14, and we ask that the committee looks positively at these proposals. <\/p><p>  The workplace smoking ban was introduced ten years ago, despite the resistance of many interests that decried the legislation and predicted it would fail.  Nobody could speak now against the success of that legislation.  Ireland can once again take the lead in Europe by putting the health of the nation ahead of the profits of any single industry.  The leadership of our legislators is a key element in this.  I thank the committee again for the opportunity to address it today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ross Morgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1391075700,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Morgan.

I thank the committee for inviting us here today.  COPD Support Ireland is a national network of local groups led by people living with COPD.  Our focus is to raise awareness of COPD and the profound link between smoking and the development of this disease.  COPD is probably not as well known as other illnesses but it is estimated that 440,000 people are living with the disease in Ireland today.  Smoking is the lead cause of COPD.  There are approximately 1,500 deaths per year from this disease and over 90% of all sufferers are smoking or are ex-smokers.  COPD is the collective name for lung conditions that make it hard for sufferers to breathe due to obstruction in the air passages of their lungs.<\/p> <p>It is a progressive, disabling disease with a significant extra-pulmonory effect and it has a major impact on the lives of patients, families and carers, in addition to the health care system.  COPD cannot be cured.  Even when a person quits smoking, the damage to the lungs is not reversible.  The consequences of smoking are lifelong.  One sufferer has said the condition is such that it is like trying to take a breath with an elephant sitting on one's chest.<\/p><p> There are approximately 11,000 admissions to hospitals each year of COPD patients, representing approximately 120,000 bed days utilised.  There are huge costs associated with that.  An uncomplicated admission of a COPD patient costs over &euro;4,000, and a complicated admission can cost &euro;7,700.  The average length of stay is nine days.  Therefore, one can see how the costs build up.<\/p><p> Although smoking is the leading cause of COPD, 77% of Irish people do not know this.  This indicates that the health warnings are currently not effective enough in deterring people from taking up smoking.  More needs to be done.  Smoking is a factor in 90% of cases of COPD.  Most of those affected have smoked over 20 cigarettes per day for up to 20 years.  Up to 50% of lifelong smokers will develop COPD.  An individual who is highly exposed to passive smoking is 48% more likely to present with COPD than an unexposed individual.  Given the adverse effects of cigarettes in terms of COPD, the disease can have a lag period of up to 15 to 20 years.  These rates have significant health implications for the medium and longer term.<\/p><p> We have heard a little about passive smoking already.  What was said applies to those with COPD.  While the workplace ban has limited the number of places in which people can smoke, passive smoking has a huge impact on people with COPD.  Our members tell us that smoking poses a problem daily as people must walk past smokers on the street or gathered outside public buildings, such as hospitals, pubs or caf&eacute;s.  Even being in a vehicle where smoking has recently occurred can induce a coughing fit and immobilise a person with COPD.  It is very important to reduce the number taking up smoking rather than just restrict the number of places where people can smoke.<\/p><p> COPD is adversely associated with socioeconomic status.  The effects are reflected in the risk factors for the disease.  The smoking rate in Ireland among those in the most deprived social groups is high compared with the national rate.  Among homeless men in Dublin, the smoking rate is 78%.  These social and economic gradients are reflected not only in the prevalence of smoking but also in the prevalence of COPD and the outcome for those with COPD in terms of morbidity and mortality.<\/p><p> COPD Support Ireland fully supports the Bill to standardise the packaging of tobacco.  Smoking is a dominant cause of COPD.  Discouraging young people from taking up smoking is a key preventive measure in tackling the disease.  On seeing a mock-up version of a potential plainly packaged box of cigarettes, a 50-year-old woman commented: \"I wish I had never started smoking.  I would not have taken up smoking if those images were on the packs.  You would be mortified to take that out\".   The statement was made by Paula, who smoked ten cigarettes per day from the age of 16.  She is present today in the Visitors Gallery because she is determined to prevent and passionate about preventing others from taking up smoking.  She believes plain packaging will have an impact.<\/p><p> COPD has a considerable impact on the quality of life of all patients.  It involves long-term medical care and, for many, frequent hospital admissions for the treatment of exasperations, which often result in premature death.  As with many chronic conditions, COPD not only affects the patient but also has a significant impact on the family, carers, health services and wider society.  Given that 90% of cases are caused by smoking, it is imperative that we act now to minimise the potential of future generations from taking up the addictive habit.  The Bill represents an important step towards protecting young people and future generations from addiction to tobacco products.  The swift introduction of the legislation will ensure that the health of Irish citizens is prioritised over the efforts of the tobacco industry to weaken and delay a significant public health protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Peelo","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391076300,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I thank all the delegates for their very informative and sobering presentations.

We have heard this morning a series of absolutely shocking facts.  One in every two smokers will die of a smoking-related illness.  The ASH presentation stated 100 people will die this week of smoking-related illnesses.  The tobacco industry is an industry of death.  While we obviously welcome the reduction in recent years in the prevalence of smoking, which is now down to 22%, much more needs to be done.  Plain packaging is required to prevent 50 people taking up smoking per day, which number is required to maintain the overall number of smokers.  It is predominantly young people who take up smoking.<\/p><p>  It was suggested that the Australian experience shows that it is not only plain packaging but also the size of the packaging that has an influence.  Do the representatives believe the size of packaging should be covered in the legislation?  The Australians have reduced the size of packaging in addition to introducing plain packaging.  The introduction of a quitline is a helpful suggestion.<\/p><p>  I said on the last occasion that what we really need from the representatives appearing before us is a very clear indication that they are absolutely satisfied that plain packaging will reduce the attractiveness of cigarette smoking among younger people.

This is a slam dunk and everybody who cares about health will support this Bill.  We need to get it shepherded through as quickly as we can.  All the arguments about smuggling and illegality are entirely bogus.  I believe in my heart, and I believe the evidence is clear, that the tobacco industry directly and indirectly profits from the sale of illegally smuggled cigarettes, which are their own products.  They also indirectly profit from the sale of illegally produced counterfeit cigarettes because anything which provides cheap cigarettes to impressionable young people who may have limited financial resources, which hooks them and addicts them to nicotine from tobacco smoking at an early age is in their long-term interests.  The industry therefore does not really care about that; all it cares about is selling cigarettes.  Anybody from the tobacco industry who espouses any position other than one which honestly says, \"We want to increase sales of tobacco products\" is lying.  It is that simple.<\/p><p>  We also need to foster the notion of ethical business.  As the committee may know, I have put out an idea that we should pick some future date and say that after that time it will be illegal to do for-profit commerce in carcinogenic tobacco.  In the short-term we equally need to think of ways to incentivise individual businesses to get out of the tobacco supply chain.  I do not mean to moralise about mom and pop corner shops.  As I have pointed out at this committee before, my own father, Lord rest him, used to run a shop called \"Jack's cigar store\".  He used to sell tobacco in Brooklyn, New York, many years ago.  The culture is different now, however, and people understand that smoking causes cancer.<\/p><p>  People in any shop, be it a local retail shop or garage, who are selling cigarettes are part of the problem and they need to understand that.  The Government needs to think of clever ways of incentivising people to get out of that business, perhaps by having differential VAT rates on all products for shops that declare themselves to be tobacco-free zones.  One would therefore pay a little less VAT if one went to a shop that committed itself to not having tobacco.<\/p><p>  What about those nice pictures we have on the tobacco boxes now?  Why not have a life-size poster of that mandatorily put up in every shop that sells tobacco, saying: \"The proprietor of this shop sells these products\"?  A nice big picture of somebody with an advanced tumour, a gangrenous leg or an oxygen mask could be put in every shop.  Let people know exactly what they are doing. <\/p><p>  I also hope this Bill passes for another reason.  Those who heard the news this morning will realise that the House of Lords - that second great upper Chamber of these islands - passed an amendment last night to the Child Welfare Act which would make it illegal to smoke in cars where children are present.  That comes two years after that legislation was introduced here.  For the past two years, it has been interminably glued up in the bureaucracy, so it needs to pass.  As of today, 30 January 2014, this Government has passed one piece of smoking legislation, which is to make it easier to sell cheap cigarettes, although I know that is not the intent of the Minister or the Government.  That legislation was forced on them by commercial courts and international precedence, but that is the scorecard as of today.  It could be fixed quickly with the rapid passage of several pieces of legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000008#G00200","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1391076900,"counter":641,"content":"<p>To be fair to the Minister, he explained the reasoning and rationale behind the delay in the Bill which he co-sponsored.

I am concerned that it is 50 years since the first major report was published in the United States setting out the real risks of smoking and the health difficulties is was causing.  While we have moved on somewhat in 50 years, we have not really got the message across to a large percentage of the population around the world.  In most countries, well in excess of 20% of the population are smoking.  I hope that whatever progress has been made in the last 50 years, we can at least treble it in the next ten years.  Are we doing enough to get the message across even on simple issues?  Despite the economic downturn during the past five to six years, it is costing a person who is smoking 20 cigarettes per day well over &euro;3,500 per year in real terms.  We have highlighted the health issues but I am not sure we have highlighted the financial costs.  Should we not also examine that aspect of campaigns?<\/p><p>  The real financial cost of cigarettes should be highlighted as well as the cost healthwise.  For instance, if a person decided not to smoke 20 cigarettes a day, they would save &euro;3,500 per year, which is the price of two holidays.  We have not been that subtle in the way we are providing such information.  It is something we should examine.  It is right to highlight the health risks but we should also focus on the financial benefits of giving up smoking.  Perhaps the witnesses could give us their own views on that.  In addition, how can we fast-track reducing the numbers further?  In fairness, all the witnesses are doing their own job in selling that message but I wonder what their plans are for the coming three to four years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000008#G00600","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1391076900,"counter":645,"content":"<p>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1391076900,"counter":646,"content":"<p>I also welcome the contributions and thank witnesses for attending the committee.

Deputy McLellan asked about the Tobacco Products Directive.  An incredible amount of lobbying was done around that directive by the tobacco industry.  A lot of this took place during the Irish EU Presidency and an Irish civil servant remarked that he had never seen that extent of lobbying and the sheer volume of lobbyists there.  Despite that, the Tobacco Products Directive has been passed and will do a number of things, including introducing important regulations concerning e-cigarettes.  Menthol cigarettes are also covered by the directive.<\/p><p>  A question was also asked about the number of smokers who were quitting in Australia but it is only a year since plain packaging was brought in there.  The research I referred to shows, for instance, the high rate of people who are telephoning the quitline, which is a good indicator of intention to quit, although the number who will quit will not be as high.  My former colleague, Ms Norma Cronin, who is on the board of ASH, will say it is very important that in the first instance, a person has an intention to quit.<\/p><p>  Many members referred to branding.<\/p> <p>It was one of the issues considered In the report commissioned by the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society.  People who have contact with teenagers know that branding is of significant importance to them.  It is part of the sense of belonging to the group.  It creates a sense of status and belonging.  It is the hook that brings in the young person.<\/p><p> I was asked how the legislation could be improved.  Deputy Seamus Healy asked whether the size of the packet had an influence.  We have suggested in our submission to the joint committee that standardising the size of the packet of cigarettes is important - this is backed up by evidence from Australia - in other words, that tobacco companies should not be allowed to change the size of the packet, in particular to produce smaller neater packets because size can be relevant.  We want the legislation to ensure there is a standardised size of a packet of cigarettes.  Much has been done.  Senator Colm Burke referred to the US Surgeon General's report of 50 years ago, but as Deputy Dan Neville said, the report of this committee was very relevant in setting the tone for the workplace smoking ban.  A great deal has been done, therefore, in a relatively short period.  In that time we have succeeded in de-normalising smoking, in other words, smoking is not considered generally to be a normal activity.  For many who are addicted, this is too late.  We have to ensure, however, that there are sufficient supports in place for those who are heavily addicted to cease smoking.  <\/p><p> Senator Colm Burke asked me to outline the Irish Cancer Society's plans.  We have a specific programme with a number of women in two disadvantaged communities in Dublin designing a model which will support them specifically in giving up smoking.  The normal advertising messages to quit smoking are not sufficient for particular groups in society.  Their smoking habit is linked with other factors such as poverty and dependence.  We are designing a particular model and when we have it later this year, we will be very happy to talk about and share it with members of the committee.  This is one of a series of developments which, as Dr. Ross Morgan said, represent ground-breaking legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000008#G01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen O'Meara","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391077500,"counter":651,"content":"<p>Let me respond to Deputy Sandra McLellan's questions.  Ms Martina Anderson, MEP, has been fantastic and stood up to what Ms O'Meara identified as the massive industry lobbing in the European Union.  Her work has had a deep impact, but having said that, the Irish Heart Foundation would have been quite disappointed with the voting on the tobacco products directive.  On a positive note, the graphic warnings on plain packets will make them much stronger, but on the issue of slim cigarettes which are aimed at young girls, MEPs from other countries turned.  One tobacco company alone had 161 lobbyists working on this issue, whereas it was registered in the EU register of lobbyist as having only seven.  It was the fourth largest supplier of cigarettes in this country.  Let us think of how many people are working on co-ordinating the anti-plain packaging campaign.<\/p><p>  Some 78% of smokers start to smoke before the age of 18 years, which is the reason the tobacco industry knows it must get new customers.  Tobacco products kill their customers and the industry must replace them.  As somebody mentioned, it needs 50 new smokers a day, most of whom will be children and young people because they account for the majority who start to smoke.  It was mentioned in the context of addiction to illegal drugs that they were not branded, but people still use them.  We must remember that the main purpose of the legislation is to stop young people from starting to smoke.  For people who are already addicted, it is another issue.  It has been shown in Australia that there has been a 23% reduction in the numbers smoking outdoors; therefore, the packaging used is having an impact on current smokers.  We also know that cigarettes are addictive.  There is evidence that the tobacco industry is making them more addictive by increasing the nicotine content to hook people and frustrate tobacco control efforts.<\/p><p>  Deputy Seamus Healy asked if the use of plain packaging would reduce smoking rates.  As my colleague, Ms O'Meara said, we carried out research with focus groups of young people that showed that in 100% of cases those who had not started to smoke were less likely to start; that those who had started but were not addicted would stop immediately and that those who were addicted were going to try to stop.  That was the message across 100% of the people to whom we spoke.  When they spoke about the packaging currently used, they talked about how it made them feel more sophisticated, richer, more glamorous and cooler, whereas the plain package would actually turn that concept of peer pressure on its head by making them fear judgment and shame from their peers and saying they would quit immediately.  As far as we are concerned, what more conclusive evidence could young people give us?<\/p><p>  Let me deal with the question of smuggling and counterfeiting.  The tobacco industry and the groups it funds bang away at the argument that plain packets will increase the number of counterfeit cigarettes, but the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue are absolutely categorical that there is no evidence that plain packaging fuels smuggling in any way.  Counterfeiting is not an issue because only a very small amount of illicit tobacco coming into the country is counterfeit, the vast majority comes from the legal industry.  Let me give an example.  Exports of cigarettes to Andorra increased from 13 million cigarettes in 1993 to 1.52 billion in 1997, the equivalent of 130 cigarettes a day for every Andorran man, woman and child.  Most of these cigarettes ended up back in the United Kingdom on the illicit market.  As Senator John Crown asked: &quot;Who makes the profit from that?&quot;  The legal tobacco industry makes the profit.  The Minister for Finance said in November 2013 that he was concerned about the legitimate tobacco industry being involved in illicit trade.  There are repeated remarks about this, in particular, in the United Kingdom.  The Chairman of the UK Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge, MP stated:<blockquote>The Department [HMRC] has failed to challenge properly those UK tobacco manufacturers who turn a blind eye to the avoidance of UK tax by supplying more of their products to European countries than the legitimate market in those countries could possibly require.  The tobacco then finds its way back into the UK market without tax being paid.<\/blockquote>The supply of brands of hand rolling tobacco to some countries in 2011 exceeded legitimate demand by 240%.  That highlights where the fuelling of this illicit trade is taking place.  The tobacco companies state the smuggling rate is around the 30% mark at a time when it has  been reduced from 16% in 2009 to 13% now.  That is not to say we do not have a problem because the average rate of smuggling in EU countries is 11%, whereas it is 13% in Ireland, but it is nothing like what the tobacco industry states it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Macey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391077500,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I will try not to repeat what has been said.  In response to Deputy Sandra McLellan who asked if we were supportive of the tobacco products directive, we are.<\/p> <p>Banning flavoured cigarettes is a significant measure in terms of stopping young people smoking.  They are very appealing to teenagers.  We were disappointed that the warning size was reduced to 65%.  We would have liked to have seen the maximum warning size adopted.  <\/p><p> Mr. Macey has already touched on the age profile.  A total of 50% first-time smokers are under 15 years of age and 78% are under 18 so it highlights the fact that this is a child protection measure.  Branding has been stopped in public places and advertising has been stopped but a packet of cigarettes at home where there are young people and where their parents smoke is a key branding tool for the industry.  <\/p><p> Deputy Healy spoke about the numbers in Australia, which was touched upon earlier in terms of the quitline number being on the packs.  We would fully support the quitline being included on the packaging.  There has been a 78% increase in calls to the quitline in Australia so it demonstrates that this is a measure that will, hopefully, stop existing smokers smoking.  <\/p><p> I will address the questions from Deputy McLellan and Senator Burke regarding the risk of smoking, getting the message across and branding.  Branding is aspirational.  It sells something that somebody wants to be and it is really important that tobacco packaging demonstrates that the only things you are aspiring to if you use this product are ill health and death.  It has to send the message that if you smoke, you have a 50% chance of dying.  At the moment, allowing the tobacco industry to use coloured packaging in the same way as every other product says \"try me\" and \"buy me\" to young people.  It needs to be treated like the individual unique product it is and the packaging needs to be unique.  <\/p><p> Senator Burke asked about the financial implications of smoking.  The personal financial implications are a strong message to put forward.  Ms Cosgrove outlined in our opening statement the cost of smoking.  People with asthma miss 12 days of work and ten days of school each year.  One can add to that people with other respiratory problems.  These are not just smokers.  Passive smoking is a huge issue for people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.  One of our patient advocates spoke recently about needing emergency care after being at a hurling match where someone was smoking.  Even in outdoor areas, someone smoking nearby can stop you going to work, which has an add-on effect for the State.  More worryingly, one in five children in the State has asthma and 22% of adults smoke.  Therefore, the children of smokers are in the home and in the car with people with smoking.  This all adds up to a huge burden on the State in respect of health care so the financial implications are not just personal.  There are implications for the State.  A recent Philip Morris report stated that the loss in revenue from standardised packaging would be &euro;125 million.  When one compares that with the cost of treating smoking-related illness, which is estimated to be about &euro;4 billion each year, it is minuscule.  <\/p><p> Senator Burke also asked about how we can further reduce smoking prevalence.  The measures contained in the Tobacco Free Ireland policy document are very ambitious and will go a long way but it is imperative they be implemented as speedily as possible.  Measures like banning smoking at bus stops, around schools and in public places can help.  Deputy Healy asked us to confirm that we are absolutely satisfied that this Bill will reduce smoking prevalence.  I can confirm that the Asthma Society of Ireland fully supports this Bill and believes it will go a long way towards reducing smoking prevalence in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000009#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391078100,"counter":654,"content":"<p>Does Dr. Morgan or Ms Cronin wish to speak?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000010#J00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391078100,"counter":655,"content":"<p>There is unity here.

I have a lot of experience of dealing with people with the addiction and helping smokers to quit.  The Deputy is probably right in that the branding and glamorisation of the packs, along with peer influence and whether their parents smoke, start them smoking.  However, the addiction takes hold very quickly.  We know nicotine reaches the brain in seven seconds.  It is a very fast delivery system.  Most smokers are not smoking out of choice.

We ask everyone what their reason for quitting is.  It is health but the second reason is the cost.

We know from our national smokers' quitline that when we have an ad campaign, we get a huge increase in the volume of calls.  The quitline number will do two things.  It will prompt these smokers to pick up the phone and possibly make their first attempt or get the information about quitting.  Second, it is a very cost-effective measure when one considers what we must spend on advertising the quitline number or advertising campaigns so it will do what it says on the pack.

A number of serious facts were presented this morning and I learned a lot.  The Irish Cancer Society stated that 5,200 people die prematurely per year, that 25% of the Irish population smoke, that one in two long-term smokers will die from smoking related diseases and that smoking is an addiction.  Harm from smoking begins immediately and ranges from addiction to serious damage to the heart and lungs.  The earlier children become regular smokers, the greater the risk of developing heart or lung disease, or cancer.<\/p><p>  ASH Ireland stated that our health services spend more than &euro;1 billion annually on tobacco related diseases, that the evidence indicates standardised packaging is less attractive is young people, that tobacco is directly linked to serious diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and asthma, and that the tobacco industry now accepts that nicotine is highly addictive.<\/p><p>  The Irish Asthma Society stated that tobacco smoke is one of the most common and dangerous triggers of asthma attacks, that 470,000 people in Ireland have asthma, that Ireland has the fourth largest prevalence of asthma worldwide and that 60% of people in Ireland have uncontrolled asthma, which means they are at risk of asthma attacks.  One in every ten adults and one in every five children has asthma.  The Irish Heart Foundation noted that socialising remains a key driver for smoking and that the biggest barrier to giving up smoking is a night out.  Smoking is seen as equating to more fun, a way to fit in and an opportunity to interact with others.<\/p><p>  COPD Support Ireland stated that approximately 11,000 admissions to hospitals per year are COPD related and that approximately 120,000 beds are utilised by COPD patients.  It costs &euro;4,086 for an uncomplicated admission and &euro;7,749 for a complicated one.  The average length of stay is nine days.<\/p><p>  The witnesses agreed that packaging offers tobacco companies a powerful opportunity to recruit new smokers, particularly among young people.  They suggested that reducing the appeal of tobacco products can play a vital role in reducing the impact of tobacco on health among Irish adults and children.

I wonder why health matters are not also being included on the curriculum.  Education is central to health awareness, whether that education begins at home, in school or at work.  Over Christmas I spent some time in the company of 15 young people, ten of whom were smokers.  I asked the smokers their opinion of the packaging of their cigarette packages.  Two of them said they would continue to smoke regardless of the packaging but the rest thought the picture on the package looked awful.  However, the picture on the package is the size of a postage stamp.  If we are to promote good health through standardised packaging, we need to put more thought into the image on the box.  In my opinion as a non-smoker, the image is too small.  I got the sense that the aforementioned young smokers did not understand the health risks, and this is why education is important.  It is time that the Minister for Education and Skills examined the way in which health matters are taught, including drug and alcohol addiction.<\/p><p>  I agree with Senator Crown that advertising plays an important role.  What are the witnesses' organisations doing to disseminate graphic images of the diseases caused by smoking?  A massive poster campaign should be developed to reach hospitals, schools, community centres, sports halls and bus stops.  The one thing that lives on in our minds is the image.  The way a baby learns that an apple is an apple is by looking at a picture.  I spent much of the past week in the respiratory unit of St. James's Hospital because my brother is a patient there.  I was shocked that some of the patients with COPD and other respiratory illnesses continued to smoke.  We need an organised effort to disseminate the graphic images of the effects of smoking.<\/p><p>  Two of the aforementioned young people had close relatives who had died of lung cancer.  I was appalled that they continued to smoke despite this impact on their families.  Education begins at home and extends into our classrooms.  All organisations that campaign against smoking need to examine how it can disseminate the message graphically.

The suggestion that a quitline telephone number should be included on packages is a no-brainer and the committee should recommend to the Department of Health that it be included in the Bill.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge that Deputy Crown's passion arises from his professional experience but it is not our role as policy makers to demonise manufacturers and, especially, Irish retailers.  I have 20 years of experience in marketing.  Companies would not spend money on marketing if it did not work.  We should take the opportunity to find positive outcomes because they are equally as important as negative outcomes for those who continue to smoke.  Those who want to quit smoking should have a positive image to strive towards.  When my mother was giving up smoking she set a goal of spending the money she saved on clothes for me.  As a teenager, that was an attractive goal.<\/p> <p>Retail Ireland needs to engage with the Department of Health to provide for a positive campaign for a healthy Ireland and healthy alternatives for retailers around the country.  We have already discussed this issue.  They do not want to sell tobacco.  They know full well that they would earn much more profit from selling something else, but at the end of the day they are providing jobs and a living for themselves.  It is incumbent on us and the Department to try to provide some alternative for them.  Perhaps nicotine replacement therapies should be freely available in all retail outlets, as opposed to customers trying to find a chemist that is open at 6 p.m. on a Sunday.  We need to be part of the solution in providing equivalent incomes for retail businesses in Ireland, as well as providing positive messages for people who want to quit smoking.  As Senator Colm Burke said, we could provide the image of that holiday for the price of a person's ten or 20 cigarettes a day if they gave up smoking, as well as for the improvements to one's lifestyle and overall health.  I congratulate the delegates and urge them to keep going.  We are nearly there and they have the full support of the committee.<\/p><p> I have a question for Dr. Morgan.

What is the source of the quotes Dr. Morgan read?  Where did he get them?

I agree that we need to look at visual, graphic images to help in that task.  Education starts in the home and there has been a cultural change.  My parents were smokers.  Smoking seemed to be a very normal thing to do and I am not talking about all that long ago.  It is still in our psyche that smoking is not going to cause that much damage and that it happens to somebody else, but there is a need to personalise the effects of smoking.  We will be trying our best to promote this approach.<\/p><p>  Because ours is a national network, people with COPD go into schools and publicise the effects smoking has had on their lives.  It is often a very big shock factor for young people to see people with oxygen and learn that this could happen to them as they get older, although with the age gap, people often think it is a lifetime away.  Education is key in that regard.  On Deputy Fitzpatrick's comments, all those facts are very clear, that COPD is a huge burden on Ireland's health service, both financially and in the personal lives of sufferers and their families.  This burden can be reduced by preventing people from getting COPD in the future.  One way to do this is through providing for the plain packaging of cigarettes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000012#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr.  Damien Peelo"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391079300,"counter":669,"content":"<p>On Deputy Regina Doherty's point, a very small proportion of the budget is spent on the marketing side on what the industry terms awareness campaigns which we believe do not work.  We talked a little about education, while Deputy Catherine Byrne talked about where it started.  Education clearly is important, but legislation must support it, too.  Senator Colm Burke alluded to Luther Terry, the US surgeon general, when, finally, the evidence was out that smoking caused lung cancer.  It is 50 years since that happened and in the first 30 or 40 years after that event the industry put up a smokescreen of doubt, controversy, jobs and all of the arguments we now hear when we talk about introducing new legislation.<\/p><p>  The quotations referenced in the submission are in the public domain and would have got into it during the course of the tobacco master settlement in the United States in 1999.  That was the year in which the Marlborough man was retired.  He died this week of COPD, the condition suffered by many of the people Mr. Peelo supports.  It is a very common and increasing condition of chronic lung disease and disability.  He died of that condition.  He was a promoter of cigarettes in his early days as an actor.  More recent quotations may be available.  One would imagine the industry is a little tighter with these quotations now.  Some lip-service is paid to awareness campaigns in some countries, for example, the oft-quoted ones in Germany.  They have done nothing to impact on childhood smoking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000012#L00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ross Morgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1391079300,"counter":670,"content":"<p>The German model is espoused by the pro-tobacco lobby.

That model does not appear to work or be associated significantly with any impact on smoking.  The types of legislation introduced in the past decade have been effective, but we need to go further.  The current rate of 12 to 15 year olds smoking or experimenting with tobacco is around 12%.

Deputy Catherine Byrne talked about having real posters and graphic images.  We know that might work for some, but for young people, some of the research shows that perhaps scare tactics alone will not work.  We need to have what is in the schools, the social personnel and health education, SPHE, programme further developed.  More needs to be done in school programmes.  It is a choice for teachers whether to include it.  It must start with education.

However, something that points to a reduction in prevalence is the tobacco industry's assertion of the loss in revenue that standardised packaging will cause.  If the industry did not believe this was going to cut the amount of people smoking, the figures would be much lower.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Catherine Byrne spoke about the size of the picture.  In Australia the health warning covers 75% to 90% of the packet.  We are in favour of having the health warnings as large as possible, provided it allows for the quit line number to be carried also.<\/p><p>  Deputy Catherine Byrne asked what we were doing about the lack of understanding of health risks.  Smoking, as Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned, is the most common and worst trigger for asthma symptoms.  Smoking is part of everything.  Smoking cessation is mentioned in our clinic advice.  We have clinics to which people go throughout the country and it is included in all of our health information on asthma.  Every piece of information we give includes a smoking cessation message.<\/p> <p>Further to this, smoking cessation is first on the list of priorities in the HSE's national asthma programme as a measure to help people with asthma.  Deputy Byrne spoke about educating young people and Ms Cosgrove will speak about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000012#L00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391079900,"counter":675,"content":"<p>To add to what Ms Kelly stated and to return to Deputy Byrne's question on education and young people, it is something the Asthma Society has been involved over the years.  Last year, we developed and piloted a transition year e-learning programme, which was an interactive module with videos.  We know young people are attracted by branding and engage in risk-taking behaviour, and those with asthma often do not carry their inhalers or might try cigarettes.  We have developed a particular approach which examines education regarding asthma but also, as Ms Kelly stated, includes a component about health and the impact of addiction and smoking on asthma and what to do if smoking or passive smoking triggers an asthma attack.  We are very conscious of this.  We also provide a service whereby asthma nurse specialists go to schools and meet groups of parents, children and teachers to educate them on asthma.  Part of this includes speaking about the impact of smoking on asthma and what to do.<\/p><p>  A question was asked as to whether the Asthma Society should use harder hitting campaigns.  Over the past year we have tried to use harder hitting campaigns, but we must get the balance right between scaring people and educating or empowering them to quit smoking and control their asthma.  We are conscious our messages need to be very clear and need to be harder hitting with regard to the prevalence of deaths and the link with smoking.<\/p><p>  Deputy Doherty suggested the use of positive images and this is something we try to do.  We are very conscious of it, particularly the use of asthma ambassadors such as young people who are involved in sport and have very healthy lifestyles.  We try to ensure we have swimmers and kickboxers in our campaigns because positive images of healthy lifestyles for young people and throughout life are very important and we are building this into our awareness raising and campaign work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000013#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sharon Cosgrove"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391079900,"counter":676,"content":"<p>To answer the Chairman's point, we examined the situation in Germany because it is something the tobacco industry tends to raise.  Specifically we examined it after a number of retail organisations whose interest is supposed to be in smuggling raised it on radio programmes.  We found Germany does not have a mandatory school-based education programme on smoking.  An analysis of the existing school-based programme found it was not effective.  Germany has the same smoking rate for 12 to 17 year olds as Ireland does, which is 12%.<\/p><p>  To address Deputy Fitzpatrick's point on what reduction we seek, I stress the crucial element of this legislation is to stop young people starting to smoke.  The percentage of people who had ever smoked in Ireland in 2002 was 41% and in 2010 it was 27%.  This is the figure we seek to reduce.  It is almost certain to have reduced further from 27% since 2010, but I do not know the figure.  It is a matter of maintaining this reduction.  The youth smoking rate had fallen from 21% to 12% in 2010, and we can be reasonably confident it is lower than this now.  It is a matter of maintaining the reduction of this figure.<\/p><p>  To answer Deputy Byrne, there is no doubt that education is very important.  We cannot have enough education and it is vital.  We also need to take other steps, one of which is to block attempts by the industry to reel in young people.  It has done so successfully for many years.  We know it has incredible amounts of money and that it is ruthless and will stop at nothing.  It does not care about our children's health and it is up to us to protect them with all the measures we need to do so.<\/p><p>  Deputy Byrne mentioned she was surprised to hear people continue to smoke knowing the risks.  A recent survey showed more than 50% of stroke survivors are back smoking within six months.  We also know people who have had amputations because of smoking are often back smoking very quickly.  This shows the hugely addictive nature of cigarettes.  The most important thing we and legislators can do is to stop people starting.  Once people have started they must be helped to quit and we do not do enough in this country in this regard.  The quit programmes in some places throughout the country are good but in many places they are not.  We need to do more.  We cannot let down smokers.  We have a duty of care to them.<\/p><p>  To respond to Deputy Doherty's point, we do not wish to demonise retailers although we have serious issues about some of the representative bodies.  We know most retailers are decent hard-working people who are making a living.  In our opinion they have been duped for many years by the industry, particularly in terms of the bogus smuggling argument.  We would reach out to ordinary retailers throughout the country and do anything to work with them to protect their businesses but also to reduce this element of it.  Likewise we are not out to demonise smokers.  A total of four out of five smokers want to quit and we want to help them do so.  We wish the best of luck to those who decide they want to continue smoking and we hope no harm comes to them, although we know it is very likely to do so.  The four out of five smokers who want to quit deserve our help and we should be doing everything we can to give it to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000013#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Macey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391079900,"counter":677,"content":"<p>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the smoking rate as being 25% but in fact it is 21.7%.   I am glad to say it is lower than 25%.  With regard to the type of reduction we want, we want a tobacco-free Ireland.  The Minister speaks about a smoking rate in Ireland of 4% in 2025.  It is a very ambitious target but we have been making considerable progress, particularly in recent years.  If we continue to do all we are doing and more and stay focused on the target we think it is possible.  Education is the key as Deputy Byrne stated.  The committee will hear from a youth group which has taken part in the exhale programme started by the Irish Cancer Society a few years ago, which is about empowering school groups and youth groups to take on a project themselves.  It has been very popular.<\/p><p>  I wish to quote very briefly from some of the comments from young people we surveyed.  A female teenager stated superslim cigarettes looked really cool and would look really classy on the table.  When the participants were shown the plain packs they stated they would stop smoking when they came out because they turn them off completely, that the pictures look awful and disgusting and one would be embarrassed to be seen with them in one's hand.  This is what we want and expect.  We believe it will work.<\/p><p>  We also favour mass media campaigns and more investment in cessation programmes and quit programmes.  The <i>quit.ie<\/i> programme is very good but we would like to see many more television advertisements.  Some of them are very powerful.  I thank Deputy Doherty for her major support and for the inclusion of the quit line number.  I agree with the point on positive messages.  I also agree with my colleague, Mr. Macey, with regard to retailers.  We know they are trying to earn a living like everybody else.  On behalf of the Irish Cancer Society, I emphasise we fully believe the legislation will reduce smoking prevalence in Ireland, in particular combined with other measures the Government is taking and intergovernmental measures on the illicit side.<\/p> <p>We need more investment in cessation programmes.

The mission of the youth service is to provide a range of quality and professional services to young people in a safe and inclusive environment, contributing to a changing society for the benefit of young people.

We worked hard throughout the summer of 2012 creating an animation, a programme and a workbook that highlighted the dangers of smoking.<\/p><p>  In September of that year, four members of the group went to our local primary school, facilitated our programme, showed the animation and asked the class of 30 students to make a pledge not to smoke.  Each student received a workbook and a wrist band to remind him or her of that pledge not to smoke.  According to one teacher, the students took on board the information provided because it came from their peers.<\/p><p>  In October, we attended a showcase hosted by the Irish Cancer Society to highlight the X-Hale projects and received an award for the creation of our animation.  Due to the positive feedback from our work, we have gone on to secure further funding through the X-HALE Youth Awards to develop our programme further into a training resource pack and to train young people in other projects to roll out an anti-smoking workshop to their peers.  Also in 2013 we contributed some of the activities from our workshops to a resource pack that the Irish Cancer Society is developing for schools and youth projects throughout Ireland.<\/p><p>  As part of our workshop in the schools, we asked the students what information impacted on them the most and 25 of the 30 young people identified the images they saw and the fact that they did not like being a target of the tobacco industry as having the most effect.  We felt as a group that it was important to work from a preventative approach to smoking and that giving young people the right information from people they looked up to as role models would empower them to make positive choices in their future.<\/p><p>  One of the main factors that we highlight to primary school students when we run our workshop is that the tobacco industry must attract 50 new smokers per day to replace those who have either died or quit.  Given that most smokers start smoking before they are 18 years of age, the majority of these new recruits are young people.  Highlighting this to young people has shown to impact on their thinking about smoking.<\/p><p>  Ms Maher will now tell the committee why we as a group of young people believe that the introduction of plain packaging is so important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000016#P00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Danielle Gayson"},{"type":"speech","time":1391081100,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Gayson.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000016#P00500","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391081100,"counter":691,"content":"<p>As a group that focuses much of its work on prevention, we feel that the introduction of plain packaging is an important step towards preventing young people from ever starting to smoke.  By introducing this legislation, we are protecting our future generations by changing young people's attitudes to smoking so that it will no longer be what I may term \"the norm\".<\/p><p>  When we started to consider making a submission, we organised focus group discussions with young people who were both smokers and non-smokers.  We wanted to find out what young people felt about the idea of plain packaging, whether it would impact on their decision to smoke and whether they placed much importance on smoking as an image factor.  They discussed how \"purple skins\" or \"flavoured skins\" were \"class\" and mentioned a friend who, while not a smoker, had brought home pink-coloured cigarettes from holidays abroad because she wanted to have them at a disco to offer to people.  This highlighted to us the importance young people place on how things look and that the appearance of cigarettes plays a huge role in young people smoking.<\/p><p>  Young people discussed the health implications for them from smoking.  Some experienced difficulties with their teeth and lungs and their ability to engage in physical activities and sports.  They expressed that they would not like to see their younger siblings smoking and felt that plain packaging would have a significant impact on preventing young people from ever starting to smoke.<\/p><p>  We feel that young people should have a right to be protected from the marketing of a highly addictive and seriously harmful product.  Plain packaging is one way we can do this.  By making smoking less appealing and health warnings more effective, the misguided opinion young people have that smoking is \"cool\" or \"class\" will be changed, stopping them from smoking in future.<\/p><p>  We recommend that the public health (standardised packaging of tobacco) Bill be introduced as a matter of urgency; that members of the committee appreciate that plain packaging seeks to stop young people from taking up smoking and that branding cigarettes undermines the work of our group; that the Bill take account of the EU product directive on flavoured and coloured cigarettes; that the legislation seek to de-normalise smoking further and be considered a public health measure; and that the Bill take into account the effect of branding on young people and the desire of young people to be seen with a \"cool\" product such as cigarettes.<\/p><p>  We thank the committee for the opportunity to attend and share our group's views today.

The alliance is a network organisation with more than 100 member organisations.  We want an Ireland where children are valued and where it is the one of the best places in the world in which to be a child.  We have been involved in a number of campaigns down through the years, the most important, perhaps, being the constitutional referendum campaign.<\/p><p>  We support the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2013 and commend the Minister on driving it forward.  We believe this is a core children's rights issue.  Other witnesses have articulated very well the type of on the ground issues confronting young people who do not want to smoke.  Article 24 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child holds that State parties shall recognise the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health.  This extends beyond the provision of appropriate prevention or treatment and includes the implementation of programmes that address the underlying determinants of health.  There is no doubting the research in this area, which states that smoking has a detrimental affect on people's health.<\/p><p>  One of the starkest statistics from the recently published Government report, Tobacco Free Ireland, highlights that 78% of smokers commence smoking regularly before the age of 18.  The indication is that this statistic is even higher for the UK.  This is a children and young person's issue.  There may be arguments against this initiative, but the Children's Rights Alliance finds it hard to understand any of them.  The concept that packaging is nothing other than marketing or branding cannot be disputed.  Cigarette companies would not spend millions on marketing and development of these types of fancy packaging if they did not believe it encouraged people to buy cigarettes.  We believe a standard plain package which contains a strong health warning, perhaps similar to the one being introduced in Australia, would be the best way forward.<\/p><p>  Research on the effects of plain packaging of cigarettes is still at an early stage.  However, research from Australia indicates that this type of packaging would result in a reduction in the number of children who try smoking, a reduction in the number of children who become regular smokers, an increase in the number of adult smokers giving up smoking and an increase in awareness among children of the dangers of smoking.  We strongly support this legislation, as we believe this is a core children's rights issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000017#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Gilligan"},{"type":"speech","time":1391081700,"counter":698,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gilligan.

Our vision is of an Ireland wherein all children are heard and valued.  Our mission is to advocate on behalf of all children and to provide a range of independent and unique services that are preventative and empowering in nature.  The ISPCC welcomes this opportunity to address this committee on this issue.  We welcome the proposed legislation and the developments contained therein.<\/p><p>  The ISPCC sees smoking and the targeted marketing of such a fatal product to children and young people as a serious child protection issue.  As an organisation dedicated to the protection of children, we believe children should be protected from the preying marketing of tobacco companies.  We believe this legislation is a hugely important step in improving the protection and welfare of children and reducing the potential for children to begin smoking.  As outlined by Mr. Gilligan and Ms Gayson, 78% of people who smoke began smoking while under the age of 18 years.<\/p><p>  In our submission, we referred to head 3 which outlines the purpose of the Bill.  The tobacco industry requires the continuous recruitment of new consumers, namely, children, in order to maintain it.  New customers are needed to replace those who have quit or died from a tobacco related disease.  The ISPCC works directly with children on a daily basis and has approximately 2,000 contacts per day with young people.  As such, we can readily attest to what is happening with children every day.  We know that children and young people are pressurised by peers to fit in, which is hugely important to them.  If a product is targeted as a fun or stylish product or something that makes a person look and feel better about himself or herself, then clearly it is something in which young people will be interested.  Bad as this is if the product is the latest shoes, clothing and so on, a lot worse it is if it is something that can seriously damage a young child's health.<\/p><p>  The concept of standardised packaging as a means of reducing the likelihood of smoking or making children more aware of the risks involved in taking up the habit of smoking can only be a positive step forward.  Advertising and the normalisation of any form of drug usage can be heavily influential to impressionable young minds.  Recently conducted research by Ignite Research involved direct contact with young people and includes direct quotes from them, some of which stood out for me and my colleagues.  One such quote is: \"It&rsquo;s not even just the cigarettes, it&rsquo;s the packaging.  It&rsquo;s all the swirls on the pack, the colours, they look fashionable.  You kind of want them sitting on the table to be able to say, 'Yeah they&rsquo;re mine'.\"  This would indicate a level of pride being associated with the fancy box sitting on the table.  If that packaging was changed and in future displayed the horrors of what smoking can do to a young person, that level of pride would be taken away and young people would not want it.  Some of those surveyed said that if such were displayed on every box, they would stop smoking because they would be too embarrassed to take out the box.  This is a clear indication of what can be achieved through this legislation.  By changing the branding and packaging, children will not be interested in being seen with this product.<\/p><p>  The ISPCC believes that legislation needs to reflect the influential nature of marketing and advertising on children.  In this regard, there is a duty of care between the Irish Government and its citizens, and in particular a duty for the protection of children.  We believe the legislation should highlight that this is a protection issue.  This is not about packaging or cigarettes or a drug.  It is about protecting current and future generations of children in Ireland.  We believe the legislation should acknowledge this in the context of tobacco products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000017#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1391081700,"counter":700,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Sullivan.

Could the legislation be improved?  If so, how?<\/p><p>  I refer to the statement made earlier that addiction keeps people smoking and branding entices them to start.

Ms O'Sullivan mentioned the duty of care of the Government to citizens, which is very important.<\/p><p>  My questions are mainly directed at the representatives of the Tipperary Regional Youth Service.  They have provided a compelling case and I thank them for that and their work.  They noted that peer education is very important and we must learn more from that.  There is a difference between me going into a classroom and saying smoking is bad and them going into the same classroom, and that work is excellent.  I have no doubt that in a few weeks we will have representatives of the tobacco industry before us saying that they do not market to children as cigarettes are sold behind the counter and they are not allowed to advertise.  I have no doubt they will have charts and so on to illustrate this.  I will feel like telling them to butt out and leave our kids alone.  Is there anything the witnesses would like to ask those people?  I may be putting them on the spot but they can follow up with me afterwards if they so wish.

This legislation will be enacted because it has cross-party support, but will there be a greater temptation for young people in particular to smoke cigarettes that people may bring back from holidays because the packaging will be much more attractive than what will be available in Ireland?  Will there be a temptation to use illegal tobacco products and how would we stop that behaviour?  I have one or two ideas but perhaps the witnesses can add to them.  When people go on holidays they are allowed to import approximately 800 cigarettes per head, but many people bring in numbers way in excess of that, which has a definite impact on the market, in addition to illegal stock.

The longer we can delay a person having a first cigarette, the better chance we have of ensuring they never do it.<\/p><p> Second, one must remember that children are vulnerable by virtue of their developmental capability.

As Paul says, the longer that can be delayed, the better the chance the child or young person will not take up smoking.  Anti-smoking campaigns can work, but they are working more for adults.  Adults can reach a point where they have been smoking for so long, for example, 15 years, that they think it is time to give up.  The campaigns work on that basis, but from our discussions with young people, they look upon lung cancer and other diseases as something that could happen in 30 years.  At present, they are more concerned about looking good, having peers, going out with their friends and enjoying themselves.  Thirty years in the future is completely irrelevant to a young teenager.

I have heard people say that when they start drinking it takes a while to acquire the taste.  Will the plain packaging help?  Would increasing the price of a packet of cigarettes to &euro;20 help?  The problem is that if one starts a price war on tobacco, the smuggling will cause hassle.  What can we do to stop young people smoking?  As I said, it takes a while to get addicted to cigarettes, so what keeps the process going with cigarettes and alcohol?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000019#S01200","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391082900,"counter":733,"content":"<p>It is the image of holding the box and smoking in front of one's friends.

I am only in third year at present and we have been doing different modules in SPHE for the past three years.  In first year it was smoking but we did not really do much about it.  It did not give us any information about how much it can affect us or what it can do to us.  It did not influence people in the class in their decisions on whether to smoke.  In second year we did alcohol.  We had to do a project for that.  It was a little poster about the different things alcohol can influence and the effects it can have.  That did have an influence.  We had a different teacher so it was taught to us slightly differently from how the first year module was taught.  It affected many people in the class.  They all had their own opinions on it and they made their decisions based on them.  It is not really the course that has an influence, but the teacher's means of teaching the course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000019#S01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Danielle Gayson"},{"type":"speech","time":1391082900,"counter":736,"content":"<p>The witness is right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014013000019#S01600","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391082900,"counter":737,"content":"<p>It is not the SPHE class that is influencing us as to whether we should or should not smoke.

We must tackle tobacco at all those levels.  In the case of attractiveness, price is obviously important but it is not the only factor.  If something is attractive enough, people will pay the price for it.  We know that from many other things.  With regard to vulnerability, young people with mental health problems are more susceptible to develop tobacco addictions because they are particularly vulnerable.<\/p> <p>We need to examine that issue.  Obviously availability is a key issue.<\/p><p> The last point I want to make is that the new health strategy should be supported by everybody.
