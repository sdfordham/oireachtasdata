If one reflects on that, she was also aware that he was a potential Seanad by-election candidate and that once he became one, he would have to resign from the board.  Is this a simple ruse?  The Minister ignored the cap of nine members for the board of IMMA and enlarged it to 11 members, a bit like the banking inquiry shenanigans that happened here some time ago.  There is also the further question of why, despite the clear suggestion that a woman would have been the preferred candidate, did the Taoiseach and the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht chose to ignore this.<\/p><p>Some are claiming this debacle is over.

A journalist yesterday said, in the context of the ongoing State appointments row, that what politicians in these Houses know but do not admit is that all Governments have done this.  I will admit that all Governments have because that has been the system.<br\/>It was pointed out that in the American political system, for example, the newly-appointed US ambassador to Ireland - whom I welcome and wish well, following his ratification - will serve for only two years because when the Obama Administration ends all the Democrat appointees will be gone.  If a Republican is elected President, Republicans will be appointed to boards.  That happened in Greece during the bailout process where, I discovered, as others I am sure did, that not only are state appointments made by politicians and governments but revenue collectors are appointed by the government, which has led to enormous inefficiencies.  I am not justifying this.  I applaud the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, for moving very quickly yesterday to send a memorandum to the Government to the effect that appointments to State boards will go through the Commission for Public Service Appointments.<br\/>As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications I went through a process this summer, with my committee colleagues, of sifting through 140 <i>curricula vitae<\/i>sent in by members of the public, in response to an advertisement from the committee.

We interviewed all eight candidates yesterday, which was an exercise in democracy at its purest.  All parties and none applauded it.<br\/>I know that Senator Brennan, who is on the committee, will agree that while the process was very difficult and burdensome because of the time it consumed over the summer, we came up with four people for each board of whom we can feel very proud.  They have come through a very pure democratic process.  I have no idea what, if any, their political affiliations are, and Senator Brennan would say the same.  They are recommended on merit.  I welcome that process.  Maybe now we can take this item off the agenda and focus on the economy, as Senator Mullins says.<br\/>It would be churlish of me not to acknowledge the reduction in unemployment figures.

As a recent graduate of University College Dublin, UCD, I am well aware of what is happening on the front line and in particular of the pressure on academic staff to deliver with less and less resources.  We tend to talk in terms of falling unemployment figures and improved fiscal outlooks and so forth, as though the war on austerity was over but it is not over.  We are living with the results of austerity, particularly in the third level sector.  There is sometimes a lack of sympathy for that sector in the way that there is sympathy for the needs of children.  There is no doubt, however, that the way our universities fare is important for inward investment and for how the wider world perceives this country.<\/p><p>I was very disappointed to see all Irish universities, except the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, effectively fall down the rankings, and continue to fall as they have done for the past few years.  That includes Trinity College, Dublin.  I noticed, however, that the chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority made a few positive points including, for example, that the student contribution of &euro;250 should remain with the universities and not be effectively removed by the State&rsquo;s putting less money into third level education.  That should be considered.  Will the Acting Leader ask the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, to consider that as an immediate response to the crisis in third level education?  I would like the report on the funding of third level education to be expedited and put on the table as a matter of urgency.

It has been interesting to hear the Government state for a number of years that one reason Ireland has had successful foreign direct investment is because of our high standard of education.  Since the onset of austerity, as we call it, resources for universities have been reduced and this would account for the disastrous showings on the rankings.  Although I heard Mr. Tom Boland express the opinion this morning that these rankings are not necessarily the only measurements one can have, their importance is recognised around the world and, therefore, we suffer a great deal from anything that would damage them.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has stated we should not assume that austerity is over but should make sure we get it right.  As a nation, we still are spending more than we are earning and no family, no home and nobody can continue that way.  Consequently, I believe we must consider carefully how we spend and how we earn.  While the figures are very good, and Senator Mullins touched on some of them, we have a long way to go before we relax.<\/p><p>If I may take one further case, one district in our island is out of control, namely, north Louth and south Armagh.  I refer to the amount of smuggling, including the smuggling of cigarettes, tobacco and alcohol, and diesel laundering that is going on there, which is so out of control that it appears to me as though there is a Mafia up there, running it on both sides of the Border.  To a large extent, Members know how this must be solved.  Something similar was experienced in Dublin some years ago and it was not until the death of Veronica Guerin that suddenly the Government and the Garda decided to do something about it and to move on it.  I believe the death of Adrian Donohoe in Lordship, County Louth, should have been the point, as was the death of Veronica Guerin, when it was decided that something must be done about this.  Apparently, it was known who killed Veronica Guerin but the State had difficulty in bringing him to court.  Similarly, I believe there is strong knowledge as to who were the culprits in the case of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe.  The Garda and the Minister must move on this as it is something with which we cannot live any longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200004#C00700","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412243400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Cronyism, favouritism and jobs for the boys and ladies has been a topical issue in both Houses for the past week or so.

It involved 129 highly qualified people and that working group had the difficult task of reducing the number down to eight, that is, four to RTE and four to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  As Senator Mooney noted, we have been taking part in this exercise for the past two months or more.  Yesterday, we interviewed those whom we had chosen from their curricula vitae and I feel honoured to have been part of this working group, which chose eight highly qualified people, men and women, who will be a major asset.

This calls for careful examination of the criteria by which universities are judged.  I am unsure whether the Times Higher Education group actually has the right criteria.  I am unsure whether it has the tools to measure the performance of the universities.  That said, the consistent drop is something and it is substantial in both cases, although Trinity has not dropped quite as disastrously as UCD.  Domestic factors are involved in this regard.  We are operating at approximately 45% of the state funding of the highest universities.  The entire university system has changed since I was an undergraduate in Trinity.  The university community is now seven times what it then was, which is an astonishing figure.  Moreover, in the case of Trinity, it is on the same small island site, generally speaking.  Consequently, the relationship between staff and students has been weakened.  In my day, there were three terms, namely, Trinity, Michaelmas and Hilary, there were seven weeks in each term and six students in each tutorial group.  The first of the seven weeks was used to discuss the course in general and to pick up subjects on which the student was to write essays, and over the next six weeks, the essays were presented and were critiqued by the academic and student colleagues.  I believe this has largely been watered down and I believe it was one of the factors that gave Trinity its pre-eminence.  I express concern, therefore, although I am unsure how much can be done in respect of funding.  Governments tend to operate on fairly short-term strategies, and as for investing in the universities with the intention of making money, it certainly will but it is a long-term prospect.  It is a worrying situation which Members should keep their eye on.

This Government committed, when it took up office in 2011, to publish and carry out a national dementia strategy.  A number of steps have taken place since then, including support from Atlantic Philanthropies Ireland in the form of funding, research into the strategy, a call for public submissions and the setting up of an expert working group.  We are now at the stage where the strategy should be published.  During the summer, the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for this area, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, announced that Atlantic Philanthropies Ireland were providing &euro;15 million and that the HSE would match this funding to prioritise the rolling out of the strategy which would include GP training, public awareness and intensive home care.  As recently as 17 September, the Minister of State announced that the strategy publication date was imminent.  I met representatives of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland this week and they are very concerned that the clock is still ticking and that the strategy has not been published.<\/p><p>In view of this I ask the Acting Leader to request the Minister of State to come into the House, preferably with the strategy published or to tell us when it is going to be published and also to outline to us how we are going to roll it out.  Many strategies have been published and shelved.  However, there is a commitment of &euro;30 million for the strategy to be rolled out.

Members of Sinn F&eacute;in are apologists for the murderers of the young man in question so they might be a little more circumspect in their parliamentary language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200007#F01000","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1412244600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Senator O'Donovan raised the John McNulty saga and confessed to eavesdropping and listening in corridors after the Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting.  I have no comment on his eavesdropping skills but my view on this issue has been expressed consistently on the record on a number of occasions.  I have serious concerns about the manner and timing of the appointment of Mr. McNulty to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, but things have moved on.  Mr. McNulty has indicated he does not want people to vote for him and the Taoiseach has advised Fine Gael members not to do so and to respect Mr. McNulty's wishes.  We will have to consider how we vote, in accordance with the secret ballot, and I know the Clerk of the Seanad has sent instruction on this to all Senators.  In the circumstances I will not accede to the amendment sought by Senator O'Donovan.<br\/>Yesterday I asked the Leader for a debate on the new mechanisms announced by the Minster, Deputy Howlin, which received Cabinet approval this week.  It is historic that the Government has now agreed to a revised model for ministerial appointments to State boards that will resolve this ongoing issue at last.  As Senator Mooney very fairly acknowledged, it has been an issue that has affected many Governments.  This week's decision ensures there will be a structured approach requiring that all appointments to vacancies on State boards must be advertised openly on the State boards portal, <i>stateboards.ie<\/i>, operated by the Public Appointments Service.  There will be specified and detailed criteria for the effective performance of a role and these may be determined by a Minister, if necessary.  Applications will be processed through a transparent assessment system designed and implemented by the independent Public Appointments Service.<br\/>I welcome these changes and some colleagues gave examples of existing good practice whereby different committees scrutinised appointments and made them in a transparent and objective manner.  The Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality scrutinised the membership of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and we found it a very useful exercise.  I hope there will be more of this as it is clear there will be a very different system in all Government appointments.<br\/>Senator Paul Coghlan commented on the flogging of a dead horse and referred to the new planning Bill that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, is publishing today.  It is an important Bill that will make significant changes and improvements to the planning regime, particularly by allowing for the imposition of vacant site levies by local authorities, which will free land for building.  The focus the Bill is allowing the construction of housing at a swifter rate than heretofore.<br\/>Senator Barrett referred to the decline in Irish university rankings evidenced in the publication of <i>The Times<\/i>higher education rankings.  As others said, like opinion polls, these rankings always come with a health warning.  There are questions about the criteria used and different ranking systems use different criteria.  The staff-student ratio is only one criterion as is the area of academic citation.<\/p> <p>Everybody who contributed on this did so in a measured fashion, which is appropriate.  While UCD has, unfortunately, fallen in the rankings it is still among the top 200.  Also, it is not true to say there have been dramatic or consistent falls in respect of other institutions.  For example, Trinity College, which was already out of the top 100 has fallen from 129th to 138th in today's ranking, which, while regrettable, is a relatively small fall.  If it was an opinion poll it would be said that it was within the margin of error.  It is important to say that NUI Galway has moved upwards and is now the third ranked university in Ireland.  Also, the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland has for the first time entered the top 400.  It should not be forgotten that there are more than 15,000 universities represented in the rankings.  It is important to bear all this in mind when commenting.<\/p><p>I am happy to support the call by Senator Sean Barrett that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, be asked to come to the House for a debate on the third level sector generally and the many factors that dictate the ranking and status of different universities.  This is not just an issue of resources but the structure of universities and the systems in place and so on.<\/p><p>Senator Mullins referred to Fianna F&aacute;il's history in terms of the filling of board positions with its supporters.  The figures, in terms of Fianna F&aacute;il's approximately 272 appointments to State boards during its final four months in government from December 2010 to March 2011, speak for themselves.  That is an important figure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200007#F01100","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412245200,"counter":91,"content":"<p>They had to be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200008#G00200","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1412245200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>It should also not be forgotten-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200008#G00300","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1412245200,"counter":93,"content":"<p>On a point of order, the Deputy Leader is being selective.

It is genuinely a good news story that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is 11.1%, down from a crisis peak of 15.1% in 2012.  It is hugely significant that there has been a 9% year-on-year decrease in unemployment, with long-term unemployment having decreased by 5.5% year on year.  I know everyone in the House will welcome this.  It is hoped this pattern of decreases will continue into the future.  As I said, this issue was also fairly noted by Senator Mooney.<\/p><p>Senator Mullins asked that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, be invited to the House for a debate on jobs and job creation.  Previous debates on this issue in the House have proved very useful.  I will ask the Leader to facilitate such a debate.<\/p><p>Senator Mullins also referred to the tragic deaths in recent times on farms.  We were all heartbroken to hear about the two little girls involved in the accident on a farm in Cork.  The Senator's suggestion that primary schools educate children about farm and road safety is a good idea.  It might be worthwhile for the Senator to raise that matter with the Health and Safety Authority.<\/p><p>I have responded to some of the questions raised by Senator Mooney in his contribution.  I note the Senator also welcomed the new model launched by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, this week, which marks an historic change in the system of appointments to boards.  We should all applaud the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and Government in this regard.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney also referred to the appointment of the new US ambassador to Ireland.  Unlike here, ambassadors in the US are political appointees rather than civil servants.  We do not have the same system as the US in terms of the election of judges and prosecutors.  There are many ways in which our system bears much better scrutiny.<\/p><p>Senator Hayden also spoke about and called for a debate on the third level institution rankings.  As I said, it would be good to have the Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan, come to the House for such a debate and, in particular, the report on third level funding, publication of which we would all welcome.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn also spoke about the university rankings and the importance in the context of foreign direct investment of high standards in our universities.  He also referred to Tom Boland's important statement that rankings are not the only measurement and that there are other criteria used, some of which may be flawed.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn also referred to the issues of cigarette smuggling and diesel laundering in north Louth and south Armagh and spoke of the tragic death of Garda Adrian Donohoe as being a catalyst for change.  I agree with him on that.  Next Tuesday the Minister for Justice and Equality will be in the House for the Second Stage debate on the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014, which might present an appropriate opportunity for the Senator to raise his concerns relating to the particular area of the country mentioned.  It should be possible to introduce measures that might be of assistance, although I suspect what is needed is policing strategies and measures rather than legislative ones.  It is an important issue which was brought home in the context of the tributes paid yesterday in this House to the late former Senator Edward Haughey who as a major employer brought so much prosperity to the south Armagh area.  That is perhaps a better way of dealing with these issues than the vehicle of terrorist legislation.<\/p><p>Senator Brennan spoke about the appointments to the RTE Authority and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, which again are examples of good practice in terms of the nominees having been required to engage in a process of hearings-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200008#G02300","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1412245200,"counter":113,"content":"<p>That process was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200008#G02400","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1412245200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>-----following which 129 applicants where whittled down to eight.

The Minister will be before the House on the planning Bill at which time issues such as the vacant site levy and Part V social housing issues can be addressed.<\/p><p>Senator Norris also spoke about the university rankings.  I agree with his comments in regard to the need for careful examination of the criteria being used in that regard.  It is also important to say that in Ireland there have been positive increases in recent years in the numbers of students attending third level education.  Ireland has one of the highest proportions of third level graduates across the EU, which is something of which we should be very proud.  Our universities are doing a very good job in terms of raising educational standards in Ireland generally.  When looking at criteria across other countries, it should be remembered that other countries may have much lower levels of participation in third level than is the case in Ireland.  We have also seen considerable success here in terms of the roll-out of campus companies from different universities through good use of philanthropy and philanthropic funding.<\/p><p>Senator Conway welcomed the new structures in regard to appointments to State boards as positive politics, with which I agree.  He also put forward important ideas in relation to how we deal with accidents on farms and address the issue of farm safety generally.  The Senator also called for the Seanad to play a role in this regard and for the Seanad Public Consultation Committee in particular to take it on as its next topic for consultation, which I believe is a good idea.  I would advise the Senator to communicate with the Cathaoirleach on the matter and I will undertake to raise it at the next meeting of the Public Consultation Committee that this be the next issue it addresses.  I agree it is an appropriate forum to try to come up with ideas for the better dissemination of the message on farm safety.  The Health and Safety Authority advertising in this regard is very powerful, but clearly more needs to be done.<\/p><p>Senator Wilson spoke about the McNulty affair and wilfully misquoted Senator Paul Coghlan on the issue of the dead horse, which I do not propose to go over again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200008#G02500","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1412245200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>The record will speak for itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200008#G02600","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1412245200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I propose to ignore Senator Wilson's gratuitous comments about the Labour Party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200008#G02700","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1412245200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Everyone else is ignoring the Labour Party so it does not matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200008#G02800","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1412245200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>It is nice not to be ignored.

The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has said that he has not received representations on that matter.  He will be in the House next Wednesday at which time these matters can be raised with him.<\/p><p>Senator Landy raised the issue of the national dementia strategy, in respect of which issue on Tuesday last I asked the Leader for a debate and commended the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland on its work in this area.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will be requested to come to the House to update us on that strategy.<\/p><p>Senator Thomas Byrne also raised the issue of the McNulty affair.  I have responded on that issue.  As I said at the time the Minister of State, Deputy Heather Humphreys was in the House, we should have a general debate with her on the different issues to do with the arts.  We have considerable expertise in this area in the Seanad, in particular, Senator Mac Conghail.  It would be worthwhile having such a debate.<\/p><p>Senator Naughton spoke about the Irish Hotels Federation quarterly barometer survey which again was a good news story.  The Senator noted that there had been a 10% increase in tourism figures last year and pointed to the success of the 9% VAT rate in this area.  I commend the Senator on raising this important issue less than two weeks out from the budget.  Continuation of the reduced VAT rate is one of the key issues we hope to see addressed in the budget.  I am sure everybody in the House would agree.<\/p><p>Senator Michael D'Arcy also spoke about the good news story of the decrease in the unemployment figures and suggested we have a debate on ideas for the budget and job creation, which debate would be well worth having, even after the budget.<\/p> <p>We should have that debate on job creation.  I note really creative ideas, for instance, around apprenticeships.  There was good news yesterday, when Waterford Crystal has for the first time in years taken on new apprentices in the high-skilled glass-blowing sector.  That is really positive news for Waterford and the south east to see that recommencing.  We might have a useful debate on that with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  We will also have statements on the budget on 14 October and Deputy Bruton has promised to come into this House shortly after Halloween to a debate, as we might focus on job creation with him.<\/p><p>Senator Comiskey raised farm safety and I have already spoken on that.<\/p><p>Senator Eamonn Coghlan, on the McNulty affair, pointed out the Taoiseach had recommended to his members not to vote for Mr. McNulty to respect his wishes.  The Senator also spoke on the board of the paediatric hospital and the issue of planning for a maternity unit at the same time as planning permission is submitted for the children's hospital.  It is an excellent idea to ask the Minister that.  It might be done as a matter on the Adjournment.  I was personally involved with the submission from the Coombe hospital, which looked to have the sight of the children's hospital co-located with the Coombe.  There is a plan to develop the Coombe hospital, which is a maternity hospital local to the St. James's site that was ultimately chosen.  It is possible to open up a swift corridor between the two sites and that might be something the Senator could pursue directly with the Minister.<\/p><p>Senator Gilroy pointed out that section 836 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 was an obscure anomaly which appeared to allow Ministers to be exempt from certain charges.  I would agree with Senator Gilroy and commend the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the Government for closing this loophole swiftly when it became apparent.  Sinn F&eacute;in did attempt to make some political mileage out of it but I would agree with Senator Gilroy that the term sickening is far more appropriate to use about that party's own actions.  That really came home to us all when we saw Brendan Megraw's body discovered finally 36 years after his disappearance, and after his mother had died.  Hearing his family speak about the heartbreak they have been through in the past 36 years brought home to all us what sickening really means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200008#G02900","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412245800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Senator Denis O'Donovan has moved an amendment to the Order of Business: &ldquo;That the debate with the Taoiseach on the appointment of Mr. John McNulty to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art be taken today.\"  Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200009#H00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1412245800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200009#H00300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"vote","time":1412245800,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 13; N\u00edl, 19.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paschal Mooney and Diarmuid Wilson; N\u00edl, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden..<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200009#H00400","aye":["1157","1116","1128","1136","1139","1127","1123","1115","1154","1145","1155","1164","1176"],"nay":["1148","1138","1150","1165","1151","1124","1158","1160","1117","1172","1152","1173","1162","1132","1118","1187","1153","1163","1143"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412245800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That the Order of Business be agreed to&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Bill 2013: Report and Final Stages","time":1412246100,"counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200010#J00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1412246100,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Before we take Report Stage, on a point of order, may I ask for some information about the rather unusual fact that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has seconded several Fianna F&aacute;il amendments to this Bill.

I do not see why we should be so craven and give in to the media's demands, suck up to the press and let them have access to information of this nature.  I am very much inclined to go back to the original legislation and exclude private communications between two or more members of the Government.  Including it only means certain matters will be discussed off the table and there will be no record.  We will be deprived of the historical record in 50 years time when the State papers become available.  It does not achieve any positive end.

This is the <i>status quo<\/i>, in as much as I am undoing the amendment made by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government in 2003.  The original legislation was not as restricted.  The balance I have struck is about right.  I understand the point made, and there will be occasions when people may not want to commit to paper some of their views for fear it may be covered by freedom of information, but on balance one could make an argument against freedom of information in its totality if one believes this to be the case.  By and large, best practice internationally shows the usefulness and utility of freedom of information.  For this reason I do not propose to accept the amendment tabled by Senators Norris and Barrett.<br\/>With regard to amendment No. 10, Senator Byrne made a very strong point on Committee Stage on private papers and a requirement of the Houses of the Oireachtas in their Standing Orders to define what they are.<\/p> <p>I do not know whether the Senators have made any progress in terms of raising this matter at the CPP of each of the Houses, subsequent to our last discussion.  That is somewhere it could be debated.  <br\/>There is a definition of private papers that is referenced in this legislation, a  definition that I forgot to mention on the last occasion.  I inserted it into the Houses of the Oireachtas Inquiries Act. Section 42(k) of this Bill provides that FOI does not apply to:<blockquote>a record relating to any of the private papers (within the meaning of Article 15.10 of the Constitution) of a member of either House of the Oireachtas or an official document of either or both of such Houses that is required by the rules or Standing Orders of either or both of such Houses to be treated as confidential.<\/blockquote>The definition of private papers in the Oireachtas legislation that is enacted, and without prejudice of course to the powers of both Houses, individually and separately, to make rules and Standing Orders pursuant to the enabling provision of the Constitution in Article 15.10, in the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013 contains a definition of &quot;private paper&quot; for the purposes of that Act.  In acknowledgement of that, section 42(l) of this FOI Bill provided that the FOI Act does not apply, &quot;unless consent has been lawfully given for its disclosure, a record relating to any private paper or confidential communication, within the meaning of Part 10 of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013&quot;.  There is a definition.  It is reasonably comprehensive because it replicates what we debated on the inquiries Act.  It is still open to the Houses of the Oireachtas to set their own rules on the implementation of the enabling provision of the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200011#K01900","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412247000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I would like to comment on the Minster's response.

If I discussed knowledge I had about a fundamental misconduct of justice that had somebody incarcerated, should my right to privacy be greater than somebody's incarceration?  All rights are balanced against other people's and other rights.  No right, normally, is absolutely fundamental to the point that it supersedes other's rights, even to live, to not be incarcerated or oppressed, or to be deprived of a range of rights.  In those contexts, we can talk in absolutist terms but these things are not absolute.  On balance, my view is that to corral into an immune space all communications between two members of the Government that they deem to be private so that it becomes an impediment, a debar and an impenetrable wall is an assertion that would undermine the principle.

It would be much more important to take the advice of this House rather than the advice of an Attorney General who may well be wrong.  On a maximum fine of &euro;4,000 for defacing records, Garda records, which were a subject of contention between the British and Irish Government and between various individuals in this State and the Garda, regularly go missing.  I feel strongly on this.  The advice of the Attorney General should be taken into the balance, but I would ask the Minister to think again.  This is no deterrent.  If there is a situation, for example, involving financial irregularities, the kind of practice that went on during the banking crisis, does the Minister seriously think a &euro;4,000 fine will deter anybody from covering up or destroying?  I appeal to him to think again about this.  I am sure the Attorney General is a tough enough bird to survive her advice being ignored for once.  I feel strongly about this.  I will call a vote on it.  I beg the Minister to reconsider this and give some indication that he will think of it again.<\/p><p>This is a deliberate act.  This is the destruction of records that are the property of the people.  I spoke about privacy earlier and asked why make private communications available to the mass of the people.  Now we have material that is the possession or birthright of the people being treated casually and its defacement and destruction regarded in so light a manner.  I cannot understand this.<\/p><p>I cannot speculate on the reasons the Attorney General went through it.  Maybe it is merely that she went through a list of penalties, but legislation is often out of date.  In a previous session of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the former Minister of State, Mr. Martin Mansergh, when a Senator, introduced a rack of matters going back to the fact that it was a capital offence to omit the words &quot;Crom ab&uacute;&quot;, the Butlers' war cry, and we had immense fun with this kind of stuff.  I would not say it is merely a matter of running a scan to see what was comparable.  Can the Minister give any indication of comparable offences?  I suppose it is an unfair question.  In case he has any access to that information, what are the comparable offences?  I would like to know them because I do not believe they are anything as consequential as this.  This is a very serious matter.  This is the deliberate destruction to avoid the exposure of certain information that may be detrimental to the career of somebody in the Civil Service.  This is a most serious matter.

I understand some Garda stations have achieved good prices on the open market but that is dependent on their location and condition.<\/p><p>I spoke to some departmental officials about community and voluntary groups taking ownership or a temporary lease on Garda stations for use as youth facilities or for the elderly.  Many towns with Garda stations that are now closed lack community halls, for example.  The Minister of State, who is from County Wicklow, will be aware of the situation.  Communities always seem to be raising money to build a new community hall or other facility.  I hope the Department and the Office of Public Works could work together on the matter and that if decent plans are put in place by local communities, they would be considered before the sale of such premises.<\/p><p>The Garda station in my town was closed.  It is adjacent to the soccer pitch, which is maintained to a high standard by the recently reformed soccer club.  The problem is that the club has no changing facilities or dressing rooms.  At the moment players get changed in their cars and that is not ideal in the winter when the weather can be wet and cold.  The response the club received from the Department is that consideration has been given to the proposal but it is not considered feasible.  The recently reformed soccer club involves a good bunch of young lads like the Minister of State and I who want to keep themselves occupied during the winter.  In fairness, they just want a premises to bring them in from the cold and rain.  They do not need spectacular showering facilities or top-of-the-range dressing rooms; they just want a warm, dry place during the winter.  Would the Minister of State consider offering the building to a club, such as my local football club, on a temporary basis if the cost to the Department would be the same to maintain it?  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200015#P02800","speaker":"1119","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412249100,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Heffernan for his kind words on my appointment.  I very much appreciate them.  I also appreciate the opportunity afforded by the Adjournment debate raised by him for me to update Seanad &Eacute;ireann on closed Garda stations and what has happened to date, and to respond to the question of the cost of maintaining such premises.<\/p><p>In relation to the State's property assets, the Government is committed to reforming property asset management in the public service to ensure value to the taxpayer.  The Commissioners of Public Works manage a large and diverse portfolio of property assets, including historic properties, on behalf of the State.  The authority to dispose of State property is conferred on the commissioners by section 10 of the State Property Act 1954.<\/p><p>The stated policy for closed Garda stations is to identify if other State bodies, including Departments and the wider public sector, have a use for the property.  If no State requirement is identified, the OPW will consider disposing of the property on the open market, in order to generate much needed revenue for the Exchequer.  At a time when we are trying to reduce the rental bill for the State, the first port of call is to see if the closed Garda station could be used for an existing State need, as outlined.  If such is not found, then the option to dispose of the premises on the open market is considered in order to generate revenue.<\/p><p>If a decision is taken not to dispose of a particular property, the OPW will consider community involvement, subject to the receipt of an appropriate business case.  That must indicate that the community and voluntary group has the means to insure, maintain and manage the property and that there is no cost to the Exchequer in the short, medium or long term.  We have a responsibility to maintain the building and while we can enter into licensing agreements we cannot do anything that would in any way jeopardise the State&rsquo;s investment in terms of the building.<\/p><p>To date, eight former Garda stations have been retained for other State uses and 15 stations have been sold at public auction, achieving approximately &euro;1.4 million.  A further 25 are to be sold this year.  Sixteen former Garda stations have been assigned to community groups.  Where Garda stations have been so assigned, those have been generally to community councils that represent a broad range of community and voluntary groups, with links to local SOLAS, community employment and T&uacute;s training and employment schemes.<\/p><p>Decisions taken by the OPW to licence certain properties are based on the following principles, namely, the benefit to the broader community in terms of local services, activities or employment and training opportunities to be achieved from the use of the property; savings to the State of maintenance, service and other costs; and ownership remaining with the State with a re-entry clause at a time to be decided by State requirements.<\/p><p>There are other considerations to be taken into account.  For example, properties with telecommunications masts generate an income in excess of &euro;5 million per annum for the State which place contractual obligations on the OPW and it may be more beneficial for the taxpayer to retain these properties in State management rather than dispose of them.  When retaining properties, the OPW continues to explore uses for them through State bodies and local authorities, in addition to considering community use.  The cost of maintaining the closed Garda stations this year, to date, is approximately &euro;136,000.  With regard to insurance, these former stations are covered by the State&rsquo;s indemnity.<\/p><p>Senator Heffernan has referred to the question of temporary use of the former Garda station in Kilfinane, County Limerick by Kilfinane Forest AFC.  The property was assessed in line with the disposal policy I have outlined and no State use was identified.  The property is now being prepared for disposal on the open market.  In the event that the property does not sell, the OPW could then consider community use.  I will ask my officials to provide the Senator with an update on the timeline in terms of attempting to dispose of the property on the open market.  I will also try to get an indication of how hopeful we are of a disposal.  If the disposal does not go ahead or is not successful, I will ask the OPW to link in with the Senator and the local soccer club to see whether a community use could be identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200016#Q00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1412249100,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

Given the state of the open market, the property could be sold in two weeks or in 12 months.  In the meantime, would it be possible to make the property available for the use of the club?  I do not suggest that a lease would be signed with a community group during the sale process but instead of the property lying idle while waiting to be sold, could the Department come to an agreement with the local club for the use of the building until such time as it is sold?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100200016#Q00300","speaker":"1119"},{"type":"speech","time":1412249700,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I will take the Senator's three questions.
