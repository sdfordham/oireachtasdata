Sufficient cases were selected during a mission to Lebanon earlier this year to ensure that the full quota of 520 will be taken in during 2016, ahead of schedule.  In addition, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 260 refugees from Lebanon in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Under relocation, Ireland has to date taken in 69 Syrians from Greece, mostly families, and a further 40 people are scheduled to arrive this month.

Guidelines for the establishment and operation of such partnership initiatives, including Text Alert groups have been published by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  For many years my Department has provided funding for the administration of the Community Alert Programme, including the work of regional development officers who play a key role in helping to establish local groups, including Text Alert Groups.  Community Alert operates as a partnership between Muintir na Tire and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I was very pleased to secure more than a doubling of the funding available to my Department for such initiatives in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the essential funding to support the national and regional administration of Community Alert programme, I was particularly pleased to announce recently the provision of &euro;100,000 for a rebate of costs incurred by local Text Alert Groups in 2016.  While the costs of running a Text Alert Group are generally quite modest, it is only right that we recognise the considerable efforts involved in organising such groups and make a contribution to the costs which have, up to now, been borne entirely from voluntary contributions.  This funding will cover the cost of approximately 1.6 million text messages for the distribution of important crime prevention and community safety advice.  The rebate scheme is available to all Text Alert Groups registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is being administered by Muintir na Tire and details of the scheme can be accessed on their website, www.muintir.ie.<\/p>  <p>  I intend to keep the question of funding for local crime prevention initiatives under review with a view to continuing to support Text Alert into the future, and taking into account the views of the Garda authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100065#WRB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100065#WRB02300"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[29406\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100065#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress being made on her commitment in February 2015 to allow asylum seekers living in direct provision to have their complaints independently examined by the Ombusdman and the Ombudsman for Children in line with the recommendations of the 2015 working group report, Improvements to the Protection Process, including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers (details supplied); her views on the lack of action on this commitment in principle and the timeline of actions for ensuring that children living in direct provision have access to the services of the Ombudsman for Children.","asker":"1226","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":81,"content":"<p>Work is underway to extend the remit of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children to cover services delivered to persons living in Direct Provision, including children.

Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State by the end of 2017, through a combination of the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focused on resettling refugees from camps in Lebanon.  <\/p><p>Under the resettlement part of the Programme, 520 refugees are to be resettled in Ireland by the end of 2016.  To date, 486 refugees have been admitted to the State and a further 14 are scheduled to arrive today.  Sufficient cases were selected during a mission to Lebanon earlier this year to ensure that the full quota of 520 will be taken in during 2016, ahead of schedule.  In addition, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 260 refugees from Lebanon in 2017.<\/p><p>Under relocation, Ireland has to date taken in 69 Syrians from Greece, mostly families and a further 40 people are scheduled to arrive this month.  A further 63 people have been assessed and cleared for arrival and arrangements for their travel to the State are currently being made.  Last week, IRPP officials interviewed a group of 71 people in Athens who, once cleared for travel, are expected to arrive in November.  Further missions are scheduled for November and December and by the end of 2016 it is expected that Ireland will have accepted up to 400 people through the relocation pledge system.  The intention is to sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its commitments within the timeframe envisaged by the Programme.  The figures are summarised in the following table, as requested by the Deputy.<\/p><p>In announcing the Programme, the Government recognised the importance of addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  The relocation of unaccompanied minors is a complex and sensitive process, involving various aspects of European and domestic law, and any actions taken in relation to this vulnerable group must have the principle of the best interests of the child and the prospect of family reunification at their centre.  Ireland is committed to relocating unaccompanied minors and is actively working to overcome the barriers that have presented themselves in this regard.  Ireland has thus far been able to transfer one unaccompanied minor from Greece.  Further efforts were made to identify unaccompanied minors for relocation by Tusla officials who took part in a mission to Greece last week and these efforts will continue.  <\/p><p><b>Table - Arrivals to Date<\/b><table><tr><th>IRPP Programme<\/th><th>Numbers admitted (as of 11 Oct 2016)<\/th><th>Unaccompanied Minors admitted (as of 11 Oct 2016)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Resettlement<\/td><td>500*<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Relocation<\/td><td>69<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><\/table><i>* subject to scheduled arrival of 14 persons today<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100065#WRB06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100066#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":120,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[29780\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100066#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to reintroduce a dedicated drugs unit in the Cavan-Monaghan Garda division; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":121,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

It is important to note that all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences or otherwise.  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau  leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs supply.  This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  I am further informed that the prevention and detection of drug related offences is a priority within the Cavan\/Monaghan Division and that all Garda&iacute; in the Division, both uniform and detective, are engaged in intelligence-led policing and the undertaking of targeted operations against those involved in drug-related crime.  In addition, Garda personnel from the Division continue to work with the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau in this regard.  I am advised that local Garda management are satisfied that this strategy ensures the optimal use of resources in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country.  This will be achieved though continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000, as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free-up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 members will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.

Section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003 provides for 'agricultural relief'.  The relief takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable market value of the gifted or inherited agricultural property.<\/p>  <p>  The person taking the gift or inheritance (the 'beneficiary') of the agricultural property must qualify as a 'farmer' for the purpose of section 89 CATCA 2003.  This means that a beneficiary's agricultural property must comprise at least 80% by gross market value of the beneficiary's total property at a particular date.  Revenue take the view that land on which solar panels are installed is not agricultural property for the purpose of establishing whether or not a beneficiary satisfies this '80%' test.  Thus, depending on the amount of an individual's land that is actually occupied by solar panels, the use of agricultural land for solar panels may result in a beneficiary's failure to satisfy the '80%' test and to qualify for agricultural relief.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to 1 January 2015, the availability of agricultural relief was essentially determined by the proportion of a beneficiary's overall property\/assets that was accounted for by agricultural property following a gift or inheritance, i.e. the '80%' test as described in the preceding paragraph.  Arising from recommendations made as part of the Agri-Taxation Review in late 2014, additional measures were introduced to ensure the productive use of 'tax-relieved' farmland.<\/p>  <p>  A condition for agricultural relief that applies in relation to gifts and inheritances taken on or after 1 January 2015 is that a beneficiary, or a lessee where the beneficiary leases the agricultural land, must actually farm the land for a period of at least 6 years after taking the gift or inheritance.  As it would not generally be possible to farm any part of the land occupied by solar panels, the change in the use of land from farming to the generation of solar energy within the required 6-year period would result in a withdrawal of some, or all, of any agricultural relief that had been granted, depending on how much of the land is diverted to this alternative use.<\/p>  <p>  It is not clear from the details supplied by the Deputy whether the inheritance was taken before or after 1 January 2015 when some of the conditions for agricultural relief were changed.  Where a beneficiary took an inheritance of agricultural property prior to 1 January 2015 and in respect of which that beneficiary satisfied the 'farmer' test on the taking of the inheritance, a clawback of the relief would occur only where the agricultural property was sold or compulsorily acquired in whole or in part within \u00a06 years of taking the inheritance and where the proceeds were not re-invested in agricultural property within a year of the sale or within 6 years of the compulsory acquisition.  The leasing of the land for an alternative use during the 6-year period would not result in a clawback for inheritances that pre date 1 January 2015.  However, there would be a full or partial clawback of the relief where land was leased for an alternative use for inheritances that are taken after this date.<\/p>  <p>  Any land that is purchased or leased after an inheritance is taken does not form part of the original inheritance and is not taken into account in establishing whether or not a beneficiary qualifies for agricultural relief or continues to be entitled to the relief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100068#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Excise Duties Collection","counter":274,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100068#WRE02550"},{"type":"question","counter":275,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[29675\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100068#WRE02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"to set out the total revenue income from excise and taxes on alcoholic drinks per annum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1346","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":276,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the total amount of revenue from Excise and VAT on alcoholic drinks for the years 2010 to 2015 is as shown in the following table.<table><tr><th>Alcohol<\/th><th>Excise<\/th><th>VAT<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>(Estimated)<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><td>&euro;m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>826.4<\/td><td>1,010.5 <\/td><td>1,836.9 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>829.5<\/td><td>1,014.0 <\/td><td>1,843.5 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>846.1<\/td><td>1,088.8 <\/td><td>1,934.9 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>1,002.0 <\/td><td>980.8<\/td><td>1,982.8 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>1,139.8 <\/td><td>1,053.3 <\/td><td>2,193.1 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>1,136.7 <\/td><td>1,133.0 <\/td><td>2,269.7<\/td><\/tr><\/table>Please note that VAT receipts are estimated, as VAT returns do not require the yield from a particular sector or sub-sector of trade to be identified and the actual VAT yield for any category cannot therefore be determined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100068#WRE02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100068#WRE02750"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[29680\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100068#WRE02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"to set out the amount the investigation of underpayment of taxes by various groups, for example, medical consultants, has resulted in the recovery of taxes, penalties and interest in each of the past ten years from 2006 to date in 2016; the principal groups and occupations so investigated; and the number of back cases identified in each category and group.","asker":"1253","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":279,"content":"<p>It is assumed that the Deputy's Question is referring to outcomes from the programme of compliance interventions conducted by the Revenue.<\/p><p>I am advised that Revenue, generally, conducts compliance interventions based on a range of risk criteria in specific cases rather than by particular sectors or groups.\u00a0 However, sectoral projects are initiated where Revenue wishes to examine practices in a particular sector or where Revenue is satisfied that a high risk of evasion or noncompliance exists.<\/p><p>I am informed by Revenue that detailed statistical information on their compliance programmes are published each year in their Annual Reports.

VAT receipts collected under the Mini-One-Stop Shop (VAT MOSS) scheme are ahead of target.  However, compared to the same period the previous year, VAT internal is up strongly year-on-year to end-September, as is VAT ex-warehouse and VAT MOSS, but VAT at point of entry is down on the same period last year.  I am further advised that VAT internal net receipts would be higher were it not for increased levels of repayments in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Customs, the position is that Customs duties and VAT are payable at point of entry on the importation of goods and services from outside the EU.\u00a0 Customs receipts experienced a number of recent year-on-year increases, with 2015 experiencing a 20% increase relative to 2014.

Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs and the Department does not stipulate how such services are to be obtained.  Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary (or caretaker or cleaner), such staff are employees of individual schools.  My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged.  These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of School Secretaries and Caretakers who are employed using grant funding and to enter an arbitration process if necessary.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for School Secretaries and Caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Arbitrator's recommendations were accepted by both sides.  My Department issued Circulars to schools which gave effect to the measures which applied from 1 January 2016 (i.e. an increase of 2.5% in the hourly pay rate and the introduction of a minimum hourly rate of &euro;10.25) to School Secretaries and Caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and also revised grant rates.  Staff who were not comprehended by the Arbitrator's recommendations will benefit from the pay restoration measures contained in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100069#WRF04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Patronage","counter":346,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100069#WRF04100"},{"type":"question","counter":347,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[29369\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100069#WRF04200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans for the development of a new secondary school (details supplied); if he will update the issue of patronage of the new secondary school planned for the area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":348,"content":"<p>In April 2016 applications were invited for the patronage of nine new post-primary schools to be established in 2017 and 2018, including the new post-primary school to serve the Carpenterstown and Castleknock areas.

It is a matter for local authorities, when assessing individual households, to consider whether rents payable are in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s rent scheme.  Therefore, decisions on whether or not to disregard either a proportion of income or particular sources of income for the purposes of calculating rents are matters for each individual local authority to consider in accordance with their own rent scheme.   <\/p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 allows the Minister to make regulations in respect of various matters to be included in a rent scheme.  These can include the sources of household income that may be assessed for the purpose of determining rent levels.   <\/p>  <p>  Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft framework for a harmonisation of the approach to be taken by local authorities in regard to various aspects of rent schemes.  This includes providing for a common set of income disregards to be applied by all housing authorities in determining a household&rsquo;s assessable income for rent calculation purposes.<\/p>  <p>  These proposals are now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rents for social housing in place across local authorities to ensure that housing supports are fair and sustainable, prioritise those on lowest incomes and avoid creating social welfare traps that may prevent people from either returning to work or to the private housing market.

The sale of the dwelling cannot proceed until a certificate of discharge in respect of the dwelling has been received from Irish Water.   <\/p>  <p>  The Water Services (Amendment) Act 2016 suspended charges for a period of 9 months, commencing on 1 July 2016 and ending on 31 March 2017.  Irish Water customers remain liable for unpaid domestic water charges as it is the law of the land.\u00a0 This Act provides that during any period of suspension of domestic water charges, this shall not count towards the time period for the calculation of late payment charges in respect of unpaid water bills.\u00a0 However, arrears of water charges incurred by households remain to be discharged.   <\/p>  <p>  The Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least 1 year.   <\/p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of the tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants can be included, as can the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner\/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them.  Reckonable income is calculated as gross income.

The Plan sets out a practical and implementable set of actions that aim to increase the supply of homes to 25,000 units per annum by 2020, thereby creating a functioning and sustainable housing system.  This cross-Government plan is divided into five pillars, each targeting a specific area of the housing system for attention.  <\/p><p>Pillar 2, entitled Accelerate Social Housing, provides for a number of actions to increase the level and speed of delivery of social housing and other State supported housing.  Significant funding of &euro;5.35 billion is committed over the period of the plan, reflecting the increased level of ambition, to deliver 47,000 social housing units, through build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, between now and 2021.<\/p><p>Rebuilding Ireland recognises the key contribution that approved housing bodies (AHBs) can make to the delivery of housing supports in Ireland, building on their track record in terms of both housing provision and management.  The AHB sector has evolved in a short timeframe from the traditional grant-funded model to greater use of a loan finance approach, reflecting the prevailing arrangements in other jurisdictions, and maximising the off-balance mechanisms.  Working with the Housing Finance Agency, 15 AHBs with certified borrower status are currently progressing projects across the country.  This is a significant contribution and the Government remains committed to enabling the sector to play a central role in the effort to meet social housing needs.<\/p><p>Over the lifetime of the Action Plan, AHBs will build approximately 4,700 units and acquire or directly lease over 20,700 units using a mix of exchequer capital support, private finance or other borrowings.  All of these units will be secured for social housing use using robust long-term leasing type arrangements known as Payment and Availability Arrangements (PAA) that are usually between 20 to 30 years.<\/p><p>The Government is also committed to a range of other structural, funding and policy supports to increase delivery by AHBs.  Among these measures is the establishment of an Innovation Fund to support the development by AHBs of innovative financial models, such as Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) or mutual bodies, to further enhance the contribution of the sector to the delivery of additional social housing and maximise the opportunity to leverage off-balance sheet funding opportunities.<\/p><p>These actions complement activities that are already underway within the AHB sector to support long-term strategic thinking and facilitate collaboration, alliances and mergers within the sector.  The establishment of a Regulator for the sector, on a full statutory basis, will be a key step in supporting its continued evolution and rationalisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100074#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":659,"content":"<p>Question No. 226 answered with Question No. 200.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Library Services Staff","counter":660,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100074#WRL00900"},{"type":"question","counter":661,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[29546\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100074#WRL01000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the position regarding the obligation on applicants for positions as librarians in county libraries to be fluent in the Irish language; if the obligation has been removed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":662,"content":"<p>In July 2016 new qualifications for library staff were declared that removed the obligation for candidates to be fluent in Irish, in order to be considered for library posts.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2015 a working group was set up to revise the qualifications for professional and non-professional public library grades.

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition), thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  The changes introduced in 2011 were on foot of a Government commitment included in the National Recovery Plan published in 2010, and in the subsequent Memorandum of Understanding with the Troika.<\/p>  <p>  Each year more people are reaching pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision, which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the State pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy. <\/p>  <p>  Where an individual has left employment but has yet to reach the State pension age of 66, they may claim another social welfare payment including Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit.  They will be awarded Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit provided they satisfy the conditions of the scheme including the requirement to be available for and genuinely seeking full time employment.<\/p>  <p>  However, some specific measures apply to someone claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit from a date after their 65 birthday.  These recipients continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  While this is currently up to their 66th birthday, this approach will continue to extend their jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit entitlement continuing for another year when the pension age rises to 67, and indeed a further year when it rises to 68 in 2028.  This eligibility is of course still subject to satisfying conditions such as the &lsquo;genuinely seeking work&rsquo; condition. <\/p>  <p>  Jobseeker activation criteria have been eased for people aged 62 and over.  They are still able to avail voluntarily of an array of supports, which are available from my Department if they wish to return to work, training or education.  However, sanctions will not be applied to this cohort, should they decide they do not wish to engage with the activation process. <\/p>  <p>  Special arrangements have also been made so that the majority of older people in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment will have to register with their local office only once a year and their payments will be paid directly into their bank accounts.

These include that the person must be aged 66 or over, and that they have at least 520 paid contributions, i.e., a minimum of 10 years of paid contributions.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age).  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20 will qualify for a pension at the 85% rate.<\/p>  <p>  Working part-time does not generally reduce entitlement, as part-time workers also pay weekly PRSI contributions, and these will generally be of equal value to the more expensive contributions paid by full-time workers.  Once someone has worked some insurable hours in the course of a given week, they will be liable for a weekly contribution for that week, regardless of the amount of hours involved, and that weekly contribution will be equal in value to that of someone working full time and paying much more into the Social Insurance Fund.  In the event that they are casual workers and have worked no hours that week at all during that particular week, they will generally be eligible for a credited contribution, which again is of equal value to a paid contribution, when calculating the level of pension payment (although a minimum total of 520 paid weekly contributions are required to have any level of entitlement).<\/p>  <p>  If someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.  While this payment is means-tested, it has significant income and capital disregards.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100075#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":724,"content":"<p>Question No. 251 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":726,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[29322\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100075#WRM00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will retrospectively apply home-maker's credits to persons who were home makers pre-1994 in view of the fact that a group of persons are being discriminated against in respect of their pensions and PRSI contributions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":727,"content":"<p>The State pension contributory is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the State pension contributory is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  It does not, therefore, involve the award of credits.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of expanding this scheme would depend on what changes were made to it.  Policy options would include backdating the period from which the scheme took effect from (i.e. to an earlier date than 1994), and\/or converting to a system of credits.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have estimated that the cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost &euro;286m in 2017.  This figure would increase in subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100075#WRM00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Delays","counter":728,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100075#WRM00950"},{"type":"question","counter":729,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[29334\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100075#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cork has not yet received an outcome to an appeal that was assigned to an appeals officer in July 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1261","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":730,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 11 July 2016.

","asker":"1312","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":794,"content":"<p>The overall concern in recent years has been to protect the value of weekly social welfare rates.  Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7 billion, is the largest block of expenditure in my Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. <\/p><p>As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced.  This resulted in one of bands (in respect of those with a yearly average of 20-47 contributions), being replaced with three bands (in respect of yearly averages of 40-47, 30-39, and 20-29 respectively).  These additional bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions. <\/p><p>Prior to these changes, someone with a yearly average of 47 contributions qualified for the same rate of payment (98% of the maximum rate) as someone with a yearly average of 20 contributions, despite generally their much more significant PRSI record, and regardless of their means.  A person with an average of 48-52 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 more than someone with a yearly average of 20 PRSI contributions.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>The principle that the amount of pension paid should reflect the PRSI contributions paid over a working life needs to be adhered to if we are to be able to fund pensions into the future.  Given the requirement to make savings in recent years, it was considered more equitable to address this disparity than to reduce the rate of payment for all pensioners by an across the board cut in payment rates.  Such a cut would have reduced the incomes of the most vulnerable pensioners, who do not generally receive reduced rate contributory pensions, but rather receive a non-contributory pension, or a maximum rate contributory pension.<\/p><p>For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a full rate State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;222, or just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if a person&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;209, which is just less than 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory).<\/p><p>It is estimated that the exchequer savings arising from the existing rate bands will be &euro;50 million in 2017, and that this will rise at a rate of some &euro;10m annually.<\/p><p>The measure introduced in September 2012 is a step towards a total contributions approach by aligning the rate of pension payment more closely to the number of contributions paid over a working life.  This means that people who contribute more will receive a higher rate of pension.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100076#WRN01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Live Register Data","counter":795,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100076#WRN01150"},{"type":"question","counter":796,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[29871\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100076#WRN01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons on the live register two months before and two months after the Young Ballymun Youth Guarantee pilot scheme ended.

I understand that there is to be an appeal to the Supreme Court. <\/p>  <p>  Because of the separation of powers, the Philippines government cannot interfere in ongoing judicial proceedings. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is concerned for the wellbeing of this Irish citizen and, both at political and official level, we regularly raise this case with senior Philippines Government representatives and we have made our concerns very clear. <\/p>  <p>  I have personally raised my concerns with senior Philippines Government contacts, including most recently three weeks ago in New York when I met with the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines Government. <\/p>  <p>   For any Irish citizen subject to criminal proceedings abroad, my Department officials will offer non-judgemental advice and any appropriate practical help that they can, irrespective of the alleged offence, and regardless of whether the individual is ultimately deemed to be innocent or guilty, is on remand or has already been sentenced by a court of law. <\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s priorities in cases of arrest or detention focus on ensuring that the Irish citizen involved is not discriminated against in any way on account of his nationality, has access to appropriate legal representation, and that the authorities in the country where he is being detained fulfil their obligations in relation to ensuring the citizen&rsquo;s health and wellbeing.  <\/p>  <p>  It is also the Department&rsquo;s policy to raise promptly with the relevant local authorities concerns that a detained Irish citizen may raise about their safety or treatment.<\/p>  <p>  My Department officials at headquarters in Dublin, at our Embassy in Singapore, which is accredited to the Philippines, and our Honorary Consul in Manila, have all been engaged in the case, have provided consular assistance fully in line with our general policy approach, and have raised the individual&rsquo;s concerns with relevant authorities in Manila.  The case has also been raised formally with the Ambassador of the Philippines to Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the case has been further complicated by the domestic environment in the Philippines since July and the severe counter-drugs actions being pursued by President Duterte.    <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputies that the Philippines authorities are fully aware that I and my Department are following this case closely, and that we are concerned about the individual&rsquo;s health and wellbeing. <\/p>  <p>   I would like to acknowledge that this is a very difficult time for this individual and also for his family. <\/p>  <p>  My Department officials, especially our Embassy in Singapore and our Honorary Consulate in Manila, will continue to maintain contact with this citizen and his family, and will provide whatever further appropriate consular assistance we can. <\/p>  <p>  More generally in regards to recent reports on the approach towards the war on drugs which is currently underway in the Philippines, I expressed my concerns in this House on 16 September.  Ireland opposes the use of capital punishment and has consistently called for its abolition in the United Nations and other fora. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports the recommendations which were set out following a UN General Assembly Special Session on effectively addressing and countering the world drug problem held in April 2016.  The UN set down that states should promote proportionate policies for drug-related offences, and promote and implement criminal justice responses to drug-related crimes that ensure legal guarantees and due process safeguards. <\/p>  <p>  The impact of drugs on individuals, families and society presents a significant challenge for governments and the wider international community.  Effectively addressing and mitigating their effects requires active and proportionate engagement, utilising both public health and criminal justice approaches, and full compliance with international law and international human rights standards.  I welcome remarks made by President Duterte and my counterpart in the Philippines, Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay, in which they have reiterated the Philippines Government&rsquo;s commitment to respect human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100076#WRN02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Advocacy Groups","counter":806,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100076#WRN02050"},{"type":"question","counter":807,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[29361\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100076#WRN02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a bank recently closed the account of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, IPSC, and that the official reason stated was that the IPSC is associated with a high risk country; his views on whether this is insulting to the Palestinian people; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1309","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":808,"qnumday":295,"qnumall":"[29757\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100076#WRN02200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on the recent closure of bank accounts of an organisation by a bank (details supplied); the interventions he is taking with regard to this closure; the supports he is offering to the organisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":809,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 284 and 295 together. <\/p><p>The regulation of the banking industry is a matter for the Minister for Finance, and the assessment of risk is a commercial decision for the banks themselves.

It was originally anticipated that a technical hearing connected to the audio-visual evidence review would take place on 2 October.

Our immediate and ongoing efforts are focused on pressing the case with the Egyptian authorities for a positive response to the application made in August under Presidential Decree 140. <\/p>  <p>  I have regular contacts with my Egyptian counterpart, Foreign Minister Shoukry, on this case.

However, there have been further important developments since then, in particular a proposed resolution at the UN Security Council which sought to restore with immediate effect a cessation of hostilities, permit unimpeded humanitarian access, renew a political process to end the Syrian conflict, and immediately end all aerial bombardment and military flights in Aleppo.    <\/p>  <p>  Ireland, along with all our EU partners co-sponsored this resolution. <\/p>  <p>  I deeply regret the Russia chose to veto this resolution.  Russia has chosen on 5 times to use its veto to prevent UN action to protect the population of Syria.  I believe that Russia&rsquo;s actions put the Syrian people in danger from further military action by the Assad regime and grant impunity to those committing war crimes in Syria.  I urge Russia to change its stance and fulfil its obligations as a permanent member of the Security Council to uphold international law and the principles of the UN Charter.<\/p>  <p>  From the outset, Ireland has been clear that we believe that this is a crisis of political legitimacy and that only a political solution will be viable and sustainable.  We are clear that this must be &ldquo;Syrian-owned and Syrian-led&rdquo;.  We have also been consistent in condemning the pattern of systematic violence against civilians, in which 100,000s have been killed and millions more wounded or forced to flee violence and terrorism.  We have called for the protection of all civilians from military force and terrorism and the unimpeded provision of humanitarian assistance to populations in need and full accountability on behalf of the victims of crimes under international law.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear from a wide range of reports that the Assad regime has been overwhelmingly responsible for the deaths of Syrians since the beginning of the uprising in March 2011.  The Commission of Inquiry established by UN Human Rights Council has reported findings of evidence that the Assad regime may have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity.  The excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate use of military force against the besieged population of Aleppo are clear violations of international law. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns have been directly conveyed in the clearest terms to the Russian authorities at my direction.  On behalf of the Irish people, I urge Russia to use all its influence in Syria to end these inhumane actions against a defenceless civilian population.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has repeatedly called for the situation in Syria to be referred to the International Criminal Court.  The suffering of the besieged population in Aleppo underline both the urgency and importance of ensuring accountability for those responsible for these actions. <\/p>  <p>  The attacks have rightly appalled people across Ireland and around the world.  I want to acknowledge the important stand taken by Irish people in supporting NGOs working to assist the Syrian people. <\/p>  <p>  As a Government we have placed huge emphasis on doing what we can to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people, through provision of humanitarian aid.  Last week, I approved &euro;1.5 million for the ICRC for their work inside Syria and &euro;1 million to UNWRA for Palestinian refugees affected by the Syria crisis which, combined with our recent disbursement of &euro;5M to the Turkey Refugee Facility, brings our total contribution to the Syrian crisis to &euro;62M since 2012. <\/p>  <p>  I will be discussing the situation in Syria with my EU colleagues at the next Foreign Affairs Council, and focusing in particular on how to support the EU&rsquo;s Humanitarian Initiative on Aleppo. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100076#WRN02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consular Services Provision","counter":816,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100076#WRN02750"},{"type":"question","counter":817,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[29388\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100076#WRN02800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will intervene in the case of a person (details supplied) regarding their passport and rights abroad as an Irish citizen;

It is my belief that the narrow rejection by the Colombian electorate of the agreement does not signify a rejection of peace.  In fact, many of the areas of the country most-affected by the conflict voted decisively in favour of the agreement. <\/p>  <p>  I therefore urge all parties in Colombia to remain committed to the peace process and focused on their ultimate objective - bringing peace to their country and improving the lives of present and future generations of Colombians.  I am pleased to see that the parties have begun a process of consultation in order to identify how the process might be re-started.  The role of the European Union&rsquo;s Special Envoy for the peace process, the former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Eamon Gilmore, is of particular importance at this difficult time.    <\/p>  <p>  I warmly welcome the announcement of October 7 that President Santos has been awarded with the Nobel Peace Prize.

The recent report by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), which revealed a disturbing increase in civilian casualties in the first half of 2016, highlights the need for ongoing engagement by the international community. <\/p><p>Last week, at the <i>Brussels Conference on Afghanistan<\/i>, jointly hosted by the European Union and the Government of Afghanistan, participating States - including Ireland - and international organisations reaffirmed their commitment to providing ongoing assistance.  Collectively they pledged approximately &euro;13.6 billion ($15.1 billion) over the 4 year period from 2017 to 2020.  This assistance will be directed to several key areas including poverty reduction, tackling corruption, addressing issues of migration, strengthening the rule of law and enhancing human rights, particularly for women and girls.<\/p><p>European Union-Afghanistan cooperation in the area of migration is addressed in the <i>Joint Way Forward on Migration<\/i>(JWF), which was signed in Kabul on 2 October.  This provides for cooperation in the fight against smuggling and people trafficking, information and awareness raising.  It aims to provide for a &ldquo;smooth, dignified and orderly return&rdquo; of those Afghan nationals who do not fulfil the conditions for remaining in the EU after &ldquo;consideration of all relevant international law and legal procedures&rdquo; and who &ldquo;cannot be granted international protection status&rdquo;.  The JWF further provides for reintegration assistance, and specific humanitarian consideration for vulnerable groups, including women and children.

The request was filed with the Court on 4 December 2014.  On the basis of new material uncovered, the Government has contended that the ill-treatment suffered by the Hooded Men should be recognised as torture.  The Government&rsquo;s request currently remains under consideration by the Court.<\/p>  <p>  This decision was not taken lightly.  The Government is acutely aware of the suffering of the individual men involved and of their families, of the significance of this case, and of the weight of these allegations.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is also conscious that, in the Council of Europe, the European Union, and in other fora, Ireland and the UK as strong bilateral partners have worked together to promote human rights, and will continue to do so.

The UK observations will in due course be made available to the Government and an opportunity afforded for reply.

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18 November 2015 by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with the full support of both the Department of Health  and the Department of Education and Skills. <\/p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8m is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school settings, as part of the roll-out of the new inclusive preschools model. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited and specific cases at local level, disability services have in the past also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing additional supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such additional pre-school supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants, who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.<\/p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the specific issue he has raised.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100079#WRQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Data","counter":974,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100079#WRQ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":975,"qnumday":346,"qnumall":"[29825\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100079#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the names of the licensed importers, wholesalers, marketing company and the distributors of the drug Lariam-Mefloquine here.","asker":"1305","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":976,"content":"<p>The marketing authorisation for Lariam (active substance, mefloquine) was withdrawn from the Irish market by Roche Products Ltd, the marketing authorisation holder, in July 2016.

EU and Irish law lays out the circumstances under which a medicine must be subject to a prescription, including consideration of the risk of side effects if a medicine is used without medical supervision or the risk of incorrect or misuse of a medicine.<\/p>  <p>  Medicines may be classified on the basis of their availability i.e. subject to a prescription or available without a prescription (over-the-counter).  In Ireland, over-the-counter medicines are further classified as being: available only from a pharmacy and are sold by, or under the personal supervision of, a pharmacist; or on general sale where the product is more widely available in general retail outlets such as supermarkets.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014 the HPRA introduced a revised approach in the area of medicines reclassification.  The HPRA proactively identified medicines which could be safely made available without prescription in pharmacies, or made more widely available in general retail outlets, and directly invited the industry to make applications to have these medicines reclassified.<\/p>  <p>  A reclassification from prescription-only to pharmacy-only supply will always require an application to be made by the marketing authorisation holder of the medicine due to the legal requirement to provide product information that is suitable for non-prescription supply.  A reclassification from pharmacy-only to general sale may be acceptable if the current product information is suitable for use without the supervision of a pharmacist.     <\/p>  <p>  Over the past two years, 19 reclassifications from prescription-only to pharmacy-only status have been approved.  This has extended the range of medicines available without prescription through pharmacies.  Furthermore, 34 medicines have been reclassified from pharmacy-only to general sales status. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the proactive approach outlined above, a marketing authorisation holder can at any stage directly make an application to the HPRA for reclassification of a medicine without an invitation to do so.  Applications of this nature continue to be received by the HPRA as part of routine business.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA also continues to review other substances that may be considered suitable for reclassification in order to maintain its proactive approach and has actively encouraged the industry to consider the submission of applications for innovative reclassifications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100079#WRQ06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":1036,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100080#WRR00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1037,"qnumday":368,"qnumall":"[29294\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100080#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will consider a programme to educate the public regarding the importance of following the recommended dosage of medications on packets or from their general practitioner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1038,"content":"<p>Last month I launched a national public information campaign to raise awareness of the safe and effective use of medicines.

They can also provide respite to carers and support them in their caring role.  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2016 provided for a target of 10.4 million Home Help Hours to support about 47,800 people.  It also provides for 15,450 HCP and 130 Intensive HCPs for clients with complex needs.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that the resources available for home supports need to be strengthened and we have committed in the Programme for Government to improving the situation.  As a first step, an additional &euro;40m has been made available to maintain and develop home care services to the end of 2016.  This year the HSE will now provide 133,000 home help hours and 350 home care packages more than was originally planned.<\/p>  <p>  On 9 September the HSE published its Winter Initiative Plan for 2016\/2017.  The plan focuses on specific measures to address the surge in demand for services that is typical of this time of year.  A key objective is to facilitate the discharge of people who have completed their hospital treatment.  The Plan provides for an extra 950 HCPs over the Winter Initiative period and the packages will be targeted at 10 specific hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The Implementation Programme, co-funded by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies, which accompanies the Irish National Dementia Strategy, includes the provision of Intensive Home Care Packages for people with dementia valued at &euro;22.1 million.  To date 133 people living with dementia have benefitted at an average cost of &euro;1,000 per package per week.  There are currently 71 people with dementia in receipt of a dementia-specific Intensive Home Care Package.  Up to 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from Intensive Home Care Packages over the lifetime of the Implementation Programme.  In addition to these Intensive Home Care Packages, the HSE will continue to provide mainstream home help and standard packages to people with dementia whose needs have been assessed as requiring these supports and within available resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100080#WRR04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1076,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100080#WRR04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1077,"qnumday":382,"qnumall":"[29386\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100080#WRR04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a treatment plan for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1346","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1078,"content":"<p>The Deputy's question relates to service delivery matters and accordingly I have asked the HSE to respond directly to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100080#WRR04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres Provision","counter":1079,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100080#WRR04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1080,"qnumday":383,"qnumall":"[29390\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100080#WRR04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to plans to build a primary care centre in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1081,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters,  I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100080#WRR04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":1082,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100080#WRR04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1083,"qnumday":384,"qnumall":"[29398\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100080#WRR04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to support the further roll-out of Jigsaw drop-in centres around the country and if so, the locations and under what timeline; whether funding is ring-fenced for this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1294","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1084,"content":"<p>The HSE Service Plan 2016 prioritises the development of a range of Early Intervention and prevention mental health initiatives for young people.

I can confirm there has been no change of policy in this matter. <\/p><p>Last month, the Physiotherapists Registration Board established its register with effect from 30 September 2016 under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  This ensures that the specified title of <i>physiotherapist<\/i>will be protected for the exclusive use of the board's registrants when the register&rsquo;s two-year transitional period ends in September 2018. <\/p><p>In much of the rest of the English speaking world the titles of physiotherapist and <i>physical therapist<\/i>are interchangeable and their users are qualified physiotherapists.  In Ireland, however, the title is also used by a number of practitioners who are not physiotherapists but who have been providing musculoskeletal therapies in the private sector for many years.  Physiotherapists, on the other hand, are trained to provide cardio\/respiratory and neurological therapies as well as musculoskeletal therapies and they practise in both the public and private sectors. <\/p><p>Earlier this year, my predecessor, Leo Varadkar T.D., having consulted with the Physiotherapists Registration Board and a number of other relevant organisations, announced that he had come to the conclusion that protecting the title of <i>physical therapist <\/i>under the Act as a variant of the title of physiotherapist would be the best way to eliminate the ongoing risk of title confusion and the consequent risks to public safety.  He also decided to allow particular existing users of the title of <i>physical therapist,<\/i>who are not physiotherapists but who hold qualifications of a certain standard, to continue to use the title. <\/p><p>New grand-parenting provisions will allow such practitioners to apply, on a once-off basis and for a limited period, to register in the physiotherapists register.  The registration board&rsquo;s code of professional conduct and ethics will oblige all registrants, including those registered under the new provisions, to act within the limits of their knowledge, skills, competence and experience.  In other words, in order to ensure public protection, those registered under these time-limited special provisions will be required to confine their practise to musculoskeletal therapies. <\/p><p>Preparation of the necessary legislation to give effect to these decisions is now at an advanced stage.  The legislation will involve the making of regulations under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 together with the enactment of the necessary amendments to the Act to allow qualified existing users of the title of <i>physical therapist<\/i>to register on a once-off basis and for a limited period.  It is my intention to seek Government approval in the next month or so to include these amendments to the Act in a Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that is currently being drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100081#WRS00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Data","counter":1111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100081#WRS00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1112,"qnumday":394,"qnumall":"[29441\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100081#WRS00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the operative period stated in the terms and conditions of the service level agreement, ref.no.HSE 021\/12, between the HSE and private ambulance companies for the provision of ambulance services to the HSE hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1113,"qnumday":395,"qnumall":"[29442\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100081#WRS00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of money in total the HSE hospitals paid to private ambulance services participating in the service level agreement, SLA, no.\u00a0HSE 021\/12\u00a0from 3 June 2013 to 1 September 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1114,"qnumday":396,"qnumall":"[29443\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100081#WRS00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of money HSE hospitals have paid to private ambulance companies which are not participating in the service level agreement HSE 02\/12 from 3 June 2013 to 1 September 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1115,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[29444\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100081#WRS00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of additional tendering processes for the supply of private ambulance services the HSE hospitals have put out to tender from 3 June 2013 to 1 September 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1116,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[29445\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100081#WRS01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of requests from HSE hospitals to the private ambulance companies participating in the service level agreement No. HSE 02\/12 which have been declined by those private ambulance companies listed on the service level agreement from 3 June 2013 to 1 September 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1117,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[29446\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100081#WRS01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of private ambulance companies which have had their position in the ranking on the service level agreement no.

This direct communication with patients or their carers allows the pharmacist to evaluate a patient&rsquo;s overall health and health needs, perform a therapeutic review of the prescription, and for the required patient counselling to take place.  It also allows the pharmacist to verify the authenticity of a prescription and to evaluate the safety and appropriateness of supplying the medicine in the particular circumstances presented.<\/p>  <p>  In general, monthly prescriptions are dispensed by pharmacies on a single occasion, depending on the type of medicine and the form in which it is packaged by the manufacturer.  A prescriber may, on occasion, request that a  patient is only supplied with one week's supply of medicine at a time, because of the nature of the medicines involved or where there may be safety concerns in relation to the patient.  In such circumstances, the pharmacy would be required to dispense the prescription on a weekly basis.

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. <\/p><p>Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.  NIAC recommended that the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools. <\/p><p>By January 2016, over 200 million doses of Gardasil had been distributed worldwide.  In Ireland over 580,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and over 200,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010. <\/p><p>No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised. <\/p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the statutory regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level. <\/p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  The national adverse reaction reporting programme in Ireland has been in place since 1968, initially operated by the HPRA's predecessor organisations, the National Drugs Advisory Board (NDAB) and the Irish Medicines Board (IMB).  This reporting system has continuously evolved over the years to encourage increased participation across healthcare professional groups as well as patients\/consumers.  A variety of methods are in place to facilitate reporting such as on-line reporting tools, or submitting a form by post, email or reporting by telephone.  The HPRA website includes a dedicated section on reporting for healthcare professionals as well as members of the public and regularly highlights reporting recommendations in its Drug Safety Newsletter.  In addition, a number of leaflets have been issued by the HPRA to highlight patient awareness around taking medicines safely and advising patients of reporting options.  These leaflets have been distributed to the public through a number of channels, including being made available in GP surgeries.<\/p><p>Reporting rates in Ireland for suspected adverse drug reactions associated with HPV vaccines have been high since the introduction of Gardasil into the Schools Immunisation Programme in 2010.  This level of reporting reflects the very positive response to calls from the HPRA for reporting of national experience associated with use of the vaccine.  All reports of suspected adverse reactions submitted to the HPRA are reviewed and followed up as necessary to ensure all relevant information is available, prior to onward reporting to relevant stakeholders, including the European Medicines Agency (EMA). At EU level, regulators continuously monitor this cumulative reporting experience as part of the ongoing assessment of the safety of HPV vaccines.<\/p><p>In terms of overall reporting rates, the HPRA actively participates in the WHO Collaborating Programme for International Drug Monitoring.  Information on reporting rates from countries in the WHO programme is published on the centre's website and Ireland was ranked as the thirteenth highest reporter across 121 participating countries during the period 2011-2015.<\/p><p>I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services.  The HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.<\/p><p>In November 2015, the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review, which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  The European Medicines Agency has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information.<\/p><p>On 12 January 2016, the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states.<\/p><p>The HSE provides information for parents about diseases, the vaccines to prevent them and side effects to allow them to choose whether or not to give consent to vaccination.  All vaccination information provided to parents is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet.  The information booklets include information on the most common adverse events that can occur after each vaccination.  The information is presented in clear simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency so that it can be understood by all adults as the average reading age in Ireland is 12 years of age.  Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions.<\/p><p>Should parents require additional information about vaccines the immunisation leaflet refers to the HSE&rsquo;s national immunisation website <i>(www.immunisation.ie).<\/i>The national immunisation website has been accredited by the World Health Organisation for content and for good information practices.  The website allows members of the public to contact the National Immunisation Office to ask a question if they require further information.  These questions, when possible, are answered by the staff of the National Immunisation Office within one working day.<\/p><p>No specific training was provided to GPs when HPV vaccine was introduced in 2010 other than as part of the information sent in the regular Immunisation newsletters.  Recent updates to GPs have included updated information in national immunisation newsletter, a letter sent to all GPs with copies of a HPV information leaflet and the information leaflet given to parents, collaboration with ICGP in production of 2 e-learning modules on HPV vaccine and the development of workshops on HPV vaccine which will take place shortly.  In addition the HSE immunisation website <i>(www.immunisation.ie)<\/i>is constantly updated with the latest information.<\/p><p>My Department is aware that representatives from REGRET have already met with the HSE and I hope to be in a position to meet with them in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100083#WRU04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1286,"content":"<p>Question No. 457 answered with Question No. 345.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1287,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100083#WRU04550"},{"type":"question","counter":1288,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[29710\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100083#WRU04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when theatre space will be made available at University Hospital Waterford for children in the Waterford area with special needs and who have dental requirements that necessitate general anaesthetic procedures as in the case of a person (details supplied).","asker":"1220","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1289,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100083#WRU04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cancer Research","counter":1290,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100083#WRU04750"},{"type":"question","counter":1291,"qnumday":459,"qnumall":"[29756\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100083#WRU04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of funding available to cancer trial research units in hospitals around the country; the amount of funding which is going to each cancer trial research unit in tabular form; if results from such trials are carefully reviewed; his plans to increase funds to such research; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1292,"content":"<p>Since 2005, the Health Research Board (HRB), a statutory agency under the aegis of my Department, has invested approximately &euro;53 million in the development of a network of cancer clinical trials in hospitals across Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The aims of this initiative are to ensure that a significant proportion of patients have the option to participate in the latest clinical trials, to improve the quality of care and access to the latest therapies and to establish a coordinated approach to cancer trials.<\/p>  <p>  The HRB funding is provided to Clinical Trials Ireland (CTI) to support clinical trials at hospital sites, as well as the CTI Group Central Office, and a Statistics and Data Management Office based in Galway.

These Committees have continually concluded that the vaccine is safe.<\/p>  <p>  The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety of the World Health Organisation has systematically investigated safety concerns raised about HPV vaccines and has issued several reports in this regard.  In December 2015, WHO reported that, it has not found any safety issue that would alter its recommendations for the use of the vaccine.  In January 2016 the EU endorsed the use of HPV vaccines in all countries in the EU.  This was following a European Medicines Agency (EMA) report on a review of HPV vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  There have been numerous studies published in the past 5 years on the HPV vaccine which have observed those girls vaccinated with the HPV vaccine since it was licensed in 2006.  The findings of almost 30 of these studies that I am aware of can be summarised as follows:<\/p>  <p>  -  HPV vaccines are highly efficacious (>90%) at preventing infection with targeted HPV types (types 16 and 18 and for the quadrivalent vaccine also types 6 and 11) and related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.  The quadrivalent vaccine has proven efficacy and against HPV16\/18\/6\/11 related vulvar, vaginal, and anal intraepithelial neoplasia and genital warts.<\/p>  <p>  -  The vaccines have some, although lower levels of, cross-protection against related type HPV31.  The bivalent vaccine also has some cross-protection against types 33, 45, 51 and 52.  The bivalent vaccine produces higher antibody titers than the quadrivalent vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  -  Following three doses, antibody tirtres plateau by 48 months but are then sustained (bivalent>quadrivalent) for more than 9 years, with no indication of waning protection.<\/p>  <p>  -  Two doses of vaccine spaced six months or more apart are as immunogenic in females aged under 15 years as three doses in older women.<\/p>  <p>  -  Following population-based vaccination programs, significant declines in genital warts, HPV infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia have been observed.<\/p>  <p>  -  Herd protection of males against genital warts has been observed following female HPV vaccination programs.<\/p>  <p>  -  With over 230 million doses distributed globally, HPV vaccines have been repeatedly assessed as safe.  The vaccines are not associated with any increased risk of disease including  autoimmune, neurological or thromboembolic disease.<\/p>  <p>  I can provide Deputies with detailed references of these studies.<\/p>  <p>  Worldwide there is no scientific evidence that HPV vaccines cause any long term illness.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), the authority regulating the HPV vaccine has never advised that there is any concern about the safety of the HPV vaccine.  The HPRA continues to monitor each vaccine and medicine during the life time of its license.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100084#WRV02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1329,"content":"<p>Question No. 476 answered with Question No. 454.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1331,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[29797\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100084#WRV02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of complaints that have been received each year from 2011 to 2016 by the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC; the number of complaints received regarding the symptoms as described by the girls who made the complaints, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1332,"qnumday":478,"qnumall":"[29798\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100084#WRV02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the principal role of the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, and the cost of this body in each of the years 2011 to 2015.","asker":"1341","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1333,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 477 and 478 together.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the statutory regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  This is achieved by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  From the time of authorisation and up to 30th September 2016, the HPRA had received 1063 reports of adverse reactions and events associated with use of Gardasil.  This level of reporting for Gardasil reflects the very positive response to calls from the HPRA for reporting of national experience associated with use of the vaccine, following its introduction into the national immunisation programme which commenced in May 2010.<\/p>  <p>  The majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)).  Vaccination related events, occurring at the time of vaccine administration, such as syncope (faints) has been among the most commonly reported effects.  Other commonly reported symptoms include gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and injection site reactions.  Reports of allergic-type reactions including skin rashes, urticaria and flushing have also been received, including isolated reports of more severe hypersensitivity-type reactions.  There have also been some reports describing persisting\/chronic fatigue, generally with multiple other symptoms (e.g. headache, malaise, drowsiness, nausea, gastrointestinal upset, joint swelling, flu like illness, menstrual disorders) following vaccination.  The HPRA has informed me that a tabulated listing of case reports will be provided separately to the Deputy. <\/p>  <p>  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) has no statutory role in the monitoring of adverse reaction to licensed medicinal products.  NIAC was established within the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in 1998.  It comprises representatives from a broad range of medical and healthcare organisations.  The role of NIAC is to provide expert, evidence-based, impartial guidance to the Chief Medical Officer in the Department of Health in the area of immunisation procedures and related matters.  NIAC also prepares, and regularly updates, the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland with the assistance of an active committee from associated disciplines in Paediatrics, Infectious Diseases, General Practice and Public Health.

Prior to the last CAP reform negotiations, two separate groups\u00a0 had conducted feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing a new sugar\/bioethanol processing facility in the country.

An agreement was reached as part of the overall CAP reform package, negotiated during the Irish Presidency in June 2013, to abolish all sugar quotas by 30 September 2017.  This agreement removes, with effect from 1 October 2017, the current EU quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member States, wishing to re-establish a sugar beet processing industry. <\/p>  <p>  At the time, this agreement was welcomed by those parties who are interested in seeking to re-establish a sugar industry here.  It is now up to any commercial interests who wish to establish a sugar plant to move the project forward and to garner sufficient commercial and financial support to turn their plans into a viable reality.\u00a0 The Programme for a Partnership Government makes clear that &ldquo;State enterprise bodies will be asked to examine any substantial business plans related to rebuilding the industry with a view to considering appropriate State supports&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that officials in my Department have met with the interested parties a number of times since 2011 to hear from them how the projects are developing and to provide any assistance and advice that has been sought by the interested parties.

The UK is by far Ireland's largest trading partner.  Last year we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products, much of which was produced and processed in the southeast.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department, together with its agencies and stakeholders, has been carefully considering the potential impacts of a UK exit, looking at the areas in which the greatest risks may arise and on which we will need to focus when negotiations begin. <\/p>  <p>  The main areas in which impacts are foreseen are in relation to currency fluctuations, tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification.  The UK exit vote also raises complex issues for the fisheries sector. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiations that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure are completed.  <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department has engaged in detailed contingency planning, and has published a summary of the key actions we are taking by way of immediate response to the UK&rsquo;s decision.  It is also continuing to deepen its analysis of the likely impacts, and to feed into the central Contingency Framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  I have taken a number of steps to ensure that a sensible and coherent approach is adopted, including:<\/p>  <p>  -  Establishing a dedicated unit in my Department to work on all of the issues I have mentioned;<\/p>  <p>  -  Convening a Consultative Committee of stakeholders that will ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed.  This Committee held its first meeting in July and will meet again on 20 October;<\/p>  <p>  -  Establishing a contact group under the auspices of the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee in order to ensure that the response of the relevant agencies is fully co-ordinated.  <\/p>  <p>  Of course the most immediate impact for our agri-food exporters arises from changes to Euro-Sterling exchange rates.  While this was not unexpected in light of the uncertainty caused by the referendum result, a sustained period of currency volatility would be of concern.  I have asked Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland to provide practical guidance to SMEs.  Bord Bia recently announced a number of measures, covering areas such as managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness.  Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Contacts between the Irish and UK governments, and with our counterparts in Northern Ireland, are also ongoing at both political and official levels.  I will also continue to work closely with Ireland&rsquo;s EU partners with the aim of ensuring a well-managed withdrawal and a strong EU-UK relationship post-exit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100086#WRX01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Basic Payment Scheme Applications","counter":1440,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100086#WRX01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1441,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[29512\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100086#WRX01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a person (details supplied) will have farm payments processed; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1442,"content":"<p>An application under the 2016 Basic Payment Scheme\/Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme was received in my Department from the person named on 14 April 2016. <\/p>  <p>  Under the 2016 ANC Scheme, eligible applicants are required to meet a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units for a retention period of seven consecutive months and to maintain an annual average of 0.15 livestock units calculated over the twelve months of the scheme year.

The aim of the RHI is to build on the progress already made in the renewable heating sector and to help reach Ireland&rsquo;s 12% target by 2020.  In 2015, it is estimated that 6.8% of heat was derived from renewable sources.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">Over the last few months, my\u00a0Department has undertaken a detailed economic assessment on the design and cost of the RHI and this work is now almost complete.  This assessment included a\u00a0range of renewable energy\u00a0technologies including biomass boilers\u00a0and focused\u00a0on the approximately 3,000 large commercial and industrial heat users in the non-Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) in Ireland.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The focus on the larger heat users was underpinned by analysis completed in 2014 which indicated that it would not be cost effective, at this stage, to include the domestic heating sector in the RHI.  This is due to a number of factors including the much higher support tariff per kilowatt hour of energy that would be required to incentivise households to change heating systems, as well as the significantly greater costs associated with administering the scheme for a large number of households in what is an unregulated sector.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">There will\u00a0be an additional public consultation phase on the design of the new scheme before the end of the year.  Before the RHI is introduced,\u00a0the overall costs and technologies to be supported\u00a0will be subject to Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission.  It is expected that a new scheme will become available in the latter half of 2017.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100087#WRY05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff Scheme","counter":1546,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100087#WRY05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1547,"qnumday":555,"qnumall":"[29547\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100087#WRY05300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to extend the closing date of the REFIT 3 scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1548,"content":"<p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The REFIT 3 scheme closed to new applicants on the 31 December 2015. \u00a0As the REFIT closing date approached late last year, it was decided to offer a degree of flexibility for applicants who had submitted applications to the department before the closing date, but still were waiting on planning decisions or grid connection offers.

They are intended to make bus transport faster and more reliable, therefore attracting more people out of their cars and onto public transport.  Greater bus use reduces congestion, air pollution and carbon emissions and must remain a strong focus of our drive to make transport cleaner and less carbon emitting.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to buses, taxis are permitted to use bus lanes, as they are available for on-street hire by the general public.  The emergency services are also entitled to use bus lanes, as are cyclists, on the basis that they are inherently vulnerable road users. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has received many requests over the years to allow other classes of traffic access to bus lanes.  These have included hackneys, limousines, motorcycles, multi-occupancy cars, and animal ambulances, as well as electric vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  All of these requests have been rejected as allowing additional categories of traffic to use the lanes would undermine their efficiency for their original purpose, which is to facilitate bus transport.  In addition, if a concession were made on one of the many classes of traffic for which access to bus lanes is regularly sought, it would be difficult to justify refusing access to the others.  Furthermore, it is far from clear how enforceable such a concession may be.  <\/p>  <p>  Keeping bus lanes for small and large PSVs and vulnerable users such as cyclists ensures efficient use of road space, a better quality public transport service and, accordingly, plays an important role in reducing emissions.  It is also safer as it reduces conflicts between different kinds of users.  I am committed to exploring mechanisms to encourage increased take up of electric vehicles but, in this instance, I believe that alternatively fuelled vehicles are better encouraged using other measures.<\/p>  <p>  I therefore have no plans to allow electric vehicles to use bus lanes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100088#WRZ06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1627,"content":"<p>Question No. 584 answered with Question No. 573.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus &Eacute;ireann Staff","counter":1628,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100089#WRAA00300"},{"type":"question","counter":1629,"qnumday":585,"qnumall":"[29407\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100089#WRAA00400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the rationale for not providing Bus &Eacute;ireann drivers in County Cork with a hepatitis C vaccination when bus inspectors are provided with such a vaccination despite a number of assaults on drivers recently.","asker":"1279","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1630,"content":"<p>\u200bThe issue raised is a matter for Bus &Eacute;ireann and I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the company for direct reply.\u00a0 Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100089#WRAA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport Initiatives","counter":1631,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100089#WRAA00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1632,"qnumday":586,"qnumall":"[29457\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100089#WRAA00700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to extend the use of the Leap card on Irish Rail outside Dublin.

It will end limitations in access to public contracts, open up markets for services and offer predictable conditions for investors.  I fully support and welcome CETA.  Ireland stands to gain substantially from this agreement and I am looking forward to Irish firms enjoying the benefits and new opportunities as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  CETA will save on duty costs as 99.6% of all industrial tariffs will be eliminated on entry into force.  Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, thus saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.  These are some of the benefits of the trade deal with Canada as well as providing new market opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms.<\/p>  <p>  Given the position taken by Ireland and other Member States, the Commission has submitted CETA to the Council for decision as a mixed agreement.  That is one requiring both EU and individual Member States ratification.  As this process may take a number of years to complete the agreement provides for provisional application.  <\/p>  <p>  Provisional application is a standard process in Free Trade Agreements.  This provides for the coming into effect of those areas over which the EU has competence.  It will be a matter for the Council and the European Parliament to decide on the signature and provisional application of CETA.<\/p>  <p>  Following concerns raised in a number of Member State parliaments and this House, the EU now proposes to exclude investment protection and investment dispute settlement from the provisional application of the Agreement.  The EU and Canada are also finalising a legally binding Joint Declaration to provide further assurances in relation to the provision of public services, labour rights, environmental protection and investment.<\/p>  <p>  The EU and Canada are working towards the signature of CETA at the EU-Canada Summit scheduled to take place on the 27 October 2016.  Prior to this, the Council of EU Trade Ministers will meet in Luxembourg on 18 October 2016 to decide on the signature and provisional application of CETA.  <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with Article 218(8) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the full entering into force of CETA will be subject, in the first instance, to a decision by the EU, through a Council decision with the consent of the Parliament, and secondly by the approval of all Member States through the relevant national ratification procedures.  In this regard, D&aacute;il Eireann will be a part of the final decision to ratify CETA in accordance with Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100090#WRBB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development Grants","counter":1712,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100090#WRBB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1713,"qnumday":615,"qnumall":"[29714\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100090#WRBB01600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of research grants from Science Foundation Ireland won by bidders in each higher level institution in each of the years from 2010 to date in 2016, in tabular form.

That is partly because approximately 70% of all FDI investment won by IDA Ireland comes from its existing client base, rather than new companies. <\/p><p><b>IDA Ireland Jobs Statistics 2015; Site Visits 2015 and to end Quarter 2 2016 by County<\/b><table><tr><th><div>County<\/div><\/th><th><div>Total Jobs<br \/><br \/>2015<\/div><\/th><th><div>Number of Companies<br \/><br \/>2015<\/div><\/th><th><div>Site Visits 2015<\/div><\/th><th><div>Site Visits for Q1 and Q2 2016<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>Carlow<\/div><\/td><td><div>768<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Cavan<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,165<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Clare<\/div><\/td><td><div>6,599<\/div><\/td><td><div>68<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Cork<\/div><\/td><td><div>31,900<\/div><\/td><td><div>148<\/div><\/td><td><div>48<\/div><\/td><td><div>29<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Donegal<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,918<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Dublin<\/div><\/td><td><div>77,244<\/div><\/td><td><div>652<\/div><\/td><td><div>242<\/div><\/td><td><div>145<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Galway<\/div><\/td><td><div>14,297<\/div><\/td><td><div>60<\/div><\/td><td><div>41<\/div><\/td><td><div>23<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Kerry<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,931<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Kildare<\/div><\/td><td><div>10,313<\/div><\/td><td><div>22<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Kilkenny<\/div><\/td><td><div>650<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Laois<\/div><\/td><td><div>97<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Leitrim<\/div><\/td><td><div>423<\/div><\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Limerick<\/div><\/td><td><div>8,849<\/div><\/td><td><div>52<\/div><\/td><td><div>40<\/div><\/td><td><div>23<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Longford<\/div><\/td><td><div>686<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Louth<\/div><\/td><td><div>3,245<\/div><\/td><td><div>21<\/div><\/td><td><div>20<\/div><\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Mayo<\/div><\/td><td><div>3,981<\/div><\/td><td><div>18<\/div><\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Meath<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,571<\/div><\/td><td><div>17<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Monaghan<\/div><\/td><td><div>146<\/div><\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Offaly<\/div><\/td><td><div>902<\/div><\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Roscommon<\/div><\/td><td><div>936<\/div><\/td><td><div>9<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Sligo<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,029<\/div><\/td><td><div>22<\/div><\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Tipperary<\/div><\/td><td><div>3,518<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Waterford<\/div><\/td><td><div>5,662<\/div><\/td><td><div>33<\/div><\/td><td><div>31<\/div><\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Westmeath<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,529<\/div><\/td><td><div>16<\/div><\/td><td><div>28<\/div><\/td><td><div>14<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Wexford<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,486<\/div><\/td><td><div>17<\/div><\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Wicklow<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,211<\/div><\/td><td><div>18<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Total<\/div><\/td><td><div>187,056<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,254<\/div><\/td><td><div>565<\/div><\/td><td><div>315<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100090#WRBB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Data","counter":1718,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100090#WRBB01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1719,"qnumday":617,"qnumall":"[29376\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100090#WRBB02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will provide on a county basis all vacant IDA Ireland sites;

The membership of the Forum comprised representatives from my Department and its enterprise agencies, County Councils, the education sector, Teagasc and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The Forum progressed a significant number of actions from the 2011 Plan.  With the development of the broader South East Region Action Plan for Jobs (APJ), which was launched in September 2015, the role of the Forum was subsumed into the implementation process for the Regional Action Plan and many of the organisations that were represented on the Forum continue to be involved in overseeing its implementation.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, many of the key recommendations of the South East Employment Action Plan and the 2013 South East Economic Development Strategy (SEEDS) reports were incorporated into the South East APJ where appropriate, and are currently being implemented through that mechanism.<\/p>  <p>  The core objective of the South East APJ is to support an ambitious programme of enterprise growth and job creation in region over the medium and longer term, as advocated in the SEEDS report.  The primary objective of the South East APJ is to realise the potential to have a further 10-15 per cent at work in the region by 2020 so as to ensure the unemployment rate is within 1 per cent of the State average. <\/p>  <p>  Among the actions in the Action Plan to be delivered over the period 2015-2017 include increasing Start-ups\/SMEs by 30%, at least 44 additional IDA supported investments in the region over the coming years, a 20% increase in jobs in exporting companies, in particular in manufacturing, agrifood, businesses services and biopharma\/medtech and an 85% increase in agri-food exports over the next 10 years.<\/p>  <p>  Tourism also plays a pivotal part in the Plan towards job creation and includes measures to accelerate the tourism targets set for the south east over the next 10 years, in particular, to attract over 300,000 extra tourists and to create at least 5,000 associated jobs including developing Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East.<\/p>  <p>  The latest figures from the CSO show encouraging signs that the region is recovering with the unemployment rate having fallen from a peak of 20.1 per cent in Q1 2012 to 10.8 per cent in Q2 2016, with almost 214,000 now at work &ndash; an increase of 27,800 over the period.

Planning, Community and Local Government to address this issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1752,"content":"<p>The goal of this Government is to support the creation of an additional 200,000 jobs by 2020 with 135,000 outside Dublin.  We also want to attract back at least 70,000 emigrants from aboard.  This is a whole of Government effort and is delivered through our integrated Action Plan for Jobs.  As set out in the Government's enterprise strategy, Enterprise 2025, rising property costs are viewed as posing a significant threat to competitiveness, with a direct link between house prices and upward wage expectations.  The affordability of housing matters for the individual household, for society as a whole, and for national competitiveness.<\/p><p>From a competitiveness perspective, housing affordability is a component of Ireland&rsquo;s ability to compete internationally.  It impacts upon the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for investment and directly impacts on enterprise costs through wage effects, and indirectly determines the price of Irish goods and services.  The cost of housing influences labour mobility and contributes to an economy&rsquo;s ability to adjust to adverse shocks.  In short, a well-functioning housing and construction sector is critical to the overall health of society and the economy. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, a very challenging housing crisis exists in Ireland, the root cause of which is an undersupply of housing across all tenures.  At an overall level, while 25,000 new homes a year are needed to meet demand, output fell to as low as 8,300 in recent years.  At its heart, the Government's Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness is about increasing and accelerating housing delivery, across all tenures, to help individuals and families find homes.<\/p><p>In publishing Rebuilding Ireland, the Government has set out a practical and readily implementable set of actions to create a functioning and sustainable housing system.  The Plan, which is available at the website , is divided into five pillars, with each targeting a specific area of the housing system for attention. <\/p><p>Pillar 4 of the Plan commits to developing a comprehensive strategy for the rental sector in Q4 2016.  The strategy will be structured around 4 key areas: security, standards, supply and services.  In developing the strategy, it must be recognised that the rental market faces different challenges in different areas.  For example, high rents and excess demand are features of the market in Dublin and in other major urban centres, whereas rents in many rural areas are lower and demand is weaker.<\/p><p>These differences will be taken into account in the development of the strategy, which will lay out measures to address immediate issues affecting the supply, cost and accessibility of rental accommodation.  <\/p><p>The overarching objective of the strategy will be to increase the supply of rental homes and support the development of a stable, strong and viable rental sector, offering choice for households and investment opportunities for providers, while reflecting the rights and responsibilities of both tenants and landlords.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100090#WRBB03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Trends","counter":1753,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100090#WRBB03950"},{"type":"question","counter":1754,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[29537\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016101100090#WRBB04000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her plans to increase female entrepreneurship; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1755,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s National Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship in Ireland was launched in October 2014 and sets out the Government&rsquo;s strategic objectives as a facilitator within the Irish entrepreneurship ecosystem.<\/p><p>One objective of the policy statement is to promote female entrepreneurship through identification and promotion of female role models, targeted events and awards, support for female entrepreneur networks and promotion of a dedicated area on corporate websites. <\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland (EI) has been running female only feasibility and competitive funds since 2012.<\/p><p>During 2015, EI provided &euro;50,000 each to 34 female entrepreneurs who applied for a Competitive Start Funding round, including a call specifically aimed at females.
