Last Friday evening a large gorse fire broke out on a hillside in Carrickmines, very close to the M50 motorway in south County Dublin.  The fire raged for an extended period before it was brought under control by a number of fire engines from the Dublin fire brigade.  Gorse fires in the Dublin mountains are a fairly common sight.  This is the second fire in recent weeks.  However, they are usually far more common in the summer months, with warmer, drier temperatures.<\/p> <p>The recent fires in this part of south County Dublin have understandably caused serious concern among local residents.  The damage done to the hillside by these fires is obvious but the secondary disturbances are even more telling.  At rush hour last Friday evening, traffic was seriously impacted on the M50 and other surrounding roads due to the distracting nature of the fire and the measures being taken to extinguish it, but also by the impact on driver visibility due to the plumes of smoke emitting from the fire.  Needless to say, a number of local residents contacted me, severely perturbed by the sight of yet another fire so close to their homes.  The threat of the fire spreading was quite real for some, while the damaging impact of the smoke was also quite apparent.<\/p> <p>As the evenings get longer and, hopefully, the wintery weather breaks, it is apparent that the outbreak of gorse fires across the country, but particularly in the Dublin mountains area, is of major concern to many people.  I have tabled this Commencement matter in the hope that the Minister can acknowledge the very real concerns of so many people and provide a genuine plan in regard to how her Department and the wider group of responsible agencies are working to prevent and tackle gorse fires.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021500002#B00300","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1487154600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this very important matter.  Significant environmental damage is caused by wildfires.  This issue has become more acute in recent years, as evidenced by a spate of fires in various parts of the country.<\/p> <p>As the Senator is aware, the primary responsibility in terms of fire fighting lies with the fire service and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  With regard to gorse fires in particular, my Department is one of a number of agencies represented on the interagency gorse fire group that explores issues surrounding such fires.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also represented on the group and leads any criminal investigation.  My Department, of course, co-operates fully with any Garda investigations and any other investigations that may be initiated by other statutory bodies.<\/p> <p>Some 14% of the terrestrial area of the State is designated, and this includes many remote and inaccessible areas.  Most land in special areas of conservation, special protection areas and natural heritage areas is in private ownership.  My Department manages a property portfolio in respect of national parks and reserves of approximately 79,000 hectares.  These important biodiversity areas are located all around the country.  Given the sheer scale of property involved - for example, Killarney National Park on its own comprises over 10,000 hectares - coupled with the remote locations of much of the designated lands, and the sporadic occurrence and dynamic nature of such fires, it is very difficult to provide a visible presence on the ground to discourage and prevent unauthorised burning in the countryside.  Equally, trying to identify those who deliberately set fires in open areas without concern for the consequences can be challenging.  Nevertheless, with regard to the national parks in particular, on an ongoing basis officials from my Department are in close liaison with both the Garda and the fire service.  My staff remain ever-vigilant when conditions exist that might result in fires in the national parks.<\/p> <p>Section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, prohibits the cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction of vegetation, with certain strict exemptions, from 1 March to 31 August.  Following a review of section 40, which involved consideration of submissions from interested parties, I announced proposals in December 2015 to introduce legislation to allow for managed hedge cutting and burning at certain times within the existing closed period on a pilot two-year basis.  The legislation required to allow for these pilot measures is included in the Heritage Bill 2016, which was published in January 2016.  The Bill is currently on Committee Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>In the meantime, the existing provisions relating to section 40 of the Wildlife Act remain in force.  My Department has taken over 50 prosecutions in recent years relating to individuals for breaches of section 40 of the Wildlife Act for the burning of gorse and vegetation.  Fines were imposed in all cases, ranging from &euro;50 to &euro;600.  In some cases, the defendants were ordered by the court to pay legal costs and expenses.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also authorised officers to prosecute breaches of the Wildlife Acts.  My Department will, of course, continue to work closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as appropriate, to investigate the causes of wild fires and, where evidence is forthcoming, to pursue appropriate enforcement under the Wildlife Acts or other legislation.<\/p> <p>The main source of wild gorse fires is thought to be the deliberate starting of fires without concern for the consequences.  Aside from such malicious activities, one of the main challenges is to encourage members of the public, including landowners, farmers and recreational users of publicly accessible land, to act responsibly at all times, to be mindful of their own safety and the safety of others, to be mindful of the need to protect property, both publicly owned and privately owned, and to appreciate the value of our natural heritage, particularly in our national parks, nature reserves and designated Natura 2000 sites.<\/p> <p>I appeal to all members of the public to be conscious of the danger posed by fire, particularly fire on open ground, which can very quickly get out of control.  As the Senator said, we can see how homes and lives can be threatened and we can also see the damage to the landscape and to valuable habitats caused by uncontrolled fires.  Even planned or controlled burring can get out of hand very quickly, so it is critical that everyone realises the damage that can be caused to property and the health and welfare of family, neighbours, the wider community and the responding emergency services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021500002#B00400","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1487154600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive and total reply, for which I am very grateful.

I think we can always be more proactive in getting the message out there that, not only is there serious danger for those acting carelessly or maliciously, but also, as the Minister stated, there are serious fines and punishments for those who are acting in such a manner.  Again, I extend my sincere gratitude to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021500002#B00500","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1487154600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his remarks.

In this regard, it is important we work with local landowners.<\/p> <p>The Heritage Bill, which is currently on Committee Stage in the Seanad, seeks to provide more flexibility and a measure of common sense on this issue.  In this regard, the Wicklow uplands are a very good example of a practical partnership and shared stakeholder approach to the issue.  This involves a partnership of NPWS, Teagasc forestry services, the Wicklow Uplands Council, the IFA, community interests and other landowners.  The engagement has been positive and is, I believe, a great pathfinder for the rest of the country.  Beginning with the field day over a year ago on burning methods, and a practical day in September last demonstrating mechanical ways of upland vegetation control, it has been very well received by all.<\/p> <p>This is what we need to do - we need to work together.  I urge Members to support the Heritage Bill so we can progress this kind of common sense approach.

Perhaps the Minister might come into the House at some point in the future to talk specifically about the strategy and how it is being progressed.

I recently opened the small business forum, particularly for the horticulture sector. as there are a couple of problems that we face.  Retailers have tended to want their own quality brand for their own product as distinct from having a universal brand across products.  The test will be whether the Bord Bia quality assurance mark transcends all products such that the consumer can see an independent accreditation and quality mark.  I have been trying to emphasise the importance of indigenous Irish produce.   A vox pop was carried out on the scarcity of vegetables normally available at this time of the year from southern European states.  Some of the comments made included that we had to concentrate on seasonality and that when vegetables were in season, we should buy Irish and local.  Irish produce means Irish jobs, nowhere more so than in the horticulture sector which is one of the more labour intensive in the agriculture industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021500002#C00400","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coast Guard Services","time":1487154600,"counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021500002#C00450"},{"type":"speech","time":1487154600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to address the glaring anomaly in legislation, or lack thereof, covering the Irish Coast Guard.  As a medic on the west coast, I regularly liaise with the Irish Coast Guard and experience first hand the bravery and commitment of its members to serving the public while putting their own lives in danger.  On every single call out they are exposed to dangers with which no other workers outside the emergency services are faced.  As the Minister is aware, the Irish Coast Guard handles approximately 2,500 marine emergencies a year, assists 4,500 people and saves over 200 lives.  It evacuates medical patients from the islands on hundreds of occasions.  Irish Coast Guard helicopters are tasked around 800 times per year and the service makes 6,000 marine safety broadcasts to shipping, fishing and leisure crafts.<\/p> <p>I am honoured to live and work on the coast with these brave volunteers and members of other emergency services which include the National Ambulance Service, the fire service, the Garda and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, RNLI.  When the bleep sounds, as a local general practitioner on call, all of the emergency services work as a collective unit.  I have been privileged to take part in rescues at sea, on trawlers of Spanish fishermen and at the edge of cliffs, but,, sadly, there have also been drownings.  When a casualty is taken ashore and dispatched via road in an ambulance or via an air ambulance and the emergency services discuss matters on the pier or wherever else, all of the responders are not treated fairly.  That is the issue I have.  I support the call for the Irish Coast Guard to be designated as a stand-alone primary response agency.  On a daily basis its members sacrifice and place themselves at the peril of the Atlantic Ocean and the dangers of the jagged coastline.  It is within the Minister's remit to legislate for this cohort of volunteers to put them on the same footing as other emergency service personnel.  I am calling on him to engage personally and purposefully with them.  Now is the time for action.  There is no point in lauding them and telling them what we think of them.  The fact of the matter is that there is a two-tier health system and we now have a two-tier emergency response service.

I am aware of the interest in it in this House and in the Lower House.  We certainly have one thing in common, namely, a very healthy and large admiration for the work of this extraordinary group of people.  I have expressed that in many quarters, and in some tragic circumstances, recently.  At the very least, that is something we can both express in this House.<\/p> <p>In the recent past, I received a number of requests to introduce legislation in respect of the Irish Coast Guard, a division of my Department, most notably in correspondence I received from some Irish Coast Guard volunteers.  I would like the record to show that my Department and I have the utmost respect for the volunteers who give their free time to provide a search-and-rescue service on behalf of the Irish Coast Guard.  Their devotion to serving their communities must be commended and admired.  The latter cannot be repeated often enough.<\/p> <p>I welcome this opportunity to address some of the issues and concerns which have been raised and which have been expressed to me through correspondence.  It is true that the Irish Coast Guard is not an established legal entity.  It is, as I have said, a division of my Department.  It was established thus under a Government decision in 1990, initially as the Irish Marine Emergency Service.  The name was changed to the Irish Coast Guard in 2000.  The division was subsequently transferred from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the Department of Transport in 2006.<\/p> <p>The Irish Coast Guard has a number of functions, including search and rescue and maritime pollution prevention and response.  I am satisfied that the Irish Coast Guard, as a division of my Department, has sufficient powers to carry out its functions.  These are augmented by the various items of merchant shipping and sea pollution legislation to which I previously referred in the D&aacute;il.  These Government decisions, the Irish maritime search-and-rescue framework and legislative provisions are aligned with the accepted provisions of international law, namely, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.  This administrative and legal framework establishes the search-and-rescue function as a State function, with the Irish Coast Guard designated as responsible for maritime search and rescue.  It further defines the jurisdiction and legal authority of the rescue co-ordination centres with relevant standards of the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the International Maritime Organisation.<\/p> <p>As I have already stated, the volunteer element of the Irish Coast Guard has expressed concerns regarding its legislative standing.  However, I am of the view, in light of the context which I have just set out, that there is no need to place the Irish Coast Guard on any additional statutory footing.  Indeed, it is difficult to identify any specific need for legislation or to establish what would be the purpose of any legislation.  Legislating for a voluntary group would give rise to very complex matters.  In all probability, the volunteer sector would not be covered under any such legislation, as is evidenced by the Civil Defence Act, which does not contain any provisions in respect of its large volunteer force.  The same applies to matters such as training standards, which are dynamic and constantly evolving and which are not, therefore, an appropriate subject for legislation.<\/p> <p>The marine rescue co-ordination centres have been in existence for many decades and operate on the basis of international law and international recognised standards.  It is difficult to see what advantage would derive from further legislation.  Finally, the helicopter search-and-rescue facility is provided to the Irish Coast Guard under commercial contract to which company law applies and it could not, therefore, be legislated for in any other way.<\/p> <p>Finally, I assure Senators that there are no plans to diminish Irish Coast Guard services or reduce the number of active stations, which is a concern that has been voiced.  The location, distribution and response service provided by Irish Coast Guard assets are kept under continuous review with a view to development and improvement in the delivery of search and rescue services around the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021500002#D00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1487154600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>With the greatest respect to the Minister, I fundamentally disagree with the sentiments he has expressed.

I am glad to get the opportunity to raise this issue on what has become an increasingly serious problem for many small businesses operating within close proximity of the Border.  In recent weeks, I spoke to businesses and families in north Roscommon and south Leitrim who make their living from the solid fuel trade and who are increasingly worried about real threats to businesses and jobs.  There is growing anecdotal evidence to suggest that the solid fuel trade this side of the Border has been affected by a combination of cheaper prices for similar products in the North, and fuel smuggling.  To give an example of the current risks posed, a standard truck bringing 20 tonnes of coal from Northern Ireland across the Border without the application of carbon tax can bring a saving of almost &euro;1,200.  How can a legitimate business compete south of the Border with such a price differential?  That is without even applying the difference in VAT between the two jurisdictions, which would increase the margins further for legal traders.  This price differential is also significant when it comes to briquettes and turf because, again, no carbon tax is applied to these fuels north of the Border.  This unacceptable situation is not just detrimental to local businesses located in the Border region, but the Exchequer is also essentially robbed of tax income as a result.<\/p> <p>In light of these real threats to businesses and jobs, I ask the Minister if he is satisfied that there are enough safeguards in place to protect legal traders this side of the Border.  Are we satisfied that there is a fully co-ordinated approach between Revenue, its UK equivalent, the Garda, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, and other relevant agencies to crack down on these rogue traders?  It goes without saying that we must do everything possible to catch these perpetrators, which are damaging legitimate business.  Many of these legitimate businesses are based in rural Ireland and provide vital jobs for local economies.  Retail Excellence Ireland, the representative organisation supporting Irish retailers, recently highlighted that &euro;2.35 billion has been lost to the Irish economy as a result of smuggling in general.  This is not just to do with fuel.  It also says that there is deep concern within the fuel industry regarding the influx of illegal sales.  Retail Excellence Ireland has always said that it has received reports that gangs, courtesy of our good road network, are travelling across the country selling illegal fuel.<\/p> <p>There is also another sinister dimension to this which could have health consequences for consumers.  Retail Excellence Ireland also say that counterfeit coal bags are being used and that these contain coal which is unsafe because it has a higher sulphur content and can, as a result, be explosive.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frank Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Brexit is highlighted almost daily as another factor creating much uncertainty for businesses along the Border.  It is another concern that legal solid fuel traders have to contend with.  I cannot over-emphasise the need to eliminate all threats to small businesses based in the Border region.  To protect our solid fuel traders we must ensure that the crackdown on fuel smuggling is as rigorous as possible.  Otherwise, these traders will be forced to close their doors for good with the loss of many jobs.  We simply cannot allow that to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021500002#D00700","speaker":"1424","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487154600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his contribution and comments.  I welcome the opportunity to highlight some important points on this matter.<\/p> <p>The background is that the solid fuel carbon tax, SFCT, was provided for in the Finance Act 2010 and was commenced on 1 May 2013.  The introduction of the solid fuel carbon tax was delayed to allow for a mechanism to be put in place to address the risk of coal products with lower environmental standards being sourced from outside the State.  Regulations to enable local authorities to regulate and control the type of coal supplied in the State were put in place by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The rate of tax is currently based on a charge of &euro;20 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted from the fuel concerned.  This equates to &euro;52.67 per tonne in the case of coal and ranges from &euro;17.99 to &euro;36.67 per tonne for peat and peat-based fuel products.<\/p> <p>The yield from the solid fuel carbon tax in 2016 was in excess of &euro;24 million.  Revenue has responsibility for administering the solid fuel carbon tax and, as it does with all taxes and duties, takes a risk-focused approach in its deployment of resources on compliance activities.<\/p> <p>Currently, there is no carbon tax on domestic solid fuel in Northern Ireland.  This factor, combined with that jurisdiction's lower VAT rate on solid fuel and currency fluctuations, can give rise to significant price differentials for solid fuel between this State and Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>The solid fuel carbon tax applies on the first supply of coal and peat in the State and the tax is payable, on a bi-monthly basis, by a taxable person who is registered for VAT and making a first supply.  Every supplier who intends to make a first supply of solid fuel in the State must register with Revenue.  This obligation includes suppliers based in Northern Ireland who deliver solid fuel into the State to a private individual.  However, solid fuel carbon tax is not payable by a Northern Ireland supplier where that supplier makes the supply at the premises in the North, nor is it payable by private individuals travelling to the North to buy solid fuel for personal consumption if the individual accompanies the fuel back into the State.<\/p> <p>Revenue collects this tax on a self-assessment basis and enforces compliance by way of audit of solid fuel carbon tax returns.  It is important to note that European Union Single Market constraints preclude the use of any cross-border movement controls in the administration of the solid fuel carbon tax.  Therefore, Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel.  Similarly, the transport or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland are not, in themselves, Revenue offences and Revenue's officers have no authority to challenge such transportation or possession.<\/p> <p>Collection of solid fuel carbon tax is heavily reliant on the regulatory regime for solid fuel established by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and enforced by local authorities.  This regulatory framework covers the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels in the State and sets out particular environmental standards for coal supplied in the State.  These environmental standards are higher than those that apply in Northern Ireland.  The regulations provide for the enforcement of the relevant environmental standards by local authorities.  Local authorities have powers to inspect premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel; collect samples of coal to check for adherence to environmental standards; and prosecute traders involved in selling illicit coal.  The regulations also provide for the establishment of a register of coal suppliers by the Environmental Protection Agency.<\/p> <p>I am aware of concerns expressed by solid fuel traders, especially those located near the Border, relating to untaxed coal entering the State.  My officials will continue to engage on this matter with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  As I have outlined, that Department is responsible in the first instance for regulating solid fuel in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021500002#E00200","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1487154600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House and outlining the position.

The framework is in place now, as are the environmental standards for coal supplied in the State.  The enforcement of these environmental standards is the responsibility of local authorities.  Local authorities have powers to inspect vehicles and premises being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuels.  It seems, therefore, that there needs to be a tightening up of the inspection and standards at local level.  This is a matter for the local authorities as the powers of inspection have been given to them under the regulations.

There seems to be a lack of reality with regard to his statements.  Every time he talks about the McCabe issue, he seems to contradict not only himself but also his own Ministers.  Hopefully, we will get clarity on who knew what and when but as we all know, that is a distraction.  It is merely a circus and a source of entertainment for political types and the media but is of little real concern to the people on the ground.  What is of real concern to the people on the ground is the central issue of the treatment of Sergeant Maurice McCabe, a whistleblower who was doing his job as he saw fit and who raised concerns about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He has made allegations that he was targeted with a smear campaign of the worst and most vile type.  That is why we welcome a tribunal of inquiry that will get to the truth of this issue.  This is not just about Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  We need to get to the bottom of why it was that a whistleblower, who did his job correctly and acted in the best interests of every citizen was smeared rather than protected.  We introduced whistleblower legislation to protect whistleblowers but we should not only be seeking to protect them but to actually reward and encourage them.  We should make sure that the State not only protects whistleblowers but encourages and rewards them for doing their job.  Anyone who comes forward and acts as a whistleblower is doing a great service to this State.  When we get to the bottom of all of this it is to hoped that those who have had allegations made against them in terms of their attempts to smear Sergeant McCabe will face the full rigour of the law.<\/p> <p>In the context of the Taoiseach's inability to communicate, there was an event recently in Cork at which a person professed to be an Irish Sign Language interpreter.  That person was actually a comedian and I have received communications from members of the deaf community who were outraged by his behaviour.  He portrayed himself as a sign language interpreter and then interfered at an event at which the Taoiseach was speaking.  It was a deplorable and appalling act to use the issue of the lack of recognition of Irish Sign Language in that way.  Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe not to recognise the sign language used by its own deaf community.  <\/p> <p>I wish to put the Leader on notice, in regard to the Corporate Manslaughter (No. 2) Bill and the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill, that on 25 March Fianna F&aacute;il will propose an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that Committee Stage of both Bills be taken.

We should discuss the migration compacts in the Seanad because many questions need to be asked about EU policy, how we engage with it in respect of migration and the responsible role that we should play.<\/p> <p>Today, the European Parliament will vote on the provisional application of the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement.  As the Leader and other Senators will recall, we passed a motion of concern about the matter.  I regret that the European Parliament has previously chosen not to vote to use the appropriate checks and balances.  For example, checking the investor court mechanisms against the European Court of Justice and not to debate this specific issue.  I plead with the Leader and his party colleagues to carefully reconsider their decision because they plan to support the provisional application.  I would like to focus on what the outcome may be.  If the European Parliament votes for the provisional application of the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement then I seek clarity given the clearly expressed concern of the House about this issue.  What does the Government plan to do in the interim between provisional application and full ratification?  Will the Government seek an investor court system? <\/p> <p>I represent these Houses on the Council of Europe.  Recently the Council of Europe held a plenary session comprising parliamentarians from across Europe.  At the meeting there was large support for two motions from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights and the Committee on Social Affairs, Health and Sustainable Development.  They called for a re-examination of the provisions of the investor court system to ensure its compatibility with the European Court of Human Rights.  There was also a call to re-examine components such as the payment for future loss of profit, which was a specific concern that was expressed right across the chamber.  <\/p> <p>If the Government does not offer support then at least will it ensure it does not block a review of the investor court system?  Will the Government facilitate challenges at the legislative level in the European Court of Justice to the investor court system?  I refer to the period between provisional application and full ratification.<\/p> <p>I know there are Senators who are on the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Recently I attended one of its meetings.  On that occasion we heard of the disgraceful lack of proper engagement about exemptions and exclusions.  We also heard that there was no parliamentary debate or even consultation at committee level on what Ireland chose to exclude from its concerns about the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement.  Will we ensure that such negligence does not continue?

Over the weekend arising from the political fallout we have seen, I raised the issue of Article 28.4.2&deg; of the Constitution and the principle of Cabinet collective responsibility.  I asked the question that remains pertinent as to whether Cabinet members were acting collectively and in accordance with the principle set out in that article in the Constitution when they took a decision last week to establish the commission of investigation.<\/p><p>As we know, of course, we have now moved on from that decision and I very much welcome the Taoiseach's announcement of a public tribunal of inquiry.  I acknowledge and pay tribute to our party leader, Deputy Howlin, whose intervention prompted the change towards a public tribunal.  It is clear now that we need to air these issues in public.  Despite the focus on political fallout over which Ministers knew what at which point and said what to whom, the fundamental issue is the appalling treatment of Sergeant Maurice McCabe and his family, and the awful trauma they have suffered for so many years.<\/p><p>The other fundamental issue, of course, is the serious issue about corruption within policing that Maurice McCabe exposed through his whistleblowing.  I ask the Leader for a debate on policing issues and in particular on the oversight mechanisms that have now been established within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, largely as a result of the brave actions of whistleblowers such as Maurice McCabe.  When I was a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, we had extensive debates with representatives of the Garda Inspectorate.  We went through the report they produced which confirmed the writing-off of penalty points, the issue raised by Maurice McCabe.<\/p><p>Now that the Policing Authority is in place and we have strengthened the power of GSOC it is time to see whether these mechanisms are sufficient to ensure we do not have the widespread practices that Maurice McCabe and others exposed.  I ask for that debate, being mindful of the appalling treatment suffered by Maurice McCabe and of the need for the public tribunal of inquiry that has been announced.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader for a debate on immigration policy.  Yesterday I had a Commencement Matter addressed to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, that was dealt with by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  I raised the recent Court of Appeal decision of the rights of families, undocumented migrants here who have overstayed student visas but many of whom have children.  I understand 70 applications have been lodged to the court pending an appeal being taken by the State to the Supreme Court.  I ask for a debate on immigration policy and on our treatment of undocumented persons, given how vocal we have all been in our criticism of President Trump over the undocumented Irish in the US.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021500002#H02000","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487154600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>A parent, whose child is on a list for rehabilitation at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, has brought to my attention that 12 beds have been closed at that hospital.

This submission is still under consideration by the HSE.<\/blockquote> <p>Closing 12 existing beds out of 120 beds, 10%, is simply not acceptable.

Given the trauma of an injury, be that a stroke, a spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease, these people need access to timely and specialist rehabilitation.  Confirmation that bed capacity has been reduced by 12 beds is simply not acceptable.  I wrote to the Minister, Deputy Harris, last night.

It started almost three weeks ago on 27 January in Keshkerrigan, County Leitrim, when Paul Egan, a HSE employee from Sligo encountered a very serious car crash.  He witnessed an 18-year old woman, Tamara Jade Huxtable, from Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, wandering in the middle of the road after her friend's car crashed into a wall.<\/p> <p>As it was pouring with rain, he helped Tamara into the passenger seat of his car for shelter.  They were soon joined by garda&iacute;, and members of the fire brigade and ambulance service.  During that time, Tamara began to lapse in and out of consciousness.  Following very clear protocols, it was decided for fear of spinal injuries that Tamara would be cut out of the vehicle.  This vehicle was not involved in the accident, but was the vehicle of Paul Egan, the Good Samaritan.  In summary, his 2008 Opel Astra car was destroyed in the operation, including having its roof removed.  She was then removed from the vehicle and airlifted away by helicopter.<\/p> <p>The kindness of strangers such as Paul on that night helps prevent more serious injury.  However, Paul Egan now has no car.  A crowd-funding page has been set up by others to help him.  He has had to hire a car to allow him to continue to work.  Now the insurance company is passing the buck.  It is an absolute scandal that a man who came to the assistance of somebody in serious danger that night in Leitrim is being given the run-around by the insurance company.  It has even advised him that when he goes to renew his policy, it will treat it as if he had a claim from the accident, which is unbelievable.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to intervene in this case with the Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Generous members of the public have raised money to get him back on the road and back to work.  The insurance companies need to be brought to task over this.  Despite all this, Paul Egan has said he would do the same thing again if he encountered the same scenario.  He said, \"I have teenage daughters myself and I&rsquo;d be hoping someone would look after them if they had a problem.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021500002#J00300","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1487154600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I raise the issue of time for debate in this House.

I read a newspaper report that the Office of Public Works, OPW, will examine developing sites in conjunction with builders and developers.  The sites will have to be loaded towards development for social housing, which will be the priority in opening up these landbanks.  It is a positive step and is to be welcomed.  Pressure should be put on county councils in this respect.  It has come back to the OPW to examine the development of State held lands.  County councils have masses of landbanks which are not being used and most councils have been sitting on their hands with respect to these lands for the past number of years.  Severe pressure should be put on councils to use the landbanks they have.  What are they doing to procure houses for social housing development?  Pressure should be put on them to advertise and seek joint partners to open up and develop these lands and provide social housing.  The figures stack up because the money that is being squandered on social rents is incredible.  Where the figures add up, it makes far more sense to build social housing.  I would welcome that.  I raised this matter in Westmeath County Council two years ago but it did not get much support from the executive at the time.

There is a real issue regarding the good Samaritan case that arose in County Leitrim.  I commend Senator Swanick on raising it.  I had planned to intervene in it myself.  There is a concept in contract law whereby contracts can be void, voidable or unenforceable where they are contrary to public policy.  A significant public policy issue arises where an insurance company would impose a loading on an insured party arising out of circumstances where that party had not been at fault and, more importantly, was acting in the public interest.  It should not stand that the man in this case, Mr. Egan, should face not just a write-off in respect of his car but also a future loading on his policy.  We need to hear from the Government on that issue.  I suggest that there may be a need for legislation, or some amendment to existing legislation, that would ensure that an insurance company could not impose a penalty or a disadvantage where the circumstances of a claim involve no fault on the part of the insured and where they arise our of actions reasonably taken to protect public health and safety.  There is a real issue here whereby insurance companies must be mindful of the public good.  We spoke last night about the concept of the law needing to promote the common good.  It seems that this is a classic case involving the common good.  We need to hear from the Government on how it proposes to dialogue with the insurance industry in respect of cases of this nature and on whether legislation is necessary and possible.<\/p><p>I would also like to hear from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade regarding Ireland's diplomatic efforts to address the suffering of civilians as a result of the conflict in Yemen.  The United Nations has appealed for immediate international support to help with the worsening humanitarian crisis there.  Yemen is one of the Arab world's poorest countries.  Children, men and women are starving and some 12 million people need food, water and medicine to save and sustain their lives.  The UN has warned that famine is now a real possibility this year.  Ireland has pledged another &euro;2 million to Yemen.  That brings our total humanitarian funding to over &euro;4 million.  I will be very brief, but I think it is important.  Whereas the injection of a State donation is to be welcomed, it is also important that we consider the role of the United States and Britain in this conflict.  Given the contacts that our Government will have with the US Government in the coming weeks, it is important that we raise the question of what has happened in Yemen with President Trump in the White House.  One might consider a recent report in <i>The Guardian <\/i>about how weapons exports from Britain to the Royal Saudi Air Force continued even after an airstrike on a funeral hall led to 140 people being killed.

I will be happy to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to address the House in that regard.<\/p> <p>Senators Hopkins, Gavan and Feighan spoke about the closure of beds at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It is open to any Member, irrespective of his or her party affiliation, if any, to come to the House to raise any matter he or she considers to be important for him or her to raise.  Those of us who are familiar with the health sector will be aware that after the Minister issues an order directing how money is to be allocated, the spending of that money is administered by hospital management and the HSE.  The Minister might not be specifically responsible for the closure of beds.  Senator Hopkins made a good point about the closure of beds when she said it is about fast and timely treatment and access to care.  Senator Feighan mentioned that Roscommon County Hospital is to become a rehabilitation centre for the west.  We all join him in welcoming that.<\/p> <p>Senators Swanick, Feighan and Mullen referred to the case of Paul Egan.  This good Samaritan should certainly not be obstructed by the State or the laws of the land.  Senator Mullen is right when he says we might need to look at whether a lacuna exists in the law in this area.  I am not familiar with the legal position.  What has happened to Paul Egan should not happen to somebody who acts in good faith to help a fellow citizen.  Perhaps we can ask the Minister to come to the House to consider this matter.  If the Senators take a joint approach to raising it as a Commencement matter, it might be a way of discussing it.  Maybe it can be raised at committee level.  I thank the Senators for bringing this issue to the House.<\/p> <p>Senator Byrne highlighted the changes being made at Bank of Ireland.  We have no direct influence on that.  There is a movement towards peopleless banks or, in the case of telephone banking, contactless banks.  This is something we need to take up with the bank on behalf of the Senator.<\/p> <p>I did not mean to be disrespectful to Senator Gavan while he was speaking.  I was reading a note I had received.  As he knows, I share his view regarding Palestine.  I would be happy to invite the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to come to the House to discuss this matter.  I have received the same correspondence to which the Senator referred.  This is an important issue, not least in the context of what the Trump Administration could potentially do or is threatening to carry out.  I think there is a vital role for Ireland and the EU as a whole in this respect.  This matter was also mentioned by Senator Davitt.  It is important for us to recognise the need to have an honest debate on the role of Israel and on how it interacts and sees itself across the world stage.  Equally, we should debate the Palestinian people.  I would be happy to have such a debate in this House.<\/p> <p>Senator Dolan raised matters of disability and mental health again.  It is important to recognise that he is a champion of these issues.  I believe he has been in contact with various Departments.  I will be happy to help him to expedite the situation he raised here this morning.  It is disappointing that the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities has not been ratified.  I hope this will be done promptly.<\/p> <p>I agree with Senator Davitt there is on onus and an obligation on the OPW, county councils and developers - both public private partnerships and private developers - to work to expedite idle sites around the country that can be used to provide social housing, as in the case the Senator outlined, or to develop various social and community care facilities.

I anticipate an interesting exchange of views and look forward to hearing the comments of Senators.<\/p> <p>Since my last visit, road safety continues to be a major concern.  As we are all aware, the road safety fatality figures are still at a very high level and it is disappointing that they are running at the same level as last year already, based on recent figures. Industrial unrest in the transport sector still exists, and also there is an increasing awareness of the impact that Brexit poses for the tourism sector.  Senators have asked that I comment on these issues today.<\/p> <p>The increase in road deaths last year was very disappointing, and I would like to offer my condolences to all those who lost loved ones.  I assure the House that I am working tirelessly in the Department and with the Road Safety Authority to tackle the main causes of serious road collisions causing death and major injuries.  Road traffic legislation has been strengthened continually in recent years.  The Road Traffic Act 2016, signed by the President in December, provides a further range of improvements.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will now have power to test drivers at the roadside for a wide range of drugs.  There will be a new optional speed limit of 20 km\/h where appropriate.  New measures will ensure that written-off vehicles are recorded and we will introduce mutual recognition of driving disqualifications with the UK.  I am working to commence these measures as soon\u00a0as possible.  I am also working on a programme of further legislation for 2017.  As a priority, I will bring in a Bill to remove the provision that allows some people who are guilty of drink-driving to receive penalty points in place of disqualification.  Shockingly, there is still an average of 152 drivers arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence every week.  The ministerial committee on road safety is now meeting more regularly and I and my partners in road safety, the Road Safety Authority, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the local authorities, the Health and Safety Authority and the Office of the Attorney General, are working together to tackle the upward trend in road deaths.  I welcome the assurance by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that road safety enforcement is a priority in the Garda policing plan for 2017, that there will be a stronger focus on road traffic enforcement in Garda training and an increase of 10% in the traffic corps, which will result in more checkpoints and greater enforcement of road traffic laws.<\/p><p>I now turn to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I have no doubt that Senators share my concern about the industrial relations tensions that currently exist.  I welcome that the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, will today meet relevant parties to begin exploratory discussions.  This is an important first step in what I have no doubt will be difficult discussions for everybody concerned.  However, as I have said, this situation will only be resolved through such discussions and I urge all parties to engage constructively with the WRC.  In the context of some of the commentary of recent weeks, I would like to briefly refer to a couple of issues on which I have no doubt Senators will have their own view.<\/p><p>Others have raised the issue of Government subsidy.  We need to be clear about what that subsidy is provided for.  It is used to fund socially necessary but financially unviable services.  It cannot be used to fund commercial services such as Bus &Eacute;ireann's Expressway services.  That is not just a principle; it is a matter of law.  The State cannot legally fund one commercial bus operator but not the rest.  We have increased the public service obligation, PSO, subsidy over 2016 and again in 2017.  Last year, Bus &Eacute;ireann received 21% more than it received in 2015 and this year it will receive even more thanks to the 11% increase I secured in the budget for 2017 for PSO services generally.  As I have said, that subsidy cannot be used to fund commercial services.  I have no doubt that Senators will have concerns as regards the impact of any potential Expressway changes upon rural Ireland.  I share those concerns but have been assured by the National Transport Authority, NTA, that it will work with any affected rural community to ensure continued public transport connectivity in cases where services are reconfigured.  The authority has done that in the past and will do that again.  Let us be clear.  Bus &Eacute;ireann loses money.  These losses stem from its commercial services.  Losses must be addressed and it must do so in consultation with its employees and with a view to restoring the company to a sustainable and viable future.  I am hopeful that today&rsquo;s exploratory talks will provide the basis required for more substantive discussions in the coming days.<\/p><p>Funding is being provided for replacement and expansion of the PSO fleet with 110 buses to be purchased in 2017 for the Dublin region and 70 for the Bus &Eacute;ireann PSO fleet.  Funding is also being allocated for the development or upgrading of quality bus corridors in both the greater Dublin area and in regional cities.  The NTA has statutory responsibility for the development of public transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area, including the new metro north project.  The decision to proceed with metro north followed consideration of the Fingal-north Dublin transport study and the NTA&rsquo;s recommendations on the study, which identified the light rail link as the optimal long-term public transport solution on the Swords and airport to city centre corridor.<\/p><p>It is expected that the service will offer capacity for 9,900 passengers per hour per direction with potential to expand services in the future.  Funding for the project is provided under the Government&rsquo;s capital plan, allowing initially for the planning and design phases of the project, followed by the construction phase, which is expected to commence in 2021 with a view to delivering the project by 2026 or 2027.<\/p><p>I recognise there is considerable evidence emerging of increased travel demand across the Dublin region, with growing traffic levels on many of the region&rsquo;s roads and streets.  The welcome increase in the number in employment has impacted on transport, not only through the beginning of a recovery in public transport numbers but also through increased car use and re-emergence of peak period congestion.  As Dublin city centre is the target destination of many of the journeys being undertaken in the region, there is a substantial degree of congestion evident at many locations on the road network approaching the city.  A significant deterioration in M50 journey times has also been observed.  In so far as congestion issues in Dublin are concerned, my Department is in close contact with the NTA about addressing travel demand growth in the Dublin region with a view to intensifying efforts to combat congestion in the short to medium term through greater use of bus priority, demand management and other alleviating measures.<\/p><p>I must emphasise that a step change in the funding of public transport is required if we are to deliver and maintain a well-functioning transport system that will cater for increased travel demand, deliver modal shift and support economic recovery.  A mid-term review of the capital plan has been initiated and I will make the case for increased funding for public transport in that context to cater for increasing demand for public transport as the economy continues to improve and to encourage people to get out of their cars and onto public transport and more sustainable forms of transport.<\/p><p>In common with the rest of Government, there has been considerable analysis of the challenges which tourism faces arising from the UK referendum.  In this context, on 23 January 2017, the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan, and I hosted an all-island dialogue on the impact of Brexit on the tourism and hospitality sector.  Research shows that 7% of people living in Britain say they are less likely to holiday overseas in 2017.  The research also indicates that spending patterns are likely to change.  For example, 50% of people say they will spend less while on holiday abroad.  Tourism Ireland also presented research which estimated that outbound travel from Britain will decline by 2.5% in 2017.  Given Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on Britain, from where 41% of our overseas visitors came in 2016, tourism to Ireland is likely to be more affected than to any other destination.  Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for responding to Brexit will involve various strands, including defending key segments of the British market, very focused competition in existing markets in Europe and North America and pursuing new, potentially lucrative, markets further afield.  A commitment is given on markets further afield in the Government's tourism policy statement, People, Place and Policy - Growing Tourism to 2025, to prioritising tourism marketing efforts towards those markets providing higher revenue returns.  The programme for Government commits to implementing the policy objectives in the policy statement and achieving the targets for Irish tourism contained therein.  The UK vote does not change this.<\/p><p>In 2017, Tourism Ireland will continue to implement its market diversification strategy and intends to maximise holiday revenue through investment in mainland Europe and North America.  In addition, the depreciation of the pound against the euro since the UK referendum means that value for money will be a key message for Tourism Ireland in Britain this year.  A strong focus on the culturally curious, who tend to stay longer and spend more, will assist in the defence of the British market.  Looking to the medium term, Tourism Ireland is currently finalising its corporate plan for the period 2017 to 2019.  This plan will include the agency&rsquo;s response to marketing Ireland in Britain in the situation that has developed following the referendum.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Ireland has successfully cleared the applicant phase of the bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023 and is now in the candidate phase.  We are working closely with our Northern Ireland counterparts to ensure the best possible submission will be made by 1 June 2017.  World Rugby will make its selection in November 2017.  Hosting the event would provide a platform to showcase the island of Ireland globally.  We have the stadiums, the tourism infrastructure and ease of access, and a friendly Irish welcome is guaranteed.  We have the confidence and the capacity required to deliver a highly successful Rugby World Cup, with an ideal mix of stadiums throughout the country right in the hearts of our cities and towns.<\/p><p>Ireland is a major international tourist destination, with 10 million visitors to Ireland in 2016.  We have the range of accommodation to cater for all fans.  Our tourism infrastructure has the capacity to host all visitors we would expect to come for the tournament.  Regarding connectivity, Ireland is easy to travel to, and it is very easy to travel around to all parts of the country.<\/p><p>The 2023 Rugby World Cup also has incredible potential to engage with our Irish abroad, the Irish diaspora.  That Ireland set a US rugby attendance record for the match against New Zealand underscores Ireland's ability to tap into and mobilise the diaspora, particularly in the United States.<\/p><p>Ireland also has a proven track record of successfully staging major international sporting events and we continue to attract high-profile global events.  We are ready to host the Rugby World Cup as one of the premier global sporting events with significant attendance and overseas viewing.  Hosting it would provide a unique platform to showcase Ireland globally.<\/p><p>The tournament would have very considerable potential.  The direct economic return of hosting the tournament would be derived primarily from the spending by overseas visitors.  Based on the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England, there would he an estimated all-island economic impact of &euro;800 million from 450,000 visitors.<\/p><p>Rugby, and sport in general, will be a key beneficiary of the tournament's domestic legacy, including a multimillion sustainable investment in the enhancement of existing stadiums.  Ireland's 2023 legacy would produce a network of improved community and grassroots facilities for the next generation of players.  We will reach out to Ireland's diaspora for its support and we are confident, given the success of The Gathering, that Ireland will see tangible support for a staging of the tournament by way of many of the diaspora travelling to Ireland for the tournament.  Should we be successful, we will work closely with the tourism bodies to ensure this happens.<\/p><p>That concludes my overview.  I thank Senators for their time and patience and I look forward to hearing their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021500002#O00400","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487154600,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, who is also my local Teachta D&aacute;la.  He is very welcome back to the Seanad Chamber, where I know he spent many happy years, probably longer than almost anyone else has ever spent here.  It is good to see Senators doing well in Cabinet.  There are quite a number of former Senators in the current Cabinet.<\/p> <p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on tourism and transport.  Ireland's tourism industry has seen its overseas visitor numbers grow consistently in recent years, with growth of 13% in 2015.  Overseas visitors spent an estimated &euro;6 billion in the State in 2015, a growth of 16% on the previous year.  However, to remain competitive in the global tourism market, Ireland must ensure the quality of our services remains high, our prices remain reasonable and access to our ports and airports is maintained and improved.  The savings created by the retention of the 9% VAT rate for the tourism sector must be passed on to the consumer.  While the tourism experience offered in Ireland is unrivalled, we cannot afford to neglect the overall quality of tourism product in the country.  The Department, tourism agencies and local authorities have a key role in devising tourism product and promotion strategies and policies.  For all these bodies, we cannot get carried away with the success we have had in attracting tourists over recent years and we must not rest on our laurels.<\/p> <p>The Gathering was very successful, but since then the Government has neglected tourism product development and domestic and overseas marketing.  In budget 2017, the capital budget for tourism was cut by 4%.  In the light of Brexit and sterling devaluation, to which the Minister referred, this is a shocking statistic.  Brexit poses a real threat to further stable growth in the tourism industry, as the Minister outlined.  We must be very cognisant not only of what Brexit has done for the psychology and the way people think of Britain but also of the very real and immediate drop in the value of sterling.  It is imperative the Minister moves to publish immediately a new overarching tourism policy document to reassure the industry that a strategy is in place to deal with the potential consequences of Brexit.<\/p> <p>The Government lacks a comprehensive vision and strategic plan for how to cope with future public transport demand not only in the core Dublin city area but also in the greater Dublin area as well as the rest of the country.  The capital plan published in September is emblematic of the lack of ambition, vision and forward planning for public transport that the Government has been following.  In the period 2007 to 2010, the Fianna F&aacute;il Government set in motion two rail projects which would have radically transformed public transport in the greater Dublin area.  Both these projects, DART underground and metro north, are vital to increasing productivity and economic output in the capital into the coming decades.  Both were significantly progressed by the time the current Government came to power.  DART underground already had a railway order and was ready to go, while planning for metro north was in its final stage.  However, the Government chose to cancel both these projects in the capital plan.  While metro north has been replaced with a scaled-back alternative, the Government's decision to abandon these projects has effectively set back public rail transit in the capital for decades.<\/p> <p>It is vital that the DART underground project goes ahead.  The project has economic benefits which reach far beyond the greater Dublin area.  If completed, it will link up our southern and western rail lines with the DART, eastern and northern rail lines.  It will more than double capacity on the Maynooth and Kildare route, which in turn will enable more frequent and better integrated rail services.  The project would allow people to travel from Dublin Airport directly to Cork, Limerick and Galway.  The previous Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, claimed he was unconvinced by the business case for the project.  This was a disingenuous claim, especially when one considers the strong endorsement put forward by the National Transport Authority at the time.  Analysts have long warned of the massive challenges facing transport in the greater Dublin area.  The M50 has already reached peak capacity, as the Minister outlined, and commuters are already all too aware of the difficulties facing our transport network.  It has been suggested the Government now realises the mistake it made and is considering advancing DART underground, which is positive.  However, it is disappointing that Deputy Donohoe's previous statement will result in much higher costs for and a much greater delay to the project when and if it ever happens.<\/p> <p>Last week, works began in Cherrywood, an area the Minister would know well, in south Dublin.  I outlined this yesterday on the Order of Business.  It is fantastic to see the groundbreaking ceremony happen.  This development will potentially lead to 8,000 houses, with an increase in the population of between 20,000 and 25,000 projected.  As the Minister knows, many of the Luas green line stations in his constituency - my constituency too - are effectively at capacity for a significant part of the day.  One hears of people in Dundrum going up the line to Kilmacud to cross over the tracks to get back in because one cannot get on at Dundrum.  This is before 8,000 homes and 20,000 people are added to Cherrywood.  What will we do about the Luas green line?  I do not know how it might be handled.  I am not a transport engineer.  I do not know whether it is possible to lengthen the carriages - probably not - or whether the frequency of trains can be further increased, but the line is very busy all day before the addition of another 20,000 people.  Ideally, Cherrywood could be a self-sustaining community in which many of the facilities and services are on site.  However, it is unrealistic to believe that all 8,000 homes and the entirety of the population living there will not need a good quality, efficient transport service with adequate capacity.<\/p> <p>The competitiveness and attractiveness of Dublin and its surrounding counties as a destination for living, visiting and doing business will be seriously undermined unless actions are taken to increase the capacity and usability of public transport to better manage traffic during peak periods and reduce private car share.  The population of the greater Dublin area is expected to grow by 22% by 2030 and by 26% in the mid-east region, including Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  Increasing investment in bus services as well as DART underground, metro north and Luas is vital.<\/p> <p>I have a few other small points.  The Minister referred to road safety.  What he is doing in this field is commendable but, and this is as much a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality as it is for him, enforcement and the Garda traffic corps are noticeably absent on the roads.  That is the only way of putting it.  Not enough people are worried about being caught.  People are taking chances.  The Minister's predecessor both in Dublin South and in the Department, Seamus Brennan, introduced a penalty points system.  There was great resistance to it by officials initially, but it had a very positive effect in terms of lives saved.  Enforcement is the key.  We in the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach dealt with the cost of motor insurance.  The cost of motor insurance is related to the number of claims, and the claims are related to the number of accidents.<\/p> <p>It is disappointing that whereas the Minister's statement referred to sustainable modes of transport, nowhere was cycling mentioned in his entire speech.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=15\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In Dublin especially we need to provide proper cycling facilities.  This means not only better surfaces - they are often not joined up &ndash; but we need to ensure that employees have safe places to lock their bikes as well as decent changing facilities in buildings. <\/p><p>The Minister referenced demand management.  That expression is usually code for road pricing and I am concerned.  Will the Minister outline what he means by that and whether he is referring to demand management on the M50 and further tolls?<\/p><p>There was a proposal approximately ten years ago called the blue line.  It related to a rapid bus transit project along the eastern bypass corridor through much of Dublin and Rathdown.  The idea was to connect the Luas and DART with UCD and RTE.  At this stage, the road reservation is there and the proposal for the eastern bypass will not start before 2035 and may never progress.  It would be good to use that corridor as a way of delivering high-quality public transport along a route that has many trip generators, in particular UCD, Dundrum Town Centre and Sandyford business district.  It could connect the DART and Luas with all other major trip generators on that line.  I thank the Minister for his time and I look forward to his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021500002#Q00200","speaker":"1412","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487154600,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I wish to concentrate on issues around transport.  I realise it is only part of the overall brief and responsibility of the Minister.<\/p> <p>I note the Minister's emphasis on the Road Safety Authority.  The Minister will recall that the last time he was in the House I asked for some detail or clarification relating to vacancies for directors on the RSA board.  The Minister outlined a course of action and associated reasons.  He explained that he had more names than people and that he did not quite know what their recommendations were.  He said he wanted to review the whole matter.  That is the Minister's prerogative and I acknowledge that.  However, I believe it is important that the Road Safety Authority has all the necessary resources and personnel to do its job.  After all, the authority has a statutory remit.<\/p> <p>The Minister also mentioned an ongoing report or review of the RSA.  The Minister might share with us the position at this point.  Where is the RSA review?  Has it been completed?  What are its recommendations, if it is complete?  When does the Minister intend to fill the three vacancies on the board of directors of the RSA?<\/p> <p>I want to raise an issue that I raised with the Minister previously on numerous occasions.  It relates to the inordinate delays for everyone - young people in particular are affected &ndash; who wishes to do a driving test.  We know there are major delays in Donegal, Sligo and, to a lesser extent, Galway.  Young people want to do a driving test in these places but they are repeatedly delayed.  The problem is especially acute in parts of rural Ireland where there is a high reliance on private cars.  They do not have the public transport network to get around.<\/p> <p>The evidence shows that many young people are driving without an experienced accompanying driver.  They are leaping from village to town.  That is not right.  We cannot condone that but that is the reality.  These young people want to do their test and get it.  It impacts on their insurance and independence.  I believe it is appropriate to put some measures in place to fast-track applications where there are backlogs in the system.  People who want to do their driving test should be able to do it.  I got a call this morning from Councillor Nicholas Crossan from Donegal.  He said it is one of the major issues in his clinic in Buncrana week in, week out.  Young people in their 20s and 30s are waiting for months.  That is unacceptable and I am keen to hear what the Minister has to say about it.<\/p> <p>More pressing is the potential of a major travel dispute that will affect public transport next week.  I took the time to look over the submission by the National Bus and Rail Union and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It was submitted by the NBRU spokesman, Dermot O'Leary, and Patrick McCusker.  I will not reread the submission.  The joint committee raised several issues.  Clearly, we have a major travel dispute and industrial dispute under way.<\/p> <p>It cannot really be said that the Minister does not have a role in respect of transport.  A number of the Minister's colleagues in the Independent Alliance would be fully aware of the implications for rural transport.  It is one of the planks of this Government's policy in the partnership Government manifesto, to which the Minister is a party and to which his colleagues are committed.  The aim is to bridge the shortcomings in terms of infrastructure for rural communities.  Rural communities rely heavily on public transport and they avail of various modes of transport provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>We really have a critical issue.  We also have issues relating to the Department of Social Protection.  That Department funds aspects of the rural travel system and the fees are being paid by that Department.  I am not suggesting that the Department should be lumbered with fees.  However, the reality is that public transport is a service, especially in rural communities.  The Minister does have a role, as does the Minister for Social Protection, the NTA and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in resolving this dispute.<\/p> <p>It is a question of public health.  If there is insufficient money, we have to deal with it.  Transport is a critical issue for people, especially in rural communities.  I am keen to hear how the Minister intends to take some responsibility in terms of negotiating with all parties to get some resolution.  Certainly, there must be reform and cost-cutting measures.  However, the reality is this is not a level playing pitch.  Some private people operate on some routes.  Some of the routes have been cherry-picked as a result of NTA encouragement over many years.  The public sector companies are taking up the bad routes and many of them are not profitable.<\/p> <p>A key issue arises for the Minister's political group.  I know that the Minister and his group are absolutely committed to balanced regional and rural development.  I believe this is one aspect of the dispute.  I am keen to hear what the Minister has to say.  I believe this is critical.  A great deal is at stake here.  We need to look at it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021500002#R00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1487154600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity, in the time allotted to me, to cover several points relating to transport, tourism and sport.  In the past three weeks the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs published a plan for sustainable communities and regional development.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has launched a plan for the period from 2020 to 2040.  These proposals should, if implemented, lead to greater balanced regional development.  However, the history of such plans has shown that they tend to become hijacked politically and not implemented.<\/p> <p>For these plans to be successful it is important that the roll out of transport infrastructure throughout the country connects the west coast with the east coast and the north west and so on.  That is crucial.  Obviously, the need for metro plans in Dublin and the other cities has been raised.  However, let us look ahead 20 years.  We could have a situation whereby the east coast is totally choked and the west coast is totally devoid.  We need connections.  It is vital to plan for and roll out the infrastructure.  We do not expect it to be done by next year, but we need to see the development of motorways such as the M4 and M5 as well as the M17 Gort to Tuam motorway.  That will be completed next year.  That route needs to be continued to Sligo and on to Donegal for balanced development.  This is the key to the other plans relating to the spines and connectivity that we see.<\/p> <p>The need is similar in the case of regional airports.  I was at a meeting in Ireland West Airport Knock on Monday.  Those at the meeting articulated the development taking place there.  They had a record year with 750,000 passengers, more than all the other regional airports put together.  It is not an airport for Mayo; it is an airport for the west and the north west.  It needs to be continually supported.  Those at the meeting outlined that &euro;1.2 million was contributed in PRSI and tax to the Government as a result of people directly employed there.  A further 900 indirect jobs are supported by the airport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017021500002#R00300","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1487154600,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
