Depending on the nature of the individual circumstances, a child may be received into the care of the State.  At the end of July 2014, there were 6,466 children in care.<br\/><br\/>The majority  - 93% - of children in care are placed in foster care with a family.  Where a foster care placement is unsuitable, children may be placed in a children's residential centre.  There were 339 children placed in children's residential centres at the end of July 2014.  Children's residential centres can be operated directly by the Agency or by a private or voluntary provider on behalf of the Agency.  A child is placed in a private residential centre when no suitable Child and Family Agency placement is available and the placement has been assessed as meeting the needs of the child.  Children with more complex and challenging needs are generally placed in private residential centres.<br\/><br\/>Nationally, at the end of July 2014, 163 children in residential care were placed in  private residential centres, 38 of whom were in private residential centres in Dublin North East.  I am advised by the Agency that in February 2014, there were 63 Private Residential Child Care Centres in operation throughout the country.  21 of these were based in the Dublin North East Region.  I have asked the Agency for up to date information in relation to this Region and I will arrange for this to be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available.<br\/><br\/>The Agency undertook a tendering process in 2013 for the provision of private residential placements.  All Private Children's Residential Providers are now subject to contract.  The Agency advised that approximately 91 places in 23 centres operated by 9 providers will be subject to a block-book contract at &euro; 4,500 per week per place.  This is a reduction from the previous average cost of &euro;5,000 per week prior to tendering process.  The value of the tender is &euro;23.6 million. <br\/><br\/>The Agency advised that the number of placements procured is less than what is used from the private sector at any one time so the Agency does not pay for beds that are not used.  This means the Agency &quot;spot purchase&quot; a number of beds over and above what is procured on a block basis.<br\/><br\/>All private children's residential centres who were not awarded or did not enter the block-book element of the tender will also be considered as approved providers for &quot;spot purchased &quot; placements.  These &quot;spot purchased&quot; placements are now governed for the first time ever by an approved provider system.  136 places are available in 40 centres operated by 17 approved providers who were not part of the above tender process, should these placements be required by the Agency.

It is important that any such process should be as sensitive and non-adversarial as possible, consistent with the requirements of natural justice and the provisions of the Commission of Investigation Act 2004.  As the Commission will be addressing matters which touch on areas of great personal sensitivity it will be necessary that appropriate protocols be adopted which protect the confidentiality of sensitive personal information. <\/p><p>  More generally, our approach should have regard to the facts established through recent inquiries into related institutions, and the general experience gained in conducting similar investigations into matters of public importance.

The two Departments continue to collaborate on the quality agenda for Early Years Services.  Indeed the fact that the Early Years Education Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills is co-located with my Department in Mespil Road is testament to the close working relationship.<br\/><br\/>My Department supports quality in pre-school education in a number of ways.  These include funding voluntary organisations to carry out the field testing of the Siolta Quality Assurance Programme and the roll out of the Aistear in Action projects, incentivising higher qualifications through the criteria for funding attaching to the free pre-school year, and, most recently, the introduction of new qualification requirements for staff in child care settings and financial support for staff to achieve those qualifications.  <br\/><br\/>In respect of primary and secondary level pupils, the Child and Family Agency assists the Department of Education and Skills in a number of ways.<br\/><br\/>The functions and operational responsibilities of the former National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) are now part of the new Child and Family Agency.  Since 1<sup>st<\/sup>January 2014 the staff of the former NEWB, including its Education Welfare Officers, have transferred to the new Agency. <br\/><br\/>The three service strands formerly under the remit of NEWB collectively form the Educational Welfare Services of the new Agency.  These are:<br\/><br\/>- The Education Welfare Service, which has specific responsibility for the Agency&rsquo;s general function to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education,<br\/><br\/>- The Home School Community Liaison Programme, which has 402 school-based co-ordinators; and<br\/><br\/>- The School Completion Programme which has a &euro;24 m budget and provides to support 124 locally managed projects and related initiatives operating across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools and providing targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people.<br\/><br\/>I am confident that this Government's decision to amalgamate the educational welfare functions formerly assigned to the National Educational Welfare Board, into the Child and Family Agency will provide opportunities for more effective working amongst the range of professionals involved in directly supporting children and their families.  <br\/><br\/>The Children Detention Schools in Oberstown, provide education facilities to children detained there by the courts.

Some 230 projects are supported under the Fund. They are located in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  The objective is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people into facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.

As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, my aim is to highlight the potential youth work can play, as part of the response to the youth employment challenge, through collaboration with other interests.  Youth work and non-formal learning, in its many programmes and activities, offers young people opportunities to acquire new competences and skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, motivation, creativity and leadership. These are core and transferable life skills - the 21st century skills - that are so important to training and career readiness.<\/p><p>  The work of the voluntary youth work sector, in the provision of youth services, has a significant contribution to make to the Government&rsquo;s jobs agenda for young people including the Action Plan for Jobs, led by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Pathways to Work and the implementation of the Youth Guarantee for unemployed young people, which is led by the Department of Social Protection.

The Agency has advised me that day to day exigencies of service provision, such as staff absence due to annual, maternity and sick leave, can impact on services. The Agency further advised that there may be circumstances in which local decisions are made in regard to work planning within the context of service priorities, such as child protection workloads within an area or staff availability. In these circumstances, it may be determined that a &lsquo;child in care review&rsquo; can be deferred for a short period. Such a decision will be made on the basis of risk assessment and would apply to particularly stable care placements. Special Care, High Support, Residential care and short term foster care are all prioritised for an allocated social worker. Ongoing provision of social work to children and foster families is ensured in these circumstances.<\/p><p>  The Agency is in receipt of funding of &euro;6.7m this year to alleviate identified service pressures and to support the continuing implementation of the reform programme across children and family services.  <\/p><p>  This funding is being targeted at a number of areas, including the replacement of staff on maternity leave by way of  a 12 month temporary contract.

Accordingly, it is not possible to provide the specific information requested by the Deputy at this time.<\/p><p>  There are a number of reliefs where detailed information is not required to be returned to Revenue and therefore no costing is readily available without a detailed review of case records by the Commissioners.  I am informed that the agritaxation review referred to above uses information from a variety of sources to estimate costs for a wider selection of farmer tax reliefs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500046#WRG02800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Application","counter":184,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500046#WRG02900"},{"type":"question","counter":185,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[36391\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500046#WRG03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost of extending the stamp duty consanguinity relief for non-residential property after 31 December 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[36397\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500046#WRG03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost of extending the 1% stamp duty rate for transfers to close relatives post 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":187,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 82 together.<br\/><br\/>It is assumed the Deputy is referring in both questions to the stamp duty consanguinity relief for non-residential property.

The initial sale or purchase, or the exchange, must occur in the relevant period and the subsequent sale or purchase must occur within 24 months of that sale or purchase. <\/p><p>  Full relief from capital gains tax will be given where the consideration for the purchase or the exchange is equal to or exceeds the consideration for the sale or the other land that is exchanged.  Where the consideration for the purchase or the exchange is less than the consideration for the land that is sold or the other land that is exchanged, relief will be given in the same proportion that the consideration for the land that is purchased or exchanged bears to the consideration for the land that is sold or the other land that is exchanged. <\/p><p>  Provision is made for the clawback of the relief where qualifying land in respect of which relief has been given is disposed of within 5 years of the date of the purchase or exchange of that land.  A clawback does not apply where the disposal arises under a compulsory purchase order. <\/p><p>  A prerequisite to any disposal and acquisition of farm land qualifying for this relief is that an application for a farm restructuring certificate is made to Teagasc and that Teagasc grants such a certificate (that has not been withdrawn).\u00a0 Guidelines relating to the application for, and the issue of, a Farm Restructuring Certificate are available on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's website. <\/p><p>  The purpose of the relief is to ensure that the sale and purchase of farm land together lead to a reduction in the distance between parcels of land comprised in a farm, thereby leading to an improvement in the viability of the consolidated farm.  Depending on the circumstances in any particular case, it may be that the disposal of two separate holdings of land and their replacement with a single holding of equal value may qualify as farm restructuring for the purposes of this relief.  This would be a matter for Teagasc to consider in the first instance by reference to the full facts being known.<\/p><p>  The farm restructuring relief is one of the measures under consideration in the context of the AgriTaxation Review which I announced in my Budget 2014 speech.

The SFPA is the independent law enforcement agency of the State for sea fisheries law. <br\/><br\/>As Minister, I do not have responsibility in relation to the issues raised by the Deputy.  Responsibility in these matters rests with the SFPA.  The SFPA have a challenging job to do.  Its statutory responsibility is to enforce EU and national law under the Common Fisheries Policy.  It also has responsibility to provide a level playing field for everybody in this industry.  If one boat or two or six boats are overfishing deliberately, it is not a victimless crime.  It has an impact on others who are law abiding and who are catching in accordance with the quotas allocated to them.  The market situation for pelagic fish is currently challenging, as Russia has banned the importation of pelagic fish and Russia has been an important market for mackerel, in particular.  If illegally caught fish are being placed on the market, it displaces and reduces prices for those operators, the majority of our industry, who are abiding by the rules set down.  In my view, it is in the interest of the industry as a whole to have strong and fair arrangements in place that give confidence that the rules apply across the board and that all operators are abiding by the quota allocations made available to them. <br\/><br\/>In order to inform the Deputy, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority has sent me a report on the issues that have given rise to the current situation, the actions taken and the current state of consultation between the SFPA and the industry. <br\/><br\/>Arrangements for the monitoring and control of fisheries is set down in the EU Control Regulation 1224\/09.  Article 60(2) of the Council Regulation requires that weighing of fisheries products shall be carried out on landing prior to the fisheries products being held in storage, transported or sold.  The SFPA has allowed a derogation from the EU regulations and permitted the weighing of pelagic fish post-transport in every plant since 2012, based on assurances that proper systems and procedures that accurately recorded catches were in place in these plants. <br\/><br\/>However, there have been substantial indications that fish have been landed in weights that exceed those recorded by the weighing systems in factories.  These indications have arisen through the routine course of the SFPA&rsquo;s work and as a result of joint inspections with other organisations, including the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  The SFPA has set out some of the issues that gave rise to concerns.  These include a high level of divergence between spot checks by the SFPA and the official factory weight, even taking account of some divergence relating to water content.  A trend of individual trucks recording substantially more fish when subject to an SFPA official control compared to instances when not subject to such controls.  One instance involved a simple on-off switch on the belt weigher in a factory which had the effect of allowing the belt to transit fish without being recorded on the meter.  If used in this way, fish would not be weighed or recorded. <br\/><br\/>The permits which allow in-factory weighting have lapsed due to the SFPA&rsquo;s overall lack of confidence in the operation of the weighing systems.  The SFPA has entered into discussions with both catchers and processors to implement systems and procedures that will restore confidence in the weighing systems in factories.  The SFPA have set out to the factories certain requirements necessary before permits can be granted, allowing the renewal of in-factory weighing.  These requirements include provisions to give assurances that weigh belts in the factories when moving are recording.  They include confirmation of product flows into and out of the plant and checks involving weighing of a sample of landings on the pier side as a means of validating factory weighing.<br\/><br\/>Several pelagic fish factories have over recent days applied for permits under the new requirements, albeit generally qualified by statements around non-acceptance of some of the requirements described by SFPA.  These applications are currently being considered by the SFPA.  The representative bodies for the Irish pelagic industry have acknowledged the need for change.  However, they are not to date willing to support the SFPA requirement for a continuous remote monitoring facility to increase assurances of accurate recording.  Furthermore, they are not to date willing to provide stock movement records at the level of detail of the SFPA request. Irish catchers have said they are not willing to move to recognise the validity of weighing at landing, even as a component cross checking arrangement of an overall system of supporting factory permits.<br\/><br\/>I understand and appreciate that the new arrangements sought by the SFPA for the effective control of pelagic fisheries involve some changes in practices. However, in the long run, I believe that it will be in the interests of the industry as a whole to commit to strengthened controls that give all catchers and processors assurances that there is a level playing field across the industry.  I would encourage the industry to continue its dialogue with the SFPA.  The SFPA is currently considering existing applications for in factory weighing permits and is awaiting further applications from the remainder of the factories.  If there are additional technical issues to be sorted out, the SFPA have assured me that it remains available for further discussion with industry representatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500048#WRJ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500049#WRK00150"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[36207\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500049#WRK00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding an agri-environment option scheme payment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"975","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>The person named was approved for participation in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS 3) with effect from the 1<sup>st<\/sup>May 2013.

Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application. Currently, 4,330 persons are residing in 34 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA. Direct Provision owes its origin as the public policy response to a major accommodation crisis that existed in the late 1990s \/ early 2000s. At its high point in 2005 the number of persons residing in Direct Provision was 8080.<\/p><p>  A key finding in the 2010 Value for Money Report on the Direct Provision system was that if we were operating a system which provided for asylum seekers to live independent lives in individual housing with associated social welfare payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' towards the State it would clearly create, the cost to the exchequer could be possibly double what is currently paid under the direct provision system. The report is available in full on the agency's website on www.ria.gov.ie.<\/p><p>  In terms of the cost of replacing the Direct Provision system with private rented accommodation, it is difficult to calculate what that cost would be. The number of persons seeking asylum  this year is currently  running at 40% higher than last. This, invariably, creates additional pressures and challenges for the State. Asylum seekers are not obliged to avail of direct provision supports and a significant number choose to make their own arrangements in the absence of an alternative. Should a system be introduced whereby such persons could effectively avail of mainstream social welfare supports, including rent supplement in line with those available to Irish citizens, it would be logical to expect that the numbers seeking such State supports could increase significantly with costs rising accordingly. It would also be logical to expect an increase in the number of economic migrants seeking to enter the State via the asylum system. Therefore, any change to the current Direct Provision system must be given careful consideration.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to making real improvements to the protection process, including direct provision.  We have made a number of commitments to this end in the Statement of Government Priorities 2014 &ndash; 2016.  This includes a commitment to establish an independent Working Group to report to Government on improvements to the protection process, including Direct Provision and supports for asylum seekers.<\/p><p>  My intention is to proceed with the establishment of that Working Group in the near future.  Together with Minister of State O&rsquo;R&iacute;orda&iacute;n, I hosted a Round Table on 18 September to provide non-governmental organisations active in the field of asylum the opportunity to outline the key issues for them in relation to the State's current arrangements for asylum seekers.  That initiative was widely welcomed by the NGOs involved and proved very useful for the purpose of identifying the issues which will need to be addressed.  I will be using the outcome of that meeting to inform the terms of reference of the Working Group which I expect to establish shortly.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500051#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Recruitment","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500051#WRM00450"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[36382\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500051#WRM00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the expected number of new Garda recruits to commence training in 2015; the additional cost in 2015 of increasing this number by 100 and 200 respectively; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":319,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the first intake since 2009 of 100 new recruits entered training at the Garda College in Templemore on Monday 15th September 2014.

In so doing  the Agency will promote enhanced interagency cooperation  to ensure that services  are coordinated on the principle of the best interest of all children and their families.<\/p><p>  The Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency is in the process of refining and implementing a new strategic approach to service delivery through an integrated model of service committed to the principle of &ldquo;One Child, One Team, One Plan&rdquo;. The EWS of the Child and Family Agency is developing national guidelines as a practical support for schools in the preparation of School Attendance Strategies as outlined in Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. The guidelines will assist schools to implement effective measures to support children at risk of poor attendance and participation, including those with caring responsibilities. It is anticipated that the guidelines will be completed before the beginning of the 2015\/16 academic year.<\/p><p>  In order to learn more about children that undertake caring roles, my Department requested the Central Statistics Office to help to identify the extent to which children have caring responsibilities.<\/p><p>  The Census of Population 2011 found that 6,449 children, or 5.6 per 1,000 children provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problems or disability.

Under the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives (2011-2016) analysis of those figures in the 2011 Census will help to inform future policy as to how best to address the support needs of children and young people who undertake caring roles.

In this context I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes.<br\/><br\/>A second free pre-school year would represent &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 worth of free childcare to parents and would be likely to generate 4,000-5,000 new jobs, albeit mostly part-time. <br\/><br\/>However, the introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current one-year provision, which is &euro;175 million per annum.  This additional funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the pre-school provision is key to good outcomes for children.  The Early Years Quality Agenda that is being progressed by my Department, and which involves a range of actions in key areas aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime, is a key building block for any further extension of universal childcare provision.<br\/><br\/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures,<\/i>the national policy framework for children and young people 2014-2020, recognises the value of early childhood care and education in supporting children's early cognitive, social and emotional development, and the Government is committed to the introduction of a second free pre-school year within the lifetime of the framework once the required quality standards are achieved and subject to the availability of resources.  My Department and I will be keeping this commitment under review in the context of the progress of the Early Years Quality Agenda.<br\/><br\/>The approximate additional extra cost of  extending the ECCE programme is:<br\/><br\/>4 hours per day, five days per week, for 38 weeks=&euro;58m<br\/><br\/>5 hours per day, five days per week, for 38 weeks=&euro;117m<br\/><br\/>6 hours per day, five days per week, for 38 weeks=&euro;175m<br\/><br\/>3 hours per day, five days per week, for 44 weeks=&euro;27.66m<br\/><br\/>3 hours per day, five days per week, for 46 weeks=&euro;36.88m<br\/><br\/>3 hours per day, five days per week, for 48 weeks=&euro;46.10m<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that there are factors outside cost which would impact on policy decisions in this area.  For example a programme that lasted for a 6 hour day would be very onerous for young children, and programmes that extended outside the primary school year could be difficult for parents to manage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500052#WRN02700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Detention Centres","counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500053#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":387,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[36259\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500053#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if his attention has been drawn to complaints regarding the treatment of clients and the use of funds at Oberstown campus, County Dublin; if he will investigate the matter.","asker":"1022","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":388,"content":"<p>I assume the Deputy's reference to clients concerns children in custody in the children detention schools.<\/p><p>  I am not aware of any complaints regarding the treatment of children and the use of funds at the Oberstown campus. \u00a0There are complaint mechanisms available to children who are in custody in Oberstown.

The report found that there have been significant improvements in the service response to homelessness of children and this has contributed to a decrease in the number of children presenting to services as being homeless.<\/p><p>  It should of course be noted that policy responsibility for homeless young people, insofar as it extends to my Department, relates to children under 18 and any child welfare and protection concerns that may arise in the context of the Child Care Act 1991. Young people who are homeless, either singly or as part of a family unit and not falling within this category are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.  Young people who were formerly in the care of the State and presently in receipt of aftercare services will, as part of this support, have their accommodation needs identified.<\/p><p>Children under 16 who present as being homeless to emergency services are taken into care. Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care, or provided a service under Section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991. Such children are typically more challenging to care for as they may be out of school; have experienced neglect and serious family discord; problematic drug use; have mental health or learning difficulties. These children often wish to be only involved with peers and they may be less inclined to engage with social work services. Services need to provide early and flexible options to engage with these children and to support them beyond their 18 birthday.<\/p><p>  Aftercare is the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him\/her in making the transition to independent living. The children most vulnerable to homelessness as care leavers are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements. Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that helps them achieve positive outcomes. It is essential that these young people have an opportunity to develop a relationship with a dedicated aftercare worker who will work with them to identify their needs and ensure that services are in place to help provide them with the stability and support they need.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare. This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.<\/p><p>  The prioritisation of services for young people receiving aftercare is considered in the context of the statutory and administrative criteria and rules relating to State provision of services and the requirement of all State bodies to provide services in accordance with resources available to them.

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines. In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website ().<br\/><br\/>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. Due to the very difficult and challenging economic environment in which the Government targeted additional savings in health expenditure of &euro;619 million in 2014, which must be achieved while protecting front line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible, the HSE decided it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. <br\/><br\/>It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost effectiveness of Fampridine.

The key response is the establishment of an ex-gratia payment scheme, which will cost around &euro;34 million.  In addition, there is a commitment to the continued provision of medical services, including medical cards for the women.<br\/><br\/>This followed Government&rsquo;s examination of a report carried out by Professor Oonagh Walsh, on <i>Practice of Symphysiotomy in Ireland, between 1944 and 1984; <\/i>and<i><\/i>an <i>Independent Review of Issues relating to Symphysiotomy <\/i>by Judge Yvonne Murphy which advised Government, inter alia, on the relative liabilities of insurers, indemnifiers and\/or other parties in relation to symphysiotomy and on the merits and costs of proceeding with an ex gratia scheme relative to allowing the court process to proceed.  <br\/><br\/>Judge Murphy outlined the case for a scheme in her report and her recommendations on levels of awards were accepted by Government.  Subsequently, I asked Judge Murphy to draw up a detailed draft scheme. I have consulted through the summer with the Judge and have also been speaking to relevant parties about the proposed scheme.  Judge Murphy submitted her more detailed proposal to me on 11 September, setting out how the scheme should operate.  In this context I met the support groups representing women who have undergone symphysiotomy last Friday. I wanted to hear from the support groups how they hope the scheme will operate, and to confirm to them that the scheme will be established as quickly as possible.<br\/><br\/>Key aspects of the proposed scheme include: <br\/><br\/>- Women who had a surgical symphysiotomy in the State between the years 1940 and 1990 may apply in accordance with, and subject to the terms of the scheme. <br\/><br\/>- The scheme will be run by an independent Assessor.  If women have questions on any aspect of the scheme, the Assessor or secretariat, will be available to assist. <br\/><br\/>- The scheme will be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial. It will allow women to have legal and other advice available to them in preparing to submit an application.  It will result in awards of between &euro;50,000 and &euro;150,000 for the women.<br\/><br\/>- Women who have had a surgical symphysiotomy and have medical evidence to prove it may accept an award of &euro;50,000 without further assessment. If no medical records are available a medical assessment will be carried out.<br\/><br\/>- For those who wish to apply for higher awards (&euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000)  a medical assessment may be necessary if  up to date medical records are not available, or if the Assessor decides this is needed for final determination of the award. <br\/><br\/>- Women will not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a pre-condition to participating in the scheme.  Women may opt out at any stage in application and assessment process, up to the time of accepting their awards.  However, on accepting the offer of the award under the Scheme, women will have to agree to discontinue their legal proceedings against any party arising out of their symphysiotomy.<br\/><br\/>I intend to finalise the details of the scheme shortly and will bring a Memorandum to Government requesting approval to appoint an Assessor for the scheme instead of it being administered by the State Claims Agency and to a small number of other amendments to the Government decision of last July.  The details concerning the scheme and its commencement date will be advertised in national and other media, as decided by the Assessor.  I hope that when the women see the details of the scheme and the efforts made to ensure it is person-centred, simple and non-adversarial many of them will opt to join the scheme.<br\/><br\/>In agreeing to the ex-gratia scheme, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to trying to bring a resolution for the women concerned. The Government has acknowledged the pain and suffering which the procedure caused to many of the women and is aware also of  the uphill battle many of them will face in the courts with uncertainty about the outcome of that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500057#WRS01900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Recruitment","counter":506,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500057#WRS01950"},{"type":"question","counter":507,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[36218\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500057#WRS02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of community mental health posts sanctioned in 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014; the number of these posts which have been filled to date and the number of outstanding vacancies which remain to be filled","asker":"1190","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":508,"content":"<p>Since 2012, an additional &euro;90 million and some 1,150 posts have been funded comprising &euro;35 m for 414 posts in 2012, &euro;35 m for up to 477 posts in 2013, and &euro;20 m for approximately 250 posts in 2014.

The HPRA is responsible for determining the method of sale and supply of a medicine and also determining whether it should be available on prescription, or not.<\/p><p>  The HPRA is committed to the current Irish health care policy which aims, where appropriate, to provide patients with increased access to safe medicines, at the lowest level of complexity and cost.  In July 2014, the HPRA published a list of 12 active substances contained in medicines currently classified as prescription-only medicines (POM), which could be safely reclassified to be available for sale &ldquo;over the counter&rdquo; (OTC) in pharmacies. This list includes products for the treatment of migraine, acid-reflux symptoms, hay fever, cold sores, muscle pain and inflammation, fungal skin and nail infections and other inflammatory skin conditions.<\/p><p>  This was a significant development. It represented the outcome of measures which have been undertaken by the HPRA to explore unmet needs in the availability of non-prescription medicines in Ireland. It also follows recommendations made by an independent consultative panel established by the HPRA to specifically assist its review of this area.<\/p><p>  Arising from the publication of the above mentioned list, expressions of interest in reclassification of certain medicines have been received from the marketing authorisation holders (MAHs). The HPRA is now working with manufacturers and MAHs to progress.<\/p><p>  In reclassifying a medicine there are number of factors that need to be considered.

The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final. <br\/><br\/>  In addition, the staffing appeals process at primary level was extended for the current school year to allow schools that are not gaining an additional teaching post under the developing schools criterion to submit an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. This appeal criterion is targeted at those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places and so assist the response to demographic growth within their area and, as a result, are under significant pressure on their class sizes at infants level. Circular 0007\/2014 provides details for schools wishing to make an appeal.<br\/><br\/>  The allocation of all teaching posts is contingent on compliance with redeployment arrangements. The core function of the redeployment arrangements is to facilitate the redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers to other schools that have vacancies. The redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers is key to the Department's ability to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers. <br\/><br\/>  I believe that allocating resources based on projected enrolments for the coming school year is not practical and would impact negatively on the teacher allocation and redeployment process and the timeframes in which this process is completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500062#WRX00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Training Provision","counter":660,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500062#WRX00325"},{"type":"question","counter":661,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[36354\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092500062#WRX00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will review the decision made by her predecessor in 2012 which removed the subsidiary that was granted to student teachers to undertake a mandatory Gaeltacht placement; if her attention has been drawn to the huge, additional costs being imposed on student teachers due to this decision; if she will confirm the annual cost of this subsidiary to the State in 2012; her views on whether this decision was fair; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"962","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":662,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that the cost of the Gaeltacht Placement is a significant cost to students and their families.

The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the water charges plan to be prepared by Irish Water is subject to the approval of the CER. <br\/><br\/>Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied complies with the chemical and microbiological parameters set out in the Regulations. The maximum allowable value for lead is 10 microgrammes per litre, which came into effect at the end of 2013. At this concentration, there is a risk of exceeding the limits wherever there is lead piping and in particular where the water has been sitting in the pipe overnight. Irish Water has informed my Department that of its estimated 58,000 kilometres of distribution system, there is a very small proportion of lead piping, consisting of approximately 190 short lengths across 14 local authorities. Irish Water is working on the replacement of these pipes as quickly as possible. <br\/><br\/>However, there are a significant number of lead public service pipes between the water mains and the customer stopcock or water meter. Irish Water is identifying the location of such lead service connections during the meter installation programme. The numbers currently being identified are about 5% of houses, but this is expected to be higher in town centre areas. Irish Water also estimates that there may be a further 30,000 to 40,000 houses with shared lead backyard service connections. Irish Water has informed my Department that it intends to invest in public lead pipe replacement schemes, primarily communications pipes, with a view to eliminating lead mains, including shared backyard service connections over the next ten years. Irish Water is also reviewing its water treatment processes to ensure that they can mitigate the risk in the short term. Given the age of the housing stock in Waterford c ity and some areas of the c ounty and the presence of back yard services, the percentage of houses with lead plumbing could be higher than the estimated national average. A number of schemes were carried out to replace these pipes in recent years in Waterford City by the City Council and Irish Water will continue this programme.<br\/><br\/>The Water Services Act 2007 provides that the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the internal water distribution system and shall ensure that it is kept in good order and repair, so as to prevent a risk to human health or the environment and that the water meets prescribed quality standards. Responsibility for replacing lead pipes from the main stopcock to the house and within the house rests with the homeowner. As a precaution, Irish Water recommends persons in premises that have lead piping, to flush the supply at the kitchen tap first thing in the morning, before using for drinking. <br\/><br\/>The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 requires the CER to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers of Irish Water. This is similar to the CER&rsquo;s statutory role in respect of the gas and electricity sectors.

Developments in the broadband market over recent years means that there is now a choice of commercial operators offering broadband services over a diverse range of technology platforms throughout much of rural Ireland, including the area previously covered by the National Broadband Scheme. Details of commercial services available in each county can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual operators.<\/p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS). Following a competitive tendering process, my Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS. The Scheme offered a basic and affordable broadband service to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated rural areas where the extent of broadband coverage by commercial operators, at the time the Scheme was launched in 2008, was deemed to be inadequate. EU State Aid approval was granted for a scheme of limited duration and, following a 68 month operational period, the Scheme expired on 25th August 2014.<\/p><p>  &ldquo;3&rdquo; have confirmed that, following the expiry of the Scheme, they will continue to provide coverage throughout NBS areas on a commercial basis offering consumers the same choice of Broadband plans and tariffs as those offered to consumers outside of the NBS areas. Furthermore, they have also informed my Department of their plans to extend 4G coverage across all of the NBS Coverage Areas within the next 3 years. Digiweb, who provided the NBS satellite service on behalf of Three, will continue to offer satellite broadband on a commercial basis. I can therefore assure the Deputy that there is no discontinuation of services in former NBS areas. <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s Statement of Priorities for the period 2014 to 2016 reaffirms our commitment to delivering a State-led broadband intervention in rural areas.
