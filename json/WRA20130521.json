The long term profitability of the State supported banks depends on many variables, the impact of trackers is only one of those.  There has been improvement in many other variables that impact on profitability of the State supported banks.  I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention in particular, to cost reductions, improved funding costs, reduced ELG costs as a result of the ending of the ELG scheme, expected reductions in impairments and Net Interest Margin improvements all of which should have positive impacts on profitability.     <\/p><p>  Obviously unprofitable tracker mortgages represent a drag on the profitability of the State supported institutions and my officials continue to discuss possible solutions with those institutions and market participants.  The Deputy will recognise that there would be a cost associated with the removal of unprofitable tracker mortgages from the balance sheets of the State supported institutions and this cost would have to be borne by some entity. <\/p><p>  The Deputy should be aware however that the State supported banks&rsquo; tracker mortgages are not a homogenous group of mortgages and the terms on which they were written can and do vary.  In particular, while a significant number of tracker mortgages, especially those written during the later stages of the boom had low contractual margins over base rates, it is not the case that all tracker mortgages are unprofitable.  The profitability or otherwise of a tracker mortgage is a function of a number of variables including the base rate, the margin the borrower is contracted to pay over the base rate and the funding cost to the institution of that mortgage. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware the State supported banks provide a considerable level of disclosure on their financial performance in their annual reports and other financial statements.  Copies of these reports can be found on the websites of each of the State supported institutions.  These institutions provide detailed information on their mortgage portfolios.  The impact of tracker mortgages, as a group, on the financial performance of each State supported institution is not explicitly shown however. <\/p><p>  As no decision to transfer the tracker mortgage portfolios of the State supported institutions to any other entity has been taken, I cannot outline the impact that such a transfer would have on the long term profitability of the State supported banks. \t<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100056#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Bank of Ireland Issues","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100057#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[23929\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100057#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on departures of senior personnel from the regulatory to take up roles in the financial services sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[23959\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100057#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a practice at the Central Bank of Ireland where retiring directors are re-hired on contracts for a number of days a week for a year as a means of increasing their pensions.","asker":"969","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 63 together. <\/p><p>  It is to be expected that staff will move between the Central Bank and the financial sector in both directions.

This process needs to be managed in a way that ensures the independence and integrity of the Central Bank is preserved and seen to be preserved.  To address this, a Human Resources Strategy has been developed by the Central Bank, which includes as key elements talent management and succession planning.  I have been informed by the Central Bank that it has appropriate policies and procedures in place to deal with departures of senior personnel to take up roles in the financial services sector.   Specifically, this potential issue is taken into account when drafting new contracts for certain roles or reassigning staff to other duties if a potential for conflict arises.  <\/p><p>  The Central Bank Code of Ethics requires that in the event of an employee intending to leave the employment of the Central Bank to take up alternative employment, self-employment or business, they are obliged to provide early notification to line management when a conflict of interest exists, or might be perceived to exist, between those duties held in the Central Bank and those to be undertaken with the new employer, in self-employment or in business.

This also applies to any assumption of potential asset price appreciation, as well as the estimated costs related to a potential foreclosure of property; and<\/p><p>- Lenders need to use an appropriate interest rate when discounting future income flows, which should take account of the lender's cost of funds. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Central Bank will assess compliance with these principles in its supervisory audit of compliance with the targets, including through analysis of a sample of modifications.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Central Bank has now written to each of the 6 specified institutions to set out the reporting timelines required with regard to the public and non-public targets of each institution and the target levels.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is fair to say that progress is underway and the Deputy may wish to note that in the Central Bank's Q4 2012 mortgage arrears statistics, the Central Bank has indicated that overall there were around 23,430 mortgage accounts that had permanent restructure types at the end December 2012.  In addition, the two pillar banks have indicated that each bank will assess at a minimum 1,500 cases each month to determine whether the mortgage is sustainable and identify the most appropriate forbearance treatment.<\/p><p><br \/>  Separately from this Central Bank action, the new personal insolvency system, in particular the new resolution frameworks provided for in the Personal Insolvency Act, will be shortly be available to borrowers who are in significant difficulty in their mortgage repayments.  Utilising this process, the borrower will be in a position to consult an independent personal insolvency practitioner and where necessary to make a formal and realistic personal insolvency arrangement proposal to all eligible creditors, including a mortgage lender.  In such a situation the creditors will be obliged to formally consider and vote on the arrangement as proposed by the debtor.  I would also remind the Deputies that, under the mortgage advisory service developed by the Department of Social Protection, independent financial advice is available to borrowers who have been offered a long term forbearance option by the lender, and a panel of around 2,000 qualified accountants is now in place to provide this service.   <\/p><p><br \/>  Taken together, the framework is in place to enable banks to work with distressed homeowners to reach sustainable solutions for dealing with their personal indebted situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100057#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":20,"content":"<p>Question No. 63 answered with Question No. 61.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":21,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100057#WRB00850"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[23660\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100057#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide details of the proposed bank resolution scheme which is being considered by ECOFIN under his chairmanship; if he will confirm the order in which it is proposed that bank creditors absorb losses under the proposed arrangement; if he is proposing a lower limit to the amount of deposits which can be affected in such a scenario; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[23924\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100057#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will ensure deposits are protected in any revised Eurozone bank resolution mechanism; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":24,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 75 together.  <\/p><p>  The Bank Recovery and Resolution (&ldquo;BRRD&rdquo;) proposal aims to introduce an effective recovery and resolution framework for credit institutions and investment firms at national level to ensure minimum harmonisation at EU level.  The proposed directive provides for three stages of crisis prevention and management: a preventative stage, an early intervention stage and a resolution stage.  Part of the resolution stage provides for a bail-in tool which is a mechanism for allocating losses to shareholders and creditors of the institution under resolution in accordance with an established bail-in hierarchy.<\/p><p>  The BRRD proposal, as published by the Commission, provides that under bail-in losses would in the first instance be allocated to shareholders.  Once shareholders claims have been exhausted subordinated creditors would then be written down.  Only when these claims have been exhausted could senior creditors be written down. <\/p><p>  The hierarchy of claims for bail-in in the BRRD proposal that was published by the Commission last year does not differentiate between different classes of senior creditors such as depositors with deposits over &euro;100,000 (uninsured depositors) and senior bondholders.  This matter is the subject of on-going debate in the Council negotiations on the BRRD file.<\/p><p>  At ECOFIN earlier this month I asked finance ministers to consider the scope and design of the bail-in tool in the BRRD directive.  Among other things, these discussions focused on how bail-in would apply to uninsured depositors (i.e. deposits greater than &euro;100,000).  I proposed that these depositors should be given a higher ranking in the hierarchy of claims than other senior debt.  In effect they would only ever bear losses after other senior creditors such as bondholders. <\/p><p>  I am glad to report that the discussion provided the Presidency with sufficient clarity on the position of Member States to enable us to press ahead with our efforts to achieve agreement on this file.  On the question of how deposits are affected I noted convergence on a number of points:<\/p><p>  - agreement among Member States that deposits under &euro;100,000 must be fully guaranteed;<\/p><p>  - considerable support for depositor preference for uninsured deposits i.e. they would be the last category to be bailed-in.<\/p><p>  The Deputies will be aware that the Government fully adheres to the EU policy of guaranteeing deposits of &euro;100,000 per customer, per bank.<\/p><p>  The objective of the Irish Presidency in placing this item on the May ECOFIN agenda was to try to achieve a common understanding on this issue which would help to unlock discussion on other areas of the BRRD notably the financing element.  <\/p><p>  I am proposing to bring the BRRD dossier back to the ECOFIN on 21st June with a view to reaching a Council agreement on the overall BRRD proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100057#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Promissory Note Negotiations","counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100057#WRB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":26,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[19949\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100057#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the outcome of his recent negotiations at European leader level in relation to the promissory notes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":27,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, on 6\/7 February the liquidation of IBRC was agreed in the Houses of the Oireachtas and the IBRC Promissory Notes were replaced with longer-dated Irish Government Bonds.

The Central Bank established a Steering Committee which prepared and submitted the National Payments Plan to me.

The National Payments Plan outlines that if Ireland were to match best practice in Europe, savings of up to &euro;1 billion per annum could be made to the economy.  This would result in better value for the customer, lower back-office administration cost for Government, lower administration cost for business and lower operating costs for financial institutions. <\/p><p><br \/>  On the specific query that the Deputy has raised, the National Payments Plan has made a recommendation surrounding the use of one and two cent coins in Ireland.  There is evidence that one and two cent coins are not actively used by consumers.  It is expensive to continually mint and re-issue new coins.  The National Payments Plan does not envisage that one and two cent coins would be abandoned; they would remain legal tender. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Steering Committee intends to trial the use of a rounding convention in a pilot project in a mid-size Irish town.  The rounding convention is entirely voluntary on the part of both consumers and retailers.

The pilot is expected to run in August\/September of 2013 and to finish by November 2013.

One of these building blocks is an integrated financial framework or banking union which comprises three elements (a) an integrated system for the supervision of cross-border banks in the form of the single supervisor mechanism (&lsquo;SSM&rsquo;), (b) a recasting of the deposit insurance scheme directive (&lsquo;DGS&rsquo;) to further harmonise national DGSs, and (c) a European harmonised Bank Recovery &amp;amp; Resolution scheme commonly referred to as the BRRD.    Significantly the statement of the Euro area Summit clearly stated that when a single supervisory mechanism was in place for banks in the euro area the ESM could, following a regular decision, have the possibility to recapitalise banks directly. Furthermore to complete the Banking Union initiative the European Commission will this summer bring forward proposals for a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) to coordinate the application of resolution tools to banks. The European Council of December 2012 noted the Commission&rsquo;s intention to submit a proposal for an SRM for Member States participating in the SSM to be examined as a matter of urgency during the current parliamentary cycle of the EP i.e.,  before May 2014.<\/p><p>  The stated position of the Ecofin is that the building blocks for Banking Union should be put in place as soon as possible. This is a sensible approach and our work as Presidency is helping to advance Banking Union in as speedy a manner as possible. As we move into the final weeks of our Presidency we will continue to afford top priority to the legislative files relating to Banking Union in line with the conclusions of the European Council which set out a time frame and series of steps for achieving this.<\/p><p>  The Irish Presidency is giving absolute priority to all the files relating to the promotion of Banking Union in line with the ambitious agenda for Banking Union. We have achieved agreement on the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) - a very significant step forward towards ensuring financial stability and thus facilitating growth. <\/p><p>  We have also achieved agreement on the Capital Requirements Directive IV, which aims to strengthen the capital requirements for banks and the overall effectiveness of regulation for the sector and enhance financial stability.  <\/p><p>  We have made good progress towards agreement on the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive as the essential next step, with a view to agreement by June of this year, as envisaged by the European Council.

Revenue's overall approach to managing compliance is to undertake a range of targeted interventions that are most appropriate for dealing with the specific risks presented in individual cases. In 2012, Revenue carried out more than 537,000 compliance interventions, which yielded more than &euro;492 million.   I am advised also that Revenue continues to develop innovative ways of identifying non-compliance and bringing to account those who fail to comply with their tax obligations, including those who seek to evade their responsibilities through the use of offshore accounts and structures. They are assisted in this work by robust legislation to support compliance activities, including, for example, the recent obligation that has been placed on merchant acquirers and other payment settlement entities to make returns of transactions, principally credit card transactions, to Revenue. Their work is also supported and enhanced with appropriate technology, including their Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling (REAP) risk identification system and capture of data from multiple sources.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland has been to the forefront in acting against the use of offshore accounts for the purposes of evading tax. Revenue set up a dedicated unit, tasked with identifying and investigating Irish residents engaged in this form of tax evasion, in 2001. Further investigations targeting the settlement of funds and assets on trusts and similar offshore structures were initiated in 2009. Schemes of voluntary disclosure and investigations undertaken have, to date, resulted in collection of &euro;1.1 billion in tax liabilities, statutory interest payments and penalties, of which almost &euro;19 million was collected in 2012.  These investigations are ongoing and most recently have<font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> led to the uncovering of two types of cash extraction schemes with total tax at risk of &euro;198.5 million. <\/font>  Recent developments have also included analysing details of payments made in Ireland using foreign credit cards. Revenue will continue to act in a very determined way to deal with tax evasion in all its forms.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland is also committed to working closely with other countries to combat offshore tax evasion. 69 bilateral Double Taxation Agreements and 21 Tax Information Exchange Agreements are in place which ensure a system of full exchange of tax information. In addition, in December 2012, Ireland became one of the first countries in the world to sign an <i>Agreement with the United States of America to Improve International Tax Compliance<\/i><i>and to Implement FATCA<\/i>   (that is, the United States Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act).  This type of agreement is now being hailed as the emerging international standard for the automatic exchange of tax information. Revenue also participates in the OECD Forum for Tax Administration's Offshore Compliance Network, which is a forum for the countries concerned to share information and experiences on practical issues relating to the fight against offshore evasion.<\/p><p><br \/>  Combating tax fraud and evasion has also been a priority during our Presidency of the EU and work has been taken forward in a number of key areas. Following a very productive discussion on the issue at the informal ECOFIN meeting in April, Commissioner Semeta and I issued a joint letter to ECOFIN Ministers inviting them to agree a range of measures to tackle tax fraud and evasion. Significant progress was made in this regard at the ECOFIN meeting on 14 May, at which agreement was reached on a mandate for negotiating amendments to the Savings Tax Agreements with Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra and San Marino to ensure equivalence of measures with the EU. Also at the ECOFIN meeting on 14 May, Ministers adopted Council Conclusions strongly welcoming the European Commission's Action Plan on tackling tax fraud, evasion and aggressive tax planning, and reaffirming their commitment to collective action in this area working in close cooperation with the OECD and the G20. The issue of tax fraud and evasion is an important agenda item at the European Council meeting on 22 May and it is intended to return to the matter at the ECOFIN meeting in June.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, I am advised by Revenue that they have published detailed guidance in relation to employer withholding tax obligations for international employees working in the State which  clarifies a number of anti-avoidance measures introduced in the Finance Act 2006 to combat non-compliance with employer statutory requirements.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100058#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insolvency Service of Ireland Issues","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100058#WRC01150"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[23918\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100058#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the implications for the Central Bank of Ireland's pilot scheme debt resolution scheme of indications from credit unions that they will not participate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"976","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>The Central Bank has commenced a process to facilitate a voluntary agreement outlining a co-ordinated approach among lenders to the resolution of multiple debts owed by distressed borrowers.   An unsustainable debt position has been reached by many borrowers, which needs to be addressed for the benefit of both borrowers and lenders alike.  I have been informed by the Central Bank that this initiative is being implemented to establish, on a test basis, an approach to deal with both secured and unsecured debt in a sample of approximately 750 cases where borrowers have debts with multiple lenders. The Central Bank envisage that the participants in the pilot framework will be the main retail lending banks and the credit unions that have agreed to participate, as well as certain other unsecured lenders. This pilot framework contains a restructuring waterfall that will be applied to each borrower that agrees to participate, in order to establish the most appropriate modification to put him or her on an affordable repayment path. The pilot framework is expected to commence in June and will operate for a period of three months, after which the results will be assessed to establish the effectiveness of the framework and to determine the appropriate next steps.    <\/p><p>  The Central Bank are actively encouraging the involvement of all lenders in the process to ensure maximum effectiveness of this learning and information gathering pilot stage, and are encouraged to have a number of lenders engaged to date. The Central Bank have written to all credit unions individually to invite them to participate in the pilot framework and are confident that the pilot framework will offer outcomes which support borrowers and will allow the Central Bank to test and learn from this approach.<\/p><p>  It must be borne in mind that a key issue in a decision to opt out by some lenders is that borrowers from these institutions cannot be part of the pilot framework to restructure their debt. For example, if a distressed borrower has multiple debts and one of their lenders is not involved in the pilot scheme then they cannot be part of the pilot scheme and cannot avail of the benefits.  <\/p><p>  I am aware of the concerns expressed by the Irish League of Credit Unions regarding the Central Bank initiative and its view that the arrangements under the Personal Insolvency Act should be applied to the resolution of multiple debts owed by distressed borrowers, including credit union members.  While that regime is indeed available, the Central Bank pilot scheme will offer the opportunity for distressed borrowers - including credit union members - to resolve their debts without the need to enter into the formal statutory process.  In this respect, it is important that credit union members are not left with a more limited range of options than are available to customers of other financial institutions.  It is in this spirit that the Central Bank has written to all credit unions to make them aware of the pilot so that the credit unions can decide whether their participation is in the interests of their members, including members with distressed debts across multiple lenders.  <\/p><p>  Credit unions have been invited by the Central Bank to nationwide information seminars on the pilot scheme to discuss its objectives and approach.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has been invited to attend at these sessions and provide input into the content of them.  Notwithstanding their official stance on the pilot programme, the Irish League of Credit Unions has played a constructive role in working with the Central Bank and other lenders to address this difficult issue and credit unions continue to have an important role to play in supporting distressed borrowers in resolving their problems. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100058#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":51,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[23920\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100058#WRC01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether the proliferation of recent announcements on debt resolution is causing confusion amongst borrowers and may actually impede; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[23956\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100058#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s pilot scheme for consumer multi-debt restructuring launched on 8 May 2013.","asker":"981","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":53,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[24130\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100058#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the consultation that took place with his Department by the Central Bank of Ireland before the launch of the pilot scheme for consumer multi-debt restructuring on 8 May 2013.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[24108\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100058#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the consultation that took place between his Department and the Central Bank of Ireland before the launch of the pilot scheme for consumer multi-debt restructuring on 8 May 2013.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[24109\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100058#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there is a legislative basis by which unsecured creditors can be forced to accept write-downs in outstanding debt under the Central Bank of Ireland pilot scheme for consumer multi-debt restructuring.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[24110\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100058#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the names of creditor companies that have signed up to the Central Bank of Ireland pilot scheme for consumer multi-debt restructuring; and if he will outline the impact the reported rejection of the scheme by the Irish League of Credit Unions will have on the scheme.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73, 93, 142 and 203 to 205, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  The Deputies will be aware that the Central Bank has commenced a process to facilitate a voluntary agreement outlining a co-ordinated approach among lenders to the resolution of multiple debts owed by distressed borrowers.

The Central Bank has advised that this framework can help those borrowers because the lenders are agreeing to a coordinated approach for resolution of all of the borrowers&rsquo; debts.   In addition, many distressed borrowers are not insolvent and therefore will not be eligible for an arrangement under the personal insolvency regime, but do need to have an appropriate solution in place to deal with their debts.  This framework aims to test the feasibility and costs of implementing such solutions for borrowers.  The framework also has the potential to reduce the costs and time it will take lenders operating on an individual basis to deal with distressed borrowers, while also potentially resulting in only the more challenged cases proceeding to the new established personal insolvency regime. The Central Bank has also advised that there is no legislative basis by which unsecured creditors can be forced to accept write-downs in outstanding debt under the Central Bank&rsquo;s voluntary framework.

In particular, the Government, while significantly modernising Ireland&rsquo;s bankruptcy and insolvency law and procedures, has also advocated and encouraged borrowers and lenders to address situations of debt difficulty, where possible, on a bilateral and informal basis, and the recent Central Bank initiatives should underpin that process.<\/p><p>  Recent announcements by Government such as the launch of the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) are important steps in the overall framework to deal with mortgage arrears.

I am informed by Revenue that LPT is a self-assessed tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  The Commissioners have also comprehensively explained the purpose of the Revenue Estimate and advised property owners that the Revenue Estimate may be used as the self-assessed valuation band, only where the property owner is satisfied that it fairly reflects their own valuation for their property.  For the purposes of LPT, values for properties under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands, with a range of &euro;50,000 in each band.  As property owners will not be required to provide a precise value for their property, it is anticipated that for the most part overpayments of LPT should not happen.  <\/p><p>  The initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013, assuming it is made in good faith, is valid up to and including 2016 and will not be affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or other changes, during this period.  This will ensure a measure of certainty for all property owners.  Accordingly, where an owner assesses that the value of a residential property on 1 May 2013 places it in a particular valuation band but, due to a general decrease in property prices after that date the reduction in the value of the property would place it in a lower valuation band, the owner will not be entitled to a refund of tax.  By the same token, if the property increases in value in that period, no additional charges will apply. The owner will, however, have the opportunity to re-assess the value of the property on the next valuation date, which is 1 November 2016. <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, I am advised by Revenue that Section 26 of the 2012 Act (as amended) provides for the possibility of a refund where an overpayment of LPT was made due to an error or mistake on a Return or a statement made by the liable person, subject to certain conditions being satisfied.  This might arise, for example, where a liable person had paid their LPT charge but they subsequently discovered that their property was exempt from the charge.  In the context of Section 26 where an error or mistake is proven, I am advised that once a true and complete Return has been prepared and delivered to Revenue and all the information required to make a determination on the case has been provided, a refund may issue where a claim for repayment is submitted within the normal four year time limit. <\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they will issue detailed guidelines later in the year setting out the procedures to be followed by those who consider that they have either over or under valued their property for LPT purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100058#WRC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":62,"content":"<p>Question No. 75 answered with Question No. 64.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Application","counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100058#WRC02450"},{"type":"question","counter":64,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[23927\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100058#WRC02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his view on the rate of registration to date for the local property tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":65,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Local Property Tax (LPT) Returns, personalised letters and an LPT Guide have issued to owners of 1.66 million residential properties either by post or by way of their ROS (Revenue On-line Service) inbox.

The 9th review of Ireland&rsquo;s programme has now completed all approval stages by both the IMF and the EU.    The principal benefits of the maturities extension will be the smoothing of our debt redemption profile, the consequent improvement in our ability to fund ourselves in the financial markets and the beneficial impact on our debt sustainability.

The Financial Inclusion Working Group (FIWG), which includes An Post was tasked with governance of the project.  The Standard Bank Account (SBA) Pilot finished on 31 March 2013 after a 9-month pilot period.    <\/p><p>  A total of 205 accounts were opened during the Pilot, which was below expectations. The initial Pilot evaluation suggests that the lower than expected take-up of the SBA was due the lack of a &lsquo;trigger event&rsquo; amongst the target cohort in the pilot locations, such as a requirement to have an income or benefit payment made to a bank account.<\/p><p>  The Strategy for Financial Inclusion in Ireland noted that the post office network has the potential to play a key role in the delivery of basic payment accounts.  It is a generally accepted view that many of the financially excluded trust the post office network.  It is also clear that many of the financially excluded make use of An Post&rsquo;s services already and that many of them use An Post branches for the receipt of social welfare payments and benefits. When the Pilot commenced An Post could not on its own offer transactional banking services to its customers as it required arrangements with banking providers to do so.

It can include Money Market Funds or other &ldquo;deposit taking&rdquo; investment products, Special Purpose Vehicles which perform liquidity or maturity transformation, Exchange Traded Funds and other funds which provide credit, firms which provide credit guarantees, insurance\/reinsurance firms which issue or insure credit.  Shadow banking typically has the following characteristics maturity or liquidity transformation across the balance sheet, where the sources of funding are of shorter maturity or the assets are inherently illiquid; credit creation funded by leverage, which boosts certain measures of the money supply.<\/p><p>  Shadow Banking, if well regulated, can perform important functions in the financial system and parts of the Shadow Banking system can contribute positively to the flow of credit and liquidity and help to promote economic growth.

The Commission will in summer 2013, as a follow up to their Green Paper of March 2012, and the international work coordinated by the Financial Stability Board, address the systemic problems related to shadow banking.

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change.  It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.  Neither have I responsibility for the interest rate paid to depositors by the financial instructions.<\/p><p>The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations.  The Central Bank has, however,  no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997. <\/p><p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors, including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution&rsquo;s overall funding arrangements. <\/p><p>  I would remind the Deputy that in late 2011 the Taoiseach asked for the Central Bank&rsquo;s opinion on developments regarding mortgage interest rates and on possible action by the Central Bank in that regard.  In a letter to the Taoiseach dated 11 November 2011, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank stated that the Central Bank would not be seeking the power to have regulatory control over the setting of retail interest rates. He indicated that experience of such controls in the past, and in other countries, did not encourage the Central Bank to believe that such a regime would be advantageous in net terms as the banking system recovers its normal functioning. Binding controls tend to reduce the availability of credit and channel it to the most creditworthy customers, starving smaller and less secure customers from credit. Binding controls would have a chilling effect on the entry of sound competitors in the market. By absolving banks from their responsibility to price risk accurately, binding interest rate controls would, especially during the recovery phase, impede progress towards the re-establishment of bank management practices that can ensure a healthy and free-standing banking system no longer dependent on the Government for bail-outs. The Deputy Governor mentioned also that, within its existing powers, and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise. <\/p><p>  On specific economic assessments of changes to interest rates, I would refer the Deputy to the recent Stability Programme Update 2013 which published analysis done by the ERSI using their HERMES model of the effect of a 1% change in interest rates on key macroeconomic variables on the economy.  The simulations show the impact that a 1 percentage point increase in the rate in the first year for the following four years beginning in 2013 could reduce GDP by up to 1.7 per cent by 2016 and would add 1 percentage point to the deficit as a percentage of GDP by 2016. While the simulated effect is broadly symmetric, the proximity of policy rates to the zero lower bound means the potential magnitude of the effect could be larger for a rate increase compared to a rate decrease.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100059#WRD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Collection","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100059#WRD02050"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[23964\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100059#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of returns as a percentage of liable households that have been received to date by the Revenue Commissioners for the local property tax; the value of the outstanding liable payments; and the expected outturn if there was 100% compliance.","asker":"1083","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Local Property Tax (LPT) Returns, personalised letters and an LPT Guide have issued to owners of 1.66 million residential properties either by post or by way of their ROS (Revenue Online Service) inbox.

This represents a very substantial contribution by NAMA in the context of the limited number of available residential properties in Ireland controlled by its debtors and receivers and the range of policy measures being adopted by this Government to meet demand for social housing provision.  The onus for determining the suitability for social housing of the properties identified by NAMA rests, in the first instance, with the local authorities, which assess, in conjunction with the Housing Agency, the demand for identified houses and apartments by reference to a number of criteria.  As soon as local authorities have confirmed demand for units, the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) are asked to confirm their interest and to take the practical steps necessary to complete the lease or purchase of the properties.<\/p><p>  I am advised that to date demand has been confirmed by the local authorities for 1,574 of the properties that NAMA has made available. Another 502 properties are being evaluated bringing the overall total that may ultimately be deemed suitable to 2,076.  The local authorities have confirmed that there is no demand in respect 1,226 of the properties.  I am advised by NAMA that, in the time required to assess and confirm demand for units, 806 properties were sold or privately let by their owners or duly appointed receivers. <\/p><p>  Of the properties for which demand has been confirmed, 294 properties have been delivered for social housing to date, with contract terms signed in respect of a further 73 properties. This brings the overall total of residential properties completed and committed to social housing to 367 properties, across 19 developments in ten counties.  A further 334 are at an advanced stage of negotiation between NAMA debtors or receivers and various AHBs. <\/p><p>  I am advised by NAMA that once demand has been confirmed for properties and contracts signed there is no impediment to the early delivery of properties by its debtors and receivers. However, issues such Multi-Unit Development compliance, planning compliance, site resolution and outstanding completion works often need to be addressed before the properties are ready for occupation.  NAMA, through its debtors and receivers, is working to resolve these issues as a matter of priority on the identified developments. <\/p><p>  I am further advised by NAMA that it established the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), National Asset Residential Property Services Limited, for the purpose of acquiring properties from its debtors and receivers in order to speed up their direct leasing to housing authorities.  I understand that the Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH) has recently agreed to the lease template put forward some time ago by NAMA and I expect that this will expedite the early delivery of properties.<\/p><p>  NAMA is working closely with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State for Housing and Planning in relation to this very important initiative and all parties are committed to the maximum possible delivery of residential units in 2013.  The Deputy will appreciate that the housing authorities have a key role in this regard and the Housing Agency is working very closely with these bodies to facilitate delivery of units.  However, the pace at which units are delivered is not controlled by NAMA but by the Housing Agency\/Social Housing Bodies\/Local Authorities agreeing to lease.  I am satisfied that NAMA has brought the initiative as far as it can at this point in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100059#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Application","counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100059#WRD02525"},{"type":"question","counter":128,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[23944\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100059#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views the need for a review of the SARP.","asker":"1066","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":129,"content":"<p>Section 14 of Finance Act 2012 introduced the Special Assignee Relief Programme which is designed to reduce the cost to employers of assigning key individuals in their companies from abroad to take up positions in the Irish based operations of their employer.  Paragraph 10 of Section 14 provides that relevant employers must submit an annual return to the Revenue Commissioners detailing, inter alia, the number of employees and the amounts of exempt income claimed under the programme. As 2012 was the first year of the programme, this return was not sought until after the end of the tax year 2012 in order to ensure that an accurate picture as possible of take up levels over a full tax year could be provided. <\/p><p>  At the time of its introduction, it was estimated that for every 100 assignees that avail of the programme up to the maximum level of relief, the tax cost would be just over &euro;5 million. Employer returns received to date for 2012 indicate that there were 6 individuals who qualified for the relief with 2 of them receiving an aggregate total tax-free remuneration of &euro;39,767. Job increases were reported as numbering 26 with 2 jobs also reported as retained because of the relief. It is expected that the 4 individuals who are not reported in the employer returns as receiving tax-free remuneration are expected to claim it when they submit Form 11 tax returns for 2012 in late 2013.<\/p><p>  It is possible that not all employers have submitted a SARP return yet.

All of this information will feed into the review. Depending on the outcome of that review, I will decide whether the relief should be retained.<\/p><p>  It is worth nothing that the existence of similar incentives in other European countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland would indicate that such incentives can be a persuading factor when companies decide where to locate investment projects.

Reputation, reliability and commitment were essential elements to regaining our financial independence and that reneging on senior debt would not enhance the Irish position and may put contagion pressures on Eurozone countries.  <\/p><p>2.  If we were to postpone or suspend payment to creditors in IBRC this would have a significant impact on both the Bank and ultimately the State in that it could lead to the Bank becoming insolvent with an increase in the cost to the state to resolve IBRC and the financial market&rsquo;s view of Ireland as a place to do business or invest would be seriously undermined.  <\/p><p>3.

I am advised that Revenue made a total of 5,580 seizures of such goods, with a value of &euro;5,437,334, during 2012.  In the first quarter of 2013 there were 1,540 seizures with a value of &euro;819,684.

I am advised that Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely together, and share intelligence on an ongoing basis, in tackling the overall problem of counterfeit goods. There is close cooperation also at international level, including, for example, participation by Ireland in international operations coordinated by the World Customs Organisation. <\/p><p>  The active cooperation of intellectual property rights holders is also essential in dealing with this problem, and they can provide valuable assistance to the work of the enforcement authorities through practical steps such as responding quickly to requests for confirmation of the status of suspected counterfeit goods. <\/p><p>  The penalties for illegal importation of counterfeit goods are set down in section 186 of the Customs Consolidation Act 1876. On summary conviction, a fine of &euro;5,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both, can be imposed. On conviction on indictment, a fine of &euro;126,790 or, in the case of goods with a value exceeding &euro;250,000, a fine of three times the value of the goods (including duty and tax), or a term of imprisonment up to 5 years, or both a fine and imprisonment, may be imposed. There are no proposals at present to increase these penalties, but the position will be kept under review. <\/p><p>  I recognise the value of raising the awareness of consumers of the negative impact of the trade in counterfeit goods, and the potential safety risks involved, and believe that the holders of intellectual property rights have a key role to play in conveying this message to consumers.

The following issues were discussed.<\/p><p><b>  Banking Recovery and Resolution <\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Council discussed a proposal for a directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms, focusing in particular on the design of the bail-in instrument.<\/p><p><b>  Draft Amending Budget No. 2 to the General Budget 2013<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Council reached a political agreement on draft amending budget no. 2 for 2013, on the basis of a proposal from the Irish Presidency. Draft amending budget no. 2 for 2013 is about meeting outstanding payment needs in the 2013 EU budget for which the Commission proposed a total amount of &euro;11.2 billion.  The Council's political agreement is to provide &euro;7.3 billion in a first stage and to focus this amount on measures to support economic growth, create jobs and tackle unemployment, especially among young people, and as a second stage, to take all necessary steps to ensure EU's obligations are met on the basis of further information from the Commission.  The Council also noted that the agreement in the draft amending Budget has been linked to the negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework and as such the Council stated that &quot;nothing is agreed until everything is agreed&quot;.<\/p><p><b>  Savings taxation <\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Council approved a mandate for the Commission to negotiate amendments to the EU's agreements with Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra and San Marino on the taxation of savings income. <\/p><p><br \/>  The aim is to ensure that the five countries continue to apply measures that are equivalent to the EU's directive on the taxation of savings income, which is being amended. The Commission will negotiate on the basis of a draft directive amending the savings directive (2003\/48\/EC), aimed at improving its effectiveness and closing certain loopholes so as to prevent its circumvention.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Council also discussed a draft directive aimed at strengthening the EU's directive on the taxation of savings income (2003\/48\/EC). It agreed to revert to the matter at a forthcoming meeting, in the light of comments made by Ministers.<\/p><p><b>  Tax Evasion and Fraud <\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Council then adopted Council Conclusions on Tax Evasion and Fraud which reaffirm that all Member States recognise the importance of taking effective steps to fight tax evasion and tax fraud, and recognises the need to tackle aggressive tax planning.<\/p><p><b>  Macroeconomic Imbalances<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Council considered the Commission's publication last month of its in-depth reviews of macroeconomic imbalances in 13 Member States and adopted Council conclusions on the issue. <\/p><p><b>  Towards a deep and genuine Economic and Monetary Union<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Council took note of the presentation by the Commission of two communications on the further development of the EU's economic and monetary union (EMU) and held a brief exchange of views.  The communications relate to the introduction of a &quot;convergence and competitiveness instrument&quot; and <i>ex-ante <\/i> coordination of national economic policy reforms.  They follow up on work carried out by the European Council, which last December called on its President to present in June 2013, after consultations with the member states, possible measures and a timetable for the further development of EMU.<\/p><p><b>  Follow-up to International Finance meetings<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Council took note of the outcome of International Finance Ministers' meetings held in Washington D.C. on 18-21 April, namely:<\/p><p>- G20 Finance Ministers' and Central Bank Governors' meeting;<\/p><p>- Annual spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank.<\/p><p><br \/>  Discussions in Washington covered the global economic situation; the G20 framework for growth; reform of the international financial architecture; financial regulation; financing for investment; and energy, commodities and climate finance.<\/p><p>Over breakfast on the morning of the 14 May, the President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy made a presentation on tax evasion and fraud and this was followed by an exchange of views. Ministers were then debriefed on the outcome of the <i>Eurogroup<\/i> the day before and discussed the <i>economic situation<\/i>, on the basis of a presentation given by Vice President Olli Rehn on the Commission's Spring European Economic Forecasts. <\/p><p><br \/>  It is evident from the above list that the Council completed a very full programme of work at this meeting. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100060#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Budget","counter":182,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100060#WRE01325"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[23916\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100060#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the implications for Ireland of the outcome of EU budget talks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":184,"content":"<p>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the political agreement on Draft Amending Budget Number 2 to EU Budget 2013 reached at the ECOFIN Council on Tuesday 14 May 2013.

With that in mind, I am unsure as to the premise of the Deputy's question.  Companies operating in Ireland are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities here.  A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits, as well as certain petroleum, mining and land dealing activities, while chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.  I am not aware of companies having issues with complying with these corporate tax rates.<\/p><p><br \/>  Unlike some other countries who have a high headline rate of corporation tax but also have a significant number of reliefs, the approach in Ireland is transparent.  We have a relatively low headline rate of corporation tax which is applied to a broad base and there are only a small number of targeted incentives in Ireland.  Such reliefs include, for example, the R&amp;amp;D tax credit and the 3 year exemption from corporation tax for start-up companies.  These few reliefs are tightly focussed: firstly on the creation of additional employment as is consistent with current Government policy, and secondly on areas of innovation with a view to generating high value-added economic activity in the country.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to the compliance burden arising from taxation more generally, the Deputy may be interested to note that Ireland was ranked 6th in the world and 1st in the EU for ease of paying taxes in a report published in April by PwC, the World Bank and the IFC entitled <i>'Paying Taxes 2013'.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100060#WRE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Shadow Banking Sector","counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100060#WRE01725"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[23979\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100060#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the shadow banking sector here; if he will outline the benefits of this sector to the economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>Shadow banking embraces a disparate range of entities and activities which support investment and capital-raising.  It can include Money Market Funds or other &ldquo;deposit taking&rdquo; investment products, Special Purpose Vehicles which perform liquidity or maturity transformation, Exchange Traded Funds and other funds which provide credit, firms which provide credit guarantees, insurance\/reinsurance firms which issue or insure credit.  Shadow banking typically has the following characteristics: maturity or liquidity transformation across the balance sheet - where the sources of funding are of shorter maturity or the assets are inherently illiquid; credit creation funded by leverage - which boosts certain measures of the money supply.<\/p><p>  Shadow Banking, if well regulated, can perform important functions in the financial system and parts of the Shadow Banking system can contribute positively to the flow of credit and liquidity and help to promote economic growth. <\/p><p>  In general, regulatory proposals on Shadow Banking seek to appropriately reflect a balance between the need for better risk management and enhanced transparency and stronger financial stability, and the need for increased and more diversified financing to the economy.  <\/p><p>  Shadow banking activities make use of various services located in Ireland such as legal advice, tax advice, accountancy advice, asset servicing, subscriptions and redemptions, valuations and listing.

It is the largest implementation of a self-assessment tax system in the history of the State.  As a new service that will have exceptional temporary pressures at particular stages of its initial implementation, it was difficult to predict the level of contact during the introductory phase and consequently, the resources required to handle queries from members of the public.  Revenue considered a number of options for the provision of a phone call service to handle queries from members of the public.  It was necessary to ensure that the introduction of LPT would not adversely affect Revenue&rsquo;s capacity to deliver for the Exchequer in relation to their overall priority of maintaining and improving levels of compliance across the range of taxes and duties.<\/p><p>  Following an open competitive tendering process, the contract was awarded to Abtran.  As part of the contract Abtran must meet Revenue customer service standards as well as industry ISO and PCI standards.  To ensure the standards are met and maintained, both in English and Irish, Revenue provided training and training material and maintains a presence in Abtran on an on-going basis. <\/p><p>  The conditions of the agreement between Abtran and Revenue require the company to specifically:<\/p><p>1.Deliver information and assistance to taxpayers having difficulty understanding Local Property Tax (LPT) and completing their returns and making payments.<\/p><p>2. Assist taxpayers to navigate a new online system for filing returns and payments for LPT. <\/p><p>3. Escalate calls to a Revenue call service where taxpayer specific information is required to resolve the call.<\/p><p>4. Make outbound calls to taxpayers with information on their Property Tax queries where requested by Revenue to do so.<\/p><p>5. Provide telephony infrastructure and supports to allow direct transfer to Revenue <\/p><p>6. Provide support services and resources including account management and quality control <\/p><p>  I am advised that cost of the service to Revenue is dependent on the volume of calls handled and that a total of &euro;67,000 was spent on the service delivery during Q1 2013.  Revenue publishes quarterly lists of payments to suppliers over &euro;20,000 and the continued cost of the call service will be published on that basis.  In regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the cost of calls to the Helpline I am informed that the price is dependent on the individual&rsquo;s phone network as well as the type of &lsquo;phone package&rsquo; that the individual has with his\/her operator. <\/p><p>  In regard to the issue of credit card abuse by an employee of Abtran, I am advised by Revenue that the issue was first brought to its attention late on Thursday night 9 May 2013.  The issue related to people who filed and paid via telephone through the LPT Helpline and who used credit or debit cards as the payment method. In total, the details of 11 credit\/debit cards were improperly obtained by an &lsquo;unauthorised&rsquo; Abtran employee.  The incident did not impact on anybody who filed and paid via computer nor did it affect any of the other available payment options for Local Property Tax (LPT).<\/p><p>  I am assured that Revenue is extremely concerned about the incident and has been in constant contact with the company at a senior level since the incident occurred.  I am informed that the matter is now in the hands of the Garda&iacute; and in the circumstances it would not be appropriate to comment further on that aspect of the matter.  None of the card holders suffered any financial loss.<\/p><p>  In regard to security, Abtran was able to very quickly identify the person responsible for the inappropriate access because it has very sophisticated call management and recording systems available to log all calls.  On concluding its investigation, Abtran assured Revenue that the incident was an isolated matter relating to a single individual. It was not related to any technology or systems breach and was not related to the secure on-line payments system for LPT. <\/p><p>  When Revenue extended the facility to file and pay on-line, via the LPT Helpline, special arrangements were put in place with Abtran in line with best practice, including setting up a filing team who are located in a &lsquo;clean&rsquo; and secure environment with additional monitoring features, who do not have access to mobile phones or any other facility to record personal or payment details.  The person in question was not a member of this team and had no authority to request any payment details from customers.<\/p><p>  Since the incident also constituted a data breach, Revenue reported it to the office of the Data Protection Commissioner on Friday and is receiving advice from that office.<\/p><p>  Revenue would like to reassure people that payment of tax by either credit or debit card is completely secure and that in the unlikely event of any illegal access, the card owner will not suffer any loss. <\/p><p>  Finally, I commend Revenue for its very swift response to the incident.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100060#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Remuneration","counter":194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100060#WRE02125"},{"type":"question","counter":195,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[23954\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100060#WRE02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the responses he has received from banks following the Mercer Report; the proposals each bank has made to reduce its remuneration by 6-10% including a breakdown of their proposals regarding cuts to each of those earning less than &euro;100,000, of those earning between &euro;100,000 and &euro;200,000, of those earning between &euro;200,000 and &euro;300,000 and of those earning more than &euro;300,000.","asker":"984","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":196,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[24093\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100060#WRE02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to the publication of the Mercer report on banking pay and his calling for 6% to 10% reductions in remuneration, when such savings will be delivered.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[24094\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100060#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to the publication of the Mercer report on banking pay and his calling for 6% to 10% reductions in remuneration, if such reductions are to be effected through cutting headcount or individual remuneration.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":198,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[24095\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100060#WRE02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to the publication of the Mercer report on banking pay and his calling for 6% to 10% reductions to indicate the way he will ensure such reductions are delivered and if there will be ongoing monitoring of remuneration on a periodic basis.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":199,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[24096\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100060#WRE02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in respect of the Mercer report which he commissioned in June 2012, which was published on 12 March 2013, and his call to the banks to deliver proposals to him by the end of April 2013 detailing their plans to deliver 6% to 10% savings in remuneration, if he will confirm if he has now received proposals from all relevant banks, and if not, if he will confirm which banks have not delivered proposals.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[24097\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100060#WRE02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to his call to banks to deliver proposals by the end of April 2013 to save 6% to 10% on remuneration if he has now considered those proposals, if he satisfied that the proposals are sufficient to deliver 6% to 10% savings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":201,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117, and 188 to 192, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  I can confirm that the three State supported banks responded with their individual strategies, designed to achieve the required savings, by the due date of 30 April as requested by the Government.

This means that the trader is not required to pay VAT until payment for the supply is actually received.  Availing of this option assists firms in the critical area of cash flow.  In order to avail of the cash receipts basis of accounting for VAT, a business must either a) be supplying goods or services, where 90% of the supplies are to persons who aren&rsquo;t registered for VAT or b) have an annual turnover which is less than &euro;1.25 million.<\/p><p>  As part of a number of measures to assist small to medium enterprises, Budget 2013 increased this turnover threshold from &euro;1 million to &euro;1.25 million with effect from 1 May 2013.

In this regard, I am pleased to report that developments over the last year have been reasonably encouraging.  The Irish economy recorded a second successive year of growth last year and the underlying general government deficit - at 7.6 per cent of GDP - came in well within the ceiling of 8.6 per cent of GDP set by the ECOFIN Council in 2010.  My Department expects an underlying deficit of 7.4 per cent of GDP this year, below the 7.5 per cent ceiling set in 2010. We remain on course to reduce the deficit below 3 per cent of GDP by 2015.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Encouragingly, domestic demand showed tentative signs of stabilisation in the second half of last year, with personal consumption increasing in each of the last two quarters and investment returning to full-year growth for the first time since 2007.  While developments in the labour market have been relatively positive of late - with employment increasing over the last two quarters and the unemployment rate falling by 1 percentage point since February 2012 - a recovery in domestic activity remains a precondition for sustained employment growth. In this regard, it is encouraging to note that my Department is now forecasting domestic demand to return to modest full-year growth this year, and to strengthen gradually over the next few years.  On this basis, employment is expected to return to modest growth in 2013 and to continue expanding thereafter.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, I would like to emphasise that the Government remains committed to tackling the unacceptably high level of unemployment.

These arrangements include mortgage to rent, trade down mortgages, equity participation, interest rate reduction, sale by agreement, and split mortgages.  I have been informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that the majority of lenders have introduced, or are in the process of introducing, a split mortgage arrangement.  A split mortgage warehouses a part of what remains unamortised from the initial capital sum in what can be called \"Part B\" of the loan.  The Part B is not serviced unless the borrower's financial position improves significantly in the future, in which case the split is revised in line with the new circumstances - with the provision that, in order to preserve incentives, only a fraction of the new resources are applied to the loan.  The maximum amount that can be warehoused is dependent on each lender&rsquo;s own internal criteria.  The split mortgage, like all other forbearance and modification arrangements, is based on affordability and sustainability of the arrangement from both the borrower&rsquo;s and the lender&rsquo;s perspective and is one of the key measures being introduced by lenders in assisting their distressed borrowers.  All of the products offered by the banks have been prepared in the context of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategy.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in the context of the performance targets set by the Central Bank for borrowers in arrears over 90 days, lenders will have to satisfy the Central Bank as to the sustainability and affordability of long term solutions offered given that the Central Bank will be conducting a supervisory audit of compliance with the targets including thorough analysis of sample modifications offered by the institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100060#WRE03700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":215,"content":"<p>Question No. 122 answered with Question No. 62.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Application","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100060#WRE03850"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[23662\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100060#WRE03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of dwellings that were issued with local property tax assessment forms; the number of returns that have been received broken down between post and online; and the way he proposes to deal with the back-log.","asker":"1015","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":218,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Local Property Tax (LPT) Returns, personalised letters and an LPT Guide have issued to owners of 1.66 million residential properties either by post or by way of their ROS (Revenue Online Service) inbox.

At present, we work with almost 200 Irish community organisations in over 20 countries and despite the economic situation, I ensured the ESP budget for 2013 - &euro;11.6 million - remained at the same level as in 2012. <\/p><p>  The programme provides extensive funding to organisations that act as first port of call for new emigrants, including the GAA, the London Irish Centre, the Irish Canadian Immigration Centre in Toronto and several similar groups in Australia. We also support a wide range of business and graduate networks around the world.<\/p><p>  Among the Irish based organisations who receive ESP funding is Crosscare Migrant Project which offers pre-departure services to Irish citizens considering emigration.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Central Bank has indicated to me that these c&euro;25bn of loans are 'distressed' loans which relates to loans that are graded as 'Watch'\/ 'Vulnerable' or Impaired based on the banks' internal credit grading system - i.e. not all are impaired. <\/p><p><br \/>  During the first half of 2012, the Central Bank of Ireland commissioned a review by external consultants of the distressed SME operations in BOI and AIB.  This review examined areas such as organisational structure, staffing (skills &amp;amp; resources), work-out strategy and execution ability.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Following the outcome of this review the Central Bank commenced a project in the second half of 2012 to drive the effective and timely resolution of the SME distressed loan portfolios through improved bank management of distressed loans and appropriate workout strategies.    The priority is to ensure that the banks implement longer term resolution strategies on a case-by-case basis.  This also incorporates property debt overhang. <\/p><p><br \/>  A key focus of the project is to ensure that banks adopt a proactive approach to the management of distressed SME loans via appropriate restructuring on a case by case basis and identifying property debt resolution strategies, where required. <\/p><p><br \/>  During the first quarter of 2013, the Central Bank of Ireland formally advised the covered banks of the specific Key Performance Indicators and metrics for the SME Distressed portfolios that they are required to submit on a quarterly basis.  By the end of June 2013, the Central Bank will set quarterly institution-specific performance targets for covered banks to move distressed borrowers onto longer-term solutions.  The targets set will reflect the banks' capacity, processes and systems.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The Government recognises that SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy and will play a vital role in the recovery of employment growth in our country. It also recognises that businesses with legacy debts may be viable. One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government has taken a number of actions, particularly where SMEs have been refused credit, to improve the situation in relation to credit availability to SMEs. <\/p><p><br \/>  At national level, the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee scheme addresses the situation where the SME is outside the risk appetite of the banks. This can arise because the SME's lack of collateral or the banks' lack of understanding of the business model, the market, the sector or the technology. The three main SME lenders are all participating in the Guarantee scheme. In addition, the Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme will provide loans of up to &euro;25k to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, who have commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Government has also been active at national and European level to promote and develop non-bank avenues of credit for the SME sector. Enterprise Ireland has a range of initiatives and programmes available for businesses at various stages of the growth cycle. The NPRF has put a number of funds in place to help meet SME financing needs in Ireland: <\/p><p>Details of the schemes can be found on the websites of the relevant bodies, as well as on the Department of Finance website at <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i>, a document which consolidates the State supports available for SMEs.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, my Department has produced the first in a series of information newsletters dealing with credit and funding issues for the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector.  The newsletter provides information on the various State and private initiatives aimed at increasing the SME sector's awareness of and access to credit and funding, as well as focusing on positive stories from the sector.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government has also led, at European level, efforts to promote and develop non-bank avenues of credit for the SME sector.  In December 2012 the Department of Finance hosted a High-Level Workshop on <i>Non Bank Funding of Growth and Jobs in Europe, <\/i>and the report of this event is now available on the Department's website. Ireland's commitment, during its EU Presidency, is to facilitate and encourage the development of an appropriate set of policy options that will support long term financing of growth and employment in Europe, with the provision of capital to SMEs a key aspect of this.  In this context the Irish Presidency is fully supportive of the Commission's work in this area as highlighted by the publication in March of a Green Paper on Long-Term Financing of the European Economy.  The Irish Presidency ensured that the issue of long-term financing, including non-bank funding, was discussed at the Informal ECOFIN in Europe.  It was agreed at the ECOFIN that the Economic and Financial Committee of the European Council would be asked to progress this issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100062#WRG05100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Initiatives","counter":340,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100062#WRG05200"},{"type":"question","counter":341,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[19133\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100062#WRG05300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the expected impact on job creation in the short to medium term of the proposed &euro;6 billion stimulus package.","asker":"1080","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":342,"content":"<p>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the proposal to establish the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) which will absorb the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF).

A range of reforms have been introduced to underpin a more effective and efficient financial regulatory regime.  The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 gave effect to significant structural changes in the operation of financial regulation in Ireland. The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011, which completed Committee stage in April this year, further strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.

A special Government Sub-Committee is already in place since March last year to address the mortgage arrears problem.  This Committee is chaired by An Taoiseach and includes all other relevant Ministers, and reflects the need for accelerated progress in this area.     At official level, my Department is taking a lead role and in that context, a high level Steering Group, chaired by the Department's Secretary General, was established to drive the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears (the 'Keane Report').  <\/p><p><br \/>  The Government has put in place a comprehensive strategy to address the problem of mortgage arrears, focusing on four main distinct areas:<\/p><p><b>- Innovative Personal Insolvency Reform:<\/b> Personal insolvency reform was identified by the Keane Report as a catalyst for addressing the mortgage arrears problem and it indicated that without an effective insolvency system the mortgage arrears problem will not be resolved.   The introduction of the new Personal Insolvency Act provides new statutory insolvency frameworks to allow debtors and creditors reach arrangements on unsustainable mortgage and personal debt.  The legislation provides a legal framework for the resolution of mortgage arrears, as well as other personal debt, and it will provide certainty for borrowers and lenders alike about the consequences of non-payment and failure to reach agreement.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland, which will generally oversee the operation of the new insolvency frameworks, has now been established and it is envisaged it will be in a position to process cases later this summer.<\/p><p><b>- Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies:<\/b> The development and implementation of mortgage arrears strategies by individual lenders has further intensified with the Central Bank initiative of last March to set time bound and measurable targets for the main banks on their progress in addressing and resolving, on a durable basis, the position of their mortgage customers who are in arrears on their mortgage. In particular, the Central Bank is now requiring the relevant lenders to propose sustainable solutions to 20% of mortgages that are in arrears (of over 90 days) by end June, 30% by end September and 50% by end December 2013.  In addition, the more recent pilot initiative announced by the Central Bank will seek, where there are a number of lenders involved, to address a debtor's position in a holistic and fair way in the best interest of all creditors and the debtor.<\/p><p><b>- Comprehensive Advice and Guidance:<\/b> In addition to existing arrangements, the Government has introduced a range of additional information and guidance resources to assist mortgage holders through what can be a difficult and stressful process.  A dedicated website, <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.keepingyourhome.ie<\/font><\/i>  , has been put in place to provide general public information on mortgages arrears issues.  In addition, there is a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline, which is established under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, to provide more tailored information to individual callers.  Finally, a panel of accountants has been put in place to provide &#8220;one to one&#8221; independent advice to borrowers who have been provided a long term forbearance resolution offer by their lender in respect of a mortgage on their primary home.  All of these information services are provided at no direct charge to the users of the service.<\/p><p><b>- Keeping families in their homes: <\/b>As a social housing response, a &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme is now in place on a nationwide basis.  This option will be available to households with unsustainable mortgages and who would qualify for social housing support and meet other appropriate criteria it will allow the family, in the context of an agreed resolution to an unsustainable mortgage, to remain in their home.<\/p><p>The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears remains a key protection and applies to mortgage lending activities with borrowers in respect of their principal private residence in the State.

The aim of the pilot framework is to achieve sustainable and fair outcomes without the need for the borrower to enter the statutory insolvency process.  It is focused on enhancing cooperation between lenders of secured and unsecured debt in order to resolve distressed debt in a holistic manner at an early stage.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s framework establishes a series of principles to be applied in debt restructuring solutions for borrowers.  In particular it outlines a &lsquo;Resolution Waterfall&rsquo; which sets out a series of debt affordability scenarios.  Treatments will be applied to the borrower&rsquo;s debts in order to establish the most appropriate and affordable modification that sets the borrower on a sustainable footing for the remaining period of the loans.<\/p><p>  The framework will be implemented on a pilot basis by participating lenders to 750 borrowers who are experiencing significant financial difficulty repaying the mortgage on the family home and who also have other unsecured debt.  The pilot scheme will run for three months from the end of June and will conclude with a thorough review of all results to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework in dealing with such cases and to determine next steps.<\/p><p>  To be eligible for the framework, a borrower must be co-operating with their lenders, as defined in the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA).  It will apply to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty but who have taken reasonable steps to maximise income and curtail expenditure.  All existing protections afforded by the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code and the CCMA will continue to apply to participating borrowers.  The Framework will not include borrowers with buy-to-let or business related debts.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank has advised that it has been agreed among the lender participants to use an independent third party service provider as the most appropriate way to engage with borrowers, whose consent to participate in the pilot will be sought.  Discussions are underway to determine the most appropriate provider and no decision on this matter has yet been made.

This average rate was compiled on the working assumption that taxation of this income source would be applied at each taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal tax rate, that is, at 20 % or at 41% as appropriate.  The Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) rate was not applied to the interest amount.   Income from these products is currently exempt from income tax so in working out the cost of the exemption one can make assumptions as to what tax rate should apply.  The information given in response to the Parliamentary Question on 30 April was in the context of the providing the cost of a number of reliefs and exemptions, which would apply either at the marginal rate or the standard rate of income tax, so an average marginal rate of tax was applied to the interest on savings certificates, savings bonds and national instalment savings to work out the costs of exempting the interest.<\/p><p>  As an alternative, one could assume that the income would be taxable at the higher rate of DIRT which applies to interest which is paid less frequently than annually.  In 2009, the year for which the figures were supplied, the higher rate of DIRT was 26% from 1 January to 7 April 2009 and 28% from 8 April to 31 December 2009.  On the assumption that the interest was paid evenly throughout the year, the estimated yield from applying the higher rate of DIRT to this interest income in 2009 would have been in the region of &euro;127.7 million.  The estimate does not take into account the fact that some account holders will be exempt from DIRT, including individuals aged over 65 years and whose total income, including the income subject to DIRT, is below the income tax age exemption limits (&euro;18,000 for a single individual and &euro;36,000 for a married couple or civil partners); and individuals who are permanently incapacitated, and whose tax credits cover their tax liability.<\/p><p>  The total interest paid under savings certificates, national instalment savings and index linked savings bonds in 2009 was &euro;465.04 million, whereas payments for those products in 2011 totalled just under &euro;164.83 million.

However, I am aware of a number of reports in the media where European Central Bank (ECB) officials, including President, Mr Mario Draghi, indicated that the ECB is considering buying asset-backed securities (ABS), among possible options to support lending to small and medium sized companies. I understand that President Draghi has said that the ECB's role in this would be mostly catalytic because the ECB works with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and with the EU Commission. I have no further details at this time.   As regards the EIB, it has highlighted SME financing as a priority for the Bank. On the domestic front, this has been evidenced when the EIB agreed to work with AIB in providing &euro;200 million for investment by small and medium companies across Ireland. This represents the latest EIB support for SMEs in Ireland since an earlier lending programme intermediated by AIB in 2011. This announcement coincided with a visit by the EIB President and the Management Committee to Ireland on 29 and 30 April 2013. The EIB delegation met with myself and a number of other Government Ministers including Minister Bruton where it was highlighted that access to funding for Irish SMEs is a priority for Ireland. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that Mr Werner Hoyer was appointed President of the EIB in January 2012.

The maximum amounts which can be raised under the scheme are up to 80% of the cost of production for all budgets up to a maximum of &euro;50,000,000.<\/p><p>  Tax relief on 100% of their investment is available to individual investors and to corporate investors.<\/p><p>  Individual investors can invest up to &euro;50,000 under the scheme in any year of assessment and will be entitled to tax relief on that amount at their marginal rate of tax. An investor who cannot obtain relief on all his\/her investment in a year of assessment, either because his\/her investment exceeds the maximum of &euro;50,000 or his\/her income in that year is insufficient to absorb all of it, can carry forward the unrelieved amount to following years up to and including 2015, subject to the normal limit of &euro;50,000 on the amount of investment that can be relieved in any one year.<\/p><p>  A corporate investor and any connected companies can invest up to &euro;10,160,000 in any 12 month period. The company will be entitled to a deduction, from its total profits, of the amount invested. There is provision for carry forward of an unrelieved amount. The total amount which can be invested by a company, in any one film, cannot exceed &euro;3,810,000.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners took over the certification of films qualifying for Film Relief in 2005 and my attention has not been drawn to any abuse in relation to films certified by them. Prior to then there was a number of tax avoidance schemes involving Film Relief which have been challenged by Revenue and the legislation has been changed as required over the years. <\/p><p>  Finance Act 2013 introduced changes to give Film Relief a new focus. The delivery mechanism of the incentive will change. Relief will not, in the future, be available to investors in qualifying films. Instead a payable tax credit of 32% will be paid directly by the Revenue Commissioners to a Producer Company, which produces a qualifying film. The legislation provides for measures to ensure that, in the event that the qualifying company does not satisfy any statutory conditions or conditions imposed by a film certificate issued by the Revenue Commissioners, any amount paid by the Revenue Commissioners can be recouped. <\/p><p>  The commencement of the section is subject to EU approval. The changes are expected to be effective from the 1 January 2016. The current scheme expires on 31 December 2015. <\/p><p>  The second question asks about the tax exemption for profits or gains from woodlands. The details in Parliamentary Question 20065\/13 to which the Deputy refers relate to exemptions contained in Sections 232 and 140 of the TCA 1997. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that profits or gains from the occupation of woodlands in the State managed on a commercial basis are exempt from Income Tax and Corporation Tax, (but not from the USC or PRSI) under Section 232 TCA 1997. Section 140 provides that distributions paid out of such exempt profits or gains are not regarded as income for the purposes of the Taxes Acts. The exemption granted to such profits, gains and dividends is, however, subject to the High Earners Restriction.  <\/p><p>  For chargeable periods commencing on or after 1 January 2004 details of all such profits, gains and losses must be included in the annual return of income to the Revenue Commissioners. The normal rules relating to the keeping of records and the making available of those records for inspection by the Revenue also apply<\/p><p>  Capital gains arising to an individual on the sale of woodlands are also exempt from CGT insofar as they relate to standing timber. Any gain attributable to the underlying land is subject to CGT. Companies and other bodies of persons are liable to CGT on gains arising from the sale of woodlands and standing timber.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are not aware of any abuse of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100067#WRO00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Betting Regulations","counter":544,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100067#WRO00750"},{"type":"question","counter":545,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[24318\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100067#WRO00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will detail the various taxes that currently apply to bets placed in a bookmakers' premises here and bets placed online; if any changes are planned in this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":546,"content":"<p>The only tax that currently applies specifically to bets placed in a bookmaker&rsquo;s premises is betting duty.

These governance reforms &ndash; including the reforms to the Stability and Growth Pact &ndash; will have a key role to play in containing fiscal imbalances in the future, and help to put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward trajectory, thereby improving the repayment capacity.<\/p><p>  In addition, the establishment of an effective backstop &ndash; initially in the form of the EFSF \/ EFSM and more recently in the ESM &ndash; provides, in appropriate circumstances, support to Member States in making the necessary economic and fiscal adjustments.<\/p><p>  Another development relates to the creation of a banking union, which is a priority and which is also an important part of the necessary reforms at EU level.<\/p><p>  In relation to whether or not initiatives such as Eurobonds are part of the solution, this is part of a wider debate at EU level on the future of EMU which is on-going.<\/p><p>  Finally, I would recall that the Heads of State or Government stated in June last year that it is imperative to break the link between banking debt and sovereign debt, and work is on-going at EU level to achieve this.\t<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100068#WRP01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":605,"content":"<p>Question No. 304 answered with Question No. 293.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Statistics","counter":606,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100068#WRP01350"},{"type":"question","counter":607,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[24401\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100068#WRP01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent, if any, to which he and his Department have recognised any possible inflationary tendencies in the Irish economy; if any corrective steps are required to address any issues arising; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":608,"content":"<p>HICP inflation - the comparative measurement of inflation across Europe - increased in Ireland by just 0.5 per cent year-on-year in April.

I understand that although the Children's Rights Alliance consulted with other groups on the content of the Report Card relating to Traveller children, it did not consult with my Department in relation to developments concerning Traveller education.  My Department would be keen to be consulted on future occasions in order to ensure a balance in the commentary as well as a currency of information.<\/p><p>  This Government, through its various interventions in the education sector, is committed to improved retention rates, better learning experiences and improved outcomes for all children, including children who are members of the Travelling community.  Recorded Traveller participation rates in education in recent years show an increase.  In the 2004\/05 school year, approximately 1,850 Traveller pupils aged between thirteen and eighteen (inclusive) were recorded as enrolled in post-primary schools and this increased to 2,698 in 2011\/12 school year.  The majority of Traveller students transfer from primary to post-primary education.  Participation rates in the junior cycle have steadily improved from 1,598 Traveller students recorded in 2004\/05 to 1,898 in the 2011\/12 school year.  The number of Travellers progressing to senior cycle has consistently improved in recent years from 260 in 2004\/05 to 800 in 2011\/12.  Some 25% of young Travellers leave mainstream post-primary education, before completion of the senior cycle.<\/p><p>  Current policy in relation to Traveller education is underpinned by the Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy which was launched in 2006, following wide ranging consultation with relevant stakeholders including Traveller representative groups.  The Strategy covers, in a very comprehensive manner, aspects of Traveller Education from pre-school right through to further and higher education within a lifelong learning context.  The principle of inclusion is at the core of the Strategy and, accordingly, the focus of both current and future provision is on the development of a more inclusive school environment through the whole school planning process, teaching practice, admissions policies, codes of behaviour and whole school evaluation.  In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system are allocated on the basis of individual educational need rather than that of ethnic or cultural background.  Implementation of the Strategy is undertaken by the Department of Education and Skills in consultation with representatives of the Traveller community through the Traveller Education Strategy Advisory and Consultative Forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRQ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Enrolments","counter":671,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRQ02350"},{"type":"question","counter":672,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[23994\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRQ02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will review a submission regarding a school that operates under Church of Ireland management; his view of the cultural and local roles of such schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"997","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":673,"content":"<p>The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools is being gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.  During this period the pupil threshold for a 2-classroom school is being increased to 20 pupils.  In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.  The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible. If amalgamations do take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.<\/p><p>  How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small Protestant communities does present as a particular challenge especially in any locality where enrolment in their schools is declining to single figures and amalgamation is not an option because there is no other school nearby. The Government is intent in fostering pluralism in school provision.  Supporting minority churches in maintaining their schools is part of that policy.<\/p><p>  A Value for Money examination of small schools is being carried out and my Department expects to publish the analysis and findings in the near future.  I hope that this report will foster constructive engagement both in the Oireachtas and among all interested parties in looking at the challenges ahead and how best to make provision for primary education in rural and dispersed communities.<\/p><p>  My Department and I will continue to engage with the relevant education sector stakeholders, including the Church of Ireland, in relation to education provision for all areas.  In addition to this my Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the schools that are affected by the budget measure.  In this regard small schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting sustainable increased enrolments in September 2013 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.  The detailed arrangements in relation to the appeals process are set in the Department's Staffing Circular 0013\/2013. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRQ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Inspections","counter":674,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRQ02550"},{"type":"question","counter":675,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[24015\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRQ02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the annual budget spent on employing school inspectorates at primary and post primary level; if he will list in tabular form the number of inspectors employed by his Department on an annual basis; and if he will provide a breakdown of their salary scales.","asker":"984","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":676,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[24016\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRQ02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of his Department's annual spend to maintain the school inspectorate system at primary and post primary level.","asker":"984","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":677,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 328 and 329 together.<\/p><p>In 2012 my Department spent &euro;11.635m on the Department's School Inspectorate Division comprising of &euro;10.64m on salary costs, &euro;0.84m on travel and subsistence and &euro;155,000 on training and development.

The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (DCENR) has responsibility for overall implementation of the plan and chairs the Cross-Departmental group tasked with ensuring that all the actions contained in the plan are delivered.<\/p><p>  In terms of energy efficiency in educational buildings, for the past fifteen years the Planning and Building Unit of my Department have been using a process called the DART approach to develop sustainability and energy efficiency.  This acronym focuses on four key areas, namely; Design, Awareness, Research and Technology.  The policy is informed by the Building Unit Professional and Technical staff, driven by its technical guidance documents and updated by continued energy research and development.<\/p><p>  My Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy efficiency (including water conservation and efficiency) in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both national and international level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.  In conjunction with Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), my Department has developed an &quot;Energy in Education&quot; website www.energyineducation.ie which I launched in October 2012.  The website is designed to help school boards of management, principals, teachers, administrators, caretaking staff, pupils and parents to improve energy use practices and to reduce school operating costs along with helping to protect the environment for future generations.  The principles of NEEAP supports the energy efficiency programme and approach of the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills both in new build and with existing schools that saw significant investment through the Energy Efficiency Insulation Scheme 2009, the Water Conservation Scheme 2010 and the Summer works schemes.<\/p><p>  DCENR and SEAI have responsibility to collate all energy consumption data for the public sector and are presently testing the system that will facilitate this.  The data obtained from this process will help formulate energy upgrades to existing building stocks.  In parallel with this DCENR and SEAI are working on a National Energy Services Framework to be published shortly which will facilitate the development of an energy performance contracting (EPC) model for the upgrade of existing buildings; it is envisaged that this process will help identify the proposed models for delivery relating to schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRQ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":690,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRQ03650"},{"type":"question","counter":691,"qnumday":334,"qnumall":"[24021\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRQ03700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of personnel working within his Department and F&Aacute;S who received an annual take home pay based on salary and allowances that exceeded &euro;100,000 annually in the 2012\/13 academic year.","asker":"984","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":692,"content":"<p>There are no officials on the payroll at my Department or F&Aacute;S that are in receipt of an annual take home salary that exceeds &euro;100,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRQ03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Staff Remuneration","counter":693,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRQ03850"},{"type":"question","counter":694,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[24022\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRQ03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide in tabular the number of third level lecturers who receive an annual take home pay based on salary and allowances that exceeded &euro;100,000 annually in the 2011\/12 academic year.","asker":"984","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":695,"content":"<p>The specific information requested by the Deputy is not collected by my Department.

The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term pupils with Down syndrome pupils who are in the Mild General Learning Difficulty (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD. <\/p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.<\/p><p>  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRR02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":736,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRR02650"},{"type":"question","counter":737,"qnumday":350,"qnumall":"[24230\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRR02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the arrangements that have been put in place for new school buildings in respect of a school (details supplied) in County Wicklow; when he expects constructions works to start and on what sites; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":738,"content":"<p>The schools to which the Deputy refers are among a list of schools that are planned to be delivered as part of Bundle 5 of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) schools building programme.

My Department has provided the Deputy's correspondent in this matter with the contact details of the relevant Development Adviser in Enterprise Ireland who is available to discuss his proposal with him and who can provide him with details of the supports available from Enterprise Ireland to entrepreneurs and early stage companies that have an innovative product, service or technology, and have the potential to achieve exports sales and create employment. These supports include:<\/p><p>  New Frontiers Entrepreneur Development Programme<\/p><p>  This national incubation programme offers successful applicants a package of supports to help accelerate their business development and to equip them with the skills to successfully start and grow a company.<\/p><p>  HPSU Feasibility Grant<\/p><p>  Used to investigate the viability and potential of an innovative\/high potential start-up and the development of an Investor Ready Business Plan.<\/p><p>  Innovative HPSU Fund (Equity)<\/p><p>  The Innovative HPSU Fund allows Enterprise Ireland to offer equity investment to HPSU clients, on a co-funded basis to support the implementation of company business plans. First time and follow-on equity investments in HPSUs are supported under this offer.<\/p><p>  Mentor Grant<\/p><p>  Used to support the cost of a Mentor Assignment. Enterprise Ireland can match an entrepreneur with an experienced business mentor to assist the start-up phase or advise on specific areas of a company development plan.<\/p><p>  Innovation Voucher<\/p><p>  Innovation Vouchers, worth &euro;5,000, are available to assist a company to work with a registered college or knowledge provider to explore a business opportunity or technical problem. <\/p><p>  Internet Growth Acceleration Programme (iGAP)<\/p><p>  A 6 month intensive management development programme aimed exclusively at high potential internet\/games companies. <\/p><p>  County Enterprise Board Funding<\/p><p>  As I outlined previously, funding from the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) would be suitable for small start-up enterprises, such as those linked with the SIABH hub proposal. Eligible clients may qualify for a Priming Grant, which is a business start-up grant that is available to micro enterprises within the first 18 months of start-up. The grants are subject to certain criteria, such as commercial viability, avoidance of displacement of jobs elsewhere in the economy, creation of sustainable employment, etc. The typical Priming Grant payable is 50% of the investment or &euro;80,000, whichever is the lesser, although funding of up to &euro;150,000 may be provided in exceptional circumstances. Students wishing to engage with the local enterprise board following graduation may wish to note that the contact person for Dublin CEB is Greg Swift, CEO, 5th Floor, O'Connell Bridge House, Dublin 2, tel: 01-635 1144, email: gswift@dceb.ie, website: www.dceb.ie, although contact details for all CEBs are available on www.enterpriseboards.ie.&quot;<\/p><p>  Microenterprise Loan Fund<\/p><p>  It is a requirement of all approved applications that matching funding is available from the applicant for investment in the venture.  This requirement for matching funding is a proven technique in stimulating change, in that the commitment of entrepreneurs to development projects is significantly increased by virtue of the promoter having a financial interest in the success of the business. In this regard, the availability of the Microenterprise Loan Fund might be of benefit to Mr Bell&rsquo;s students in overcoming this condition.<\/p><p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund was launched on the 27 September 2012 to improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses from all industry sectors which have been refused access to credit by banks.<\/p><p>  The Fund provides support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks. The potential viability of the business proposal will be the dominant factor in all credit decisions.<\/p><p>  Generally loans will be provided for business start-up costs, expansions costs and working capital.  Due to its focus on job creation and the benefits this creates, the new Microenterprise Loan Fund will have a greater risk appetite than Banks could possibly have and therefore will be able to fund and help create and sustain additional micro-enterprises which cannot satisfy conventional Bank credit criteria.<\/p><p>  Further information on the Scheme is available at www.microfinanceireland.ie and by telephone on 01-2601007.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRT02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Community Issues","counter":849,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRT02725"},{"type":"question","counter":850,"qnumday":390,"qnumall":"[24253\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRT02800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding unemployment in the traveller population; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":851,"content":"<p>The Department for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has no remit with regard to the provision of formal education\/qualifications or labour market activation measures.

There is an obligation on receivers to comply with the legislative provisions applicable to them.  Sections 319 and 321 of the Companies Act 1963 provide that a receiver must send to the Registrar of Companies an abstract detailing the assets of the company of which he has taken possession, their estimated value, the proceeds of sale of any such assets and of his receipts and payments for each six months period following his appointment.  If a receiver makes default in complying with Section 319, or if applicable Section 321, he is guilty of an offence.  The offence may be prosecuted summarily or on indictment and the penalties are set out in Section 145 of the Companies Act 1990, as amended.<\/p><p>  From information contained in my reply today to the Deputy&rsquo;s Dail question in relation to numbers of filings of six-monthly abstracts in 2012, it would appear that receivers do not fail to file the required abstracts, but many fail to file them within the statutory deadline. While non-compliance with a statutory deadline is not desirable, the Companies Registration Office (CRO) is not in a position to prosecute every case of late filing of statutory submissions.  The CRO prioritises its limited enforcement resources towards the key compliance measure of securing the filing of Section 125 annual returns and financial statements by companies.<\/p><p>  Section 322 (1) (a) and (2) of the Companies Act 1963 provide that if a receiver fails to file returns, accounts or other documents which he is required to do by law, and fails within 14 days of the serving of a notice requiring him to do so, a creditor or member or the registrar of companies may apply to the court for an order directing the receiver to make good the default within such period as may be specified in the order. There is no provision applicable to a former business owner who is not a member or creditor.  Section 322 (3) provides that this does not affect the operation of any other enactment imposing penalties on receivers for similar statutory breaches to those set out in subsection (1).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRT03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":861,"content":"<p>Question No. 393 answered with Question No. 391.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":862,"content":"<p>Question No. 394 answered with Question No. 392.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":863,"content":"<p>Question No. 395 answered with Question No. 391.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Bodies Accounts","counter":864,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRT03925"},{"type":"question","counter":865,"qnumday":396,"qnumall":"[24493\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRT04000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will lay the latest annual report and accounts of the Company Registration Office before the Houses of the Oireachtas.","asker":"959","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":866,"content":"<p>There is no statutory obligation on the Registrar of Companies to prepare an annual report.

Those engaged with BTEA before 1st January 2013 and who are progressing, or who are mid-course will not be affected by the Budget changes relating to 'uprating'.<\/p><p>  The BTEA scheme remains an attractive scheme for social welfare recipients who wish to further their education.  A significant majority of those entering BTEA are in receipt of the maximum personal rate of payment of &euro;188 per week, which compares favourably with other State funded supports for those pursuing education.<\/p><p>  The Department has recently published a review of employment support schemes, including BTEA, and held a stakeholders' forum where review recommendations were discussed.

This will begin in 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) thereby standardising State pension age for all to 66 years. The State pension age will be further increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028. These changes apply to all fully insured employees, including some public servants.<\/p><p>  Public servants (including civil servants) who are due to retire aged 65 in January 2014 will be able to draw their occupational public service pension at age 65.  The changes regarding State pension (transition) will have no impact on public servants (including civil servants) who are on modified social insurance.<\/p><p>  However, for those public servants (including civil servants) who are fully insured, their public service pensions (and contributions) are, like many occupational pension schemes, integrated (or co-ordinated) with social welfare benefits.  This means the occupational pension paid is based on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State pension (transition or contributory).<\/p><p>  Where this does not happen, a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the relevant public service pension scheme to bridge the gap.  In this instance, a supplementary pension is only payable where the individual, through no fault of their own, does not qualify for social welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate.  It is therefore necessary to claim any available social welfare benefits in order to receive a supplementary pension.  This situation is not new and already applies to public sector workers who have a retirement age below 65.<\/p><p>  For other workers, the main social welfare payments available to those who leave employment before pension age are jobseekers benefit and job seekers allowance.  Persons aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).<\/p><p>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age. Increasing longevity and significant improvements in health status mean that people can work longer to support themselves in retirement. Raising State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition) is a necessary step in ensuring the sustainability of pensions into the future.  The recently published OECD report on the Review of the Irish Pension System confirms that reforms are necessary if we are to continue to put pension provision on a sustainable footing given the changes in demographics, the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund, and the difficult fiscal situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRU01800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":885,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 403 and 404 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":886,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRU02000"},{"type":"question","counter":887,"qnumday":405,"qnumall":"[23680\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRU02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision on carer's allowance will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":888,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 26th February 2013.

This is in line with wider Government policies and objectives such as better public services, better and more effective ePayments and is aligned to the objectives of the National Payments Plan published by the Central Bank recently. The progression to electronic payments is a critical element of the National Payments Plan which aims to reduce the very high levels of cash usage in the Irish economy, thereby contributing to improved national competitiveness.<\/p><p>  All welfare customers paid through the post office network are paid in cash.  This is an inherently expensive means of paying customers.  This approach is inefficient, costly and imposes security risks on customers and staff alike who handle, distribute and receive these monies. The Government needs to move to more modern approaches for distributing these vast sums of money to customers weekly.<\/p><p>  As the current contract with An Post expires at the end of 2013, the Department is undertaking two public procurement competitions for the delivery of welfare payments and will provide for progression over time from cash to electronic payment methods.<\/p><p>  The first procurement for over the counter cash services for social welfare customers commenced in December 2012 and is now well advanced.  This will replace the existing service contract with An Post and will ensure continuity in the delivery of cash payments to the Department&rsquo;s almost 1 million cash payment customers.  I anticipate a contract for these services will be signed by the summer and will provide similar services to customers to those they currently enjoy.  The term of the contract will be for a two year period up to 31 December 2015.  The contract may be extended, for one or more period(s) of twelve months each, up to a maximum of six years in aggregate.  The services being procured under this RFT will be for a transitional period as the Department progressively increases levels of electronic payments.<\/p><p>  In addition, and to further support the migration towards electronic payments, the Department will be procuring an ePayment solution(s) to complement the existing facility to make payments directly into customers&rsquo; accounts in financial institutions. It is anticipated that notification regarding this procurement will issue by end June 2013 and a new electronic payment method will be in place for customers towards the end of 2014.<\/p><p>  Public sector contracts for the supply of products and services are generally subject to a competitive tendering process. This ensures that the taxpayer receives value for money and ensures that all potential suppliers are given the opportunity to put forward the most efficient, effective and competitive solutions for consideration and evaluation. The award of public sector contracts with a significant financial value is subject to various EU Directives. Because of the financial value of this particular service, the Department was required to publicly invite tenders for the new contract to deliver social welfare payments when the current contract with An Post expires at the end of this year.<\/p><p>  I am conscious of the important role of the post offices around the country, notably the extent to which it is now a one stop shop where people can pay bills, purchase mobile phone top ups, use the passport application facility, pay local property tax and carry out a range of banking and other financial services.

Courses leading to a qualification as a special needs assistant may be eligible for both these schemes. <\/p><p><br \/>  A  person wishing to pursue a course of study under the back to education allowance will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications among others. BTEA is essentially a social welfare replacement income which is paid in lieu of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  <\/p><p>Courses of education from second level to Higher diploma level (H Dip) in any discipline (level 8 in the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or a Professional Diploma in Education (Primary and Secondary Teaching; level 8 in NFQ) are eligible courses.

Customers can therefore avail of competitive offerings from electricity and gas suppliers.  Prices are set by suppliers and are commercial and operational matters for them.  I have no statutory function in the setting of electricity or gas prices.<\/p><p>  With regard to the regulation of gas prices the position is that up until 1 October 2011 the CER regulated Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential and smaller business customers but price regulation for the latter group ended at that point.  The CER still regulates the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential customers.  The timing for complete deregulation of the residential segment of the gas market, as has taken place in the electricity market, is an issue under active review by the CER.<\/p><p>  Electricity and gas costs in Ireland are influenced by various drivers, including global gas and oil prices, the costs of capital, exchange rate fluctuations, the small size of the Irish market, geographical location and low population density.  Global gas and oil prices are by far the most significant factor in the case of Ireland. Prices have risen sharply since the start of 2011 driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan and demand from China and India.  Ireland is at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices which dictate the retail price of electricity.<\/p><p>  At a national level, the competitive energy market in place helps put downward pressure on prices.

I have no direct statutory function in relation to connections to the gas network.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2006, the CER approved a new network connections policy which enabled reassessment of the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  This policy was updated in 2011.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.<\/p><p><br \/>  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.  The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Otherwise, uneconomic projects will increase costs for all energy consumers.<\/p><p><br \/>  Having regard to the CER policy on new towns connections, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and more recently Gaslink, have carried out a comprehensive review of towns not connected to the national gas network.  In April 2010, Gaslink published its 'New Towns Analysis Phase 3'<i><\/i>  report.  The study included a review of the feasibility of connecting 11 towns in the West and North West region, including Sligo town.

Neither of the matters to which Deputy Doherty refers impact upon the considerations which resulted in the Government taking the decision which it did.   It will be recalled that those considerations involved a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights. <\/p><p>  With regard to providing assistance to businesses in relation to this matter, absent legislative intervention, NAMA is playing a role in dealing with problems caused by upward only rent reviews applying to NAMA properties.   I have been advised that, by end-April 2013, the Agency had granted 222 applications for rent abatement with an aggregate annual value of about &euro;14 million which represents the annual value of rent due to NAMA that it has agreed to forego in order to help businesses survive.  A further 52 applications were under review at that date.  Of the 284 eligible applications received only 10 have been refused representing a 96% approval rate by NAMA.   The practice of NAMA in this area is one which I would commend to landlords in the commercial property market and in the retail sector in particular.<\/p><p>  More generally, the importance of supporting the retail sector is widely recognised across a range of Government Departments.   I would draw the attention of Deputy Healy-Rae to the Action Plan for Jobs which lies within the remit of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I would also note the continuing action which is being taken to reduce the costs for doing business for all businesses and which is intended to have a positive impact on areas such as energy, local authority rates, and the administrative burden involved in companies complying with Government regulations and tax systems.<\/p><p>  Regarding the feasibility of establishing a register for commercial tenancies, the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a Commercial Leases Database by the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  This Database will assist in providing readily accessible, accurate information in order to determine the market rent payable in respect of comparable commercial properties.  Work is underway to ensure that the Database will be operational shortly.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRZ03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1194,"content":"<p>Question No. 515 answered with Question No. 513.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1195,"content":"<p>Question No. 516 answered with Question No. 514.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Equipment","counter":1197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRAA00050"},{"type":"question","counter":1198,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[23702\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRAA00100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of bicycles in the Garda Cycle Unit per station; the number of Garda&iacute; entitled to use them in each station; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1199,"content":"<p>The provision and deployment of Garda resources, including bicycles, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the context of his identified operational requirements.

This process has included the very detailed Second Stage debate of the Bill which took place from 16 December 2011 to 23 February 2012.  The following July, in supporting discussion of the Bill, my Department hosted a conference on \"Regulatory Reform for a 21st Century Legal Profession\" with guest speakers from home and abroad who shared their experiences of legal sector reform including the Legal Services Commissioner of New South Wales and the Chief Executive of the Legal Services Board for England and Wales.  In terms of written submissions, I have received just under 50 since publication of the Bill representing nearly 30 interested parties along with dozens of individual letters from concerned members of the public and practitioners and the formal observations of other Government Departments.  The submissions have come from a wide range of bodies including the main legal professional bodies and associations, academics, civil liberties and human rights organisations, private businesses and government entities.  For their part, the Law Society, the Bar Council and the King's Inns have provided substantive views which are among those to which consideration continues to be given.  In addition, over the past 18 months both I and my officials have, together and separately, had meetings with various interested groups and bodies.  Alongside those representing the legal professions, these have included such entities as the Competition Authority, the Consumers' Association and the Committee of Heads of Irish University Law Schools.  The fruits of these ongoing consultations and submissions will be reflected in the amendments I intend to make to the Bill at Committee Stage in July and I have already identified a number of specific areas of the Bill where this will be the case.

All eight reports have been published and are available electronically at <i>www.morristribunal.ie<\/i> and on my Department's website, <i>www.justice.ie<\/i>.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the passage of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act was the main response from Government to implement the recommendations from the Morris Tribunal.  That Act clarified the respective roles and responsibilities of the Minister and the Garda Commissioner and provided for the strengthening of the regulatory framework governing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the establishment of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  I assume that the Deputy is referring to issues arising in the recent report of the Ombudsman Commission into the use of informants by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The first report of the Morris Tribunal recommended that there should be a periodic independent audit of Garda informant handling procedures by an outside authority, with power to make inspections and see documents and to monitor and review the informer management system.  In December 2010 my predecessor as Minister, at the request of the then Garda Commissioner, appointed retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice Thomas Smyth, as the Independent Covert Human Intelligence Sources Oversight Authority.  The functions assigned to Mr. Justice Smyth are to review and monitor the use within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of Covert Human Intelligence Sources; to ensure compliance with the code of practice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the management and use of Covert Human Intelligence Sources; to communicate any matters, he considers appropriate, including recommendations, to the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and report to the Minister at such intervals, being intervals of not more than twelve months, on discharge of his functions.  The most recent report of Mr Justice Smyth, which I have already put in the public domain, stated that he was satisfied than An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were in substantial compliance with the code of practice.  I have indicated that I will publish such reports in the future.  I am satisfied that the recommendations arising from the Morris Tribunal have been addressed in this regard by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I am informed that no submissions were received and the Board at its meeting on 15th April, 2013 approved the closure of Ballyconnell and the amalgamation of the Ballyconnell District Court area with Cavan District Court area. It is expected that court sittings at Ballyconnell will cease before the end of the year.<\/p><p>  I understand that no decision in relation to the future of Clones courthouse has been taken to date but that the consultation process has been concluded and the views received will be taken into account in the decision making process which, as the Deputy is aware, is a matter for the Courts Service Board under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRBB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":1280,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRBB02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Investigations","counter":1279,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRBB02225"},{"type":"question","counter":1280,"qnumday":551,"qnumall":"[24367\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRBB02300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the steps he has taken with the Lebenese and Palestinian authorities to try and locate the remains of a person (details supplied) who was kidnapped on the 27 April 1981 from an Irish observation post outside the village of Dyar Ntar in South Lebanon.","asker":"1028","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":1281,"qnumday":555,"qnumall":"[24366\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRBB02400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if any progress has been made in case of a person (details supplied) who was kidnapped on the 27 April 1981 from an Irish observation post outside the village of Dyar Ntar in South Lebanon and whose body was never recovered.","asker":"1028","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1282,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 551 and 555 together.  <\/p><p>  Private Kevin Joyce and Private Hugh Doherty were serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), when on 27 April 1981, an observation post manned by them came under attack.

I have also decided, as an exceptional measure, that any definite purchases that have been placed by that date, but which will be delivered during the following week, will be included under the scheme.<\/p><p><br \/>  To date some 2,000 loads of imported fodder, amounting to about 30,000 tonnes, have benefited from my Department's contribution to these transport costs.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation on a day by day basis.  This remains a very challenging situation for farmers and the extension to 24 May will allow both farmers and Co Ops to have some certainty around the supply of fodder over the coming weeks.  It is also important that while continuing to focus on the emergency fodder position in the short term, farmers should also focus on growing and conserving fodder for next winter's needs. We should be maximising production in the coming period and I have asked Teagasc to prioritise this policy in their advisory campaigns over the summer months.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is clear that the main cut of silage will be delayed this year and as a consequence we need to look at the potential for the growing of additional fodder later into the season.

In response, I have introduced a specific Scheme, the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme, designed to assist towards the transport costs of imported fodder and maintenance of stocking levels. The situation has prompted action by the wider industry and farm bodies, which is very welcome. In keeping the situation under constant review, I decided, given the ongoing shortages in some areas, to extend the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme to 24 May and to double the funding available to &euro;2 million. Simultaneously, my Department&rsquo;s Emergency Welfare System continues to respond to individual emergency situations. The scheme will cover any definite purchases that have been placed by that date but which will not be delivered until the following week.<\/p><p>  Mindful of ongoing difficulties, I also decided that a formal request should again be made to the EU Commission seeking agreement to pay an advance from 16 October of the 2013 Single Farm Payment which, being the first day of the new EU financial year is the earliest potential payment date and almost two months ahead of the standard timeline. It will be recalled that my successful approach to Commissioner Ciolos for agreement to making an advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment was prompted by the very wet weather experienced throughout last summer.<\/p><p>  With specific regard to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the 2013 Scheme, as already announced, is focussed on the protection of the smaller and most disadvantaged. It must also be borne in mind that the minimum stocking density requirement is equivalent to one ewe per eligible forage hectare and cannot in any way be regarded as onerous. It will be recalled that, in response to budgetary realities, it was decided to re-focus the Scheme, with greater consideration been given to those contributing most to achieving the aims of the Scheme, which are:<\/p><p> - Ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of a viable rural society;<\/p><p> - Maintaining the countryside;<\/p><p> - Maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which, in particular, take account of environmental protection requirements. <\/p><p>  Given the restrictions faced by those farming in recognised Disadvantaged Areas and mindful of the aims of the Scheme, as outlined, it will be readily appreciated that appropriate stocking levels are crucial. In this regard, balance must be struck between the need to ensure that at least the minimum is done to ensure the land is adequately utilised and grazed, while at the same time being sufficiently aware of the natural constraints. In this regard, it is clear that the minimum stocking levels currently set under the Scheme achieve this twin objective.  Thus, the terms of the 2013 Scheme remain as previously announced.  Farmers with genuine fodder-related stocking difficulties may avail of the force majeure provisions of the Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRCC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Travel","counter":1336,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRCC02725"},{"type":"question","counter":1337,"qnumday":570,"qnumall":"[23809\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRCC02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will outline in tabular form, the amount of travel and subsistence, both foreign and domestic, claimed individually by each Minister and Minister of State and Secretary General in his Department, for each year in the period 2005 to March 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1338,"content":"<p>The total travel and subsistence expenses claimed by each Minister, Minister of State and Secretary General in my Department for each year from 1 January 2005 to 9 March 2011 is set out in the table.

This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law. I have made it clear to the health insurers that I believe significant savings can be made, the effect of which can be to contain the cost of health insurance premiums. <\/p><p>  Given VHI&rsquo;s very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs.  At my instruction, the VHI recently compiled a detailed cost containment plan, which sets out savings targets for 2013 and for the 2014-2016 period, so as to minimise the need for any future premium increases.

SAGO works closely with the Health Service Executive, the Irish College of General Practitioners and in conjunction with other professional bodies, and, as mentioned previously, has developed treatment algorithms for both adults and children. These algorithm obesity tools are being used nationally in the treatment of adult and childhood obesity.<\/p><p>  Healthy Ireland, a Framework for Improved Health and Well-being, forms the basis of how a whole-of-government and whole of society approach to health and well-being will be delivered. It sets out 64 actions under a number of thematic areas which provide for the development of inter-sectoral and cross government plans to address risk factors and social determinants of health.  It provides a  structured mechanism to engage all different sectors of society to channel measures and actions around individual health and lifestyle  issues, and to measure, monitor and evaluate implementation.<\/p><p>  Healthy Ireland describes supportive mechanisms to ensure effective co-operation between the health sector and other areas of Government and public services concerned with social protection, children, industry, food safety, education, transport, housing, agriculture and the environment. The implementation of Healthy Ireland is now focused on the development of an outcomes framework and a physical activity plan. In this regard  the Health and Well-being Programme in the Department of Health will work closely with relevant policy divisions in the Department of Health and with existing cross-government and cross-sectoral groups, such as SAGO. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRJJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Issues","counter":1669,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRJJ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":1670,"qnumday":681,"qnumall":"[24334\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRJJ01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department has considered providing for improved weight management resources for healthcare workers who have an obesity problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1671,"content":"<p>As this is a Service Matter it has been transferred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRJJ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1672,"content":"<p>Question No. 682 answered with Question No. 680.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Training","counter":1673,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRJJ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1674,"qnumday":683,"qnumall":"[24336\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRJJ01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he considers it best practice that in all specialist postgraduate exams, obesity and relevant training in behavioural change therapy become essential components, thus enhancing the knowledge and skills of physicians and other professions related to medicine in this important area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1675,"content":"<p>I agree that not only post graduate but also undergraduate programmes would include health and wellbeing components, in keeping with the recommendations in <i>Healthy Ireland a Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing,<\/i>which I recently launched.<i><\/i><\/p><p>The implementation of <i>Healthy Ireland<\/i>  will include the prioritisation of a range of areas across the 64 actions highlighted in the report.

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme. There has been no change to the Government&rsquo;s over-arching commitment to this goal. This Government is the first in the history of this State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. <\/p><p>  Having examined the progress made in the universal GP care plan, it became clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic for a short-term arrangement. Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness. The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public. This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions. As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition. While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. <\/p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the delay in the initial step of the roll-out of the universal GP service. In doing so, it has considered the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay. <\/p><p>  No decision has been taken by the Cabinet Committee or by Government on changing the first step of the plan to extend GP care without fees to persons with chronic illnesses. Instead, it has been agreed that we should prepare and set out a number of alternative options with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  Minister Reilly and I expect to report back to the Cabinet Committee in the near future. As part of this work, consideration will be given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation this universal health service.  <\/p><p>  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources in the two most recent Budgets. The HSE Vote now contains funding of &euro;30 million for this year for an initial phase of the provision of GP services as part of this Programme for Government commitment.<\/p><p>  To conclude, far from abandoning its commitment to universal GP care, this Government is determined to expedite the implementation of a national GP service for the entire population, something to which no previous Government has ever aspired. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRJJ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1698,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRJJ03150"},{"type":"question","counter":1699,"qnumday":690,"qnumall":"[24372\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRJJ03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the acute medicine programme defined model applicable to Monaghan Hospital; the additional services that he anticipates will be located at the Monaghan hospital site under the terms of the now published framework for the development of small hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1700,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRJJ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":1701,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRJJ03350"},{"type":"question","counter":1702,"qnumday":691,"qnumall":"[24470\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRJJ03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there is a consultant paediatric urologist for children with spina bifida in Temple Street Hospital, Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1703,"qnumday":692,"qnumall":"[24471\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100069#WRJJ03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive will consider giving priority to the appointment of a research nurse for spina bifida at Temple Street Hospital, Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1704,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 691 and 692 together.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Children's University Hospital, Temple Street is the national tertiary care centre for spina bifida and hydrocephalus.

Section 11 of the Taxi Regulation Bill 2012\u00a0places an obligation on an applicant for or holder of an SPSV licence to inform the National Transport Authority (NTA) of any other occupation that involves driving. Under Section 19 of the Bill the NTA is provided with powers to make regulations concerning taxi drivers' hours. <\/p><p>  However, this is a complex legal area and it is my intention that the Bill puts in place a provision that is balanced and proportionate having regard to the rights of\u00a0individuals relating to privacy and to earn a livelihood.

The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term pupils with Down syndrome pupils who are in the Mild General Learning Difficulty (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD. <\/p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.<\/p><p>  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100070#WRR02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":1831,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100070#WRR02650"},{"type":"question","counter":1832,"qnumday":350,"qnumall":"[24230\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100070#WRR02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the arrangements that have been put in place for new school buildings in respect of a school (details supplied) in County Wicklow; when he expects constructions works to start and on what sites; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":1833,"content":"<p>The schools to which the Deputy refers are among a list of schools that are planned to be delivered as part of Bundle 5 of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) schools building programme.

I understand that the Tribunal targets areas with the longest waiting period and highest level of claims outstanding; within the resources it has currently available.<\/p><p>The Tribunal is pro-active in driving efficiencies.  Divisions of the Tribunal are sitting longer, hearing more cases per hearing and seeking to manage the caseload to maximise efficiency.  As part of the drive for efficiencies the Tribunal streams cases that are envisaged to be more straight-forward.

Eligible clients may qualify for a Priming Grant, which is a business start-up grant that is available to micro enterprises within the first 18 months of start-up. The grants are subject to certain criteria, such as commercial viability, avoidance of displacement of jobs elsewhere in the economy, creation of sustainable employment, etc. The typical Priming Grant payable is 50% of the investment or &euro;80,000, whichever is the lesser, although funding of up to &euro;150,000 may be provided in exceptional circumstances. Students wishing to engage with the local enterprise board following graduation may wish to note that the contact person for Dublin CEB is Greg Swift, CEO, 5th Floor, O'Connell Bridge House, Dublin 2, tel: 01-635 1144, email: gswift@dceb.ie, website: www.dceb.ie, although contact details for all CEBs are available on www.enterpriseboards.ie.&quot;<\/p><p>  Microenterprise Loan Fund<\/p><p>  It is a requirement of all approved applications that matching funding is available from the applicant for investment in the venture.  This requirement for matching funding is a proven technique in stimulating change, in that the commitment of entrepreneurs to development projects is significantly increased by virtue of the promoter having a financial interest in the success of the business. In this regard, the availability of the Microenterprise Loan Fund might be of benefit to Mr Bell&rsquo;s students in overcoming this condition.<\/p><p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund was launched on the 27 September 2012 to improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses from all industry sectors which have been refused access to credit by banks.<\/p><p>  The Fund provides support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.

There is an obligation on receivers to comply with the legislative provisions applicable to them.

If a receiver makes default in complying with Section 319, or if applicable Section 321, he is guilty of an offence.

While non-compliance with a statutory deadline is not desirable, the Companies Registration Office (CRO) is not in a position to prosecute every case of late filing of statutory submissions.  The CRO prioritises its limited enforcement resources towards the key compliance measure of securing the filing of Section 125 annual returns and financial statements by companies.<\/p><p>  Section 322 (1) (a) and (2) of the Companies Act 1963 provide that if a receiver fails to file returns, accounts or other documents which he is required to do by law, and fails within 14 days of the serving of a notice requiring him to do so, a creditor or member or the registrar of companies may apply to the court for an order directing the receiver to make good the default within such period as may be specified in the order. There is no provision applicable to a former business owner who is not a member or creditor.  Section 322 (3) provides that this does not affect the operation of any other enactment imposing penalties on receivers for similar statutory breaches to those set out in subsection (1).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100072#WRT03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1956,"content":"<p>Question No. 393 answered with Question No. 391.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1957,"content":"<p>Question No. 394 answered with Question No. 392.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1958,"content":"<p>Question No. 395 answered with Question No. 391.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Bodies Accounts","counter":1959,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100072#WRT03925"},{"type":"question","counter":1960,"qnumday":396,"qnumall":"[24493\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100072#WRT04000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will lay the latest annual report and accounts of the Company Registration Office before the Houses of the Oireachtas.","asker":"959","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":1961,"content":"<p>There is no statutory obligation on the Registrar of Companies to prepare an annual report.

This will begin in 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) thereby standardising State pension age for all to 66 years. The State pension age will be further increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028. These changes apply to all fully insured employees, including some public servants.<\/p><p>  Public servants (including civil servants) who are due to retire aged 65 in January 2014 will be able to draw their occupational public service pension at age 65.  The changes regarding State pension (transition) will have no impact on public servants (including civil servants) who are on modified social insurance.<\/p><p>  However, for those public servants (including civil servants) who are fully insured, their public service pensions (and contributions) are, like many occupational pension schemes, integrated (or co-ordinated) with social welfare benefits.  This means the occupational pension paid is based on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State pension (transition or contributory).<\/p><p>  Where this does not happen, a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the relevant public service pension scheme to bridge the gap.  In this instance, a supplementary pension is only payable where the individual, through no fault of their own, does not qualify for social welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate.  It is therefore necessary to claim any available social welfare benefits in order to receive a supplementary pension.  This situation is not new and already applies to public sector workers who have a retirement age below 65.<\/p><p>  For other workers, the main social welfare payments available to those who leave employment before pension age are jobseekers benefit and job seekers allowance.  Persons aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).<\/p><p>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age. Increasing longevity and significant improvements in health status mean that people can work longer to support themselves in retirement. Raising State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition) is a necessary step in ensuring the sustainability of pensions into the future.  The recently published OECD report on the Review of the Irish Pension System confirms that reforms are necessary if we are to continue to put pension provision on a sustainable footing given the changes in demographics, the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund, and the difficult fiscal situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100073#WRU01800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1980,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 403 and 404 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":1981,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100073#WRU02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1982,"qnumday":405,"qnumall":"[23680\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100073#WRU02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision on carer's allowance will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1983,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 26th February 2013.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.<\/p><p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for the State pension (contributory) easier by disregarding time spent out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme was introduced in and took effect from 1994.  Eligibility for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is conditional on firstly meeting the standard qualifying conditions for State pension.<\/p><p>  There are no plans to review the effective date for this scheme as backdating the scheme further than 1994 would involve considerable costs.  The 2007 Green Paper on Pensions indicated that to back-date the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme to 1953, the year when the unified system of social insurance was introduced in Ireland, would cost the Exchequer in the region of &euro;160 million. Costs in relation to this scheme, under the current rules, are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994.<\/p><p>  In relation to women and social insurance payments, it is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  Those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women, have and will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund.  The social solidarity principle which underlies the Fund is reflected in the fact that, for those at the higher end of the income distribution, the Fund is redistributive and they generally get back less than they pay in.<\/p><p>  While my Department will keep the homemaker's scheme under review, any improvements which could result in further costs for the Exchequer could only be considered in a budgetary context in an improved fiscal environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100073#WRU03400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments","counter":1996,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100073#WRU03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1997,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[23786\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100073#WRU03600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans move social welfare payments to a purely electronic system; if she will outline the proposed time-frame involved in making this move; if she will acknowledge that this move will have a detrimental affect on the country's Post Office Network; if she will agree that the Post Office network has delivered an exceptional service to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1998,"content":"<p>The Department of Social Protection envisages a payments environment that will ultimately deliver all payments to customers electronically. This is in line with wider Government policies and objectives such as better public services, better and more effective ePayments and is aligned to the objectives of the National Payments Plan published by the Central Bank recently. The progression to electronic payments is a critical element of the National Payments Plan which aims to reduce the very high levels of cash usage in the Irish economy, thereby contributing to improved national competitiveness.<\/p><p>  All welfare customers paid through the post office network are paid in cash.  This is an inherently expensive means of paying customers.  This approach is inefficient, costly and imposes security risks on customers and staff alike who handle, distribute and receive these monies. The Government needs to move to more modern approaches for distributing these vast sums of money to customers weekly.<\/p><p>  As the current contract with An Post expires at the end of 2013, the Department is undertaking two public procurement competitions for the delivery of welfare payments and will provide for progression over time from cash to electronic payment methods.<\/p><p>  The first procurement for over the counter cash services for social welfare customers commenced in December 2012 and is now well advanced.  This will replace the existing service contract with An Post and will ensure continuity in the delivery of cash payments to the Department&rsquo;s almost 1 million cash payment customers.  I anticipate a contract for these services will be signed by the summer and will provide similar services to customers to those they currently enjoy.  The term of the contract will be for a two year period up to 31 December 2015.  The contract may be extended, for one or more period(s) of twelve months each, up to a maximum of six years in aggregate.  The services being procured under this RFT will be for a transitional period as the Department progressively increases levels of electronic payments.<\/p><p>  In addition, and to further support the migration towards electronic payments, the Department will be procuring an ePayment solution(s) to complement the existing facility to make payments directly into customers&rsquo; accounts in financial institutions. It is anticipated that notification regarding this procurement will issue by end June 2013 and a new electronic payment method will be in place for customers towards the end of 2014.<\/p><p>  Public sector contracts for the supply of products and services are generally subject to a competitive tendering process. This ensures that the taxpayer receives value for money and ensures that all potential suppliers are given the opportunity to put forward the most efficient, effective and competitive solutions for consideration and evaluation. The award of public sector contracts with a significant financial value is subject to various EU Directives. Because of the financial value of this particular service, the Department was required to publicly invite tenders for the new contract to deliver social welfare payments when the current contract with An Post expires at the end of this year.<\/p><p>  I am conscious of the important role of the post offices around the country, notably the extent to which it is now a one stop shop where people can pay bills, purchase mobile phone top ups, use the passport application facility, pay local property tax and carry out a range of banking and other financial services.  The Government has stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network in the Programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100073#WRU03700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Assist Scheme Appeals","counter":1999,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100073#WRU03800"},{"type":"question","counter":2000,"qnumday":411,"qnumall":"[23795\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100073#WRU03900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a decision has been made on an appeal on a farm assist application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry","asker":"1051","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2001,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 25th April 2013.

The Department's objective in this area is to raise educational and skills level among the long term unemployed, in order to help them to meet the requirements of the labour market. The back to education programme was introduced to provide a comprehensive range of options from which an unemployed person can choose, or be directed to, the most appropriate for his\/her needs. Amongst the supports available are the back to education allowance scheme (BTEA) and the part time education option (PTEO). These supports may be available to persons on qualifying social welfare payments. Courses leading to a qualification as a special needs assistant may be eligible for both these schemes. <\/p><p><br \/>  A  person wishing to pursue a course of study under the back to education allowance will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications among others. BTEA is essentially a social welfare replacement income which is paid in lieu of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  <\/p><p>Courses of education from second level to Higher diploma level (H Dip) in any discipline (level 8 in the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or a Professional Diploma in Education (Primary and Secondary Teaching; level 8 in NFQ) are eligible courses.

In order to increase activation capacity the Department is considering the contracting of employment services to complement the existing capacity of the department.  In that regard, the Department engaged the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion (CESI) in November 2012 to provide expert advice and assistance with the design and delivery of a contracted employment service model. The consultants recently produced a report and this is currently being evaluated. I expect the evaluation to be completed in the near future.

The combination of funding available under the  Jobs Initiative Scheme operated by Inishowen Development Partnership Ltd and a funding allocation from Donegal CIS equivalent to a 0.5 post allowed for the delivery of a service five days a week in Buncrana Citizens Information Centre.<\/p><p><br \/>  Since February 2011, the Jobs Initiative Scheme resource is no longer available.  In order to provide a service in Buncrana,  Donegal CIS reallocated resources to provide cover on two days each week pending recruitment to fill the 0.5 post allocated to the Centre.  Following recruitment in October, a part-time Information Officer has now been permanently allocated to the Buncrana office so that a service can be provided on three days per week.  In addition to this permanent part time Information Officer, a second Information Officer works in Buncrana CIS for 1.5 days per week. <\/p><p><br \/>  Information and assistance on the range of services and schemes offered by my Department can be obtained in Buncrana Social Welfare Local Office.<\/p><p><br \/>  Donegal CIS also provides targeted information sessions to local groups and communities where a need is identified or to meet specific requests.  <\/p><p>The Citizens Information Board operates a national helpline, telephone 0761 07 4000, which provides a comprehensive and confidential information service to people throughout the country, Monday to Friday from 9am to 9pm.  Further information is provided on a broad range of subjects on the citizen's information website   , which aims to meet customer demands for fast, easy access to comprehensive information on rights and entitlements.<\/p><p><br \/>  While the number of callers to the service has increased by approximately 8% in recent months, local management, by actively monitoring demand and keeping the level of service under ongoing review, is satisfied that the current level of available resources allocated to Buncrana CIS is adequate to meet service needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100074#WRV01800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Numbers","counter":2047,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100074#WRV01850"},{"type":"question","counter":2048,"qnumday":431,"qnumall":"[24144\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100074#WRV01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of taxi drivers who are claiming social welfare benefits due to the lack of work in this industry; if the figure of 8% is the correct number of taxi drivers on social welfare benefits; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2049,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is not collated by my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100074#WRV02000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Supplementary Welfare Allowance Appeals","counter":2050,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100074#WRV02050"},{"type":"question","counter":2051,"qnumday":432,"qnumall":"[24212\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100074#WRV02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if an appeal for supplementary welfare allowance will be expedited in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2052,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 16th   May 2013, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.  <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100074#WRV02200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Numbers","counter":2053,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100074#WRV02250"},{"type":"question","counter":2054,"qnumday":433,"qnumall":"[24217\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100074#WRV02300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons formerly employed in the construction trade categories who are in receipt of unemployment benefit; the breakdown of these people by category; the number currently looking for work; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2055,"content":"<p>The total number of persons in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit at the end of April 2013 was 78,414; of this total, 13,402 had occupations in construction trade categories.

The average growth rate is 3.78 cm per year. The high growth rate confirms the importance of the transitional waters as a productive habitat for eels.<\/p><p>  The surveys provided important data, but estimating silver eel escapement\/production for transitional waters remains extremely challenging.  This is because of the difficulties in obtaining density estimates for eels in large water bodies and quantifying the migratory habits of eels moving upstream into the rivers and\/or leaving the transitional water as silver eel.<\/p><p>  To overcome these challenges a clearer indication of the movement habits of eels in estuaries and expanding knowledge of population density is now required.

Prices in the electricity retail market are fully deregulated and similarly for gas, except in the case of BGE tariffs for domestic consumers.  Customers can therefore avail of competitive offerings from electricity and gas suppliers.  Prices are set by suppliers and are commercial and operational matters for them.  I have no statutory function in the setting of electricity or gas prices.<\/p><p>  With regard to the regulation of gas prices the position is that up until 1 October 2011 the CER regulated Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential and smaller business customers but price regulation for the latter group ended at that point.  The CER still regulates the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential customers.  The timing for complete deregulation of the residential segment of the gas market, as has taken place in the electricity market, is an issue under active review by the CER.<\/p><p>  Electricity and gas costs in Ireland are influenced by various drivers, including global gas and oil prices, the costs of capital, exchange rate fluctuations, the small size of the Irish market, geographical location and low population density.  Global gas and oil prices are by far the most significant factor in the case of Ireland. Prices have risen sharply since the start of 2011 driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan and demand from China and India.  Ireland is at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices which dictate the retail price of electricity.<\/p><p>  At a national level, the competitive energy market in place helps put downward pressure on prices.  In addition, we must focus on all possible additional actions to mitigate costs for business and domestic customers, including rigorous regulatory scrutiny of the network costs component of retail prices.<\/p><p>  I am committed to working with enterprise and with the energy sector to ensure that the costs of energy are as competitive as possible.  In this context, promotion of energy efficiency measures is an area within our control where action can be taken to reduce energy costs.<\/p><p>  Energy efficiency represents a significant opportunity for both businesses and households to reduce their energy costs.  There are energy efficiency measures in place to assist both business and domestic energy consumers, with significant funding allocated to them.  The Energy Efficiency Fund, which I announced in February and which will commence funding specific measures in the near future, will assist energy efficiency projects in the public and commercial sectors.<\/p><p>  Promotion of indigenous sustainable sources of energy will help offset the impact of volatile fossil fuel prices. The Government has a target of 40% of electricity being generated from renewable sources envisaged by 2020. Good progress has been made in meeting this target and its realisation will introduce more certainty in the energy fuel mix as well as boosting security of supply. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100076#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fodder Crisis","counter":2129,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100076#WRX00725"},{"type":"question","counter":2130,"qnumday":460,"qnumall":"[23766\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100076#WRX00800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"in view of the decision taken by the Shannon Airport Authority to allow farming organisations to cut grass on property owned by them to help alleviate fodder shortages in the local area, if he will ask those agencies, companies, authorities, boards and so on who come within his remit to consider similar initiatives on suitable public lands owned by them in conjunction with representatives of local farming organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2131,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that matters relating to property owned or leased by agencies under the aegis of my Department are an operational matter for the individual agency in the first instance and I have no function in this regard.

I have no direct statutory function in relation to connections to the gas network.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2006, the CER approved a new network connections policy which enabled reassessment of the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  This policy was updated in 2011.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.<\/p><p><br \/>  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.  The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Otherwise, uneconomic projects will increase costs for all energy consumers.<\/p><p><br \/>  Having regard to the CER policy on new towns connections, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and more recently Gaslink, have carried out a comprehensive review of towns not connected to the national gas network.  In April 2010, Gaslink published its 'New Towns Analysis Phase 3'<i><\/i>  report.  The study included a review of the feasibility of connecting 11 towns in the West and North West region, including Sligo town.  However, the Gaslink report found that none of the towns qualified for connection on economic grounds.<\/p><p><br \/>  Nevertheless, Gaslink continues to review towns which did not qualify for connection under the Study and other towns on an ongoing basis.  The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, probably resulting from the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.<\/p><p><br \/>  Where, taking account of CER decisions on new towns connections, it is determined that a town qualifies for such a connection, it is then a matter for BGE to determine the optimum funding option, which may include any available EU funding mechanisms, having regard to statutory limits and controls on expenditure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100076#WRX01800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"RTE Expenditure","counter":2146,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100076#WRX01850"},{"type":"question","counter":2147,"qnumday":467,"qnumall":"[24132\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100076#WRX01900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he has any responsibility in relation to the financial situation in RT&Eacute;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2148,"content":"<p>RT&Eacute; is an independent national public service broadcaster whose remit and obligations are set out in Section 114 of the Broadcasting Act 2009.

The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU's target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p><br \/>  During the preparation of Ireland's National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.

Neither of the matters to which Deputy Doherty refers impact upon the considerations which resulted in the Government taking the decision which it did.   It will be recalled that those considerations involved a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights. <\/p><p>  With regard to providing assistance to businesses in relation to this matter, absent legislative intervention, NAMA is playing a role in dealing with problems caused by upward only rent reviews applying to NAMA properties.   I have been advised that, by end-April 2013, the Agency had granted 222 applications for rent abatement with an aggregate annual value of about &euro;14 million which represents the annual value of rent due to NAMA that it has agreed to forego in order to help businesses survive.  A further 52 applications were under review at that date.  Of the 284 eligible applications received only 10 have been refused representing a 96% approval rate by NAMA.   The practice of NAMA in this area is one which I would commend to landlords in the commercial property market and in the retail sector in particular.<\/p><p>  More generally, the importance of supporting the retail sector is widely recognised across a range of Government Departments.   I would draw the attention of Deputy Healy-Rae to the Action Plan for Jobs which lies within the remit of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.

The Equality Tribunal is independent in the exercise of its quasi-judicial function and has jurisdiction to investigate and decide upon complaints of discrimination under the Employment Equality Acts, the Equal Status Acts and the Pensions Acts.  The Equality Tribunal also provides a statutory mediation service.  The Equality Tribunal is one of the front-line services directly affected by the current turbulence in the labour market.  I am informed that the average waiting time for a hearing at the Equality Tribunal is approx. 129 weeks.  However, in cases where the complainant and respondent opt for mediation, a mediation hearing is arranged in less than 3 months of initial lodgement of the complaint.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation believes it is essential that there are efficient and effective mechanisms to develop harmonious and productive workplaces and to assist employers and employees to avoid and resolve disputes.  I understand that Minister Bruton proposes to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure.  This means that from next year two statutorily independent bodies will replace the current five.  There will be a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.  All complaints will be dealt with by a single body of first instance where the aim will be to have a hearing within three months from the time the case is lodged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRAA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fodder Crisis","counter":2301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRAA00625"},{"type":"question","counter":2302,"qnumday":520,"qnumall":"[23772\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRAA00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"in view of the decision taken by the Shannon Airport Authority to allow farming organisations to cut grass on property owned by them to help alleviate fodder shortages in the local area, if he will ask those agencies, companies, authorities, boards and so on who come within his remit to consider similar initiatives on suitable public lands owned by them in conjunction with representatives of local farming organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2303,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that many of the agencies\/associated bodies under the remit of my Department do not have property that would give rise to the benefit that he describes.

All eight reports have been published and are available electronically at <i>www.morristribunal.ie<\/i> and on my Department's website, <i>www.justice.ie<\/i>.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the passage of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act was the main response from Government to implement the recommendations from the Morris Tribunal.  That Act clarified the respective roles and responsibilities of the Minister and the Garda Commissioner and provided for the strengthening of the regulatory framework governing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the establishment of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  I assume that the Deputy is referring to issues arising in the recent report of the Ombudsman Commission into the use of informants by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The first report of the Morris Tribunal recommended that there should be a periodic independent audit of Garda informant handling procedures by an outside authority, with power to make inspections and see documents and to monitor and review the informer management system.  In December 2010 my predecessor as Minister, at the request of the then Garda Commissioner, appointed retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice Thomas Smyth, as the Independent Covert Human Intelligence Sources Oversight Authority.  The functions assigned to Mr. Justice Smyth are to review and monitor the use within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of Covert Human Intelligence Sources; to ensure compliance with the code of practice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the management and use of Covert Human Intelligence Sources; to communicate any matters, he considers appropriate, including recommendations, to the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and report to the Minister at such intervals, being intervals of not more than twelve months, on discharge of his functions.  The most recent report of Mr Justice Smyth, which I have already put in the public domain, stated that he was satisfied than An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were in substantial compliance with the code of practice.  I have indicated that I will publish such reports in the future.  I am satisfied that the recommendations arising from the Morris Tribunal have been addressed in this regard by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware that the GSOC has also submitted recommendations inter alia, with regard to the management of Covert Human Intelligence Sources and these will, of course, be considered fully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRAA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Bodies Accounts","counter":2329,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRAA02525"},{"type":"question","counter":2330,"qnumday":530,"qnumall":"[24005\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRAA02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when he expects the Annual Reports for the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to be published for the years 2011 and 2012; when they will be made available on the JAAB website; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2331,"content":"<p>Section 20A of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 requires the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to report in writing to the Minister on its activities for the previous year no later than six months after the end of each year.

Sections 40(6) and (7) of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 provide for recourse to material relating to, or information of evidence given in, proceedings heard other than in public, for the purposes of a statutory inquiry into professional misconduct.

I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review.  <\/p><p>  In this context of that review, courthouses in Clones and Ballyconnell were identified as venues that should be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case. Through this process the Service has established a general framework within which such venues are being assessed taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The consultation process in relation to the future of Ballyconnell, which included consultation with the judiciary, the Cavan Bar Association, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Prison Service, Probation Service and Cavan County Council, was completed earlier this year and a report was considered by the Building Committee at its meeting on 21st February, 2013.  The Building Committee decided that the closure of Ballyconnell should be recommended to the Courts Service Board. In accordance with the protocol all those who had been consulted previously were informed of the decision of the Building Committee and were invited to make further submissions which would be placed before the Board for consideration. I am informed that no submissions were received and the Board at its meeting on 15th April, 2013 approved the closure of Ballyconnell and the amalgamation of the Ballyconnell District Court area with Cavan District Court area. It is expected that court sittings at Ballyconnell will cease before the end of the year.<\/p><p>  I understand that no decision in relation to the future of Clones courthouse has been taken to date but that the consultation process has been concluded and the views received will be taken into account in the decision making process which, as the Deputy is aware, is a matter for the Courts Service Board under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRBB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":2375,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRBB02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Investigations","counter":2374,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRBB02225"},{"type":"question","counter":2375,"qnumday":551,"qnumall":"[24367\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRBB02300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the steps he has taken with the Lebenese and Palestinian authorities to try and locate the remains of a person (details supplied) who was kidnapped on the 27 April 1981 from an Irish observation post outside the village of Dyar Ntar in South Lebanon.","asker":"1028","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":2376,"qnumday":555,"qnumall":"[24366\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRBB02400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if any progress has been made in case of a person (details supplied) who was kidnapped on the 27 April 1981 from an Irish observation post outside the village of Dyar Ntar in South Lebanon and whose body was never recovered.","asker":"1028","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2377,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 551 and 555 together.  <\/p><p>  Private Kevin Joyce and Private Hugh Doherty were serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), when on 27 April 1981, an observation post manned by them came under attack.

My Department will continue to monitor the situation on a day by day basis.  This remains a very challenging situation for farmers and the extension to 24 May will allow both farmers and Co Ops to have some certainty around the supply of fodder over the coming weeks.  It is also important that while continuing to focus on the emergency fodder position in the short term, farmers should also focus on growing and conserving fodder for next winter's needs. We should be maximising production in the coming period and I have asked Teagasc to prioritise this policy in their advisory campaigns over the summer months.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is clear that the main cut of silage will be delayed this year and as a consequence we need to look at the potential for the growing of additional fodder later into the season.

In response, I have introduced a specific Scheme, the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme, designed to assist towards the transport costs of imported fodder and maintenance of stocking levels. The situation has prompted action by the wider industry and farm bodies, which is very welcome. In keeping the situation under constant review, I decided, given the ongoing shortages in some areas, to extend the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme to 24 May and to double the funding available to &euro;2 million. Simultaneously, my Department&rsquo;s Emergency Welfare System continues to respond to individual emergency situations. The scheme will cover any definite purchases that have been placed by that date but which will not be delivered until the following week.<\/p><p>  Mindful of ongoing difficulties, I also decided that a formal request should again be made to the EU Commission seeking agreement to pay an advance from 16 October of the 2013 Single Farm Payment which, being the first day of the new EU financial year is the earliest potential payment date and almost two months ahead of the standard timeline. It will be recalled that my successful approach to Commissioner Ciolos for agreement to making an advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment was prompted by the very wet weather experienced throughout last summer.<\/p><p>  With specific regard to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the 2013 Scheme, as already announced, is focussed on the protection of the smaller and most disadvantaged. It must also be borne in mind that the minimum stocking density requirement is equivalent to one ewe per eligible forage hectare and cannot in any way be regarded as onerous. It will be recalled that, in response to budgetary realities, it was decided to re-focus the Scheme, with greater consideration been given to those contributing most to achieving the aims of the Scheme, which are:<\/p><p> - Ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of a viable rural society;<\/p><p> - Maintaining the countryside;<\/p><p> - Maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which, in particular, take account of environmental protection requirements. <\/p><p>  Given the restrictions faced by those farming in recognised Disadvantaged Areas and mindful of the aims of the Scheme, as outlined, it will be readily appreciated that appropriate stocking levels are crucial. In this regard, balance must be struck between the need to ensure that at least the minimum is done to ensure the land is adequately utilised and grazed, while at the same time being sufficiently aware of the natural constraints. In this regard, it is clear that the minimum stocking levels currently set under the Scheme achieve this twin objective.  Thus, the terms of the 2013 Scheme remain as previously announced.  Farmers with genuine fodder-related stocking difficulties may avail of the force majeure provisions of the Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRCC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Travel","counter":2431,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRCC02725"},{"type":"question","counter":2432,"qnumday":570,"qnumall":"[23809\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRCC02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will outline in tabular form, the amount of travel and subsistence, both foreign and domestic, claimed individually by each Minister and Minister of State and Secretary General in his Department, for each year in the period 2005 to March 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2433,"content":"<p>The total travel and subsistence expenses claimed by each Minister, Minister of State and Secretary General in my Department for each year from 1 January 2005 to 9 March 2011 is set out in the table.

This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law. I have made it clear to the health insurers that I believe significant savings can be made, the effect of which can be to contain the cost of health insurance premiums. <\/p><p>  Given VHI&rsquo;s very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs.  At my instruction, the VHI recently compiled a detailed cost containment plan, which sets out savings targets for 2013 and for the 2014-2016 period, so as to minimise the need for any future premium increases.

Crosscare National Traveller Suicide Awareness Project has been funded by the NOSP and is working to develop a response to the issue of traveller suicide.

SAGO works closely with the Health Service Executive, the Irish College of General Practitioners and in conjunction with other professional bodies, and, as mentioned previously, has developed treatment algorithms for both adults and children. These algorithm obesity tools are being used nationally in the treatment of adult and childhood obesity.<\/p><p>  Healthy Ireland, a Framework for Improved Health and Well-being, forms the basis of how a whole-of-government and whole of society approach to health and well-being will be delivered. It sets out 64 actions under a number of thematic areas which provide for the development of inter-sectoral and cross government plans to address risk factors and social determinants of health.  It provides a  structured mechanism to engage all different sectors of society to channel measures and actions around individual health and lifestyle  issues, and to measure, monitor and evaluate implementation.<\/p><p>  Healthy Ireland describes supportive mechanisms to ensure effective co-operation between the health sector and other areas of Government and public services concerned with social protection, children, industry, food safety, education, transport, housing, agriculture and the environment. The implementation of Healthy Ireland is now focused on the development of an outcomes framework and a physical activity plan. In this regard  the Health and Well-being Programme in the Department of Health will work closely with relevant policy divisions in the Department of Health and with existing cross-government and cross-sectoral groups, such as SAGO. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRJJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Issues","counter":2764,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRJJ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":2765,"qnumday":681,"qnumall":"[24334\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRJJ01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department has considered providing for improved weight management resources for healthcare workers who have an obesity problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2766,"content":"<p>As this is a Service Matter it has been transferred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRJJ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2767,"content":"<p>Question No. 682 answered with Question No. 680.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Training","counter":2768,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRJJ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":2769,"qnumday":683,"qnumall":"[24336\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRJJ01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he considers it best practice that in all specialist postgraduate exams, obesity and relevant training in behavioural change therapy become essential components, thus enhancing the knowledge and skills of physicians and other professions related to medicine in this important area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2770,"content":"<p>I agree that not only post graduate but also undergraduate programmes would include health and wellbeing components, in keeping with the recommendations in <i>Healthy Ireland a Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing,<\/i>which I recently launched.<i><\/i><\/p><p>The implementation of <i>Healthy Ireland<\/i>  will include the prioritisation of a range of areas across the 64 actions highlighted in the report.

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme. There has been no change to the Government&rsquo;s over-arching commitment to this goal. This Government is the first in the history of this State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. <\/p><p>  Having examined the progress made in the universal GP care plan, it became clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic for a short-term arrangement. Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness. The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public. This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions. As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition. While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. <\/p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the delay in the initial step of the roll-out of the universal GP service. In doing so, it has considered the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay. <\/p><p>  No decision has been taken by the Cabinet Committee or by Government on changing the first step of the plan to extend GP care without fees to persons with chronic illnesses. Instead, it has been agreed that we should prepare and set out a number of alternative options with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  Minister Reilly and I expect to report back to the Cabinet Committee in the near future. As part of this work, consideration will be given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation this universal health service.  <\/p><p>  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources in the two most recent Budgets. The HSE Vote now contains funding of &euro;30 million for this year for an initial phase of the provision of GP services as part of this Programme for Government commitment.<\/p><p>  To conclude, far from abandoning its commitment to universal GP care, this Government is determined to expedite the implementation of a national GP service for the entire population, something to which no previous Government has ever aspired. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRJJ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":2793,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRJJ03150"},{"type":"question","counter":2794,"qnumday":690,"qnumall":"[24372\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRJJ03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the acute medicine programme defined model applicable to Monaghan Hospital; the additional services that he anticipates will be located at the Monaghan hospital site under the terms of the now published framework for the development of small hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2795,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRJJ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":2796,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRJJ03350"},{"type":"question","counter":2797,"qnumday":691,"qnumall":"[24470\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRJJ03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there is a consultant paediatric urologist for children with spina bifida in Temple Street Hospital, Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2798,"qnumday":692,"qnumall":"[24471\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100079#WRJJ03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive will consider giving priority to the appointment of a research nurse for spina bifida at Temple Street Hospital, Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2799,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 691 and 692 together.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Children's University Hospital, Temple Street is the national tertiary care centre for spina bifida and hydrocephalus.

Under Section 19 of the Bill the NTA is provided with powers to make regulations concerning taxi drivers' hours. <\/p><p>  However, this is a complex legal area and it is my intention that the Bill puts in place a provision that is balanced and proportionate having regard to the rights of\u00a0individuals relating to privacy and to earn a livelihood.

Following consultation with Met Eireann, Co Ops, the farming organisations, Teagasc<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>and the advice of officials working on the ground, the decision was taken to allow a further two weeks for fodder to be imported into the country with a doubling of the transport subsidy fund.  Fodder, eligible under the scheme and delivered into the country will be covered up to next Friday 24 May. I have also decided, as an exceptional measure, that any definite purchases that have been placed by that date, but which will be delivered during the following week, will be included under the scheme.<\/p><p><br \/>  To date some 2,000 loads of imported fodder, amounting to about 30,000 tonnes, have benefited from my Department's contribution to these transport costs.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation on a day by day basis.  This remains a very challenging situation for farmers and the extension to 24 May will allow both farmers and Co Ops to have some certainty around the supply of fodder over the coming weeks.  It is also important that while continuing to focus on the emergency fodder position in the short term, farmers should also focus on growing and conserving fodder for next winter's needs. We should be maximising production in the coming period and I have asked Teagasc to prioritise this policy in their advisory campaigns over the summer months.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is clear that the main cut of silage will be delayed this year and as a consequence we need to look at the potential for the growing of additional fodder later into the season.

In response, I have introduced a specific Scheme, the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme, designed to assist towards the transport costs of imported fodder and maintenance of stocking levels. The situation has prompted action by the wider industry and farm bodies, which is very welcome. In keeping the situation under constant review, I decided, given the ongoing shortages in some areas, to extend the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme to 24 May and to double the funding available to &euro;2 million. Simultaneously, my Department&rsquo;s Emergency Welfare System continues to respond to individual emergency situations. The scheme will cover any definite purchases that have been placed by that date but which will not be delivered until the following week.<\/p><p>  Mindful of ongoing difficulties, I also decided that a formal request should again be made to the EU Commission seeking agreement to pay an advance from 16 October of the 2013 Single Farm Payment which, being the first day of the new EU financial year is the earliest potential payment date and almost two months ahead of the standard timeline. It will be recalled that my successful approach to Commissioner Ciolos for agreement to making an advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment was prompted by the very wet weather experienced throughout last summer.<\/p><p>  With specific regard to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the 2013 Scheme, as already announced, is focussed on the protection of the smaller and most disadvantaged. It must also be borne in mind that the minimum stocking density requirement is equivalent to one ewe per eligible forage hectare and cannot in any way be regarded as onerous. It will be recalled that, in response to budgetary realities, it was decided to re-focus the Scheme, with greater consideration been given to those contributing most to achieving the aims of the Scheme, which are:<\/p><p> - Ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of a viable rural society;<\/p><p> - Maintaining the countryside;<\/p><p> - Maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which, in particular, take account of environmental protection requirements. <\/p><p>  Given the restrictions faced by those farming in recognised Disadvantaged Areas and mindful of the aims of the Scheme, as outlined, it will be readily appreciated that appropriate stocking levels are crucial. In this regard, balance must be struck between the need to ensure that at least the minimum is done to ensure the land is adequately utilised and grazed, while at the same time being sufficiently aware of the natural constraints. In this regard, it is clear that the minimum stocking levels currently set under the Scheme achieve this twin objective.  Thus, the terms of the 2013 Scheme remain as previously announced.  Farmers with genuine fodder-related stocking difficulties may avail of the force majeure provisions of the Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100081#WRCC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Travel","counter":2974,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100081#WRCC02725"},{"type":"question","counter":2975,"qnumday":570,"qnumall":"[23809\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100081#WRCC02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will outline in tabular form, the amount of travel and subsistence, both foreign and domestic, claimed individually by each Minister and Minister of State and Secretary General in his Department, for each year in the period 2005 to March 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2976,"content":"<p>The total travel and subsistence expenses claimed by each Minister, Minister of State and Secretary General in my Department for each year from 1 January 2005 to 9 March 2011 is set out in the table.

This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law. I have made it clear to the health insurers that I believe significant savings can be made, the effect of which can be to contain the cost of health insurance premiums. <\/p><p>  Given VHI&rsquo;s very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs.  At my instruction, the VHI recently compiled a detailed cost containment plan, which sets out savings targets for 2013 and for the 2014-2016 period, so as to minimise the need for any future premium increases.

Crosscare National Traveller Suicide Awareness Project has been funded by the NOSP and is working to develop a response to the issue of traveller suicide.

SAGO works closely with the Health Service Executive, the Irish College of General Practitioners and in conjunction with other professional bodies, and, as mentioned previously, has developed treatment algorithms for both adults and children. These algorithm obesity tools are being used nationally in the treatment of adult and childhood obesity.<\/p><p>  Healthy Ireland, a Framework for Improved Health and Well-being, forms the basis of how a whole-of-government and whole of society approach to health and well-being will be delivered. It sets out 64 actions under a number of thematic areas which provide for the development of inter-sectoral and cross government plans to address risk factors and social determinants of health.  It provides a  structured mechanism to engage all different sectors of society to channel measures and actions around individual health and lifestyle  issues, and to measure, monitor and evaluate implementation.<\/p><p>  Healthy Ireland describes supportive mechanisms to ensure effective co-operation between the health sector and other areas of Government and public services concerned with social protection, children, industry, food safety, education, transport, housing, agriculture and the environment. The implementation of Healthy Ireland is now focused on the development of an outcomes framework and a physical activity plan. In this regard  the Health and Well-being Programme in the Department of Health will work closely with relevant policy divisions in the Department of Health and with existing cross-government and cross-sectoral groups, such as SAGO. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100087#WRJJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Issues","counter":3307,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100087#WRJJ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":3308,"qnumday":681,"qnumall":"[24334\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100087#WRJJ01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department has considered providing for improved weight management resources for healthcare workers who have an obesity problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3309,"content":"<p>As this is a Service Matter it has been transferred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100087#WRJJ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3310,"content":"<p>Question No. 682 answered with Question No. 680.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Training","counter":3311,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100087#WRJJ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":3312,"qnumday":683,"qnumall":"[24336\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100087#WRJJ01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he considers it best practice that in all specialist postgraduate exams, obesity and relevant training in behavioural change therapy become essential components, thus enhancing the knowledge and skills of physicians and other professions related to medicine in this important area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3313,"content":"<p>I agree that not only post graduate but also undergraduate programmes would include health and wellbeing components, in keeping with the recommendations in <i>Healthy Ireland a Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing,<\/i>which I recently launched.<i><\/i><\/p><p>The implementation of <i>Healthy Ireland<\/i>  will include the prioritisation of a range of areas across the 64 actions highlighted in the report.

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme. There has been no change to the Government&rsquo;s over-arching commitment to this goal. This Government is the first in the history of this State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. <\/p><p>  Having examined the progress made in the universal GP care plan, it became clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic for a short-term arrangement. Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness. The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public. This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions. As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition. While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. <\/p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the delay in the initial step of the roll-out of the universal GP service. In doing so, it has considered the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay. <\/p><p>  No decision has been taken by the Cabinet Committee or by Government on changing the first step of the plan to extend GP care without fees to persons with chronic illnesses. Instead, it has been agreed that we should prepare and set out a number of alternative options with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  Minister Reilly and I expect to report back to the Cabinet Committee in the near future. As part of this work, consideration will be given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation this universal health service.  <\/p><p>  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources in the two most recent Budgets. The HSE Vote now contains funding of &euro;30 million for this year for an initial phase of the provision of GP services as part of this Programme for Government commitment.<\/p><p>  To conclude, far from abandoning its commitment to universal GP care, this Government is determined to expedite the implementation of a national GP service for the entire population, something to which no previous Government has ever aspired. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100087#WRJJ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":3336,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100087#WRJJ03150"},{"type":"question","counter":3337,"qnumday":690,"qnumall":"[24372\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100087#WRJJ03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the acute medicine programme defined model applicable to Monaghan Hospital; the additional services that he anticipates will be located at the Monaghan hospital site under the terms of the now published framework for the development of small hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3338,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100087#WRJJ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":3339,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100087#WRJJ03350"},{"type":"question","counter":3340,"qnumday":691,"qnumall":"[24470\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100087#WRJJ03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there is a consultant paediatric urologist for children with spina bifida in Temple Street Hospital, Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3341,"qnumday":692,"qnumall":"[24471\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052100087#WRJJ03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive will consider giving priority to the appointment of a research nurse for spina bifida at Temple Street Hospital, Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3342,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 691 and 692 together.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Children's University Hospital, Temple Street is the national tertiary care centre for spina bifida and hydrocephalus.

Section 11 of the Taxi Regulation Bill 2012\u00a0places an obligation on an applicant for or holder of an SPSV licence to inform the National Transport Authority (NTA) of any other occupation that involves driving. Under Section 19 of the Bill the NTA is provided with powers to make regulations concerning taxi drivers' hours. <\/p><p>  However, this is a complex legal area and it is my intention that the Bill puts in place a provision that is balanced and proportionate having regard to the rights of\u00a0individuals relating to privacy and to earn a livelihood.
