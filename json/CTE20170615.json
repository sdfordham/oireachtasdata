Apologies have been received from Deputy Niall Collins.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and her officials.  I thank her for facilitating the taking of Committee Stage of the Bill today as originally scheduled.  It is appreciated.  Before we begin our consideration of the Bill, on behalf of the committee and all of its members, I congratulate her on her new appointment.  We wish her well and look forward to working with her in the future.  I also thank the former Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, for her contribution and work with the committee.  I wish her well in her new role.<\/p> <p>  I ask members to ensure their mobile phones are switched off or left in airplane mode for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting of the proceedings, even when left in silent mode.<\/p> <p>  No amendments have been tabled to the Bill and it is intended to conclude Committee Stage today.

Its work in the area of jobs, enterprise and innovation is extremely important.  I am very excited to have been appointed Minister and very much look forward to working with the Chairman and members.<\/p> <p>  Section 2 provides for amendments to section 1 of the Hallmarking Act 1981 by amending the definition of \"articles of precious metal\" to add palladium and mixed precious metals and including a definition to cover hallmarking in assay offices outside of the State, as well as a definition of \"forged hallmark\".  I intend to submit an amendment on Report Stage to add \"mixed articles of a precious and non-precious metal\" to the definitions in the Act.  This is being done on foot of requests to include such articles to ensure the precious metal part of such articles will be properly hallmarked and that the non-precious metal will be clearly visible and marked also.  Given the technical nature of the Bill, such an amendment will result in consequential amendments to other sections, including sections 3 and 12.  I inform the committee that these amendments will also be submitted on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2017061500002#A00600","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1497531600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1497531600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>SECTION 3<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1497531600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 3 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1497531600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The Minister has stated she will table an amendment to this section on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2017061500002#A01000","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1497531600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Will amendments be made to sections 2 and 3 or section 3 only?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2017061500002#A01100","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1497531600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I believe amendments will be made to sections 2, 3 and 12.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2017061500002#A01200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1497531600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2017061500002#A01300","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1497531600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Are all of the amendments linked with each other?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2017061500002#A01400","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1497531600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>They are technical because of the technical nature of the Bill.

I have considered the Bill in detail and spoken to members of Retail Jewellers of Ireland, all of whom are very happy with the Bill which is essential.  There are gold and silver and different levels of fineness such as nine-carat and 18-carat gold, but the new metal palladium which is used mostly in men's wedding rings has not yet been recognised in legislation.

Regarding the issue of sponsors' marks, provisions had been made in the Bill, in section 10(a)(ii), to transfer the approval of sponsors' marks from the assay master to the Company of Goldsmiths, the body under which the Assay Office operates.  Since the Bill was published, it is now considered to be more preferable to delete this provision to ensure there are no possible governance issues and that the Assay Office and the assay master will maintain their independence from the Company of Goldsmiths in this matter.
