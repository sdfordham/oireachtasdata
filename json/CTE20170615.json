I would like to pick up on Deputy Catherine Connolly's important point about the deterioration of buildings that are lying idle.  A former primary school in Trim, County Meath has been transferred to the Department of Education and Skills, but nothing is happening.  The property is to be used by the education and training board for the Educate Together school in Trim which is operating from a golf club four miles outside the town.  I have raised the issue in the D&aacute;il with the Minister for Education and Skills.  It has now been discovered that the cost of fitting out the school exceeds what it was thought it would be.  The children are staying in the golf club on the Kildalkey Road.  Deputy Catherine Connolly's point is extremely well made.  There is no point in having a scenario in which property deteriorates before it is transferred to the extent that it is worth absolutely nothing to anybody.  The building control unit in the Department that analyses these properties does not provide a proper costing of what is required to make schools habitable for children when they are transferred.  One part of the Department is not speaking to another.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017061500002#B02500","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1497513600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>That is quite obvious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017061500002#B02600","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1497513600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>It is scandalous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017061500002#B02700","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1497513600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>We will ask for the dates on which it is proposed to transfer the properties and information on whether they are occupied and their status.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017061500002#B02800","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1497513600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>The National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is one that might be in use.

I think we dealt with the matter yesterday and will deal with it again next Tuesday.<\/p> <p>  No. 565B is correspondence, dated 7 June 2017, from Mr. Ed Sibley, director of credit institution supervision in the Central Bank, in response to the committee's request for further information on the bank's review of certain allegations about an Irish credit institution that was referred to in email correspondence on 27 September 2016 and to queries regarding Bank of Ireland collateral arrangements.

It is noted.<\/p><p> No. 574B, is correspondence, dated 8 June 2017, from the same Patrick O'Shea, President of UCC, and Catherine Day, chairperson of the UCC governing body, in relation to UCC's acquisition of the Irish Management Institute and the \"Morning Ireland\" programme on 26 May 2017.  This is noted.

This is noted. <\/p><p> No. 588B, is correspondence, dated 14 June 2017, from the Health Service Executive, HSE, with clarification points on the Grace case.  This will be covered in the first part of our meeting today.<\/p><p> Category C is correspondence from or relating to private individuals and any other correspondence.  No. 529C is carried over from the meeting on 1 June 2017, also Nos. 556C, dated 31 May 2017, from Deputy Catherine Murphy and 572C, dated 25 May 2017.<\/p><p> There is correspondence, dated 11 May 2017, from an individual regarding matters relating to a protected disclosure to the Irish Prison Service.  The individual has indicated he has received an apology from the director general of the Irish Prison Service.  He made a recommendation to the Irish Prison Service to appoint a protected disclosures manager and has asked the committee to support his recommendation, to support persons making protected disclosures, and to summon the director general of the Irish Prison Service to explain why it would appoint a judge to conduct a review and then ignore the judge&rsquo;s findings.  We will probably have to consider this again, but for the time being I propose we request a response from the Irish Prison Service regarding the recommendation to appoint a protected disclosures manager.  I request an update from the Irish Prison Service regarding the implementation of the review mentioned, and we might return to this.  I presume many members of the committee are receiving correspondence from this individual.  I certainly have.  Some of the allegations are very serious.  We will ask for an update on these two matters and will follow up on them later.  It is worthy of our attention. <\/p><p> No. 549C is correspondence, dated 29 May 2017, from an individual writing on behalf of a children and youth action based group in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city regarding the use of public funds for youth services in the area.  The group wrote to Deputy McDonald in 2015.  This is a policy matter not within the remit of the committee and I propose the correspondence be referred to the relevant sectoral committee, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> No. 550C is correspondence, dated 28 May 2017, addressed to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and copied to the committee concerning a letter sent to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, responsible for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, regarding an audit of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, in 2016.  We will note that. <\/p><p> No. 551C is correspondence, dated 26 May 2017, from an individual making comments relating to greed and a lack of accountability in the public sector.  That is noted.<\/p><p> No. 552C is correspondence, dated 30 May 2017, from an individual relating to procurement processes in respect of the Eircode system.  The letter alleges the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and the Environment was misled by An Post.  An Post is not within the remit of this committee so I propose we refer this correspondence to the communications committee which may wish to proceed and consider the matter further.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> No. 557C is correspondence, dated 31 May 2017, from Deputy Catherine Murphy enclosing an email from an individual regarding the appointment process for a coroner in south and east Kerry.  The appointment of coroners is the responsibility of local authorities, but I propose to refer the matter to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for a response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The individual obviously had a grievance about the process.<\/p><p> No. 559C is correspondence, dated 29 May 2017, from the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform providing an update about a minute of the Minister following publication of a review of the Courts Service Spectrum growth fund.  The matter is more relevant to the Courts Service which will be before the committee on 13 July.  I suggest we make the Courts Service aware that this matter will be discussed on the day.  We will also send a copy to the individual who raised the matter.  This is noted.<\/p><p> No. 564C is correspondence, dated 6 June 2017, from the whistleblower in the Grace case who met the committee on 25 May 2017, enclosing a note about the matters discussed at that meeting. This is noted.  A further note was received very late last night.  Members will need time to consider the latest item, and if there are matters arising that we need to put to the HSE, we will put them in writing based on the letter we received.  It is a fairly detailed letter and we certainly need time to consider it.  I presume people will raise elements of it here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017061500002#B04300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497513600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>It has relevance to today's meeting.

Mr. O'Brien said in his response that if RTE had made a more comprehensive request in respect of local interaction between the HSE and the Garda at the time, then the response RTE would have received would have been different.  It seems that RTE did make such a request but that the HSE wrote back to RTE stating that the broadcaster had to limit the scope of the questions.  Is Mr. O'Brien aware of that?

As Deputy Connolly said, three specific items are being addressed in terms of the clarification that has been provided by the HSE.  However, in our discussions this morning, we must remember that these are three specific items concerning the care of a human being.  That sometimes gets forgotten in the context of these debates.  I must say at the outset that this committee by its very nature is not one given to emotion, as can be seen at this or any other meeting, but the passion of the whistleblower when she addressed us last month is something that should have been heard by Mr. O'Brien.  Indeed, I would have loved all senior managers in Departments to have heard her.  Despite all the adverse circumstances she faced, she showed no bitterness but instead showed resilience and professional determination.  She reminded all of us that the person in question, Grace, feels loved and knows love.  That is sometimes forgotten when we are discussing facts, figures, underpayments and so forth.  I just wanted to put that on the record.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to that funding issue, which is the first point on the correspondence.  It is a simple question as to whether there had been underfunding or a cut to the funding of the service provider since 2010, but it is amazing how long it took to get to an acknowledgement of that fact from the HSE.  Even at that, the language used is not precise.  The HSE refers to an acknowledgement that the funding was \"not sufficient\".  It does not refer to a cut or to underfunding.

Exchequer funding represents the largest source of income for the HSE and amounted to &euro;13.5 billion in 2016.  Changes introduced by the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014 required the HSE to deliver services within the grant funding allocated to it annually by the Oireachtas.  A deficit in 2015 of &euro;7.9 million was brought forward and met from the 2016 Exchequer grant funding.  The HSE incurred an operating deficit of &euro;10.3 million in 2016 which, likewise, was carried forward and met from its 2017 Exchequer grant allocation.  Income from patient charges in hospitals accounted for approximately 3% or &euro;450 million of the HSE&rsquo;s total income in 2016.  Three quarters of the total, &euro;335 million, was derived from charges imposed on private patients in HSE hospitals and other care settings.  Other income totalling &euro;611 million includes employee pension contributions and pension related deductions from staff salaries which the HSE retains.<\/p><p> As shown in Figure 2, the HSE incurred expenditure totalling &euro;14.58 billion in 2016.  Approximately 80% of this expenditure was spread across three main areas.  HSE pay and pensions accounted for just over one third of the expenditure totalling &euro;5.1 billion; grants to section 38 and section 39 agencies accounted for just over one quarter, or &euro;3.8 billion, of the expenditure, while expenditure on primary care and medical card schemes accounted for one fifth, or just under &euro;3 billion, of the expenditure.  The HSE enters service arrangements with a wide range of service providers under sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004.  Agencies funded in this manner vary in scale and complexity, ranging from large acute hospitals to local community-based organisations providing personal social care services.  The audit report on the 2016 financial statements drew attention to weaknesses acknowledged by the HSE in its oversight and monitoring of grants to these agencies.  The statement on internal financial control discloses that 2016 service arrangements and grant aid agreements with a number of agencies had not been put in place by the end of April 2016; evidence of regular monitoring meetings and review of periodic financial reporting was not documented on file; there was no evidence in a number of cases of the receipt of funded agencies' annual audited financial statements and-or their review by the HSE, and that a number of funded agencies had not complied with public procurement guidelines or public sector pay policies.  <\/p><p> The audit report on both sets of financial statements drew attention to a significant level of non-competitive procurement by the HSE.  This is consistent with our audit findings in earlier years, on which I reported previously.  We examined a sample of procurements worth &euro;30.8 million in five HSE operating units in 2016 and found a lack of evidence of competitive procurement processes in relation to 49% by value of the sample.  Similarly, an examination of a sample of procurements worth &euro;29.6 million in five HSE units in 2015 found a lack of evidence of competitive procurement in relation to 30% by value.  The HSE&rsquo;s statement on internal financial control outlines the steps being taken to deal with these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017061500002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1497513600,"counter":526,"content":"<p>Deputy Sean Fleming took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1497513600,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and now invite Mr. O'Brien to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017061500002#R00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497513600,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend to discuss the HSE's annual financial statements for 2015 and 2016.  I am accompanied by Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer and interim deputy director general; Ms. Mairead Dolan, assistant chief financial officer, finance division; and Mr. Ray Mitchell in his usual role.  As we submitted information and documentation to the committee in advance of the meeting, I will confine my opening remarks to the following issues.  <\/p> <p>  On the financial outturn for 2016, following discussions which commenced in May 2016, a Revised Health Estimate was approved by the Oireachtas on 7 July, with an additional &euro;500 million notified to the HSE as part of the revision.  This represented a significant commitment to ensuring health and social care services would be placed on a more sustainable financial footing for 2016 and marked a move away from the practice of allocating supplementary funding at year end.  The annual financial statements for 2016 reported a combined, revenue and capital, income and expenditure, surplus of &euro;12.4 million before the impact of the first charge mechanism.  The result after the first charge related to 2015 was a combined surplus of &euro;4.7 million.<\/p> <p>  On the financial outturn for 2015, the 2015 annual financial statements reported a combined, revenue and capital, income and expenditure, deficit of &euro;7.7 million, which, under the principles of first charge, was reflected in the financial statements for 2016.  This was after a total of &euro;649 million had been provided in supplementary funding for the financial year 2015.  It included &euro;212 million in net Supplementary Estimates for the HSE in respect of projected deficits in areas within its direct control which were reflective of financial performance challenges related primarily to cost pressures within acute hospitals and disability services and &euro;437 million for overruns in respect of the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, pensions and the States Claims Agency, as well additional funding for new initiatives approved after the HSE national service plan was finalised such as waiting list and winter planning initiatives.  The &euro;437 million represents approximately two thirds of the total supplementary funding for 2015 and does not reflect any adverse financial performance by the HSE.  <\/p> <p>  To put the HSE's financial performance in recent years in context, looking back over the nine years from 2008 to 2016, there has been &euro;500 million in net Supplementary Estimates for the HSE for areas within its direct control which are reflective of financial performance challenges.  This equates to 0.46% of the total original net Vote over the period of &euro;108.512 billion.  Also, there was &euro;791 million in Supplementary Estimates to the HSE for the PCRS for medical cards, GP fees, drugs and other demand-led schemes, including the dental treatment services scheme.  This equates to 0.73% of the total original net Vote of &euro;108.512 billion over the period.  There was &euro;1,948 million in Supplementary Estimates to the HSE for Exchequer related and other items outside the control of the HSE.  This equates to 1.8% of the total original net Vote over the period.  Further details for the years 2008 to 2016, inclusive, have been provided in the briefing submitted.<\/p> <p>  On non-compliant procurement, the scale and complexity of the HSE's overall procurement activity are such that it will take a sustained focus for a number of years to ensure high levels of compliance.  This is a key focus for the HSE.  It continues to progress a number of initiatives which are organised around three key themes: supporting infrastructure, including training, improving data analytics, etc.; sourcing - putting in place additional contracts and frameworks; and compliance - supporting services to move towards compliance with contracts and frameworks.<\/p><p>Further details in respect of the steps being taken to address the issue of non-compliant procurement are contained in the statement of internal financial control within the 2016 annual financial statements.<\/p><p> In the context of monitoring and oversight of grants to outside agencies in 2016, just under &euro;3.8 billion of the HSE's total expenditure related to grants to over 2,000 outside agencies.  These range from the large voluntary hospitals and disability organisations to small local community-based agencies.  Weaknesses in the monitoring and oversight of these grants to outside agencies have been identified.<\/p><p> The HSE continues to progress the necessary medium to long-term actions to address these weaknesses.  Those actions are co-ordinated nationally by the HSE compliance unit established in 2014.  This unit is supporting the development of improved grant oversight by our community health care organisations and hospital groups.  This improved oversight is intended to raise the level of compliance by grant-funded agencies within the HSE&rsquo;s governance framework.  An example of the actions already taken is the external review of governance arrangements in respect of all section 38 providers.  That review is under way.<\/p><p> Further detail regarding the steps being taken to address the issue of weaknesses in the monitoring and oversight of grants to outside agencies are published in the statement of internal financial control within the 2016 annual financial statements.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's reporting is, therefore, timely and will assist the HSE in managing these key areas of focus.

This is derived from looking at the sample.  The significant difference between those two figures is that when the 2015 audit was done, our national agency contract was still live.

I thank them for their presence.  Earlier, Mr. O'Brien rightly said that he could not be expected to be across the detail of what is happening in every hospital and I would not expect him to be.  Luckily for me, I do know the detail concerning University Hospital Waterford.<\/p><p>I put down parliamentary questions almost every week to keep myself acquainted with what is happening there.  I want to use the examples of what is happening in Waterford, because I am familiar with them, in order to frame questions which have a national implication.  I will start with the outsourcing of patients, whereby patients who are on waiting lists in certain hospitals are outsourced to other hospitals because capacity simply is not there in the original hospitals.  One of the responses I got back to a parliamentary question on outsourcing in University Hospital Waterford was that, in 2013, the total number of patients who were outsourced - this refers to OPD patients - was 3,085.  That had increased to 6,203 by 2015 and, in fact, has gone up again in 2016.  That is a 100% increase in the number of patients who are being outsourced.<\/p><p> First, has the HSE done an analysis of whether it costs more to outsource patients in the first instance?  There would certainly be a cost that is not being taken into account by the patient who will have to travel and incur costs, but is there a greater cost to the organisation?  Second, when patients are outsourced, how is that paid for?  Is it paid for by the hospital that refers the patient or by the hospital that provides the treatment?  Let us bear in mind that many of these patients are outsourced to private facilities in different parts of the State, including the Mater Private in Cork, St. Francis Private Hospital, Beacon Hospital in Sandyford, Barringtons Hospital, Aut Even Hospital and Whitfield Clinic.  Most of the outsourcing, including of many patients in my area, has been done to private hospitals so my question is obvious.  Has the HSE done any analysis of its cost effectiveness?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017061500002#U04400","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497513600,"counter":665,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the thoughtful and informed question.  The practice of treating patients elsewhere, other than in the primary hospital, is often generally referred to as outsourcing.  We tend to use that term only for transfer into the private sector but I know that, locally, they think of outsourcing even if patients go to another public hospital.  I think the figures used by the Deputy encompass both.<\/p> <p>  Where we have capacity to meet an unmet need in one hospital in another hospital, we regard it as good practice to utilise the resources of the second hospital.  For example, recently there would have been a significant shift of provision of service in orthopaedics from Waterford to Cappagh in order to deal with a long-term waiting list issue and, more recently again, in the cardiac area, Cork University Hospital has been addressing the needs of some long waiters as well.  That is clearly an increasingly efficient use of the public resource and is always beneficial both to the patients and to the system.<\/p> <p>  Where there is what we essentially regard as outsourcing, which is to the private sector, that is always done on the basis of an appropriately procured service and best value for money is obtained.  Most importantly, the driver is to ensure that patients who are in need of outpatient assessment, and-or inpatient or day-case treatment they would not otherwise get in a timely way, do get it.

Again, I want to stick with examples from University Hospital Waterford as I am familiar with it.<\/p><p>To ensure Mr. O'Brien was not blindsided, I signalled before the meeting that I would be putting this issue to him.  I am trying to understand the relationship between policy, which he is not here to answer for as it is an issue for the Minister, operational matters and costs of funding.  I have been following the process of the deployment of a mobile cath lab to treat cardiac patients at University Hospital Waterford for some time and am still unable to understand it.  My understanding is that an announcement was made by the Minister in January that this would happen.  A couple of weeks later, a business case was developed by the hospital management and sent to the South\/South West hospital group.  The group then sent it in January to the HSE, the Department or both.  Four months later, nothing had happened and no decision had been made.  At the time that the business model was developed, 580 patients were awaiting cardiac procedures at University Hospital Waterford.  The hospital then entered into a service level agreement with hospitals in Cork and 380 of those patients are now being seen in Cork University Hospital, CUH, and a private hospital in Cork.  If Mr. O'Brien will bear with me, I want to understand the process.  At the time when the mobile cath lab was needed most, when the business case was made and the demand was greater, no decision was made.  Even though it seems the Minister had made the decision, the hospital was not given approval to go to the procurement stage.  The hospital has today stated it will be given that approval next week and that will then involve a procurement process.  I am trying to understand the relationship between policy and decision making.  Mr. O'Brien can correct me if I am wrong in my understanding.  If the Minister were to make a policy decision that the deployment of a mobile cath lab could be one of several options used to reduce cardiac care, would it then be up to the HSE and the Department to make an operational decision as to whether that is necessary at any given time?  Can Mr. O'Brien explain the decision-making process and who is responsible for what?  I want to ask about procurement also.  That is the real reason I am asking this but we will come to that presently.

Since that time, the Minister identified as a policy priority, as he is entitled to, that that capacity should become equalised.  In order to do so, we have commenced the process of recruiting additional staff to enable the hours of operation of the existing cardiac cath lab to be extended.  In view of some of the issues we discussed earlier in terms of agency staff and recruitment, that is likely to be a longish process.  The practical way in which capacity can be increased in the meantime is by bringing on site a private provider to provide staff and a temporary additional cardiac cath lab.  As I said, this has been identified as a ministerial priority.  At group level, there has been an effort to deal with the backlog through facilitating patients to travel to CUH, as Deputy Cullinane described.  As he has agreed, a significant number of patients have been treated who otherwise would not yet have received their treatment.  As a result of that, a procurement process, which I will not talk about until the Deputy has asked his questions, will soon commence to give effect to the provision of a temporary deployment of a mobile staffed cardiac catheterisation laboratory for a brief period at University Hospital Waterford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017061500002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1497513600,"counter":691,"content":"<p>What will that procurement process involve?

Some of this has been in the news recently with regard to what happens when people present through accident and emergency departments.  I had cause to write to the Minister six weeks ago and I received a reply from the Department of Health last week, dated 31 May.  I have a general question, but I want to set the scene in this regard.  The case describes how the situation has evolved.  A person presented to me, and I am using it as an example.  I documented the example and went to the Minister for Health.  This person presented at an accident and emergency department.  Someone followed the person around with a clipboard asking whether the person had health insurance.  It got to the point where a medic had to be called because the person's blood pressure became a problem.  The person documented to me the follow-up, including after leaving the hospital.  To be perfectly honest, I was alarmed at the behaviour.  The reply I received detailed that operational procedures are managed by the HSE, which has no centrally held policy to direct individual hospitals on the completion and signing of private health insurance forms.  It stated individual hospitals may have developed their own standard operating procedures in respect of the completion and signing of the forms, but this information is not collated, nor held centrally, by the HSE.  The reply stated it is considered that the application of these operational procedures should be sensitive to the health status of patients while in hospital.  We can see why this would be the response.  It also stated the HSE has been asked to investigate this particular case and come back to me.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, individual hospitals are looking at their own budgets, and if there is going to be a shortfall, a more aggressive approach may well be taken in respect of this.  In the case I documented, the person's health was compromised by the approach made at a very vulnerable point.  Is the HSE developing central procedures on this?  What pressure, if any, is the HSE putting on hospitals to come up with specific incomes through private health insurance in respect of this particular aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017061500002#Z00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497513600,"counter":785,"content":"<p>To speak in generality, all our staff involved in this process, particularly in dealing with people coming through emergency departments, often work in very difficult circumstances.  It is also a very difficult time for the individual patients and their families.  Most of our staff are always doing their absolute best.  We could not and do not condone any situation where a patient would be harassed, and it is regrettable if anyone perceived they were, so that needs to be investigated and followed up.  That said, our general policy in terms of interacting with patients would not allow for that.  It does not require necessarily a separate specific policy when we are speaking to them about insurance matters.  If that incident occurred, it will be investigated.  It should not have happened.  We suggest it is not the norm and is not what our staff come to work to do every day.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the budget, I remind people the charges we are speaking about were introduced under 2013 legislation.  This means they are legal embodiments of policy.  We are obliged to raise them.  The funding of the health service assumes we raise them.

The figure is an estimate.  Part of the reason it has gone up by &euro;400 million is that there has been a change in the rate of return included in the actuarial assessment from 3% to 1%.  Effectively, we are back to the discount rate being applied to actuarial assumptions.  It is the same argument in pension liabilities being estimated.  There can be a lot of fluctuations, depending on the assumptions used.  Part of the concern is that if one were to make provision for all of these things, there would be major jumps from year to year that could be very significant.  Even in an account as big as the HSE's, it can distort the financial performance in the year.

If it was felt services would be provided throughout the lifetime of the person damaged, that might well change the approach to being litigious in having to provide for the person cncerned.

We are working with the State Claims Agency to take a different approach, particularly the issue to which the Deputy refers, the catastrophic birth injury which typically gives rise to some of the largest settlements.  Historically and, to some extent, currently, part of the valuation of a claim is about the services to be provided following the catastrophic incident and their adequacy.  Through our primary care and disability services divisions and in discussions with the State Claims Agency, we are working to become increasingly proactive in addressing these health care needs, notwithstanding the fact that there may be the prospect of litigation or it is in train.  Fundamentally, irrespective of litigation, we are the health and social care service of the State and need to be proactive in meeting these health care needs, however they arose.  There is a view that our role and that of the State Claims Agency will be influenced by this, but most importantly, it can make the consequences of an adverse event less traumatising than they might otherwise be by building a better relationship between the local health service and the parents who suffered the event.  I have to admit and acknowledge do so freely that historically it has not been the hallmark of the way things have been done and that this has led to very long running, long outstanding high value claims by people who have suffered not only the consequences of an adverse event but also a damaged relationship with the health care system in the interim.<\/p> <p>  On the small print, it is my understanding we have not formally gone to print.

It is a case of going from something very big to something very small, taking into account the manner of how the HSE impacts across so many aspects of our lives.  It is important to note as well that HSE expenditure does not just relate to primary medical care but also to the school completion programme, which in the case I mentioned will hopefully keep troubled teenagers in school.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Mulvany spoke about the plan concerning procurement.

The intention is to get north of &euro;2.2 billion worth of procurable spend up to and then beyond 80% compliance, which would be good or best practice.  What is involved in that is drawing up a large number of procurement contracts or frameworks or both in the coming years.  The director general has explained what frameworks are.  To put the issue in some context, on average in recent years we are losing just north of &euro;100 million worth of contracts every year in terms of them coming out of date.<\/p><p>Our aim is to make a net gain of &euro;300 million to &euro;400 million a year, which means we have to put in place &euro;400 million to &euro;500 million a year in contracts over the next number of years.  As we sit here today, we have roughly &euro;1.1 billion under contract.  We are trying to get north of the &euro;2.2 billion mark by making up the roughly &euro;100 million a year which we lose due to contracts expiring and exceeding that by &euro;300 million to &euro;400 million in net terms.  That leaves us with &euro;400 million or &euro;500 million a year in contracts.

Even looked at retrospectively, it is clear that the services we were buying were being provided and at a reasonable cost.  We were a relatively small part of the overall Console picture.  Even if we had put significantly more resources into the active monitoring of the delivery of the bit that we were funding, I do not believe that would have precluded, prevented or eliminated the risk.  In the other part of its business, Console could have done whatever it was doing.<\/p> <p>  We interface with many section 39 agencies and are connected with them in respect of only a fraction of their businesses.  We obviously do not have wider regulatory powers or authorities.  As we discussed at the time, there was a particular dynamic there.  This was an organisation that was getting a clean audit certificate from a registered auditor.  If we were ever to conclude that we could not rely on such audit processes we would have a fundamental problem.  However good we are at monitoring the use of our resources, it would not preclude the type of thing that happened in the other part of that organisation's business.  I do not believe that the HSE can get into the business of seeking to regulate beyond what it is buying.  Our focus is clearly on ensuring systematically that we are getting the service that we are paying for to the standard we expect and at a reasonable cost in those agencies with which we have a relatively small relationship in the context of their total size.  That is why we have tended to have a tapered approach where we focus more attention on those that are public bodies, or section 38s, and those with who we have a substantial financial relationship, which is likely to be greater than 50% of their activity or represents a significant sum of public money beyond a certain threshold.  We have a tiered approach.  <\/p> <p>  We have established the central compliance unit, which has 12 staff members but our focus now is on ensuring that each of our nine community health organisations, CHOs, has developed within itself the effective capacity to monitor the grant agreements for which it is responsible.  We do not believe, given the wide distribution of entities that we fund, that this is sensibly done at central level.  It obviously must be done to central standard and with central oversight, but it must be done on the ground.  If we are funding the project to which the Deputy referred, it will have a relationship with the relevant community health organisation and no one at the centre will have particular visibility of that.  It is really about developing capacity. <\/p> <p>  The CHO is a relatively new structure and needs capacity in a number of areas, of which this is one.  In conjunction with the chief officers of those CHOs, we are currently carrying out a fairly intensive discussion to establish what they need to do their jobs most effectively and then we will have to go into the business of providing that to them.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Mulvany spoke of adding an extra 45 staff into the procurement department.  That does take a little time in that we have to secure both the cash, the headroom and the prioritisation in order to do it.

In the case of section 39 organisations, we are making a contribution towards services they are providing that are aligned with our own objectives and goals.  That does not mean that we are not interested in their governance, as the director general has said, particularly in the larger agencies.  However, we are not the Charities Regulator.  We are not the regulator of the sector.  As one goes down the scale of the smaller organisations, to which we may still be giving substantial amounts of money as &euro;200,000 is a substantial sum for most people, for us to get involved in effectively inspecting and auditing some of those is simply not practical.  Several of the practices that have been reported in the media will not show up on a review of a set of accounts.  It may or may not show up in an audit.  In some cases they should show up.  They may not show up even if there is the normal level of performance meetings with such an organisation per yer.  At &euro;200,000 per year, our guideline requires one to three meetings per year.  One will not necessarily pick up on the type of issues that have become systemic.  That is why we have written to all the chairs of the boards to state that without wanting it to appear as though we are not taking responsibility for that for which we are responsible, the fundamental responsibility for ensuring there is good governance inside each of those 2,000 organisations lies with the boards of those organisations.  They are the people who control it, not the HSE.

Last week in my constituency of Meath the issue of adult disability services was a very prominent matter.  It was covered extensively by the local media.  The issues were location and transport funded by the HSE.  The transport aspect was the toughest for the parents of the young adults involved.  In some cases, young adults were on a bus for over an hour and three quarters during a journey which should only take 15 minutes.  That was because of the route being taken.  That was provided by a particular service provider who the HSE was funding.  In the context of internal reviews of what the HSE is getting for its money, it is clearly unacceptable that young adults with intellectual disabilities are spending that long on a bus.  They would be in Wexford more quickly than they were getting home.

First, health care is one of the most emotive issues for people.  We are public representatives and we deal with people every day, and I am sure Mr. O'Brien respects that.  Issues relating to mental health services capacity, supporting children with disabilities, patients lying on hospital trolleys and people waiting longer than 18 months for an outpatient appointment are real.  They are not imagined, so when we put questions that are robust, it is because people expect us to hold those who are responsible for the provision of health care to account.  They expect us to do that.  If we do not do that, we are not doing our job.  The robustness of our questions, while it might frustrate Mr. O'Brien at times, is driven by the fact that people expect it.  Unfortunately, as Mr. O'Brien has said himself, the health service is not perfect.  There are people who are not getting the quality of care they need because of systemic problems in the health system.  I am just offering that up as an observation and I hope Mr. O'Brien can accept it as it is intended.<\/p> <p>  I will now move to the issue of supporting children with disabilities and early intervention.  Again, I gave Mr. O'Brien prior notice that I was going to raise this and a number of other issues.  I have to give Mr. O'Brien a local example because that is what I am familiar with, but it helps to frame the issue in a national context.  There are two different levels to the service provision for children with disabilities.  Early intervention is for those from birth to six years and then there is the service for six to 18 year olds.

I had a number of other questions I wanted to ask.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, the history of the health boards goes back to the mid-19th century.  Change has been incremental.  There still appears to be a great deal of fragmentation in the HSE.  It can be quite difficult to find services or even figure out funding.  I recently put a question to every Department about the hiring of private investigators - it does not matter that that was the subject.  It is a good way of testing to see how effective it is.  The one organisation that has been most difficult to get responses back from has been the HSE.  I first tabled the question in April.  Following email exchanges, we narrowed down the question.  We were told there were seven different ledgers.  We narrowed it down again and now, in mid-June, we have gone back with another question.  That is my experience of how hard it is to find information.  There is certainly a dysfunction in being able to retrieve information, including financial information, because this related to a payment.  I know it is necessary to invest in administrative systems in order to save time, etc.  Using this as an example, what needs to change to pull that together?  What is happening?  What is the investment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017061500002#NN02000","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497513600,"counter":1210,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for that question.  In 2003, Professor Niamh Brennan published her report, known as the Brennan report.  It was one of two reports that gave way to the establishment of the HSE.  The Brennan commission's report was a report into the financial systems essentially.  I suspect the Chairman probably read it carefully at the time.  It pointed out a number of things.  It outlined the financial systems that would be needed to provide effective information flows and financial control in a nationally organised health service.  In parallel with that, the Prospectus report was published.  This was the one that recommended the establishment of the HSE.  At the time, therefore, the Government had something saying, \"Here's what a shiny health service can do for you at a national level and here are the systems it would need to make it work.\"  This was done; this was never done.  When the HSE was created it was, in my opinion, systematically starved of the types of systems it would need in order to be an effective single national organisation.  On the day I came into my job, I had two things on my desk.  One was my warrant as an Accounting Officer.  It told me I was personally responsible for everything financial in the HSE.  The other was a report that told me that the HSE's financial systems were entirely unfit for purpose.  It was a happy day.<\/p> <p>  The experience the Deputy is having in getting that answer is precisely because there is no single financial system.  On that date, I established the financial reform programme, which I called my single highest non-clinical priority, in order to give the health system a financial management system.

There is a Catch-22 situation in that the HSE is trying to regularise issues in this particular organisation.

Can we be absolutely sure that while this issue is being considered there will not be any loss of services to the people who need them?

Furthermore, it has financial issues.  Again, we disagree with St. John of God's when it comes to the figure they view as their deficit or under-funding.  We are working through a process with them around that and we intend to do some forensic accounting work into this matter.  We do not accept the level of deficit or under-funding that they talk about.  Our longer-term plan acknowledges the need to invest further in their services, but in the new type of services, the decongregated services that we want, and not just in the current services.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017061500002#OO00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1497513600,"counter":1226,"content":"<p>Let us go back on this point again because it relates to what we talked about this morning.

There is a stark contrast between the service being provided by that particular service provider to some people and to others and I know of some cases very close to me.

What we do now is that, every year, we have a couple of central tax people who report in to my role.  We now do a targeted review, which is a continuation of the risk-based review, where we pick a sample every year and we go through all of the major items where we might consider that we had seen risks before.  We work with our colleagues across the HSE and with the Revenue and we do our own internal audit of a very detailed sample.  Over the past couple of years, that work has created a significant amount of visibility across the organisation of the need to be compliant.  It therefore has reduced the level of non-compliance and therefore the level of payments that we would have had to make to the Revenue in the past number of years.

I have two issues.  One is home help, which I have touched on.  My colleague, Deputy Billy Kelleher, would have received the detailed letter from Mr. Ray Mitchell in the past few days.  We asked for the home helps by region per month in 2016 and for the figures available for 2017, and we got the figures for January and February of 2017.  We just received it last week.  That showed that in the two-month period of January and February of 2017, as compared to January and February 2016, there was a reduction of 50,019 home help hours nationally.  Laois-Offaly saw a reduction of 15,383 hours.  Thirty per cent of the entire cut happened in that region.  I ask Mr. Mulvany to provide a detailed note on what happened.  I do not expect him to know it here now.  It does not include the home care packages.  It is strictly home help hours.  Mr. Mitchell will be familiar with the letter that was issued to Deputy Billy Kelleher recently.<\/p> <p>  The last thing I will ask Mr. Mulvany is to send me a detailed note on where we are on the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  At the minute, something is on the Minister's desk on the accident and emergency unit.  We know progress has been made on the maternity unit.  There was major concern regarding the ongoing uncertainty about the accident and emergency.  I ask him to send us a note.  I am not asking Mr. Mulvany to say anything special here now.<\/p> <p>  I think we are done.

I intend to submit an amendment on Report Stage to add \"mixed articles of a precious and non-precious metal\" to the definitions in the Act.

Our Chairman, Mr. Billy Hannigan, Deputy General Secretary of the PSEU, wished to be here today but, unfortunately, is unable to attend.  I am accompanied by Ms Lily Toner who is one of our members.  She has not been given the opportunity to leave a survivor pension to her wife.<br\/><br\/>Some of our group are elderly and ill and cannot be here today.  Some of them did not wish to come because they are still fearful of public exposure.  This is the first time that there has been an opportunity such as this for a public discussion on survivor pensions for same-sex couples.<br\/><br\/>We fully support the provision in head 14 of the Bill that provides a survivor pension for Dr. David Parris and remedies the injustice that he suffered.  We deplore the exclusion from the head of a small group of people who are in the same position as him.  We propose amendments to head 14 that are intended to rectify that anomaly and give practical effect to marriage equality.  The amendments are accompanied by explanatory notes and are dated 12 June.  An earlier version dated 28 May may be disregarded by the committee.  The amendments we propose are restricted in scope and are intended to apply only to this small and diminishing group.  There have been no new members since 1984.<br\/><br\/>We set out our case in our letters dated 28 May and 8 June that we sent to the committee.  I hope that members have received them.  Our central point is that our situation is unfair and our injustice is the same as that of Dr. Parris.  He was locked out of his pension scheme because he could not marry his husband before he was 60 years of age.  People like Ms Toner are locked out of her pension scheme because she could not marry her wife before her retirement.  It is unclear why a distinction was made in head 14 between people in the same position as Dr. Parris and people in same position as Ms Toner.  It is also difficult to understand why two years after the referendum we are here today.<br\/><br\/>We believe that the purpose of the constitutional amendment, and the reason that the people voted for it in such numbers, was to give same sex spouses the benefits and comforts that people in opposite sex marriages have always enjoyed, and that Article 41 of the Constitution protects.  The people did not vote for partial equality or to keep special disadvantages for same-sex couples.  Marriage cannot be separated from the benefits that it brings.  Among the advantages of marriage has always been the opportunity to provide for one's family in life as in death.<br\/><br\/>The contention has been advanced that because, in 1984, some of our members who were in the public service did not accept the option of a survivor's pension for an opposite-sex spouse, acquired after retirement, they were forever disqualified from a survivor pension for a same-sex spouse.  To even propose that shows a deep lack of understanding of the circumstances for gay and lesbian people in that period.<br\/><br\/>In 1982, when a young man was beaten to death in Fairview Park in Dublin because he was gay, the trial judge said that the crime could not be viewed as serious manslaughter, and the perpetrators received suspended sentences.  Yet it is being suggested that at that time, and in that atmosphere, gay and lesbian people were required to make a final decision about their survivor pensions that would bind them, for the rest of their lives, in a pension scheme that was designed for opposite sex marriages only.<br\/><br\/>In 1984 the idea that there could be same-sex marriage would have been ludicrous, including to the State itself when it made the offer.  One gay member has told me that he opted to benefit from an imaginary wife because he was fearful that if he did not do so he would be identified as homosexual, by his co-workers and employers, and passed over for promotion.<br\/><br\/>We have set out in our letter to the committee dated 8 June why we believe that our proposal will not cause unfairness to opposite sex couples, and this point have been raised.  This includes persons who were prohibited from marriage by reason of the lack of divorce.  FOI requests have ascertained that in the 20 years since the introduction of divorce, only one or possibly two persons who were affected by the lack of divorce have made application to any Department to change the option they had made.  Their requests were successful.  The reason for this lack applications is that anyone who was affected by the absence of divorce had ample opportunities, under the pension scheme rules, to obtain a survivor pension.  We have listed the opportunities in our costings paper at footnote (e) for paragraph 6.  <br\/><br\/>As regards the potential costs if our proposal is accepted, we have already furnished the committee with our calculations.  They demonstrate that the cost would be minimal because of the very limited number of persons who would be eligible to benefit. <br\/><br\/>The State, it seems, has accepted in head 14,<b><\/b>that changing an existing pension rule that is deeply unfair to gay and lesbian employees is the right thing to do, and will not be a cause of any general uncertainty.  There is no reason to adopt a different attitude to our proposal to change an unfair rule.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the amendments, section 73A of head 14 effectively disallows any condition in a pension scheme that requires employees to have married or entered into a civil partnership before a certain age in order to obtain a pension for their spouse or civil partner.  By adding the two words &quot;or retired&quot; to the section our amendment effectively disallows any condition in a pension scheme that requires employees to have married or entered into a civil partnership before retirement in order to obtain a pension for their spouse or civil partner.  The amendment is shorter and clearer than our earlier wording dated 28 May but it has the same effect.  We would not have a problem with an improvement of our wording that might be suggested as long as it achieves the purpose intended by our proposal.  <br\/><br\/>Yesterday we received a copy of the response given to the committee by the Department of Social Protection.  Having read it I spoke at length to Department officials.<\/p><p>There was a misunderstanding in that response, based on the mistaken belief that the original pension scheme to which most of our members belong does not have a spouse and dependant benefit.  It does have a spouse and dependant benefit, but it is only available if the member marries before retirement.  Following that clarification, we seem to have reached a common understanding with the Department of Social Protection that head 14 is intended to cover those gay and lesbian people in the original scheme who have retired and who were unable to marry before their retirement.  However, putting that understanding into the Bill, where it will pass through several hands, is another matter.  In order to guard against an unexpected change of mind from any source, it is very important that the committee make a formal recommendation that our group be clearly included in the scope of head 14.  I believe that such a recommendation would ensure its passage.  <br\/><br\/>Another issue which calls for remedy concerns gay and lesbian public servants who, following the constitutional amendment, have an entitlement to a survivor pension for their same-sex spouse but whose survivor pensions are not being calculated on the entirety of their service.  One of our members, Annette McCabe, whose case featured in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>recently and who is an ordinary level HSE employee, has been told that she is in this position.  Whether this should be remedied by administrative action or by legislation is a matter for the Department, but we strongly urge that it be resolved speedily because of her serious health problems.  She will not benefit from head 14.  I suggest that the committee recommend that where a person has a right to a same-sex survivor pension, it should be based on the whole of her service record.<br\/><br\/>Pension Equality wants to be made redundant.  We want an Ireland where there is no need to have gay and lesbian campaign groups for any reason.  I hope the committee will make us redundant.  Ms Lily Toner would like to say a few words about her own personal experience of the pension schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017061500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Courtney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497519000,"counter":1485,"content":"<p>Mr. Courtney has more or less covered everything so what I have to say is more of a personal contribution.

Included in that action was our fight for equal pay.  For all of my working life I have been involved in trade unions.  We fought for everything.

Now, I find myself at 64 years of age trying to get justice for women or men of my age who are trying to find equality in all aspects of their working lives and careers, especially in our retirement and, as Mr. Courtney has already said, in our ill health as we get older.  Our time is limited.  We are not going to live forever.  We are all of a certain age.  I just wished to make that point, but it is also about pride.  It is about the pride of having something to leave to someone - to leave something to the spouse with whom one has walked the road.  In many cases over the years that road was walked in secret and in fear.  Justice needs to be served.  I do not wish to take up too much time, but I wish to express the personal feelings around how one lives one's life, how one hides oneself and how one is afraid to come out because of everything - whether real or imagined - that was there.

We are very happy to be here.  We have supplied the committee with our opening statement.  I will not go through it word for word, but I will just touch on the main points.  I am the Pensions Regulator and the chief executive of the Pensions Authority.  Mr. Pat O'Sullivan is our actuarial adviser and Mr. Colum Walsh is an assistant principal in our legal unit who has been working on the proposed changes to the pensions legislation on behalf of the authority.<\/p> <p>  I will start by briefly explaining who we are.  The Pensions Authority was established by the Pensions Act 1990.  This Act is the legislation that governs Irish pensions, so changes proposed in, for example, the current social welfare and pensions Bill, are actually amendments to the Pensions Act.  This Act provided for the establishment of what was then called the Pensions Board.  Our responsibilities include overseeing the operation and application of the Pensions Act, providing information and guidance on pensions to both the public and those involved in the operation of pensions, and to advise the Minister for Social Protection on matters related to pensions generally.  We are therefore responsible for the regulation of trustees of occupational schemes, both for defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.  Therefore, it will be our responsibility to enforce any changes that are made to legislation as a result of this Bill.<\/p> <p>  Many people do not realise how large Irish pension savings are.  The total assets of Irish pension schemes total approximately &euro;100 billion.  These schemes provide for approximately 415,000 current employees and 105,000 retired members who are currently receiving pensions.  Those numbers do not include pension schemes for civil and public servants, which are run on a pay-as-you-go basis and include approximately 360,000 further current employees.  <\/p> <p>  The rest of my statement will deal with defined benefit schemes because that is the subject matter of the Bill.  To make it clear, a defined benefit scheme is a scheme that is expressed in terms of people's earnings when they retire.  For example, a person might get one eightieth of his or her annual pay for every year he or she had been working when he or she retires.  A defined contribution scheme is a scheme where an agreed contribution is made by a person and their employer and, at retirement, his or her benefit is the value to which those contributions have built up.  Of the &euro;100 billion in pension schemes in Ireland, approximately &euro;58 billion is in respect of funded defined benefit schemes.  There are currently 628 of these schemes, including approximately 115,000 current employees.  Both the numbers and the membership of funded defined benefit schemes are falling.  The numbers have fallen in the last year.  That figure of 628 was about 666 a year ago.  If we look at 1992, there were 2,560 defined benefit schemes at that stage with approximately 200,000 active members.  Both the numbers of schemes and the membership have been falling pretty continuously over the last 25 years.  It is usual when an employer closes a defined benefit scheme that it would be replaced with a defined contribution scheme.  <\/p> <p>  To speak briefly about the rules which govern defined benefit schemes, every year defined benefit schemes are required to calculate the value of the benefits they have promised.  They then compare this value to the total assets of the scheme.  If there are not enough assets they have to take certain steps.  All this process is overseen by the Pensions Authority.  This yearly assessment must be done in accordance with a set of rules, and these rules are collectively known and the funding standard.  In many discussions about defined benefit schemes the phrase \"the funding standard\" will be heard.  That is the set of rules that apply to schemes to ascertain whether they have enough money to meet the promises they have made.  Where a scheme does not have enough assets the most common response is that the scheme trustees and the sponsoring employer will agree a recovery plan to eliminate the shortfall over an agreed period of time.  This recovery plan is known as a funding proposal - another bit of jargon.  That is the name in the legislation.<\/p><p>Usually a funding proposal involves additional contributions by the employer.  Sometimes it may involve additional member contributions and sometimes the funding proposal may involve cuts to the benefits that have already been promised.  However, those agreements are voluntary under current legislation.  If no agreement can be reached and if a funding proposal cannot be signed off, the scheme may eventually be wound up.  In such a case, if there is a shortfall, there is usually no obligation on the employer to make up the shortfall unless, in rare cases, the rules of the scheme oblige it to do so.  It is important to point out that there have been many cases where employers have paid off some or all of the shortfall, but there is no legal obligation.<\/p><p> There is a reference in the letter the committee received from the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, to a number of changes that the Pensions Authority is considering to the funding standard.  I will briefly discuss those.  There are three changes under consideration at present.  The first is a change to the calculation of the risk reserve within the funding standard.  This will make the funding standard slightly easier on schemes that have taken steps to manage carefully their investment risk.  The second change is a procedural change relating to a funding proposal which is paying off or closing a deficit.  Where there is a funding proposal in place and it goes off track for whatever reason, we are looking at making it simpler for the trustees and employer to agree changes to that funding proposal to restore the scheme.  The third change we are considering is to examine the funding standard calculations.  The funding standard calculations in respect of members who have already retired are based on how much it would cost to pay an insurance company to take over responsibility for paying those pensions.  Questions have been raised about whether the current calculations reflect the actual cost that would arise if that transfer was made.  There are concerns that the current funding standard calculations might overestimate that cost, so we are examining whether we can improve those calculations to make them more accurate.<\/p><p> I am happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017061500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497519000,"counter":1489,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am accompanied by my colleague, Maeve McElwee, and we are here to represent the views of IBEC members.  The committee will be aware that IBEC is the country's main business representative organisation.  It has 7,500 members across all sectors of the economy and they employ approximately 70% of the private sector workforce.  Many of our members have an interest in issues relating to defined benefit pensions and the legislation under discussion today.<br\/><br\/>Our concerns relate specifically to Part 3, the amendments to the Pensions Act 1990, heads 12 and 13, which will have unintended and negative consequences for employers and scheme members.  Head 12 proposes an obligation on employers sponsoring defined benefit pension schemes to give 12 months notice of their intention to cease contributions and head 13 proposes that the Pensions Authority can determine a legally enforceable schedule of contributions that will restore defined benefit schemes which do not satisfy the funding standard.<br\/><br\/>Most defined benefit pension schemes are established under a trust deed.  The employer undertakes to be bound by the rules of the scheme and to meet certain duties and liabilities on a voluntary basis.  There has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to contribute to a pension scheme or to accept liability for any deficits.  We have just heard the comments on that from the Pensions Authority.  This Bill will turn a voluntary contribution into a mandatory obligation and potentially jeopardise the viability of businesses which are unable to absorb this extra cost.  IBEC shares the Government&rsquo;s ambition to protect scheme members, to encourage employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and to prevent employers who will not pay, as opposed to those who cannot pay, from walking away from the schemes they sponsor.  However, we also recognise that it can be very difficult to put forward legislative proposals which will have the desired effects without any negative implications.  This area of pensions is quite technical and the issues are not amenable to easy solutions.  While it may seem that a few simple changes could provide scheme members with the level of security they want, the unintended consequences can be damaging and far-reaching.<br\/><br\/>IBEC is particularly concerned that the provisions, first, could be unfair on employers who have voluntarily set up defined benefit schemes and invested significant resources over time to maintain them.  The previously voluntary commitments under these schemes would become mandatory, whereas there would be no corresponding obligation on employers who had set up defined contribution schemes or who had no pension schemes.<br\/><br\/>Second, we believe the provisions would destabilise ongoing efforts of many employers and trustees to support and deliver on the pension promise made to scheme members.<b><\/b>The experience of recent years has demonstrated that this process is best managed through discussion and negotiation between trustees, employers and members, where efforts are made to reach agreement on the steps required to secure scheme viability.  These steps may include a mix of measures such as increased employer and member contributions, which have been commonplace, longer working and changed benefits.  This painstaking process of supporting schemes to gradually move to a more appropriate funding level may not attract the same media attention as a small number of high profile scheme closures.  However, it is more likely to secure sustainable member benefits than additional regulation.<br\/><br\/>Third, we believe the provisions would impose an extra funding burden on the employer.  While the proposals might appear to improve scheme security, in many cases the pension liabilities and the investment risk assumed would be too big for a company to support.  It could jeopardise the viability of the business and the jobs of those employed.  There are also a small number of significant companies sponsoring schemes without a balance of cost provision.  This means that the employer contribution is fixed under the scheme rules.  This legislation would now mean that those companies would have to assume large pension liabilities onto their balance sheets.  This could have significant commercial and financial implications for those organisations.<br\/><br\/>Further, we believe the provisions will accelerate the closure of defined benefit schemes in the private sector.  The experience in the UK is that the introduction of &quot;debt-on-employers&quot; in 2005 has been widely blamed for the quickening pace of closure of the UK&rsquo;s 6,000 remaining private sector defined benefit schemes.  The director of a leading academic think-tank has said:<\/p><blockquote>Despite the major increase in pension rules over the last 10 years, aimed at protecting the consumer and encouraging better retirement saving, there has been a significant drop in the membership of defined-benefit pension schemes, with many people on course for inadequate incomes in retirement.  Our once brilliant, flexible, final salary schemes have been killed off by over-regulation.  We will all live to regret this.<\/blockquote> <p>We fear a similar situation playing out in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Finally, we believe the provisions will result in a far worse outcome for some scheme members, particularly younger members.  In some cases preventing an insolvent scheme from winding up can result in its ongoing deterioration before inevitable closure, with older members using up the assets before younger members retire.  IBEC therefore believes that the result of the changes proposed in this Bill, which have been designed to protect the position of defined benefit pension members, would deliver the opposite of that.  The Pensions Authority has spoken about its proposals to allow for some additional flexibility for defined benefit schemes and to tackle some difficulties with the current operation of the minimum funding standard.  Given that this in many cases is the root cause of the difficulties encountered by the schemes, the proposal should be given time for implementation before going further down the legislative route.<br\/><br\/>We urge committee members to recommend that the flawed provisions we have mentioned be removed from the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017061500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1497519000,"counter":1491,"content":"<p>Before I call on colleagues for their questions, I have a general question for Mr. Kennedy.

As the Chairman understands, an employer does not currently have an obligation to pay.  The legislation will mean that they will in the future.  Many employers pay shortfalls through funding proposals, as I explained.  The Bill will change things.  In the case of any schemes that wind up with deficits in the short term, employers will be obliged to pay those deficits.  That payment, depending on how the mechanism works out, may be a lump sum or it may take the form of payments spread over a number of years.

We have seen the impact of the winding down of many defined benefit schemes on workers who have paid into them all of their working lives and have been unfairly left out on a limb.  Some major and highly profitable businesses have wound down their defined benefit schemes.  That is why this Bill is so important.  Sinn F&eacute;in brought forward a Bill to make it illegal for profitable companies to wind down their defined benefit schemes.  I will touch on some of those points.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the statement from Pension Equality.  I welcome the group.  When someone speaks from the heart and lays the facts before a committee, it is very powerful.  It is hard to believe that it has been two years since the passing of the marriage equality referendum, which was very important day for the State.  A serious anomaly has been left in place.  If we are serious about equality, we need to recognise that it is more than a word.  Rather, it involves action and everything which flows from that.  This is something that needs to be addressed irrespective of the concerns of the Pensions Authority and whether it affects one person, 100 people or 2 million.  It is fundamentally about equality.  Mr. Kennedy referred to the low numbers of people involved.  As I said, irrespective of whether it is one person or 1,000 people, equality is equality.  Out of interest, does the Pensions Authority know the numbers involved?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017061500002#F01100","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1497519000,"counter":1503,"content":"<p>We have estimated the number of people involved at about 20.

Again, I thank the delegation for attending.<\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a pensions Bill against a backdrop where defined benefit schemes in many large companies - most recently that in Irish Life, which had a large surplus and was never in deficit - are being wound down and replaced with defined contribution schemes.  Essentially, it is robbing the employees who have paid into these schemes.  The companies in question, such as Independent News and Media, INM, and others, are highly profitable.  The Pensions Authority pointed out how there are now 628 defined benefit schemes compared to 2,560 in 1992.  We can see the direction in which this is going.  What is contained in the proposed Bill will move it from voluntary to mandatory.  Should it not be made illegal for profitable companies which are not in deficit to be able to wind down their defined benefit schemes?  Fundamentally, the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill would stop such companies from winding down their schemes.  I appreciate that the Pensions Authority has only been recently established.  Has it looked at any measures to tackle the winding down of defined benefit schemes?  Has IBEC examined the Sinn F&eacute;in legislation?  If so, will it comment on it?  IBEC is critical of what is being proposed but it has not put forward any tangible alternatives in respect of defined benefit schemes.  Has it any suggestions to stop these schemes being wound down?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017061500002#F01300","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1497519000,"counter":1506,"content":"<p>I am not an expert on pensions and I find them difficult.  I worked in An Post before I was elected and our own pension scheme was in trouble several years ago.  It was hard to understand the way it was run.  To my mind, defined benefit schemes were a significant step forward in the 1980s and 1990s from the point of view of the employer and the employee.  They were socially integrating, making employers responsible for their employees.  It is a terrible indictment that we are witnessing the move from defined benefit schemes to defined contribution schemes.  This takes away responsibility from the employer and puts it on the shoulders of the employees.  Employees have a role to playing in this.  A number of options can be considered, such as an employer increasing liability, the company&rsquo;s assets or employees increasing their liability.<\/p> <p>  The idea of giving a year's notice of intention to cease contributions is important.  When we consider the cases of INM and Irish Life, it gives people a long time to sit down and work out rather than dealing with it overnight and saying the scheme will implode.  I recall what happened during the ESB dispute about its defined benefit scheme.  The idea behind it was that the ESB wanted to take the liability off its books to sell itself to the markets.  Obviously, that was turned around and the workers maintained the defined benefit scheme.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O&rsquo;Brien stated \"This Bill will turn a voluntary contribution into a mandatory obligation and potentially jeopardise the viability of businesses which are unable to absorb this extra cost.\"  Will the other witnesses comment on that?  It is an important point which should be taken on board.  How can the Pensions Authority look at ways of intervening during that period?  Mr. O&rsquo;Brien also made the point that over-regulation kills defined benefit schemes.  During the past ten years, however, they have been killed off by austerity, the crash and the 36% reduction in values.  It is about what the pension funds invest in.  There has to be more of an examination of where the money is invested to protect it.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of pensions equality raised by Mr. Courtney and Ms Toner, it is straightforward and should be dealt with easily.  We should not be fighting over it.  If we can get clarity in respect of the matter, it would be important to ensure it is also clear in the legislation.  They raised the case of Annette McCabe.

I thank him for his comments.  His core question relates to what has been happening with defined benefit schemes, why they are in decline and what can be done to stop that.  Deputy Collins also mentioned these issues in her contribution.  The world has changed dramatically over the past ten or 15 years.  A range of financial market issues have put unsustainable pressure on these schemes.  The scale and type of financial commitments businesses are faced with are a multiple of what they would have planned for when they established the schemes.  There have been significant changes in demographics and life expectancy.  There is a mix of other reasons, including regulation, which has made it more difficult for employers to continue to support schemes.  The dynamic and the facts have changed entirely.  This is a global phenomenon; it is not only an Irish phenomenon.  I mentioned the position in the UK and there are similar scenarios internationally.<\/p> <p>  It is also important to recognise that, from a public sector perspective at policy level, it has been recognised that final salary defined benefit schemes will not be affordable in the future.  That change has been made.  We no longer have a defined benefit final salary scheme for entrants into the public sector.  Even at the level of the State, therefore, the unsustainability of final salary defined benefit schemes has been recognised and, unfortunately, they are in decline for a range of reasons.  They have become unsustainable for the State and individual businesses.  However, many employers want to sustain such schemes and we should do everything we can to support them and not to disadvantage them.  The core of our concerns about the proposed legislation is that it is patently unfair to a particular subset of businesses that have voluntarily entered into a scheme commitment with employees to make that mandatory.  They enter into the arrangement on that basis.  This is very much a retrospective change to a small subset of employers that, working with their employees, are trying to provide the best retirement option and trying to navigate that in a complex and changing world in the management of liabilities of defined benefit schemes.  Other employers have defined contribution schemes and they will not be affected, while many employers have no schemes at all, which is a much broader policy issue.  However, for employers that have been trying to support their employees for their retirement in the best possible way, the State will retrospectively impose additional regulation, cost and significant risk into those businesses.<\/p> <p>  IBEC wants viable schemes whereby employers want to maintain them and work with their employees to do so.  We want an environment that can support the schemes for as long as possible but we also have to recognise the obligation on us all to protect businesses and employees who are not scheme members, which is increasingly becoming the reality.  The vast majority of defined benefit schemes are closed to new membership.  I do not know what are the numbers but only a small number of schemes are open to new members.  There is an obligation on these businesses to their deferred members, retired members, active members and non-scheme member employees, who also have to be taken into account.  That all has to be seen in the round in the context of what have become unsustainable liabilities.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady asked whether we would support the Sinn F&eacute;in suggestion that the winding down of defined benefit schemes should be made illegal.  We would not support that suggestion, even where companies are profitable.  They could be profitable but there could be a detrimental impact on non-scheme member employees in terms of their future reward prospects and job creation.  The company might survive but it would not be able to provide the same remuneration to non-scheme member employees and would it able to increase employment, expand and invest in the future of the business in a productive and competitive way than if it were able to wind down a scheme that had become unsustainable.  It would be damaging for those businesses, the employees, and, ultimately, the economy.

We welcome the suggested changes by the Pensions Authority to support businesses that wish to maintain defined benefit schemes.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Chairman's comments, we are concerned that we do not see evidence of sufficient regulatory assessment of the impact of the proposed legislative changes.  We would like a much more comprehensive assessment of the unintended consequences of the proposed Bill.  It will accelerate a decline in defined benefit schemes.  These are voluntary schemes.  Why would any employer in their right mind continue to be involved in these schemes when they become mandatory and have excessive regulation associated with them?  We are concerned about creating an environment that will make it entirely unsustainable for employers to continue to support defined benefit schemes.<\/p> <p>  We have made a significant point about a subset of companies and the Pensions Authority has mentioned the accounting standards issues in this context.  That reinforces the need for a proper regulatory impact assessment of the proposed changes because this goes beyond the Pensions Act issues and those the authority will examine.  They require much more of a whole-of-Government consideration of the proposed changes but if they result in substantial additional debt going on to the balance sheets of companies, that will not be without commercial implications and potential risk to them.<\/p><p>From what we have heard, we do not think the issue has been sufficiently looked at right across Government.  That would concern us.  At its core, we very much concur with the view that we do not see the evidence of a proper impact assessment here of the implications of the proposed changes.<\/p><p> We may have covered some of the points mentioned by Deputy Joan Collins.  The matter is multifaceted and a range of factors are in play as to why we have seen such a demise in defined benefit schemes.  It is the reality of the State, as an employer, and it has accepted that it is not affordable to maintain final salary defined benefit schemes.  It is the reality of what has happened.  We have seen that in other public sector employment cases internationally as well.  To force a subset of private sector employers to continue with final salary defined benefit schemes would be absolutely unfair.<\/p><p> The Chairman asked about supporting companies that want to continue to fund defined benefit schemes and the matter of those who cannot pay versus those who will not pay.  We continue to urge that regulation and funding standards be made as sensible and as appropriate as possible for the realities of the market we now have, particularly with regard to the measuring liabilities.  It is the best way to try to maintain sustainability of the defined benefit schemes we have.  We are happy to engage on further legislative suggestions around company obligations but we want them to be properly assessed in advance in terms of a potential impact.

It came from the Department and the Minister and it did not originate from the Pensions Authority.<\/p> <p>  Another question was what we have done in the Pensions Authority to address the reduction of defined benefit numbers over 25 years.  To be clear, the role of the Pensions Authority is to ensure the Pensions Act is obeyed, to put it at its very simplest.  That Act specifies that if a company has a pension scheme, it must follow certain rules.  It does not say that a pension scheme must be set up, and currently it does not specify that a pension scheme cannot be closed.  The role of the Pensions Authority, as defined in legislation since it was set up, has been limited to overseeing the pension schemes that exist.  More broadly and less formally, it would be fair to say the question of whether employers set up pension schemes, as well as the level of benefits and contributions involved, etc., is seen and understood as an industrial relations issue rather than a pensions legislation issue.  It is clearly arguable that if this legislation goes through, that will change.  Until now, the question of whether there should be a pension and how much that pension should be has been an industrial relations matter for negotiation between employers and employee representatives.  We have not had a role in that.  Over the 25 years, as schemes have closed and others have been set up, it has not fallen under our responsibility.  There is nothing in the Pensions Act to give us power to intervene in that space.<\/p> <p>  There is the question of the ability of an employer to absorb the cost if this legislation goes through.  Our understanding of the proposed legislation is that the Pensions Authority's role would be limited to ascertaining how much a scheme needs to meet obligations and imposing that as an obligation on the employer.  The ability of the employer to afford that amount is not intended to be part of the Pension Authority's remit.  I should say two things in passing about that.  If it did come within our remit, it would require a change in the way we do things and we would certainly need to acquire more expertise.  It is a very complex issue.  There is a more general point that would also have to be borne in mind.  If ability to pay becomes a feature of the employer's obligation, it would also be necessary to decide that if an employer cannot afford pension scheme deficits, how will those deficits be dealt with?  It would not be enough to say the employer does not have to pay the full amount but the pension scheme must be left open in any event.  If the pension scheme is going to provide the benefits promised in the rules, the money must come from somewhere.  Ultimately, one must make the decision as to whether somebody pays the money or people lose the benefits.  There is no third way and it would have to be addressed if we went down that route.  Obviously, I am not arguing for or against it but the matters must be taken into account.  With the legislation as proposed, our responsibility does not include assessing the employer's ability to pay but rather what is required to pay the benefits promised in the scheme rules.<\/p> <p>  Should profitable companies be allowed to wind up schemes?  This is a question for the Oireachtas and the Government rather than the Pensions Authority.  The authority is a regulator.  It is a very specific question but I suggest there is a broader question.  It is not just about winding up schemes and the question goes to whether employers should provide pensions and if profitability is relevant.  There have been various suggestions for mandatory or auto-enrolment universal pension schemes.  That question goes to that kind of space.  It is not a question for us as a Government agency and pensions regulator.  It is a much broader question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017061500002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Kennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1497519000,"counter":1520,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Kennedy clarify a couple of very simple points?

My concern is there is something of a conflict, in that the cost of business has not been analysed.  It has come across both from Mr. Kennedy and Mr. O'Brien that the cost has not been analysed and nor has the consequent impact that may or may not have.  However, now that the signal has been cleared to the effect that there will be a move from a voluntary to a mandatory situation, does the passage of time cause risk to the existing scheme?

From my perspective, I do not think that is a fair assessment of this morning's proceedings.  There is clearly a huge issue here.  Irrespective of delay in this or in any legislation, defined benefit schemes have been plummeting since 1992.  We have the figures to hand.  Doing nothing is simply not an option in my book.  A number of legislative items have been brought forward, this being the most recent.  Again, I have put forward the proposition that the Sinn F&eacute;in legislation that was brought forward clearly has the mechanisms to stop the profitable companies from winding down their schemes.  I have outlined many examples that are in the media, including the examples of Irish Life, Independent News and Media and many others that unfairly, with no consultation with their employees, are winding down their schemes.  Doing nothing is not an option.  There may be some concerns around this.  Giving 12 months' notice, as this Bill currently outlines and proposes, is fair enough.<\/p> <p>  I put it to IBEC in particular - because there was not a clear \"Yes\" or \"No\" in response to the question that I put to IBEC - that if it is opposed to this legislation going forward, would it support the Sinn F&eacute;in legislation?  If the organisation has not seen it, I would gladly pass it along.  It makes amendments to the Pensions Act, specifically where a healthy sponsor shall not be allowed to close a defined benefit pension scheme except where the scheme has reached a minimum 90% funding standard.  Second, it provides that for these purposes, a healthy sponsor means an employer that either has positive net revenue or has a parent company with positive net revenue.  Its clear intention is to stop the profitable companies from walking away from their employees that are engaged in a scheme.  We are not talking about future schemes or curtailing those but about current schemes that are in operation and stopping profitable companies from walking away.  I put that question directly to IBEC, because I take on board what the Pensions Authority is saying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017061500002#K01500","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1497519000,"counter":1537,"content":"<p>Just before that is answered, Deputy Kenny had a point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017061500002#K01600","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1497519000,"counter":1538,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late; there were circumstances out of my control.
