What I am looking at, however, are those mothers and their daughters - specifically a growing number of daughters in this country - who, in my opinion, are not being treated in a holistic manner for the traumatic physical and mental side-effects that have hit them, coincidentally or otherwise, within a couple of days of receiving this vaccination.<\/p> <p>We are also here today in the shadow of High Court proceedings that are being taken by the mother of a girl who received the HPV vaccine.  She is asking for an order restraining the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, which monitors health products in Ireland, from proceeding with the use of gardasil in any vaccine programme.<\/p> <p>She is also saying that within 24 hours of receiving the vaccination in October 2011, her 11-year-old daughter presented with severe flu-like symptoms.  Her daughter became extremely fatigued and suffered severe nausea which led to weight loss and muscle wastage.  Her daughter also missed days at school, was hospitalised with bilateral pneumonia the following year, and was on antibiotics for six weeks.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paschal Mooney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Her daughter is now disabled to the point that she needs to be cared for on a permanent basis.  This was reported in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  I cite that example as one of the many that can read on the website of REGRET, a support group set up by a group of parents.  There is growing concern internationally about the use of gardasil, which I hope the Minister will acknowledge.  To date, Japan has suspended its vaccination programme.  Denmark has asked the European Medicines Agency to review the vaccine and it has been decided that the Danish child vaccination programme will switch from using gardasil to cervarix.  A presentation has been made to the Scottish petitions committee on the points that I have made and it has been asked to accede to a request for a round-table discussion to be held at Edinburgh between scientists and medical professionals from both sides of the HPV vaccine safety debate. <br\/><br\/>According to Merck's own statistics, some 183 million doses of gardasil have been distributed worldwide.  Using its clinical trial percentage, this means there could be more than 6 million girls around the world suffering autoimmune conditions that could influence their health for the rest of their lives.  According to the World Cancer Research Foundation, in 2012, 528,000 cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed worldwide.  This presents the question of whether it is worth the risk.  <br\/><br\/>There should be some acknowledgement by the Irish health authorities that there is something medically wrong with over 100 girls who have now been identified by REGRET as having developed similar symptoms within days of receiving the vaccination.  The medical establishment and the Department of Health have decided against having any discussion or investigation of this.  They say it will happen anyway and that every medication and vaccination has side effects and this is within the tolerable level.  When one looks more deeply, there are parents spending huge sums of money on trying to get treatment for their daughters and there should be some recognition of the financial crisis that many of them face as a result of this.  They genuinely believe that it is as a direct result of the vaccination.  <br\/><br\/>Everything I have said so far on the record is factual.  This is not about scaremongering.  The Danish Government has given 7 million kroner for an independent investigation, the Japanese have suspended its use, and an evaluation of gardasil and cervarix by the EMA has been initiated by the French Government.  These are not isolated cases.  There is a growing body of international opinion that suggests that something is wrong somewhere.  HPRA is engaged in the current EMA evaluation.  I hope there will be some recognition by the Irish health authorities of the trauma being suffered by these children and that they get some financial benefit.  They could be granted medical cards, which has happened in the case of other conditions in previous years.  There should be some recognition that there is something wrong somewhere along the line.  The parents genuinely believe that it is a direct result of the HPV vaccination.  <br\/><br\/>I reiterate that this is not about a suspension of the programme but an acknowledgement that there is something going on.  The Irish health authorities should not turn their face away from a growing body of international opinion that is beginning to acknowledge that there is something there.  We should join that growing chorus.  I do not believe it will go away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015110300002#B00300","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446561000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Mooney for giving me the opportunity to update the House on this important matter.

Following this, the national immunisation advisory committee recommended that the vaccine should be offered to all girls aged 12 years on an annual basis.<\/p><p>The Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  While no medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, the safety profile of gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised nationally, and at EU level.  Decisions on the supply of vaccines are undertaken by specific expert agencies rather than being the responsibility of the Minister of the day.  This is as it should be as it ensures that decisions are made solely on scientific information and expert advice, rather than being implemented by political pressure or lobbying.<\/p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where health care professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment.  All reports received are evaluated and considered for the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information that may assist in the assessment of the case.  I have been informed by the HPRA that up to 9 October it had received 921 reports of suspected adverse reactions or events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines.  The vast majority have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and soreness or a rash at the injection site.  These are short-lived.<\/p><p>As is the case for all licensed medicines, the safety of these vaccines is monitored by the pharmacovigilance and risk assessment committee, an EU-level drug safety committee, where the authority is represented and actively contributes.  I am aware that the European Medicines Agency has commenced a review of the HPV vaccine \"to further clarify aspects of their safety profile\", although the agency points out that this review \"does not question that the benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh their risks\".  The HPRA is participating in the review, which aims to clarify aspects of their safety profile and is specifically focusing on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.  In the meantime, the European Medicines Agency has advised health care professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines.  Health care professionals should therefore continue using them in accordance with the current product information.  Any changes to this advice will be made following the outcome of the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015110300002#C00200","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446561000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and I am glad that he has put on the record that there are 921 reports of suspected adverse reactions.

By the early evening, there were 41 admitted patients in the accident and emergency department awaiting a hospital bed and numbers were set to rise as the night went on.  As the Minister will be aware, the department is also short of nurses and doctors and staff are concerned that it is impossible to provide a safe level of care to patients in these conditions.  Almost half of those awaiting a bed on the night to which I refer night were over the age of 75 and many of them had been forced to spend days on trolleys and chairs in frantic, bright and noisy conditions waiting for beds to become available.  Waiting on a trolley in such degrading and inhumane conditions is unacceptable for people of any age but it is particularly cruel for frail older individuals in their 70s, 80s and 90s.<\/p> <p>Accident and emergency overcrowding also creates an unacceptably stressful working environment for staff and is exacerbating the problem with emigration of nurses and doctors from Ireland to other countries where they can work in better conditions.  I appreciate that the problems at Beaumont accident and emergency did not just appear on this Government's watch but they seem to be getting worse.  According to the INMO, overcrowding at Beaumont increased by 40% in the first nine months of this year compared with 2014.  There is a major concern that the position will deteriorate further and that Beaumont Hospital may well be facing its worst winter ever.<\/p> <p>As the Minister will recall, the CEO of the hospital, Mr. Liam Duffy, described Beaumont as unsafe during last year's similar overcrowding crisis.  The former clinical director of the hospital, Professor Shane O'Neill, resigned over patient safety concerns.  I recently met the CEO, Mr. Duffy, and accident and emergency staff to discuss the accident and emergency crisis, and particularly what can be done to address it.  A number of things need to happen.  First, we need to reduce the number of people presenting at the accident and emergency department by improving primary care and out-of-hours services.  D-Doc was a great service when it started but it is suffering from a lack of resources.  I obtained figures from the HSE last year which show that some people classified by D-Doc as urgent had been waiting over 13 hours to see a doctor.  The rational course of action in such a circumstance is to go to accident and emergency and yet the service is supposed to prevent those who use it from having to do so.  Second, there is an urgent need for more convalescent and nursing home beds in the area.  Often Beaumont has up to 100 patients awaiting discharge for whom it cannot secure nursing home or convalescent home beds.  Some even have been there for over a year.  As the CEO explained to me, the average time in Beaumont is three or four days and in those circumstances - where there are particularly difficult cases and a place cannot be found for someone - 100 others are denied places because 100 patients could go through that bed in the same amount of time.  Third, even with these measures, improving out-of-hours services and reducing those presenting to accident and emergency, there will still be a crisis at Beaumont because of the older demographic relating to the area.  Beaumont has one of the most elderly populations in the country.  Given that the people who live in the area are going to continue to age, there will always be a need for acute accident and emergency medical services at Beaumont far more advanced than those currently provided there.<\/p> <p>The accident and emergency department was built for only 35 patients and is often home to 100.  Work is ongoing in respect of designs for a new accident and emergency department on the Beaumont campus and the authorities there are in discussions with the HSE about the matter.  However, the Government has not yet committed to building that new facility.  I raised this matter in order to urge the Minister to ring-fence the necessary funding and give a solid commitment that funding will be available as soon as those plans are finalised to build a new accident and emergency facility at Beaumont Hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015110300002#E00200","speaker":"1200"},{"type":"speech","time":1446561000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Power for raising this issue.  I wish to assure the House that reducing emergency department, ED, overcrowding is an objective of the Government and the HSE.  I convened the emergency department task force in December 2014 to provide focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by ED overcrowding.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Leo Varadkar:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2192\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Significant progress has been made on the implementation of the ED task force plan.  Delayed discharges nationally are reducing steadily from 830 in December 2014 to 570 last Tuesday, and this has freed up more than 200 beds every day for acutely ill patients.  In October 2014, Beaumont Hospital had between 80 and 90 patients awaiting discharge home with supports or to a nursing home, and this number decreased to between 55 and 65 in October 2015, freeing up a whole ward for acutely ill patients every day.  The waiting time for the fair deal nursing homes subvention scheme has decreased from 11 weeks at the beginning of 2015 to between two and four weeks now.  By the end of 2015, more than 1,200 additional home care packages will have been provided as well as 149 additional public nursing home beds, 24 nursing home beds contracted for Moorehall in County Louth and 65 beds in Mount Carmel Community Hospital.<\/p><p>Senator Power is correct in identifying services such as D-Doc and convalescent home places as vital parts of a comprehensive solution to the overcrowding which we see in Beaumont all too often.  This integrated approach has led the Director General of the HSE to co-chair the ED task force implementation group until March 2016.  This will ensure all parts of the health and social care services work together and optimise resources to deal with the particular challenges associated with the winter months.<\/p><p>The rate of increase in the population of older people living in Ireland is greater in north Dublin than in any other part of the country, including other parts of Dublin.  In 1997, only 5% of people in Dublin aged over 65 lived in the areas served by Beaumont Hospital.  By 2011, this had increased to 24%.  With this older population in mind, additional short-stay convalescent beds have opened this year in St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview, Clontarf orthopaedic hospital and St. Mary's Hospital in the Phoenix Park.  Hospitals on the north side of the city were also prioritised for access to the 65 additional beds opened in Mount Carmel Community Hospital.  However, given that most people prefer to remain in their own locality, where it is easier for friends and family to visit, a tender inviting private providers to supply additional short-stay and long-term nursing home beds in the area is also in process.  It is hoped that it can be agreed in the coming days or weeks.  The HSE will continue to target additional short-stay beds as part of its winter planning process for dealing with pressures on acute hospitals.<\/p><p>The HSE is reviewing GP out-of-hours services throughout the country, including D-Doc, which provides an out-of-hours GP service to the population of north Dublin city and county.  This review is expected to conclude shortly and will contain recommendations for changes and improvements to the delivery of service in each area.  Funding has been provided to Beaumont to extend its day hospital from two days a week to five days a week as an alternative pathway for admission and assessment for elderly people referred to the hospital by their GPs, thus allowing them to avoid the emergency department.<\/p><p>On the question of a new emergency department at Beaumont Hospital, a design team has been appointed, incorporating architects and health care planners, to undertake a feasibility study on the location, size and cost of building a new emergency department at the hospital.  This work is at the stakeholder consultation phase and the report is expected to be available in mid-December 2015.  When the hospital board approves a design, the project will be submitted for consideration by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland hospital group, of which Beaumont Hospital is part, HSE Estates and the Department of Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015110300002#E00300","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446561000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply and acknowledge that there has been an increase in short-stay convalescent beds in the area, which is very positive.

However, as I pointed out, and the Minister acknowledged, the rapid increase in the number of older people in the area is causing particular pressures.  While the design is open to discussion, everybody agrees there is a need for a new, far larger accident and emergency department.

For example, 90 beds were not available to acute patients because people could not get home care packages or nursing home spaces.  There has been a considerable reduction, from 80 or 90 to 50 or 60, in the number of delayed discharges at Beaumont Hospital.  That should have made a difference but it has not.  In fairness to the hospital, it has acknowledged that and, as a result, is looking at its own practices.

I welcome the Minister of State.  As we know, deer are wild animals that cannot easily be fenced in and ideally should never be fenced in.  The protection of red deer, as a native species, is very important.  As Senators will be aware, the number of red and sika deer in Killarney National Park is roughly equal.  I know it is impossible to find an exact number, but I would be interested to get an approximate number.  I do not think there would be any objection to a cull of sika deer, which is an imported species.  I think any cull should be confined to sika deer.<\/p> <p>The fencing of Killarney National Park would be impossible.  As we know, deer exist outside the park as well.  There is no question of the road between Killarney and Kenmare, which passes through the national park, ever being fenced.  However, in view of the number of accidents that have happened on the N72 road between Killarney and Killorglin, there is a case for some limited fencing where deer have tended to cross that road.  I support that case and suggest that the fence might extend from the end of the Castlerosse Hotel wall to the car park on the perimeter of Killarney Golf and Fishing Club.  That is a limited area.  As the Minister of State probably knows, many of the trees along that roadside have been damaged by cars crashing into them as they veer to avoid deer.  The coroner has commented on that matter on a number of occasions.  I support fully the installation of fencing to exclude deer along that stretch only.  If there are too many red deer in lowland areas and they are wandering beyond the park - for example, into the reed beds on the edge of Killarney Golf and Fishing Club - perhaps they could be suitably darted at a particular time and transported to much higher ground on the edge of Mangerton or Torc.  It think it could be a question of husbandry rather than of a cull.<\/p> <p>Red deer have existed in Killarney for over 6,000 years and are widely regarded to be of international importance as a unique species of deer.  Damien Hannigan of the Wild Deer Association has said he believes illegal poaching has reduced the number of red deer in Killarney to \"a dangerously low level\" in recent years.  He fears that an indiscriminate cull could endanger the genetic diversity of the species.  While I might not go quite that far, I would be supportive of what he is saying or hinting at.  As a member of the Kerry Deer Society, I do not believe, on the basis of my sightings and my knowledge of the area, that red deer have been culled to a dangerously low level.  I should mention that the society in question would not support a cull of the red deer.  The Minister of State probably knows that illegal poaching is taking place.  I do not think the people who are shooting deer are examining them to see whether they are red or sika.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Coghlan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1881\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1881&amp;amp;pid=PaulCoghlan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Being a fellow Kerryman with an interest in these matters, I am sure the Minister shares my concerns and I look forward to hearing what he has to say on the issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015110300002#G00400","speaker":"1151","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446561000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Paul Coghlan for raising this matter.  I appreciate the Senator has a very good knowledge of the national park in Killarney.  As a trustee of Muckross House and having devoted a long number of years to the welfare and development of the park, including its wildlife, it is appropriate that he raise this matter.<\/p> <p>Nationally, wild deer in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts.  There is an annual open season during which deer can be legally shot under licence.  The open season for deer operates generally from 1 September to the last day of February, depending on the species and gender of deer.<\/p> <p>On deer policy in general, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, together with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, recently published Deer Management in Ireland - A Framework for Action, which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas, including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are widespread.  An Irish deer management forum has been established to implement the various actions listed in the report.  The forum comprises representatives from the main stakeholder areas, such as landowners, forestry, hunting and conservation organisations, and representatives from both Departments.<\/p> <p>In Killarney National Park, park rangers during their normal daily duties often take spot counts of deer on the lowlands.  Sika deer numbers are not out of control in the park and are at much lower densities than can be found in Wicklow, for example.  However, the National Parks and Wildlife Service would like to further reduce the numbers of this non-native species.<\/p> <p>Red deer numbers have not significantly increased in the uplands of Killarney National Park.  However, lowland numbers have increased, and these deer are highly visible.  It is intended to commence culling this population in November once the rut has finished.  It should be noted that pressure was exerted on red deer in areas adjacent to the park when they were on the open season order.  This may have resulted in red deer entering the park for sanctuary.<\/p> <p>With respect to the ongoing management of the deer population, the intention of any cull would be to focus on the red deer populations in Muckross and Knockreer in the first instance.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service believes fencing the national park would not be viable and would not achieve the desired results for a number of reasons.  First, as the presence of deer is not confined to the national parks, fencing of these properties would not serve any practical purpose in terms of wild deer control or management.  Second, the park is more than 10,000 ha. in size and includes some rugged terrain.  Fencing this area would be an enormous task, which would be unlikely to result in the desired objective.  Third, sika deer are capable of going under fencing that is eight inches off the ground, while red deer are capable of knocking fences that are preventing them from reaching traditional feeding and shelter grounds.  Fourth, the erection of a fence of this size would also impact on the sensitive habitats within the park.  Fifth, there are many deer outside the park boundaries which would still be capable of running into the path of motorists.<\/p> <p>The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is of the view that improving sight lines for motorists and improved signage are likely to be the most effective measures to assist motorists when driving through areas where populations of deer can be expected.  These populations roam freely throughout the countryside and are present in many parts of the country.<\/p> <p>I am aware that there have been calls in some quarters for the Department to carry out a national deer census.  The Department does not have the resources to carry out or co-ordinate a national deer count.  A large part of the deer population lives in forestry or woodland and it is particularly difficult to achieve reliable counts in such dense cover.  There is no evidence to suggest there is any threat to Ireland's deer population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015110300002#H00200","speaker":"1046"},{"type":"speech","time":1446561000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>While I agree with some of the comments made by the Minister of State, I strongly urge that the cull be confined to sika deer.

The Department conducts localised annual deer counts on State lands, such as the Wicklow and Killarney national parks.  Deer species are increasing in range and number.

Tackling organised crime is a priority for the Government, the Garda and other law enforcement authorities.  Of course it is a shared priority with the authorities in Northern Ireland, and extensive cross-Border co-operation is in place to tackle smuggling and other Border-focused criminal activities.  This work involves police, customs and other law enforcement agencies from both jurisdictions.  The inter-agency cross-Border enforcement groups on fuel and tobacco fraud are examples of this joint work in action.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, met recently with the Minister of Justice in the North, David Ford, to discuss what more can be done to tackle cross-Border crime.  The Ministers jointly hosted the annual cross-Border organised crime seminar in Sligo on 30 September and 1 October, which was attended by more than 100 delegates from North and South.

In various exchanges I have had here on this issue over the past year or two with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, she has said that increasing the rent supplement would act as a pull factor in that it would increase rents and that landlords would automatically push up rents.  They are pushing them up anyway.  If this latest episode of the soap opera comes to fruition, it will be obvious that, between now and the time any proposed legislation comes before these Houses, landlords will immediately start putting up rents again.

As we are all aware, many cannot get landlords to sign up to the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, or rent supplement and, therefore, they have no options open to them because of the lack of availability of social housing.  That is the nature of the crisis.  There is also the issue of landlords increasing rents.

This is something which we in the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly unanimously recommended last February at a plenary meeting in Dublin.  The Taoiseach greatly welcomed it at the time.  I am delighted that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is pursuing this further in the ongoing talks at Stormont.  Cross-Border crime has its roots in paramilitary groups which existed and were active in other areas using other methods, thankfully no longer.  It appears to me these people have continued their organisation for their own benefit and their own criminality.  They are crime lords in these areas and try to control things as tightly as they can.  I accept that a blind eye is not being turned to these people.  However, policing is so light and merely a token, if I may say so, particularly on the other side of the Border in south Armagh, that they do not need a blind eye to be turned.

The Minister, who is a key member of the talks team, has stated that the talks must produce an outcome that further deepens North-South co-operation in tackling problems such as large-scale smuggling operations, fuel laundering, drug dealing and extortion.  It is time to put a stop to the gallop of these criminals who think they are beyond the law.  In this regard, the recent extra resources drafted into Louth as a result of the heinous murder of Garda Tony Golden are bearing dividends.  The checkpoints adjacent to motorway exits and in the Cooley area have gathered a great deal of information and tracked the movement of many suspicious people, and that is to be greatly welcomed.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, has also said that there is a need to build on the excellent co-operation that already takes place in this regard between North and South and we want to see an enhanced overarching structure in place to support it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jim D'Arcy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2383\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2383&amp;amp;pid=JimDarcy&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Hopefully, in conjunction with the successful conclusion of the Northern talks, this task force will be established.  I would like the Minister to come here and outline how the talks are going.<\/p><p>As remarked by my colleague, Senator Terry Brennan, I wish Chief Superintendent Pat Magee of the Louth-Meath division, an amazing and outstanding garda sergeant, inspector, superintendent and chief superintendent, a very happy retirement and congratulate him on the outstanding work he did over many years in Louth and Meath.  I wish his wife, Concepta, the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015110300002#V00800","speaker":"1166","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446561000,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I already have to amend the Order of Business that we take No. 2 at 5 p.m. rather than after No. 1 because the Minister is not available until 5 p.m.  I propose this amendment.<\/p> <p>Senators Mooney, Hayden and Cullinane spoke on housing and rent supplement.  Although we have had two debates on housing during the past 12 months, I agree there is an urgent need for a further debate soon.  The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, will have further proposals on homelessness and a housing plan in the next two weeks.  Hopefully, we will have a debate on it then.  The Government has put aside &euro;3.8 billion to build more than 100,000 housing units in the coming years.  We are to install modular housing as an emergency measure in Dublin and more of those modular units will be installed in the coming months in order to tackle homelessness.  I am sure the Minister will come to the House within the coming weeks, after all the new proposals have been put in place.  The Government is treating the matter very seriously and I will ask the Minister to come to the House as soon as the new and further proposals have been announced in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>Senator Mooney raised the question of the Garda.  He suffered from a little amnesia.  The previous Government closed down the Garda college in Templemore, and as a result we had no recruitment of garda&iacute;.  This Government has put 500 new garda&iacute; on the streets and the budget provides for an additional 600 garda&iacute;.  Law and order is of paramount importance to the Government, and will continue to be during the coming months.<\/p> <p>Senator Bacik welcomed the fact that unemployment has decreased to 9.3% from 15% when the Government took office.  As she said, while it is a great improvement, the figure is still too high.  The Government recognises this and job creation is the Government's top priority, and will continue to be.  The more people we can get back to work, the more taxes will come in and the more services we can provide for the people, which is what we want.<\/p> <p>Senator Bacik welcomed the signing into law of the Marriage Bill and expressed regret at the DUP's move.  Senator Norris also commented on it and welcomed the fact that the Northern Ireland Assembly voted in favour of a change in the marriage law, which is a first in Northern Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maurice Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Senators Bacik and O'Keeffe spoke about the use of migrant workers in the fisheries sector and welcomed the Minister's action on this issue.  I agree with both Senators that the exploitation of workers is totally unacceptable, regardless of the countries the workers in question come from, and will have to be stamped out in the fisheries industry and in all other industries.<\/p><p>Senator Norris expressed his regret at the passing of a student leader, Dean McCarron.  I have read about this excellent young man, who took part in student politics and in the recent marriage referendum.  I would like to express our sympathy to his family on his very early passing.<\/p><p>Senators Brennan and Jim D'Arcy wished Chief Superintendent Pat Magee well on his forthcoming retirement.  Senator Brennan also made some good comments about the railway station in Dundalk.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn spoke about the tagging of criminals, which is an issue that has been raised recently.  I am informed that legislation to allow tagging was introduced in 2007.  Based on comments in recent times, there is obviously a need to revamp the mechanism that is in place.  As Bills relating to burglaries, bail and victims of crime will be considered in this House before Christmas, Senators will have ample opportunity to discuss the matters raised by Senator Mullins in particular.  I am sure Operation Thor can be debated when the Bills in question come before the House in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn raised the issue of best-before and use-by dates, as he has done on several previous occasions.  I would agree with him.  I understand there are supermarkets in Ireland that are giving waste food to charities.  Perhaps this could be organised on a national basis.  I think this is being done in Cork, in particular, at present.  I suggest that it could be expanded nationwide.<\/p><p>Senator Hayden suggested that inadequate protection is being afforded to tenants.  She also commented on the study on zero-hour contracts.  I will certainly invite the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, to come to this House to discuss that study.<\/p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the possible establishment of a task force with responsibility for tackling organised crime.  This matter was raised by Senator Jim D'Arcy during the Commencement Debate before the Order of Business.  Senator Coghlan mentioned the involvement of the Provisional IRA in the crime that is ongoing in Border areas and expressed support for the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, who has called for the creation of a task force.  This issue was raised at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly over 12 months ago.  I am hopeful that this task force will be up and running soon because it is of paramount importance to tackle such crime, as can be seen by anyone living in Border areas.  As Senator Jim D'Arcy mentioned earlier this afternoon, the deployment of extra garda&iacute; is already bearing fruit.  There is a need to build on the good relations that exist between the Garda and the PSNI to stamp out the criminality that has been clearly evident in Border areas over the last ten years or more.<\/p><p>Senators Craughwell and Colm Burke spoke about the great success of the Web Summit and wished it continued success in the future.  I understand that Lisbon has signed up to host the summit for the next three years.  I hope there may be a possibility of bringing it back to Ireland after that.  I listened with interest this morning to the comments of a number of people from South Africa and many other countries who are attending the Web Summit.  They said that Ireland, as an English-speaking country, is the key place to have such a summit.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maurice Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They spoke little of the problems enunciated by Mr. Cosgrave whom I wish well in his efforts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015110300002#W00200","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446561000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>That is very magnanimous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015110300002#Y00075","speaker":"1196"},{"type":"speech","time":1446561000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I hope the Web Summit will return to Dublin in the years ahead.<\/p> <p>Senator Kelly called for a further debate on wind farms.
