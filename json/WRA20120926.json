The CE schemes operate only in community creches, some of which cater for particularly disadvantaged children.

At the same time, I recognise the importance of ensuring that CE staff receive the training and support they need to follow a career path in childcare.<\/p><p>  Up to this year, CE workers could continue to claim their previous benefit while being paid to be on the Scheme.

The outcomes from a symposium on Exploring Outcomes in Youth Work which I hosted in July are also feeding into the Youth Policy Framework<b>. <\/b>Youth policy developments at European level during Ireland&#8217;s Presidency of the EU Council of Ministers in 2013, along with the experience of youth service providers, experts and young people themselves and the findings from a review of the international evidence on  outcomes in youth work carried out by the Institute of Education, London on behalf of the Department, will also inform Ireland&#8217;s national policy for young people.<\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore, I am in the process of appointing a new National Youth Work Advisory Committee (NYWAC) under the terms of the Youth Work Act, 2001.  This Advisory Committee which comprises equal representation from the voluntary youth work sector and Government departments and statutory agencies will contribute to the development of the Youth Policy Framework. These experts will advise and assist me in the development of a coherent and responsive youth policy which will direct and support the provision of relevant services and programmes that will meet the needs of young people in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600069#WRC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Detention Centres","counter":38,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600069#WRC00550"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[40693\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600069#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the progress made to date in expanding the facilities at Oberstown Children Detention Centre, County Dublin; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":40,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware I announced on 2 April 2012, following agreement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, an investment package of approximately &euro;50 million in capital funding for the project to expand the detention places and facilities on the Oberstown campus.

Both organisations have been working collaboratively at my request to promote improved safeguarding practices across the Church. I acknowledge the advances being made by the National Board in terms of increasing awareness of Church safeguarding practices. I also welcome the willingness of the various Church bodies thus far reviewed to engage with this review process and publish the results. However, the recent review reports shed further light on poor historic practices within the Catholic Church, and while efforts have been made to address poor practice, this is in some cases a very recent development.<\/p><p><br \/>  My colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence Alan Shatter TD also recently discussed the publication of the National Board&#8217;s reports with the Garda Commissioner and was informed that the Garda Sexual Crime Management Unit is examining those reports in the context of establishing what further action may be necessary on the part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to them.  Given that much of the reported abuse highlighted in the reviews published into three Religious Congregations took place in schools, the findings will be of particular interest to my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills, Ruairi Quinn TD.<\/p><p><br \/>  The work of the National Safeguarding Board, together with a national audit which is being conducted by the HSE, is designed to provide a comprehensive national picture of how child protection is being promulgated and practiced by the Church dioceses and Congregations. I recently received the report of the HSE Audit of Catholic Church dioceses, and it is intended that this will be published shortly. The HSE is also conducting a review of safeguarding practices across Religious Congregations.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government has committed to, and is putting in place as a priority, a range of legislative provisions which, when taken together, will help to better safeguard children. These include:<\/p><p><br \/>  (i) the planned introduction of legislation to place the <i>Children First<\/i>   guidance on a statutory footing;<\/p><p><br \/>  (ii) the introduction of the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Adults) Act, 2012, which was brought into force on 1 August last by my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Alan Shatter TD, and which introduced a very important measure designed to deal with the problem of people failing to report abuse;<\/p><p><br \/>  (iii) the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill, 2012, which is currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p><br \/>  In parallel, an extensive reform programme relating to children&#8217;s services is ongoing within the HSE and in consultation with my Department, which will lead to the establishment of a dedicated Child and Family Support Agency. I have also in the last week published the Constitutional amendment on children&#8217;s rights, which I believe will further heighten our awareness of the need to protect children.  Finally, I would encourage all Church authorities, who have not yet been reviewed, to cooperate with the review processes of both the National Board and the HSE.

The regulations provide for the granting of the relief due to the borrower by the lender within the tax year.   The mortgage lenders provide mortgage interest relief at source to relevant mortgage holders, which is facilitated by on-going electronic data file transfers between Revenue and each of the 132 individual qualifying lenders.

As a direct result of the work of the action team for Ireland, &#8364;25 million of funding was re-allocated to the integrated Youthreach programme which provides education, training and work experience to young people who have left school early without any qualification or vocational training. This will ensure that 3,700 training places for early school leavers are maintained until end 2013. Another initiative arising directly from the Commissions' proposals, has been the inclusion of youth unemployment as one of the four thematic themes eligible for funding under the &#8364;20m Labour Market Education &amp; Training Fund (LMETF).<\/p><p>  More generally, the Government&#8217;s primary strategy to tackle youth (and overall) unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.<\/p><p>  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. The main initiative in this regard is Pathways to Work which is the main policy focus for getting the long-term unemployed (including those aged under 25) back into employment by providing job search assistance, work experience and training.<\/p><p>  In terms of <b>job search assistance<\/b>, some 17,000 young people registered with Employment Services this year up until September 2012, representing 37% of all registrants.

My Department is also reviewing arrangements here in the light of these various approaches.

The scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994 allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.<\/p><p>  The scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.<\/p><p>  There are a number of significant challenges currently facing the Irish pension system.  At present, there are six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  In addition, those aged over 65 will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion who are of working age is expected to decline.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population. With increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement and the period for which a pension will be paid will be greater than the period for which a pension is paid at present.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision and for the sustainability of pension provision into the future.

All of these programmes have specific objectives and eligibility criteria that address the specific needs of a wide range of participants.<\/p><p><br \/>  The criteria for participating on the Community Employment (CE) programme are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social welfare payments. The core eligibility criterion for CE is that the person is in receipt of a qualifying Social Welfare payment, as defined on the Department&#8217;s public website. This requirement is based on Government policy and Departmental guidelines and has been the rule since CE commenced in 1994.<\/p><p>There are 2 options on Community Employment, a one-year version of CE and a three-year version of CE. Eligibility to participate on either option is determined by the length of time in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment, i.e. 1 year in receipt to qualify for 1 year on CE and 3 years in receipt to qualify for the 3-year option (based on annually renewable contracts). There is no <i>entitlement<\/i>   to 3 years under this latter option, only the flexibility to avail of up to 3 years on CE based on the participants progression levels and assessed personal needs at the end of each year.  All CE participants are subject to participation caps: 3 years total participation for those below 55 years of age and 6 years total participation for those of 55 to 65 years of age (inclusive of any time spent on CE before reaching 55) &#8211; only counting CE participation since 3<sup>rd<\/sup>   April 2000.

The number of contribution weeks in any year is relevant for determining the individual&#8217;s future entitlement to social insurance benefits and in particular entitlement to short-term benefits.  Any proposal to alter the basis for establishing future entitlement to social insurance benefits from contribution weeks to overall annual income would represent a fundamental change to the existing social insurance system and would have significant cost implications which could only be considered in a budgetary context.<\/p><p><br \/>  With reference to the impact of seasonal working on a person&#8217;s entitlement to Jobseekers Benefit it should be noted that Jobseekers Benefit is a short-term insurance-based payment which is designed to provide income support to insured workers during periods of involuntary unemployment.  In order to qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit, a claimant must be unemployed for at least 3 days in 6, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have suffered a substantial loss of employment.  Jobseekers Benefit is not subject to a means-test and, therefore, income earned during an employment spell would not disqualify a seasonal worker from claiming Jobseekers Benefit during a subsequent period of unemployment, even if both the employment and unemployment episodes were to occur in the same year.  Hence, Jobseeker&#8217;s Benefit is available to seasonal workers who suffer a substantial loss of employment, subject to satisfaction of the scheme criteria.

Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).  Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).<\/p><p>  Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits to self-employed persons would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.<\/p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.<\/p><p>  The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&ndash;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.<\/p><p>  The scope of the 2010 Review was to update the results of the 2005 Review, taking account of the policy, economic and demographic changes with particular reference to income and expenditure projections as well as break-even contribution rates.  The Review also considered the effects of the various policy options, existing Government commitments and planned reforms.  One of the issues examined in the 2010 Review was the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contributions rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseekers benefit for self-employed workers.<\/p><p>  KPMG modelled the costs associated with the introduction of these benefits by increasing the incidence by 12% in their models reflecting the increase in potential beneficiaries.  This uplift is based on the distribution of PRSI contributors at 31 December 2010.  The implicit assumption in this calculation is that the proportion of self-employed accessing these benefits is the same as the existing population with entitlement to access these benefits.  For illustrative purposes KPMG costed the extension of these benefits by assuming the extended scheme reaches full &ldquo;maturity&rdquo; in terms of the numbers of additional beneficiaries with immediate effect.  You will be aware that contributors must satisfy the requirement to have a minimum number of paid contributions before they can qualify for these benefits.<\/p><p>  In the absence of statistics pertaining specifically to the self-employed, KPMG assumed the incidence rates to be the same as for the overall labour force.  This may or may not be  appropriate depending on whether or not the self-employed may be expected to behave atypically.  KPMG therefore, indicated sensitivities to the incidence rates chosen setting out the range of costs involved where the self-employed numbers accessing jobseekers benefit and invalidity pension are 20% higher or 20% lower than the base-case scenario.<\/p><p>  Assuming the incidence rates are the same as for the overall population, KPMG found that the cost of extending jobseekers benefit to the self-employed in 2013 would be &euro;87m.  If the incidence rate is 20% lower than the norm the estimated cost would be &euro;73m in 2013 and if the incidence rate is 20% higher than the norm the cost in 2013 would be &euro;105m.  In the case of invalidity pension KPMG&rsquo;s analysis predicted a 2013 cost of &euro;78m where the incidence rate is the same as for the overall population.  Where the incidence rate is 20% lower the cost is estimated at &euro;65m and where the incidence rate is 20% higher than the norm the cost would be &euro;94m.<\/p><p>  The accumulated cost over the full period up to 2066 of extending jobseekers benefit and invalidity pension to the self-employed is &euro;2,320m and &euro;4,074m respectively, expressed in current terms.<\/p><p>  The 2010 Review also looked at the break-even contribution rates required to provide invalidity pensions and jobseekers benefit for self-employed workers.  The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseekers benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17%.<\/p><p>  The scope of the review did not extend to costing the provision of illness benefit for self-employed workers or to the provision of these benefits on an opt out or voluntary basis.<\/p><p>  I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year and one of the issues that the Group is currently considering is the issue of providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.<\/p><p>  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.

One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives. However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.

Under the terms of the NBS contract, 3 is obliged to provide contractually-agreed services to any fixed residence or fixed business wishing to avail of broadband services.  <\/p><p>The current minimum speeds available to NBS customers will be increased next month free of charge to 2.3mbps download and 1.4mbps upload.<\/p><p>As a result of these areas being part of the NBS, residents were not eligible for inclusion in the current Rural Broadband Scheme. <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s recently-published National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses well in advance of the EU's target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  <\/p><p>  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically:<\/p><p>  70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015;<\/p><p>  At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and <\/p><p>  A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.  <\/p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers' existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.<\/p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, (it is expected to take a number of months) the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.  <\/p><p>  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including areas such as Fontstown and Ballyshannon County Kildare will have at least 30Mbps connectivity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRP00600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Digital Television Service Availability","counter":306,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRP00650"},{"type":"question","counter":307,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[40768\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRP00700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the percentage of the population in County Kerry that will no longer be able to receive any television coverage whatsoever after the 24 October 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":308,"content":"<p>RT&Eacute; has built, owns and controls the Saorview TV network and is responsible for the roll-out, coverage and operation of that network.

The Central Bank of Ireland is the competent Authority in this jurisdiction with regard to licensed moneylending and in overseeing and regulating such activity.  <\/p><p>  Legislative provisions relating to the regulation of moneylending are contained in the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which is the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and unlicensed moneylending is an offence under that Act.  My Department&#8217;s responsibility relates to the involvement of the criminal justice system in dealing with allegations of criminal activity.  Persons who engage in money lending and who do not hold the necessary licence granted by the Central Bank are committing an offence under section 98 of the Act, which provides for a prohibition on engaging in the business of money lending without a licence.  <\/p><p>  Complaints may be made to the Garda&iacute; who have power to bring prosecutions against unlicensed operators.  The powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling illegal moneylending are principally contained in sections 105 to 109 of the Act, which make provision for a number of matters including Garda powers of entry and arrest. <\/p><p>  A person who is found guilty of an offence under the Act is liable, on summary conviction, to  a fine not exceeding &#8364;3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &#8364;100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both. <\/p><p>  I am informed that the latest available figures provided by the Courts Service indicate that no prosecutions for such an offence have been recorded over the past five years.<\/p><p>  There are also a number of provisions in the criminal law which may be of relevance in particular circumstances, for example, section 10 and section 11 of the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 and section 17 the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 which provide for a range of offences including offences relating to harassment, extortion and demanding money with menaces.  While these criminal law measures are being utilised, it should be noted that these offences have wider implications than money lending and there is no information available as to their use specifically with regard to money lending activities.<\/p><p>  With regard to these matters I am assured by the Garda authorities that where offences under section 98 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 are disclosed, and are reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the matter will be the subject of investigation under the direction of the local District Officer, with relevant expert assistance available from the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.<\/p><p>  As I stated before, I would, therefore, encourage those who may have information concerning the operation of unlicensed money lenders in particular circumstances to make that information available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who will take all measures open to them to enforce the law in this area.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">    <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRR01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Matters","counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRR01250"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[40908\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRR01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the repossession of property; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>The position is that the High Court judgment to which the Deputy refers has been appealed to the Supreme Court.

Prices have continued to increase during 2012 and are currently at record levels, some 12.53% ahead year on year, or 18c per kilo higher.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am aware of the concerns currently being expressed by the sector, particularly with regard to producer returns and the loose sow housing welfare requirements applicable from 1 January 2013.  On the latter point, European legislation requires the change in sow housing.  To facilitate compliance, an on-farm investment aid scheme (TAMS) &#8211; the Sow Housing Welfare Scheme was introduced under Ireland&#8217;s Rural Development Programme 2007 &#8211; 2013. &#8364;13 million has been made available under this scheme.  Following discussions with producers and the evidence of the initial stages of the scheme, my Department modified and improved some elements of the scheme.  Grant-aid is now available at a rate of 40% to eligible producers with a maximum investment ceiling of &#8364;500,000 for the first sow house, with further amounts of &#8364;300,000 for each of the next three houses.  The closing date for applications has being extended to 31 October 2012 in order to alleviate pressures arising from delays in obtaining planning permission.  This scheme is in addition to earlier Sow Welfare Schemes which delivered over &#8364;6 million to successful applicants.  A number of applications have already been approved and I strongly encourage pig producers who have not yet done so to submit their applications to my Department as soon as possible.<\/p><p><br \/>  While prices, production and export volumes have grown in recent years, high feed costs, most notably cereals and compound feed remain an issue.  Pig producers are especially affected by the increase in cereal prices since June 2009, given that cereals account for 75% of feed.  From a National perspective, the &#8216;<i>Food Harvest 2020 Report<\/i>  &#8217;, which was published in July 2010, sets out the vision for the future of the food industry including the pig sector.  The Report targets a 50% increase in the value of output by 2020.  This is a target set by the industry for itself.  I am personally chairing a High Level Group to ensure that the steps necessary to facilitate the development of the sector are taken.  My Department and its agencies will, along with industry, play a central role in this regard.  For example Teagasc, through its Moorepark pig research facility and the provision of FETAC courses in pig production and benchmarking pig herd performance, plays a critically important role in improving productive capacity at farm level.<\/p><p><br \/>  In so far as international trade in Irish pigmeat is concerned, I have been extremely active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long term trading relationships in the future.  Furthermore, we have hosted inspection visits from a number of other countries and negotiations are continuing with a view to opening new markets and expanding the presence of Irish pigmeat in existing markets.  In addition Bord Bia continues, through its marketing and promotional activities, and through the pigmeat quality assurance scheme, to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets.<\/p><p><br \/>  Pigmeat remains the most consumed meat internationally and indeed in 2011, exports of Irish pigmeat to non-EU markets increased by 25% to 43,000 tonnes. International markets continue to present considerable prospects for Irish pigmeat and I am confident that we are positioning ourselves to benefit from these opportunities.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department and its agencies will continue to work closely with the industry to ensure that it can continue to develop and grow in accordance with the targets in the Food Harvest 2020 Report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRT01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Responsibilities","counter":405,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRT01550"},{"type":"question","counter":406,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[40774\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRT01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the statutory powers that have been delegated to Ministers of State in his Department; and the date on which the statutory powers were delegated.","asker":"970","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":407,"content":"<p>As Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine I retain overall responsibility for all the functions of my Department.

Buoyant European cattle prices in 2011 and 2012 are attributable to a supply deficit throughout the EU and to strong global demand.  In fact, Irish cattle prices have exceeded the EU average level for most of the year to date, with the Irish price for the benchmark grade only dipping below the EU producer price in August when countries such as Germany and Italy experienced supply shortfalls which had the effect of driving up prices substantially in those markets.<\/p><p>  I am cognisant of the export dependence of the Irish beef industry which means that external market developments largely determine Irish cattle prices.  Ireland is a small, peripheral market producing an average of 570,000 tonnes annually, of which some 90,000 tonnes is destined for domestic consumption.  Over the past decade, the profile of Irish beef exports has changed from a reliance on volatile international markets to a focus on higher value consumer markets in the UK and Continental Europe.  Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across Europe.  Securing and retaining such a wide portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years.<\/p><p>  The UK is approximately 80% self sufficient and is, by a significant margin, the main market of Irish beef accounting for around 50% of exports in volume terms.  Irish beef comprises over 70% of total UK beef imports on account of our close proximity to the market and our strong customer profile which includes most of the leading retail, manufacturing and foodservice companies.  In terms of sensory attributes, Irish beef tends to closely resemble the UK's domestic offering because of similarities in our production systems (i.e. grass-fed steer and heifer cattle with moderate carcase weights, fat cover and marbling).  Trade with the UK is impacted by fluctuations in the euro\/sterling exchange rate and the extent of Britain's import requirement which is forecast to increase in the short run consequent on a continuing decline in domestic beef production.  With consumption expected to remain stable and a continuing reduction in the size of national cattle herd, British beef imports are predicted to grow from 381,000 tonnes in 2011 to 417,000 tonnes in 2013. <\/p><p>  A number of factors have been identified to account for the differential between Irish and UK cattle prices.  These include a British consumer preference for indigenous beef product.  In any analysis of comparative prices, it must also be recognised that UK cattle prices are currently among the highest in the EU.  Moreover, a price differential makes Irish beef products competitive in the UK market such that Ireland supplies the bulk of the UK's import demand notwithstanding additional logistical and processing costs incurred in shipping to that market.  When comparing Irish and UK cattle prices, it be noted too that there is a significant exchange rate effect making the UK price appear even higher.  For instance, the current GB R4L grade steer price, averaging Stg &pound;350.9 pence\/kg (deadweight), is equivalent to 439 cent\/kg (deadweight).  If converted at the rate prevailing a year ago, there would be a reduction in euro terms of almost 40 cents.<\/p><p>  In the longer term, the industry aims to maximise returns for Irish beef through its Repositioning and Differentiation strategy that focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmentally sustainable, grass-based production systems, full traceability, Quality-Assurance at all stages and superior eating quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRV00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":436,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRV00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Absenteeism","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRV00350"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[40929\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRV00400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide a breakdown of the most recent truancy rates for Dublin broken down on an area basis.","asker":"999","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":437,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[40930\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRV00500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the most recent truancy rates broken down on a county basis.","asker":"999","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":438,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 159 together.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 all recognised schools are obliged to submit an Annual Attendance Report to the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB), which operates under the remit of my Department, on the levels of school attendance each year.

The NEWB receives information and referrals from, amongst others, school authorities relating to concerns for the educational welfare of individual children.  The NEWB advises that when a young person is referred to the Board by a school, parent or another agency the initial work of the Education Welfare Officer is to assess the nature, scope and depth of the problem.<\/p><p>  This action taken then falls into two distinct categories.

In 2011, the Board reports that it worked with 12,062 children and families in providing assistance at this level.  Problems of poor school attendance that are the manifestation of more complex and deep rooted difficulties can take significant time, expert help and on-going support from the NEWB to make progress.

An additional 260 social workers have now been recruited on foot of the Ryan Report.<\/p><p>  The recruitment of the additional 260 social workers is one element of a wider reform agenda within the HSE, through which I believe we can deliver better outcomes for children and families.

The programme has sought to develop the capacity of the sector and organisations to advocate on issues that affect young people and develop evidenced based resources and training to support that work.

One of the aims of the study is to provide evidence for the creation of effective and responsive policies and services for children and families.<\/p><p>Since 2006, Growing Up in Ireland   has been following the development of almost 20,000 children in Ireland across two cohorts: an infant cohort recruited at nine-months; and a child cohort recruited at nine years. The infant cohort children (with their families) have been interviewed at 9 months, 3 years of age and further interviews are planned in 2013 when these children make the critical transition to primary schooling (at 5 years of age). The child cohort children (also with their families) have been interviewed at 9 and 13 years of age. <\/p><p>  It is generally accepted that many causes of poor psychological outcomes in both adolescence and adulthood can be traced back to early childhood. By capturing data on these children in early childhood and following their development over time, we will have a better understanding how, why and when these children experience and\/or overcome psychological difficulties.<\/p><p>A series of Growing Up in Ireland   reports have already been published, one of which focuses specifically on children&rsquo;s psychological development. This report shows that the majority of nine-year-olds in Ireland are developing well without any significant problems in this area of their lives.  It also found that however, one in five nine-year-olds have been classified as showing significant levels of emotional or behavioural difficulties and that certain characteristics of the child (e.g. the presence of a chronic illness) and other factors (e.g. economic deprivation, maternal depression, neglectful parenting style and conflict in the home) make children more vulnerable than others.  Clearly these data have the potential to inform policy and practice regarding children and their families thus ensuring that policies, services and interventions are targeted, practical and effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRW01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection Issues","counter":467,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRW01400"},{"type":"question","counter":468,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[40888\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRW01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she can initiate specific steps for children or their parents where there is a fear of or evidence of internet-grooming; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":469,"content":"<p>If any person has a concern about a child, this should be reported to the HSE Children and Family Service local Social Work duty service.

The Unit&rsquo;s purpose is to improve access to the emergency and elective care system.  Since it was established last year, it has been working to unblock access to acute services by improving patient journeys through the system and by streamlining waiting lists, including GP referrals. I am pleased to be able to say that very significant progress has been made to date by the SDU in relation to both emergency departments and waiting lists.<\/p><p>  A major priority has been to improve access to emergency care and I welcome the fact that for significant numbers of patients, the experience in our EDs has been markedly improved. From January to September, the number of patients waiting on trolleys fell by 22.9% compared to the same period last year - that equates to 14,795 fewer patients. The 30 day moving average (average number of trolleys over 30 days) has fallen by 37.5% in 12 months, from 328 on 19 September 2011 to 205 on 21 September 2012.<\/p><p>  In regard to scheduled care, the other important priority so far has been to tackle waiting times for in-patient and daycase treatment and there has been significant progress in this area also. Since the SDU was formed in July 2011:<\/p><p>- overall waiting list numbers have fallen by 7%<\/p><p>- the number of adults having to wait more than 12 months is down 85%<\/p><p>- the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months is down by 63%<\/p><p>- the number of children having to wait more than 20 weeks has fallen by 61%<\/p><p>In regard to waiting times for routine GI endoscopy services (i.e. scopes), which the SDU began to tackle in May 2012, I am pleased to say that the overall<\/p><p>waiting lists have fallen from 13,349 people to 8, 904, a drop of 33%. In addition, the numbers waiting more than three months have fallen by 66% from<\/p><p>5,062 people to 1,711 people. <\/p><p>  In relation to waiting lists, the next priority for the SDU will be to focus on outpatients. Together with the NPTF, it will take over the collection and analysis of outpatient waiting list data from the HSE from October. This will involve the systematic collection of waiting time data at an individual patient level in a standardised format from all hospitals providing a consultant-led outpatient service.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in this standardised format will enable the SDU and NTPF to target resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  Until then, data on outpatient waiting times are not available by specialty. <\/p><p>  The SDU&rsquo;s focus in relation to unscheduled care is now moving to patient journey time (attendance to admission\/discharge) with the aim that 95% of ED attendees are discharged or admitted within 6 hours of registration and nobody waits more than 9 hours. The SDU is also working intensively to develop best practice hospital sites for patient pathways through unscheduled care. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRY01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":530,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":531,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[40837\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason it takes up to nine weeks to process optical at a clinic (details supplied) in County Meath, when the average time in County Kildare is one to two weeks; the action being taken to tackle this delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":532,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":533,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":534,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[40841\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the position of disability appeals office has not been filled since the resignation of a person (details supplied) in December 2011; his views on whether there is a conflict in having the disability appeals officer subsumed into his Department, a department who's decisions could and would come to the disability appeals officer for assessment; his views on whether there is a erosion of independence in the appeals system with the current arrangements; the longer term plans for restoring the office of disability appeals officer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":535,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[40927\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Office of Disability Appeals Officer has been abolished; if he will outline the current independent process of reviewing decisions in the disability area; the plans, if any, to re-establish this independent process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":536,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 196 together.<\/p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 makes provision for the introduction of very specific obligations on the health services, including a statutory entitlement to:<\/p><p>- an independent assessment of health and education needs {Section 8}; <\/p><p>- a statement of services {Section 11} which it is proposed to provide;<\/p><p>- an independent redress and complaints mechanism {Section 14} if required; <\/p><p>- make an appeal to the independent Disability Appeals Officer {Section 18}.<\/p><p>  The Disability Appeals Officer (DAO) is an independent officer appointed by the Minister for Health whose purpose is to provide an appeals service to people who wish to appeal (i) against a finding or recommendation of a complaints officer of the HSE made under the Disability Act 2005; or (ii) against the failure of the HSE or an education service provider to implement a recommendation of a complaints officer. <\/p><p>  The Office of the Disability Appeals Officer (ODAO) was created to support the DAO in the performance of his\/her functions.

From 2007 staff from the Department of Health were assigned to the ODAO to assist the DAO in the performance of her functions.<\/p><p>  Following the decision in October 2008 to defer further roll-out of Part 2 of the Disability Act for other cohorts, it became apparent that the ODAO did not have the volume of work originally envisaged and by 2011 there was an insufficient quantum of work to justify a full-time DAO position. <\/p><p>  The existing Disability Appeals Officer resigned her position with effect from 31\/12\/2011 and my Department has been in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the filling of this post. <\/p><p>  As an interim measure, a Principal Officer on my Department&rsquo;s staff has been designated to discharge the duties of the Disability Appeals Officer and is independent in the performance of this function. A longer term arrangement will be put in place as soon as possible. <\/p><p>  The provisions for parents wishing to make an appeal have not changed and appeals will continue to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Disability Act. As part of its service the ODAO operates a Lo-Call phone line. Because of the reduced volume of work a decision was made to monitor the Lo-Call number for one hour per day as the volume of calls averages five per week. The person monitoring the calls is an official from my Department, who has worked in the ODAO since 2007 and is now assigned to these duties on a part-time basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":537,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ00650"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[40859\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of patients from County Louth currently waiting to be seen at an outpatient clinic for the first time","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":539,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services Provision","counter":540,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ00850"},{"type":"question","counter":541,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[40877\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the provision of dental service to children at Athy Health Centre, County Kildare has ceased; when this service will resume; if his attention has been drawn to the hardship that is being caused to patients due to the removal of the dental service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":542,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Safety Standards Regulation","counter":543,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":544,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[40900\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to ban the sale of high energy drinks similar to Denmark, Turkey and Uruguay due to reported cases of liver damage, kidney failure, seizures, confusion and arrhythmia associated with energy drink use; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":545,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[40901\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is considering restricting the sale of high energy drinks due to reported cases of liver damage, kidney failure, seizures, confusion and arrhythmia associated with energy drink use similar to Norway which prohibits the sale of these drinks to those under 15 years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":546,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 194 together.<\/p><p>I am taking the Deputy's reference to &quot;energy drinks&quot; to relate to &quot;stimulant drinks&quot;.  The Food Safety Promotion Board (FSPB) commissioned independent, scientific research into the effects of stimulant 'energy' drinks in 2002. One of the main issues to arise out of the report was the need for labelling of stimulant drinks, especially for groups with special considerations.  The groups identified were women who are pregnant <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">and<\/font> children under 16 years of age<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">.  <\/font>The report also recommended that labels should contain warnings that the drink was unsuitable for consumption with alcohol and as a re-hydration agent during sport and exercise.<\/p><p><br \/>  Following this report, my Department wrote to the EU Commission proposing that 'taurine' (an ingredient found in stimulant drinks) be made subject to Community scrutiny. Following a request from the Commission, the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources in the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) carried out an evaluation on the safety-in-use of taurine and d-glucurononolactone as constituents of the so-called &#8220;energy&#8221; drinks.  In 2009 they adopted a scientific opinion concluding that exposure to these ingredients through regular consumption of energy drinks was not a safety concern.    These constituents occur naturally at much lower levels as natural ingredients in food, and are also normal human metabolites. They are used at much higher levels and in combination with different ingredients in energy drinks. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has contacted the EU Commission and they are unaware of any proposal to ban the sale of such products in either Denmark or Turkey.<\/p><p><br \/>  Labelling legislation is harmonised throughout Europe and it is not open to individual Member States to unilaterally change the labelling of drinks products. However, I should point out that many of the recommendations in the FSPB report regarding labelling have been addressed by changes to the  EU Labelling Regulations which now require the mandatory labelling of high caffeine content and suitability warnings for children and pregnant women for foods and beverages exceeding specified caffeine thresholds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Correspondence","counter":547,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":548,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[40926\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRZ01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the timeframe for a response from PAD; if he will confirm receipt of emails of 3 August 2012 and 23 August 2012 (details supplied); if financial assistance is available in relation to this condition; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1099","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":549,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive is committed to answering Parliamentary Questions referred to the Parliamentary Affairs Division within 15 working days of receipt.

There is intensive engagement between my Department and the Health Service Executive to address the overrun in health expenditure.

In overall terms, the number of births to teenagers (i.e. those aged less than 20 years) has actually declined from 3,087 in 2001 to 1,720 in 2011. Overall, this represents a 44% decrease in births to teenagers since 2001.<\/p><p><br \/>  The HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme (formerly the Crisis Pregnancy Agency) is the national programme in charge of developing and implementing a national strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy in Ireland.   The Programme has implemented two national strategies to date and is currently implementing its third Strategy 2012-2016 (to be published). Research carried out by the Programme indicates that the birth rate for teenagers has declined mainly due to improvements in sex education and awareness of contraception. The research has found that the vast majority of young people are using contraception the first time they have sex and every time they have sex.As part of its mandate to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies, the HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme supports a number of teenage health initiatives that work with young people to enhance their knowledge and awareness of sexual health and relationships in both formal and non-formal education settings. For example, the Programme developed <i>www.b4udecide.ie<\/i>, a website for teenagers and their parents, teachers and youth workers which provides information on relationships and sex, as well as dealing with peer pressure and improving self-esteem. The Programme also oversees the delivery of targeted communication campaigns, customised information and educational programmes, and other initiatives across a range of settings and across the life cycle. <\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of services dealing with the impact of crisis pregnancy, State funded Crisis Pregnancy Counselling services are available at over 50 locations nationwide. They are open to young people experiencing a crisis pregnancy who may attend along with their parents\/guardian. A full list of these services is available at <i>www.positiveoptions.ie<\/i>. All of services are available free of charge. The HSE also funds the Teen Parents Support Programme, available in 11 locations nationwide, which offers practical and emotional supports to teen parents and their families. Support is available from the beginning of the pregnancy right through until the resulting child is 2 years of age. CURA, funded by the HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme, also provides a post natal support service for new parents of all ages. <\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to social security, I have been advised by officials in the Department of Social Protection that the One Parent Family Payment (OFP) is available to all teenage mothers who qualify for it.

Officials in the Department of Social Protection estimate that some &#8364;43,995 per week or &#8364;2,287,771 per annum is currently spent on OFP recipients who are aged under 18 years. Parents are also eligible for Child Benefit, and may qualify for Family Income Support, and Rent Supplement, depending on their circumstances.

Periodic reviews of progress across the pillars of the Strategy are carried out through the Oversight Forum on Drugs which I chair.  <\/p><p>  In the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy particular focus is being placed on Programme for Government commitments in areas such as treatment and rehabilitation.  Also a review of Drugs Task Forces is nearing completion and it is intended to build on the impacts being achieved by the Task Forces in the coming years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRCC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drug Dealing","counter":587,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRCC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":588,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[29753\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600080#WRCC01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to reinstate the dial to stop drug dealing campaign; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"984","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":589,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Dial to Stop Drug Dealing Campaign, which aims to provide a safe and confidential means for people to pass on information on drug dealing, has been in operation since September 2008.

The Central Bank of Ireland is the competent Authority in this jurisdiction with regard to licensed moneylending and in overseeing and regulating such activity.  <\/p><p>  Legislative provisions relating to the regulation of moneylending are contained in the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which is the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and unlicensed moneylending is an offence under that Act.  My Department&#8217;s responsibility relates to the involvement of the criminal justice system in dealing with allegations of criminal activity.  Persons who engage in money lending and who do not hold the necessary licence granted by the Central Bank are committing an offence under section 98 of the Act, which provides for a prohibition on engaging in the business of money lending without a licence.  <\/p><p>  Complaints may be made to the Garda&iacute; who have power to bring prosecutions against unlicensed operators.  The powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling illegal moneylending are principally contained in sections 105 to 109 of the Act, which make provision for a number of matters including Garda powers of entry and arrest. <\/p><p>  A person who is found guilty of an offence under the Act is liable, on summary conviction, to  a fine not exceeding &#8364;3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &#8364;100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both. <\/p><p>  I am informed that the latest available figures provided by the Courts Service indicate that no prosecutions for such an offence have been recorded over the past five years.<\/p><p>  There are also a number of provisions in the criminal law which may be of relevance in particular circumstances, for example, section 10 and section 11 of the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 and section 17 the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 which provide for a range of offences including offences relating to harassment, extortion and demanding money with menaces.  While these criminal law measures are being utilised, it should be noted that these offences have wider implications than money lending and there is no information available as to their use specifically with regard to money lending activities.<\/p><p>  With regard to these matters I am assured by the Garda authorities that where offences under section 98 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 are disclosed, and are reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the matter will be the subject of investigation under the direction of the local District Officer, with relevant expert assistance available from the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.<\/p><p>  As I stated before, I would, therefore, encourage those who may have information concerning the operation of unlicensed money lenders in particular circumstances to make that information available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who will take all measures open to them to enforce the law in this area.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">    <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600083#WRR01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Matters","counter":672,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600083#WRR01250"},{"type":"question","counter":673,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[40908\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600083#WRR01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the repossession of property; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":674,"content":"<p>The position is that the High Court judgment to which the Deputy refers has been appealed to the Supreme Court.

Prices have continued to increase during 2012 and are currently at record levels, some 12.53% ahead year on year, or 18c per kilo higher.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am aware of the concerns currently being expressed by the sector, particularly with regard to producer returns and the loose sow housing welfare requirements applicable from 1 January 2013.  On the latter point, European legislation requires the change in sow housing.  To facilitate compliance, an on-farm investment aid scheme (TAMS) &#8211; the Sow Housing Welfare Scheme was introduced under Ireland&#8217;s Rural Development Programme 2007 &#8211; 2013. &#8364;13 million has been made available under this scheme.  Following discussions with producers and the evidence of the initial stages of the scheme, my Department modified and improved some elements of the scheme.  Grant-aid is now available at a rate of 40% to eligible producers with a maximum investment ceiling of &#8364;500,000 for the first sow house, with further amounts of &#8364;300,000 for each of the next three houses.  The closing date for applications has being extended to 31 October 2012 in order to alleviate pressures arising from delays in obtaining planning permission.  This scheme is in addition to earlier Sow Welfare Schemes which delivered over &#8364;6 million to successful applicants.  A number of applications have already been approved and I strongly encourage pig producers who have not yet done so to submit their applications to my Department as soon as possible.<\/p><p><br \/>  While prices, production and export volumes have grown in recent years, high feed costs, most notably cereals and compound feed remain an issue.  Pig producers are especially affected by the increase in cereal prices since June 2009, given that cereals account for 75% of feed.  From a National perspective, the &#8216;<i>Food Harvest 2020 Report<\/i>  &#8217;, which was published in July 2010, sets out the vision for the future of the food industry including the pig sector.  The Report targets a 50% increase in the value of output by 2020.  This is a target set by the industry for itself.  I am personally chairing a High Level Group to ensure that the steps necessary to facilitate the development of the sector are taken.  My Department and its agencies will, along with industry, play a central role in this regard.  For example Teagasc, through its Moorepark pig research facility and the provision of FETAC courses in pig production and benchmarking pig herd performance, plays a critically important role in improving productive capacity at farm level.<\/p><p><br \/>  In so far as international trade in Irish pigmeat is concerned, I have been extremely active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long term trading relationships in the future.  Furthermore, we have hosted inspection visits from a number of other countries and negotiations are continuing with a view to opening new markets and expanding the presence of Irish pigmeat in existing markets.  In addition Bord Bia continues, through its marketing and promotional activities, and through the pigmeat quality assurance scheme, to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets.<\/p><p><br \/>  Pigmeat remains the most consumed meat internationally and indeed in 2011, exports of Irish pigmeat to non-EU markets increased by 25% to 43,000 tonnes. International markets continue to present considerable prospects for Irish pigmeat and I am confident that we are positioning ourselves to benefit from these opportunities.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department and its agencies will continue to work closely with the industry to ensure that it can continue to develop and grow in accordance with the targets in the Food Harvest 2020 Report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600085#WRT01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Responsibilities","counter":721,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600085#WRT01550"},{"type":"question","counter":722,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[40774\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600085#WRT01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the statutory powers that have been delegated to Ministers of State in his Department; and the date on which the statutory powers were delegated.","asker":"970","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":723,"content":"<p>As Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine I retain overall responsibility for all the functions of my Department.

Buoyant European cattle prices in 2011 and 2012 are attributable to a supply deficit throughout the EU and to strong global demand.  In fact, Irish cattle prices have exceeded the EU average level for most of the year to date, with the Irish price for the benchmark grade only dipping below the EU producer price in August when countries such as Germany and Italy experienced supply shortfalls which had the effect of driving up prices substantially in those markets.<\/p><p>  I am cognisant of the export dependence of the Irish beef industry which means that external market developments largely determine Irish cattle prices.  Ireland is a small, peripheral market producing an average of 570,000 tonnes annually, of which some 90,000 tonnes is destined for domestic consumption.  Over the past decade, the profile of Irish beef exports has changed from a reliance on volatile international markets to a focus on higher value consumer markets in the UK and Continental Europe.  Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across Europe.  Securing and retaining such a wide portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years.<\/p><p>  The UK is approximately 80% self sufficient and is, by a significant margin, the main market of Irish beef accounting for around 50% of exports in volume terms.  Irish beef comprises over 70% of total UK beef imports on account of our close proximity to the market and our strong customer profile which includes most of the leading retail, manufacturing and foodservice companies.  In terms of sensory attributes, Irish beef tends to closely resemble the UK's domestic offering because of similarities in our production systems (i.e. grass-fed steer and heifer cattle with moderate carcase weights, fat cover and marbling).  Trade with the UK is impacted by fluctuations in the euro\/sterling exchange rate and the extent of Britain's import requirement which is forecast to increase in the short run consequent on a continuing decline in domestic beef production.  With consumption expected to remain stable and a continuing reduction in the size of national cattle herd, British beef imports are predicted to grow from 381,000 tonnes in 2011 to 417,000 tonnes in 2013. <\/p><p>  A number of factors have been identified to account for the differential between Irish and UK cattle prices.  These include a British consumer preference for indigenous beef product.  In any analysis of comparative prices, it must also be recognised that UK cattle prices are currently among the highest in the EU.  Moreover, a price differential makes Irish beef products competitive in the UK market such that Ireland supplies the bulk of the UK's import demand notwithstanding additional logistical and processing costs incurred in shipping to that market.  When comparing Irish and UK cattle prices, it be noted too that there is a significant exchange rate effect making the UK price appear even higher.  For instance, the current GB R4L grade steer price, averaging Stg &pound;350.9 pence\/kg (deadweight), is equivalent to 439 cent\/kg (deadweight).  If converted at the rate prevailing a year ago, there would be a reduction in euro terms of almost 40 cents.<\/p><p>  In the longer term, the industry aims to maximise returns for Irish beef through its Repositioning and Differentiation strategy that focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmentally sustainable, grass-based production systems, full traceability, Quality-Assurance at all stages and superior eating quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600087#WRV00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":752,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600087#WRV00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Absenteeism","counter":751,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600087#WRV00350"},{"type":"question","counter":752,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[40929\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600087#WRV00400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide a breakdown of the most recent truancy rates for Dublin broken down on an area basis.","asker":"999","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":753,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[40930\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600087#WRV00500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the most recent truancy rates broken down on a county basis.","asker":"999","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":754,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 159 together.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 all recognised schools are obliged to submit an Annual Attendance Report to the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB), which operates under the remit of my Department, on the levels of school attendance each year.

The NEWB receives information and referrals from, amongst others, school authorities relating to concerns for the educational welfare of individual children.  The NEWB advises that when a young person is referred to the Board by a school, parent or another agency the initial work of the Education Welfare Officer is to assess the nature, scope and depth of the problem.<\/p><p>  This action taken then falls into two distinct categories.

In 2011, the Board reports that it worked with 12,062 children and families in providing assistance at this level.  Problems of poor school attendance that are the manifestation of more complex and deep rooted difficulties can take significant time, expert help and on-going support from the NEWB to make progress.

An additional 260 social workers have now been recruited on foot of the Ryan Report.<\/p><p>  The recruitment of the additional 260 social workers is one element of a wider reform agenda within the HSE, through which I believe we can deliver better outcomes for children and families.

The programme has sought to develop the capacity of the sector and organisations to advocate on issues that affect young people and develop evidenced based resources and training to support that work.

One of the aims of the study is to provide evidence for the creation of effective and responsive policies and services for children and families.<\/p><p>Since 2006, Growing Up in Ireland   has been following the development of almost 20,000 children in Ireland across two cohorts: an infant cohort recruited at nine-months; and a child cohort recruited at nine years. The infant cohort children (with their families) have been interviewed at 9 months, 3 years of age and further interviews are planned in 2013 when these children make the critical transition to primary schooling (at 5 years of age). The child cohort children (also with their families) have been interviewed at 9 and 13 years of age. <\/p><p>  It is generally accepted that many causes of poor psychological outcomes in both adolescence and adulthood can be traced back to early childhood. By capturing data on these children in early childhood and following their development over time, we will have a better understanding how, why and when these children experience and\/or overcome psychological difficulties.<\/p><p>A series of Growing Up in Ireland   reports have already been published, one of which focuses specifically on children&rsquo;s psychological development. This report shows that the majority of nine-year-olds in Ireland are developing well without any significant problems in this area of their lives.  It also found that however, one in five nine-year-olds have been classified as showing significant levels of emotional or behavioural difficulties and that certain characteristics of the child (e.g. the presence of a chronic illness) and other factors (e.g. economic deprivation, maternal depression, neglectful parenting style and conflict in the home) make children more vulnerable than others.  Clearly these data have the potential to inform policy and practice regarding children and their families thus ensuring that policies, services and interventions are targeted, practical and effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600088#WRW01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection Issues","counter":783,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600088#WRW01400"},{"type":"question","counter":784,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[40888\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600088#WRW01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she can initiate specific steps for children or their parents where there is a fear of or evidence of internet-grooming; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":785,"content":"<p>If any person has a concern about a child, this should be reported to the HSE Children and Family Service local Social Work duty service.

The Unit&rsquo;s purpose is to improve access to the emergency and elective care system.  Since it was established last year, it has been working to unblock access to acute services by improving patient journeys through the system and by streamlining waiting lists, including GP referrals. I am pleased to be able to say that very significant progress has been made to date by the SDU in relation to both emergency departments and waiting lists.<\/p><p>  A major priority has been to improve access to emergency care and I welcome the fact that for significant numbers of patients, the experience in our EDs has been markedly improved. From January to September, the number of patients waiting on trolleys fell by 22.9% compared to the same period last year - that equates to 14,795 fewer patients. The 30 day moving average (average number of trolleys over 30 days) has fallen by 37.5% in 12 months, from 328 on 19 September 2011 to 205 on 21 September 2012.<\/p><p>  In regard to scheduled care, the other important priority so far has been to tackle waiting times for in-patient and daycase treatment and there has been significant progress in this area also. Since the SDU was formed in July 2011:<\/p><p>- overall waiting list numbers have fallen by 7%<\/p><p>- the number of adults having to wait more than 12 months is down 85%<\/p><p>- the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months is down by 63%<\/p><p>- the number of children having to wait more than 20 weeks has fallen by 61%<\/p><p>In regard to waiting times for routine GI endoscopy services (i.e. scopes), which the SDU began to tackle in May 2012, I am pleased to say that the overall<\/p><p>waiting lists have fallen from 13,349 people to 8, 904, a drop of 33%. In addition, the numbers waiting more than three months have fallen by 66% from<\/p><p>5,062 people to 1,711 people. <\/p><p>  In relation to waiting lists, the next priority for the SDU will be to focus on outpatients. Together with the NPTF, it will take over the collection and analysis of outpatient waiting list data from the HSE from October. This will involve the systematic collection of waiting time data at an individual patient level in a standardised format from all hospitals providing a consultant-led outpatient service.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in this standardised format will enable the SDU and NTPF to target resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  Until then, data on outpatient waiting times are not available by specialty. <\/p><p>  The SDU&rsquo;s focus in relation to unscheduled care is now moving to patient journey time (attendance to admission\/discharge) with the aim that 95% of ED attendees are discharged or admitted within 6 hours of registration and nobody waits more than 9 hours. The SDU is also working intensively to develop best practice hospital sites for patient pathways through unscheduled care. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRY01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":846,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":847,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[40837\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason it takes up to nine weeks to process optical at a clinic (details supplied) in County Meath, when the average time in County Kildare is one to two weeks; the action being taken to tackle this delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":848,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":849,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":850,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[40841\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the position of disability appeals office has not been filled since the resignation of a person (details supplied) in December 2011; his views on whether there is a conflict in having the disability appeals officer subsumed into his Department, a department who's decisions could and would come to the disability appeals officer for assessment; his views on whether there is a erosion of independence in the appeals system with the current arrangements; the longer term plans for restoring the office of disability appeals officer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":851,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[40927\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Office of Disability Appeals Officer has been abolished; if he will outline the current independent process of reviewing decisions in the disability area; the plans, if any, to re-establish this independent process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":852,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 196 together.<\/p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 makes provision for the introduction of very specific obligations on the health services, including a statutory entitlement to:<\/p><p>- an independent assessment of health and education needs {Section 8}; <\/p><p>- a statement of services {Section 11} which it is proposed to provide;<\/p><p>- an independent redress and complaints mechanism {Section 14} if required; <\/p><p>- make an appeal to the independent Disability Appeals Officer {Section 18}.<\/p><p>  The Disability Appeals Officer (DAO) is an independent officer appointed by the Minister for Health whose purpose is to provide an appeals service to people who wish to appeal (i) against a finding or recommendation of a complaints officer of the HSE made under the Disability Act 2005; or (ii) against the failure of the HSE or an education service provider to implement a recommendation of a complaints officer. <\/p><p>  The Office of the Disability Appeals Officer (ODAO) was created to support the DAO in the performance of his\/her functions.

From 2007 staff from the Department of Health were assigned to the ODAO to assist the DAO in the performance of her functions.<\/p><p>  Following the decision in October 2008 to defer further roll-out of Part 2 of the Disability Act for other cohorts, it became apparent that the ODAO did not have the volume of work originally envisaged and by 2011 there was an insufficient quantum of work to justify a full-time DAO position. <\/p><p>  The existing Disability Appeals Officer resigned her position with effect from 31\/12\/2011 and my Department has been in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the filling of this post. <\/p><p>  As an interim measure, a Principal Officer on my Department&rsquo;s staff has been designated to discharge the duties of the Disability Appeals Officer and is independent in the performance of this function. A longer term arrangement will be put in place as soon as possible. <\/p><p>  The provisions for parents wishing to make an appeal have not changed and appeals will continue to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Disability Act. As part of its service the ODAO operates a Lo-Call phone line. Because of the reduced volume of work a decision was made to monitor the Lo-Call number for one hour per day as the volume of calls averages five per week. The person monitoring the calls is an official from my Department, who has worked in the ODAO since 2007 and is now assigned to these duties on a part-time basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":853,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ00650"},{"type":"question","counter":854,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[40859\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of patients from County Louth currently waiting to be seen at an outpatient clinic for the first time","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":855,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services Provision","counter":856,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ00850"},{"type":"question","counter":857,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[40877\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the provision of dental service to children at Athy Health Centre, County Kildare has ceased; when this service will resume; if his attention has been drawn to the hardship that is being caused to patients due to the removal of the dental service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":858,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Safety Standards Regulation","counter":859,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":860,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[40900\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to ban the sale of high energy drinks similar to Denmark, Turkey and Uruguay due to reported cases of liver damage, kidney failure, seizures, confusion and arrhythmia associated with energy drink use; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":861,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[40901\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is considering restricting the sale of high energy drinks due to reported cases of liver damage, kidney failure, seizures, confusion and arrhythmia associated with energy drink use similar to Norway which prohibits the sale of these drinks to those under 15 years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":862,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 194 together.<\/p><p>I am taking the Deputy's reference to &quot;energy drinks&quot; to relate to &quot;stimulant drinks&quot;.  The Food Safety Promotion Board (FSPB) commissioned independent, scientific research into the effects of stimulant 'energy' drinks in 2002. One of the main issues to arise out of the report was the need for labelling of stimulant drinks, especially for groups with special considerations.  The groups identified were women who are pregnant <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">and<\/font> children under 16 years of age<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">.  <\/font>The report also recommended that labels should contain warnings that the drink was unsuitable for consumption with alcohol and as a re-hydration agent during sport and exercise.<\/p><p><br \/>  Following this report, my Department wrote to the EU Commission proposing that 'taurine' (an ingredient found in stimulant drinks) be made subject to Community scrutiny. Following a request from the Commission, the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources in the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) carried out an evaluation on the safety-in-use of taurine and d-glucurononolactone as constituents of the so-called &#8220;energy&#8221; drinks.  In 2009 they adopted a scientific opinion concluding that exposure to these ingredients through regular consumption of energy drinks was not a safety concern.    These constituents occur naturally at much lower levels as natural ingredients in food, and are also normal human metabolites. They are used at much higher levels and in combination with different ingredients in energy drinks. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has contacted the EU Commission and they are unaware of any proposal to ban the sale of such products in either Denmark or Turkey.<\/p><p><br \/>  Labelling legislation is harmonised throughout Europe and it is not open to individual Member States to unilaterally change the labelling of drinks products. However, I should point out that many of the recommendations in the FSPB report regarding labelling have been addressed by changes to the  EU Labelling Regulations which now require the mandatory labelling of high caffeine content and suitability warnings for children and pregnant women for foods and beverages exceeding specified caffeine thresholds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Correspondence","counter":863,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":864,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[40926\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRZ01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the timeframe for a response from PAD; if he will confirm receipt of emails of 3 August 2012 and 23 August 2012 (details supplied); if financial assistance is available in relation to this condition; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1099","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":865,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive is committed to answering Parliamentary Questions referred to the Parliamentary Affairs Division within 15 working days of receipt.

There is intensive engagement between my Department and the Health Service Executive to address the overrun in health expenditure.

In overall terms, the number of births to teenagers (i.e. those aged less than 20 years) has actually declined from 3,087 in 2001 to 1,720 in 2011. Overall, this represents a 44% decrease in births to teenagers since 2001.<\/p><p><br \/>  The HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme (formerly the Crisis Pregnancy Agency) is the national programme in charge of developing and implementing a national strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy in Ireland.   The Programme has implemented two national strategies to date and is currently implementing its third Strategy 2012-2016 (to be published). Research carried out by the Programme indicates that the birth rate for teenagers has declined mainly due to improvements in sex education and awareness of contraception. The research has found that the vast majority of young people are using contraception the first time they have sex and every time they have sex.As part of its mandate to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies, the HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme supports a number of teenage health initiatives that work with young people to enhance their knowledge and awareness of sexual health and relationships in both formal and non-formal education settings. For example, the Programme developed <i>www.b4udecide.ie<\/i>, a website for teenagers and their parents, teachers and youth workers which provides information on relationships and sex, as well as dealing with peer pressure and improving self-esteem. The Programme also oversees the delivery of targeted communication campaigns, customised information and educational programmes, and other initiatives across a range of settings and across the life cycle. <\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of services dealing with the impact of crisis pregnancy, State funded Crisis Pregnancy Counselling services are available at over 50 locations nationwide. They are open to young people experiencing a crisis pregnancy who may attend along with their parents\/guardian. A full list of these services is available at <i>www.positiveoptions.ie<\/i>. All of services are available free of charge. The HSE also funds the Teen Parents Support Programme, available in 11 locations nationwide, which offers practical and emotional supports to teen parents and their families. Support is available from the beginning of the pregnancy right through until the resulting child is 2 years of age. CURA, funded by the HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme, also provides a post natal support service for new parents of all ages. <\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to social security, I have been advised by officials in the Department of Social Protection that the One Parent Family Payment (OFP) is available to all teenage mothers who qualify for it.

Officials in the Department of Social Protection estimate that some &#8364;43,995 per week or &#8364;2,287,771 per annum is currently spent on OFP recipients who are aged under 18 years. Parents are also eligible for Child Benefit, and may qualify for Family Income Support, and Rent Supplement, depending on their circumstances.

Periodic reviews of progress across the pillars of the Strategy are carried out through the Oversight Forum on Drugs which I chair.  <\/p><p>  In the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy particular focus is being placed on Programme for Government commitments in areas such as treatment and rehabilitation.  Also a review of Drugs Task Forces is nearing completion and it is intended to build on the impacts being achieved by the Task Forces in the coming years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRCC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drug Dealing","counter":903,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRCC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":904,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[29753\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600089#WRCC01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to reinstate the dial to stop drug dealing campaign; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"984","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":905,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Dial to Stop Drug Dealing Campaign, which aims to provide a safe and confidential means for people to pass on information on drug dealing, has been in operation since September 2008.

The Unit&rsquo;s purpose is to improve access to the emergency and elective care system.  Since it was established last year, it has been working to unblock access to acute services by improving patient journeys through the system and by streamlining waiting lists, including GP referrals. I am pleased to be able to say that very significant progress has been made to date by the SDU in relation to both emergency departments and waiting lists.<\/p><p>  A major priority has been to improve access to emergency care and I welcome the fact that for significant numbers of patients, the experience in our EDs has been markedly improved. From January to September, the number of patients waiting on trolleys fell by 22.9% compared to the same period last year - that equates to 14,795 fewer patients. The 30 day moving average (average number of trolleys over 30 days) has fallen by 37.5% in 12 months, from 328 on 19 September 2011 to 205 on 21 September 2012.<\/p><p>  In regard to scheduled care, the other important priority so far has been to tackle waiting times for in-patient and daycase treatment and there has been significant progress in this area also. Since the SDU was formed in July 2011:<\/p><p>- overall waiting list numbers have fallen by 7%<\/p><p>- the number of adults having to wait more than 12 months is down 85%<\/p><p>- the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months is down by 63%<\/p><p>- the number of children having to wait more than 20 weeks has fallen by 61%<\/p><p>In regard to waiting times for routine GI endoscopy services (i.e. scopes), which the SDU began to tackle in May 2012, I am pleased to say that the overall<\/p><p>waiting lists have fallen from 13,349 people to 8, 904, a drop of 33%. In addition, the numbers waiting more than three months have fallen by 66% from<\/p><p>5,062 people to 1,711 people. <\/p><p>  In relation to waiting lists, the next priority for the SDU will be to focus on outpatients. Together with the NPTF, it will take over the collection and analysis of outpatient waiting list data from the HSE from October. This will involve the systematic collection of waiting time data at an individual patient level in a standardised format from all hospitals providing a consultant-led outpatient service.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in this standardised format will enable the SDU and NTPF to target resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  Until then, data on outpatient waiting times are not available by specialty. <\/p><p>  The SDU&rsquo;s focus in relation to unscheduled care is now moving to patient journey time (attendance to admission\/discharge) with the aim that 95% of ED attendees are discharged or admitted within 6 hours of registration and nobody waits more than 9 hours. The SDU is also working intensively to develop best practice hospital sites for patient pathways through unscheduled care. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600090#WRY01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":956,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600090#WRZ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":957,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[40837\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600090#WRZ00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason it takes up to nine weeks to process optical at a clinic (details supplied) in County Meath, when the average time in County Kildare is one to two weeks; the action being taken to tackle this delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":958,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600090#WRZ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":959,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600090#WRZ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":960,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[40841\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600090#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the position of disability appeals office has not been filled since the resignation of a person (details supplied) in December 2011; his views on whether there is a conflict in having the disability appeals officer subsumed into his Department, a department who's decisions could and would come to the disability appeals officer for assessment; his views on whether there is a erosion of independence in the appeals system with the current arrangements; the longer term plans for restoring the office of disability appeals officer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":961,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[40927\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600090#WRZ00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Office of Disability Appeals Officer has been abolished; if he will outline the current independent process of reviewing decisions in the disability area; the plans, if any, to re-establish this independent process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":962,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 196 together.<\/p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 makes provision for the introduction of very specific obligations on the health services, including a statutory entitlement to:<\/p><p>- an independent assessment of health and education needs {Section 8}; <\/p><p>- a statement of services {Section 11} which it is proposed to provide;<\/p><p>- an independent redress and complaints mechanism {Section 14} if required; <\/p><p>- make an appeal to the independent Disability Appeals Officer {Section 18}.<\/p><p>  The Disability Appeals Officer (DAO) is an independent officer appointed by the Minister for Health whose purpose is to provide an appeals service to people who wish to appeal (i) against a finding or recommendation of a complaints officer of the HSE made under the Disability Act 2005; or (ii) against the failure of the HSE or an education service provider to implement a recommendation of a complaints officer. <\/p><p>  The Office of the Disability Appeals Officer (ODAO) was created to support the DAO in the performance of his\/her functions. It should be noted that the Disability Act does not create an office which exists independently of the person who holds office and, accordingly, the ODAO is not a corporate body. Since 2007, the ODAO has successfully supported the DAO in providing the appeals service envisaged under the Disability Act. From 2007 staff from the Department of Health were assigned to the ODAO to assist the DAO in the performance of her functions.<\/p><p>  Following the decision in October 2008 to defer further roll-out of Part 2 of the Disability Act for other cohorts, it became apparent that the ODAO did not have the volume of work originally envisaged and by 2011 there was an insufficient quantum of work to justify a full-time DAO position. <\/p><p>  The existing Disability Appeals Officer resigned her position with effect from 31\/12\/2011 and my Department has been in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the filling of this post. <\/p><p>  As an interim measure, a Principal Officer on my Department&rsquo;s staff has been designated to discharge the duties of the Disability Appeals Officer and is independent in the performance of this function.

As part of its service the ODAO operates a Lo-Call phone line. Because of the reduced volume of work a decision was made to monitor the Lo-Call number for one hour per day as the volume of calls averages five per week.

The Food Safety Promotion Board (FSPB) commissioned independent, scientific research into the effects of stimulant 'energy' drinks in 2002. One of the main issues to arise out of the report was the need for labelling of stimulant drinks, especially for groups with special considerations.  The groups identified were women who are pregnant <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">and<\/font> children under 16 years of age<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">.  <\/font>The report also recommended that labels should contain warnings that the drink was unsuitable for consumption with alcohol and as a re-hydration agent during sport and exercise.<\/p><p><br \/>  Following this report, my Department wrote to the EU Commission proposing that 'taurine' (an ingredient found in stimulant drinks) be made subject to Community scrutiny. Following a request from the Commission, the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources in the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) carried out an evaluation on the safety-in-use of taurine and d-glucurononolactone as constituents of the so-called &#8220;energy&#8221; drinks.  In 2009 they adopted a scientific opinion concluding that exposure to these ingredients through regular consumption of energy drinks was not a safety concern.    These constituents occur naturally at much lower levels as natural ingredients in food, and are also normal human metabolites. They are used at much higher levels and in combination with different ingredients in energy drinks. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has contacted the EU Commission and they are unaware of any proposal to ban the sale of such products in either Denmark or Turkey.<\/p><p><br \/>  Labelling legislation is harmonised throughout Europe and it is not open to individual Member States to unilaterally change the labelling of drinks products. However, I should point out that many of the recommendations in the FSPB report regarding labelling have been addressed by changes to the  EU Labelling Regulations which now require the mandatory labelling of high caffeine content and suitability warnings for children and pregnant women for foods and beverages exceeding specified caffeine thresholds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600090#WRZ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Correspondence","counter":973,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600090#WRZ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":974,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[40926\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600090#WRZ01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the timeframe for a response from PAD; if he will confirm receipt of emails of 3 August 2012 and 23 August 2012 (details supplied); if financial assistance is available in relation to this condition; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1099","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":975,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive is committed to answering Parliamentary Questions referred to the Parliamentary Affairs Division within 15 working days of receipt.

There is intensive engagement between my Department and the Health Service Executive to address the overrun in health expenditure.  In the short term, in order to address the 2012 position it has been agreed that cash limits will be imposed on agency and overtime and there will be more intensive management of absenteeism.  In addition, travel and subsistence will be limited and there will be more intensive management of stocks in order to better manage cash.  Other measures are also being undertaken in order to achieve a balanced budget.  These include reductions in services, the use of capital to fund revenue on a once-off basis and the transfer of Department funds to the HSE on a once-off basis.  I have instructed the Executive to provide fortnightly reports on the cash situation.  The Regional Directors are being required to more intensively manage the cash so as to achieve a balanced vote.

In 2011, there were 399 births registered to mothers under the age of 18 years while in 2010 the figure was 483.  In overall terms, the number of births to teenagers (i.e. those aged less than 20 years) has actually declined from 3,087 in 2001 to 1,720 in 2011. Overall, this represents a 44% decrease in births to teenagers since 2001.<\/p><p><br \/>  The HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme (formerly the Crisis Pregnancy Agency) is the national programme in charge of developing and implementing a national strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy in Ireland.   The Programme has implemented two national strategies to date and is currently implementing its third Strategy 2012-2016 (to be published). Research carried out by the Programme indicates that the birth rate for teenagers has declined mainly due to improvements in sex education and awareness of contraception. The research has found that the vast majority of young people are using contraception the first time they have sex and every time they have sex.As part of its mandate to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies, the HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme supports a number of teenage health initiatives that work with young people to enhance their knowledge and awareness of sexual health and relationships in both formal and non-formal education settings. For example, the Programme developed <i>www.b4udecide.ie<\/i>, a website for teenagers and their parents, teachers and youth workers which provides information on relationships and sex, as well as dealing with peer pressure and improving self-esteem. The Programme also oversees the delivery of targeted communication campaigns, customised information and educational programmes, and other initiatives across a range of settings and across the life cycle. <\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of services dealing with the impact of crisis pregnancy, State funded Crisis Pregnancy Counselling services are available at over 50 locations nationwide. They are open to young people experiencing a crisis pregnancy who may attend along with their parents\/guardian. A full list of these services is available at <i>www.positiveoptions.ie<\/i>. All of services are available free of charge. The HSE also funds the Teen Parents Support Programme, available in 11 locations nationwide, which offers practical and emotional supports to teen parents and their families. Support is available from the beginning of the pregnancy right through until the resulting child is 2 years of age. CURA, funded by the HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme, also provides a post natal support service for new parents of all ages. <\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to social security, I have been advised by officials in the Department of Social Protection that the One Parent Family Payment (OFP) is available to all teenage mothers who qualify for it. Figures indicate that there are currently 202 recipients of the payment who are under the age of 18 years. Officials in the Department of Social Protection estimate that some &#8364;43,995 per week or &#8364;2,287,771 per annum is currently spent on OFP recipients who are aged under 18 years. Parents are also eligible for Child Benefit, and may qualify for Family Income Support, and Rent Supplement, depending on their circumstances.  If the Deputy requires more details on these matters, I would advise him to contact the Department of Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600090#WRCC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":1007,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600090#WRCC00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1008,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[39447\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600090#WRCC00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"in the context of Ireland's endorsement of the Council of Europe Disability Action Plan 2006 - 2015, the progress made and the specific measures being undertaken to secure equality for persons with disabilities, in particular with regard to Action Line 8, 9 and 10.","asker":"1015","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1009,"content":"<p>The driving and monitoring functions in respect of the Council of Europe Disability Action Plan 2006 - 2015, reside in the Department of Justice  and Equality.

<\/p><p>- a statement of services {Section 11} which it is proposed to provide;<\/p><p>- an independent redress and complaints mechanism {Section 14} if required; <\/p><p>- make an appeal to the independent Disability Appeals Officer {Section 18}.<\/p><p>  The Disability Appeals Officer (DAO) is an independent officer appointed by the Minister for Health whose purpose is to provide an appeals service to people who wish to appeal (i) against a finding or recommendation of a complaints officer of the HSE made under the Disability Act 2005; or (ii) against the failure of the HSE or an education service provider to implement a recommendation of a complaints officer. <\/p><p>  The Office of the Disability Appeals Officer (ODAO) was created to support the DAO in the performance of his\/her functions. It should be noted that the Disability Act does not create an office which exists independently of the person who holds office and, accordingly, the ODAO is not a corporate body. Since 2007, the ODAO has successfully supported the DAO in providing the appeals service envisaged under the Disability Act. From 2007 staff from the Department of Health were assigned to the ODAO to assist the DAO in the performance of her functions.<\/p><p>  Following the decision in October 2008 to defer further roll-out of Part 2 of the Disability Act for other cohorts, it became apparent that the ODAO did not have the volume of work originally envisaged and by 2011 there was an insufficient quantum of work to justify a full-time DAO position. <\/p><p>  The existing Disability Appeals Officer resigned her position with effect from 31\/12\/2011 and my Department has been in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the filling of this post. <\/p><p>  As an interim measure, a Principal Officer on my Department&rsquo;s staff has been designated to discharge the duties of the Disability Appeals Officer and is independent in the performance of this function. A longer term arrangement will be put in place as soon as possible. <\/p><p>  The provisions for parents wishing to make an appeal have not changed and appeals will continue to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Disability Act. As part of its service the ODAO operates a Lo-Call phone line. Because of the reduced volume of work a decision was made to monitor the Lo-Call number for one hour per day as the volume of calls averages five per week. The person monitoring the calls is an official from my Department, who has worked in the ODAO since 2007 and is now assigned to these duties on a part-time basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600091#WRZ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1047,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600091#WRZ00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1048,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[40859\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600091#WRZ00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of patients from County Louth currently waiting to be seen at an outpatient clinic for the first time","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1049,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600091#WRZ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services Provision","counter":1050,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600091#WRZ00850"},{"type":"question","counter":1051,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[40877\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600091#WRZ00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the provision of dental service to children at Athy Health Centre, County Kildare has ceased; when this service will resume; if his attention has been drawn to the hardship that is being caused to patients due to the removal of the dental service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1052,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600091#WRZ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Safety Standards Regulation","counter":1053,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600091#WRZ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":1054,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[40900\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600091#WRZ01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to ban the sale of high energy drinks similar to Denmark, Turkey and Uruguay due to reported cases of liver damage, kidney failure, seizures, confusion and arrhythmia associated with energy drink use; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1055,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[40901\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600091#WRZ01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is considering restricting the sale of high energy drinks due to reported cases of liver damage, kidney failure, seizures, confusion and arrhythmia associated with energy drink use similar to Norway which prohibits the sale of these drinks to those under 15 years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1056,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 194 together.<\/p><p>I am taking the Deputy's reference to &quot;energy drinks&quot; to relate to &quot;stimulant drinks&quot;.  The Food Safety Promotion Board (FSPB) commissioned independent, scientific research into the effects of stimulant 'energy' drinks in 2002. One of the main issues to arise out of the report was the need for labelling of stimulant drinks, especially for groups with special considerations.  The groups identified were women who are pregnant <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">and<\/font> children under 16 years of age<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">.  <\/font>The report also recommended that labels should contain warnings that the drink was unsuitable for consumption with alcohol and as a re-hydration agent during sport and exercise.<\/p><p><br \/>  Following this report, my Department wrote to the EU Commission proposing that 'taurine' (an ingredient found in stimulant drinks) be made subject to Community scrutiny. Following a request from the Commission, the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources in the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) carried out an evaluation on the safety-in-use of taurine and d-glucurononolactone as constituents of the so-called &#8220;energy&#8221; drinks.  In 2009 they adopted a scientific opinion concluding that exposure to these ingredients through regular consumption of energy drinks was not a safety concern.    These constituents occur naturally at much lower levels as natural ingredients in food, and are also normal human metabolites. They are used at much higher levels and in combination with different ingredients in energy drinks. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has contacted the EU Commission and they are unaware of any proposal to ban the sale of such products in either Denmark or Turkey.<\/p><p><br \/>  Labelling legislation is harmonised throughout Europe and it is not open to individual Member States to unilaterally change the labelling of drinks products. However, I should point out that many of the recommendations in the FSPB report regarding labelling have been addressed by changes to the  EU Labelling Regulations which now require the mandatory labelling of high caffeine content and suitability warnings for children and pregnant women for foods and beverages exceeding specified caffeine thresholds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600091#WRZ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Correspondence","counter":1057,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600091#WRZ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1058,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[40926\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092600091#WRZ01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the timeframe for a response from PAD; if he will confirm receipt of emails of 3 August 2012 and 23 August 2012 (details supplied); if financial assistance is available in relation to this condition; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1099","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1059,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive is committed to answering Parliamentary Questions referred to the Parliamentary Affairs Division within 15 working days of receipt.

In overall terms, the number of births to teenagers (i.e. those aged less than 20 years) has actually declined from 3,087 in 2001 to 1,720 in 2011. Overall, this represents a 44% decrease in births to teenagers since 2001.<\/p><p><br \/>  The HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme (formerly the Crisis Pregnancy Agency) is the national programme in charge of developing and implementing a national strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy in Ireland.   The Programme has implemented two national strategies to date and is currently implementing its third Strategy 2012-2016 (to be published). Research carried out by the Programme indicates that the birth rate for teenagers has declined mainly due to improvements in sex education and awareness of contraception. The research has found that the vast majority of young people are using contraception the first time they have sex and every time they have sex.As part of its mandate to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies, the HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme supports a number of teenage health initiatives that work with young people to enhance their knowledge and awareness of sexual health and relationships in both formal and non-formal education settings. For example, the Programme developed <i>www.b4udecide.ie<\/i>, a website for teenagers and their parents, teachers and youth workers which provides information on relationships and sex, as well as dealing with peer pressure and improving self-esteem. The Programme also oversees the delivery of targeted communication campaigns, customised information and educational programmes, and other initiatives across a range of settings and across the life cycle. <\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of services dealing with the impact of crisis pregnancy, State funded Crisis Pregnancy Counselling services are available at over 50 locations nationwide. They are open to young people experiencing a crisis pregnancy who may attend along with their parents\/guardian. A full list of these services is available at <i>www.positiveoptions.ie<\/i>. All of services are available free of charge. The HSE also funds the Teen Parents Support Programme, available in 11 locations nationwide, which offers practical and emotional supports to teen parents and their families. Support is available from the beginning of the pregnancy right through until the resulting child is 2 years of age. CURA, funded by the HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme, also provides a post natal support service for new parents of all ages. <\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to social security, I have been advised by officials in the Department of Social Protection that the One Parent Family Payment (OFP) is available to all teenage mothers who qualify for it. Figures indicate that there are currently 202 recipients of the payment who are under the age of 18 years.
