Politically, we are living in very interesting times.  In England, there is a practice that when a barrister is being promoted to the bench, he or she does not receive a letter or a telephone call but actually gets what is called a tap on the shoulder.  I have no doubt but that many Members of both Houses are wandering around today, waiting for the tap on the shoulder.  It is a great honour for people to be elected to public office in the first instance and then to be promoted to higher office and, consequently, Members on this side of the House wish every success to those who will be among that lucky few.  However, I am sure Members will deal with that issue on another day.<\/p><p>Yesterday, several thousand people converged on Leinster House for a rally - I use the word &quot;rally&quot; as it was not a protest as such - of rural Ireland, that is, of the ordinary, decent, hard-working people of rural Ireland who in many cases are finding their jobs and communities to be under severe threat as a result of the inaction of the Government in not coming up with a clear solution to and resolution of the ongoing controversy surrounding the future of the county development boards.

I also compliment our colleague, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, who was one of the speakers yesterday and who made a strident and passionate appeal, as he has shown himself to be capable of doing on so many other occasions.  The appeal was to the Government and, in particular, to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to make a decision on the future of the county development boards.  It now appears as though a grab-all situation is under way on the part of local authorities and, in particular, by the executives of local authorities, which is in direct contrast to the wishes of the members of the authorities to the extent that in recent days, a number of councils that wished to nominate councillors to the county development boards have been prevented from so doing for all sorts of what I suggest are vacuous legal reasons that have been put forward.  This happened in my own county, where the county council has deferred the nomination of three members because it was told there could be a legal challenge.  However, I discovered yesterday that the councillors in County Clare, of all parties and none, in their wisdom overruled that particular executive call, went ahead and made nominations.  This also happened in County Donegal.<\/p><p>My point to the Leader is this is a vital cog in the life of rural Ireland.  The people who attended yesterday's rally were not solely those who are concerned about their jobs, although obviously there were people who are working.  In my native town of Drumshanbo, where the Leitrim county development board operates, approximately 40 people are employed either full-time or part-time.  Can Members imagine the impact it will have on that community of approximately 900 souls were 40 jobs to be lost overnight?  The uncertainty surrounding this matter is completely unacceptable.  I call on the Leader to convey to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government the absolute urgency of ensuring that a decision is taken as to what will be the future for the county development boards.  They accept that, sadly, there will be some job losses.  However, neither they nor my party can come to terms with the reason for breaking this model.  If it ain't broken, why fix it?<\/p><p>It has been proven and was stated repeatedly on the platform yesterday that the Irish Leader model is the best in Europe and that other European countries have taken a leaf out of the Irish model.  I fail to understand why the Government is trying to dismantle what has been a hugely successful project over the past 15 to 20 years, which has sustained rural Ireland, has created jobs there and which has given hope to those who have been without work, right across the entire spectrum of economic activity.  Consequently, as a matter of urgency, I call on the Leader to convey to the Minister the urgency of ensuring a decision is taken in this regard.  I will go so far as to table an amendment to the Order of Business calling on the Minister for the Environment, Community and Looking Government to come before this House on this very day.  While it may be his last day, perhaps he will go out with a flourish and will come before the Seanad to give some hope and reassurance to the people of rural Ireland.  Sadly, I must state the Government has gone completely in the opposite direction and has been the most anti-rural Government that has ever been elected to office in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000003#B00500","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1404984600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>That is correct.

I find it slightly annoying that people persist in talking about the delay as though some class of deadline had been put in place, which is not the case.

He has started the changes that are necessary in the education system to retain the things that are good about it and to improve the things that ought to be improved.<\/p><p>On the Middle East and the conflict that is unfolding there as I speak, it is deeply disheartening to hear the same language, the same difficulty and the same entrenched positions, as people yet again are losing their lives in Palestine where the same inflamed situation is happening over again.

I hope the Minister for Foreign and Affairs and Trade or whoever the incoming Minister will be, will do everything he or she can to at least assist, if at all possible, to try to bring an end to this conflict.<\/p><p>Finally, I pass my best wishes to the family of Gavin Glynn, the young four-year old who has just undergone emergency surgery in Texas.  In particular, I thank the people of Ireland for raising &euro;350,000 and showing yet again what an extraordinary spirit we have when we pull together.  It shows what extraordinary community spirit we have when someone is in need.  Clearly, young Gavin's need was greater than most and the people of Ireland came to his aid.

I refer to the Setanta Insurance Company, which is licensed in Malta and has left 75,000 policyholders in the lurch, the cost of which may yet again be imposed upon the Irish consumer and taxpayer.  The Leader and I have discussed that matter in this Chamber.  The company was licensed in Malta and started to get into difficulties in September 2013.  The difficulties were notified to the Department of Finance in January and its licence was handed back to the Maltese authorities in April.  How on earth do the Irish taxpayers and consumers yet again end up paying the bills for badly regulated organisations in the financial services sector?<\/p> <p>We discussed this issue in rushed form in September 2011.  I am aware that the Leader dislikes rush legislation and thanks to him we have not done much of that since then.  We were debating the provision of &euro;750 million to rescue the Quinn Group.  Apparently one result of that legislation is that we are now liable for the debts of foreign companies, such as the Maltese insurance company, trading in this country.  The briefing note provided by the Central Bank yesterday states that, following advice from the Attorney General that charges could not be levied on insurance companies in respect of risks outside the State, we brought in legislation that had the exact opposite effect and we now have to bear the risks irrespective of whether the insurers are based in Ireland or another member state.  If we apply this in banking and other financial services, it is estimated that the debts run up by foreign banks in this country, such as KBC Bank, Bank of Scotland and Rabobank, would bring the &euro;64 billion figure up to &euro;111 billion.  We cannot afford badly regulated companies from other countries to be sending the bills here.  This is an extremely dangerous development and we should seek to amend the 2007 legislation if it has the effect of imposing the burden of foreign financial institutions on Irish taxpayers.<\/p><p>Turning to a more serious matter, I welcome the intervention suggested by President Obama, the Taoiseach, the Lord Mayor and Mr. Kieran Mulvey, who tried to abolish this House, and the Mexican ambassador in regard to concerts.  Yesterday the Leader referred to people who need friends in high places.  All the world is a stage and all the men and women are merely players.  They have their exits and their entrances, and one man in his time plays many parts.  I note that the Taoiseach is standing by his man and is willing to go through a ring of fire to ensure these concerts proceed.

There were various contracts between the promoter and Garth Brooks, the GAA and the hotels, respectively.  There were also contracts with the various suppliers who would be working on these concerts.  They have generated employment for the community and people in Ireland.

A young gentleman from the Czech Republic who is the current president of Leader in Europe has stated that the model now being used is the old Irish model.  The European Court of Auditors has given its imprimatur to this model, which is regarded as one of the great success stories to come out of Ireland and which was adopted by all the European countries.  In such a context, the Government has decided to change our model.  One of the placards at yesterday's rally asked a revealing question, namely, if it is not broken why fix it?  This is a case of the small people - the little people if one likes - asking those of us who have a certain standing in public life to listen to what they area saying.  I hope it will not be necessary to vote on this issue.

That makes no sense.  In any conflict, one has to move forward.  We have only to travel a couple of hundred miles from where we sit to see how dialogue and power sharing works.  Human rights and humanity demand that we do not continue the slaughter of men, women and children in Gaza.

It was heartbreaking to listen to the presentations yesterday from a number of students who have experienced setbacks in their lives.  They may have a disability, a mental health difficulty, an illness or an injury.  They described what a huge impact a &euro;20 cut in the allowance would have on their ability to continue in education.  We need to address that issue.<\/p><p>I am raising this matter because negotiations are continuing between the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste on the programme for Government.  These Houses should not rise without having some debate next week on what they have decided.  Before the summer recess, it is important for us to know what direction this Government is taking.  Will it maintain the promise to promote the recognition of sign language, as well as supporting the deaf community generally?  Will it row back on cuts like those made to SOLAS-funded training?  In what direction are we going?  Will we merely see a change of personnel on the deck, or will the ship alter course?  Many people, including those campaigning for Leader funding, want to see a change of course, as we do.  It is only fair that parliamentarians should be given some indication of what direction the Government will take, instead of hearing it through the media.  I would hope therefore that we can debate that matter before the House rises for the summer recess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000005#D00400","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1404985800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I support Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh on the cut in funding for the National Deaf Society.

He spoke very clearly, as did others, about how this was a very significant example of an Irish success story, that is, the way Leader funding was delivered over the past couple of decades.  It was an example of bottom-up community development and of local development companies, managed by people operating on a voluntary basis, with multi-sectoral representation.  It delivered vital resources to rural Ireland to help close the gap between rural and urban Ireland and to improve the prospects of people's lives and to give employment.<\/p><p>Only a couple of months ago on St. Patrick's Day, I had the honour of being present when the former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, opened a new community centre in my home town of Caltra, which was assisted by the local Leader group in the county.  What has happened as a result of last year's legislation and what is causing great concern to people across this country is that there appears to be a power grab whereby the disbursement of these important resources will come under the control of local authorities through local community development committee.  The question is, why are we fixing it if it is not broken?<\/p><p>Listening to the people on that platform yesterday, it seemed that a very important complement to politicians making decisions was ordinary people helping themselves and that seems be what Leader, and the way it was delivered, was been about up to now.

All of us who have represented a rural constituency would be very much aware of the tremendous work done by Leader projects, with real jobs created by people on the ground.  It would be a shame to see an end to that type of process.  The concept of bringing this closer to local government might be fine but, unfortunately, the sort of local government we now have, especially with the new electoral areas, is very distant from communities.

This is a small state in the Middle East, the only genuinely democratic country in the region, and the people of this country should have a much stronger affinity with Israel.  I appreciate that a balanced solution is required but the presentation of Israel as somehow always being wrong is very incorrect.  We need to open our eyes a little to some of the more profound problems in the Middle East.  Some countries, states, governments and extremists have an avowed policy to destroy Israel and write it off the global map.  It is an aspiration of certain groupings, states and militias in the Middle East.

One can only bring this back to a fact that society is becoming bland and disconnected.  History has been dropped as a core subject and it has been diminished as a topic in second level education.  One must be very worried about that as we cannot go forward unless we understand the past.  Even civics, a subject which is crucial in creating some sort of awareness of the general public, politics and civic responsibilities and duties, as well as what comprises a good citizen, is also being sidelined.  It was diminished over years before coming back into vogue but it is to be sidelined again.  It is a worrying trend in our education system.  We must consider a more holistic approach to education.

In the autumn, if possible, we need to have a debate on promoting the entertainment industry in this country.  It is a significant tourist attraction and the capital city in particular is seen as a place where artists like to perform.  We already know 70,000 people were coming for this concert.  I know thousands of people come when U2 or many other acts come here to perform.  We should be growing the sector rather than decreasing it or ignoring it.

I agree with Senator Crown's comments on the city manager in the sense he ruled definitively on this issue, indicating there was no flexibility and the law seems to be the law in this regard but afterwards offered the option of a fourth concert.  The exact position is open to debate.  I am honestly not sure what the city manager can do at this stage.  Talk of emergency legislation is fanciful.<\/p><p>The statement from Garth Brooks offers some hope of a compromise, and I heard a very sensible suggestion from the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, that he have three concerts in Ireland at the beginning of his world tour and two at the end, which should accommodate everybody.  I take issue with what Senator Crown said about the Taoiseach.  Obviously I will defend the Taoiseach, but in fairness, Ministers travel all over the world on trade missions to try to bring business into the country.  The Ministers at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport go to various parts of the world, at expense to bring tourism to the country.  At the end of the day, the Taoiseach is being criticised for making a phone call to ask people to have a chat about this event to see if something can be done.  That is unreasonable.  Let me reiterate that we do something to amend this legislation, which is the fundamental point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000008#G00900","speaker":"1153","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404988200,"counter":68,"content":"<p>The Order of Business has been dominated by three subjects, Leader programme funding, Garth Brooks and Israel and the situation in Gaza.  Senator Mooney called for clarity in respect of Leader programme funding and county development boards.  I will ask the Minister to come into the House.  We have a great deal of legislation to deal with between now and next Friday, but I will ask the Minister to address that matter.  Let me remind Members that we had a very comprehensive debate when this legislation was on its passage through the House and many Members spoke on that issue at that time.  We are proposing to have a debate on what has been discussed already but I will try to facilitate it.  I am not quite sure whether the Minister will come in to deal with this issue.  Of course, it has been agreed that we will debate the CEDRA report on rural Ireland as soon as the Minister is available.<\/p><p>Senator O'Keeffe complimented the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, on his stewardship of the Department.  She also raised the question of the atrocities in Gaza.  There is a need for an international response.  I have heard balanced views from both sides of the House on the subject and I agree we should have a debate on it but both the Government and the EU have responded in statements calling clearly for all sides to act with restraint.  The Minister has been making representations with his European counterparts on that subject.  Let us hope that sanity will prevail and that we can curb the current loss of life.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett raised the question of Setanta Insurance and I agree with him that it is a disgrace that the Irish taxpayer may be liable for some of the risks.  Proper regulation of this sector is of paramount importance and needs to be done as a matter of urgency, whether it means amending legislation or whatever, it should be attended to as Senator Barrett has outlined.<\/p><p>I mentioned Garth Brooks yesterday and have spoken on it.  We hope that the five concerts may be able to go ahead or some compromise may be reached in that regard.  It is of importance to the business community and all involved in the capital city.  We hope some agreement can be reached in that regard.  I am not going to get into all the cliches.  I never realised that so many Members of the House knew so much about country music, as well as all the song titles as we heard this morning.<\/p><p>Senator Hayden raised the matter of the Samsung Electronics Company investigating claims that child labour may have been used in producing some of its goods.  It will be interesting to find out the situation in that regard.<\/p><p>I note the points made by Senator Quinn yesterday on the proposed national children's hospital.  Senator Keane raised the need for changing the provisions in the local government Act regarding county developments boards.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised a number of issues, which were also raised by other Members yesterday.  Senator Kelly asked for a debate on banking.  I understand there will be a banking Bill coming before the House next week so that may be an opportunity for Senator Kelly to raise the points that he raised today.<\/p><p>Senator Brennan raised the efforts to tackle homelessness and the funding that has been put in place to refurbish houses in many local authority areas.  I am sure that is to be welcomed by all.  Senator Moran raised the question of ambulance breakdowns.  It is an important subject and I am sure all of these ambulances are serviced regularly.  I would be very surprised if they were not regularly serviced but I would agree that the situation should be investigated and I am sure it is being investigated as we speak.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall, from the date of enactment of this Act, be known as the Environmental &amp;amp; Radiological Protection Agency (ERPA).&quot;.<\/blockquote>We covered some of this ground yesterday on Second Stage.  This is a very simple amendment.  We seek the incorporation of the very important function of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland into the name of the Bill.  I hope the Minister of State can easily and readily accept this simple amendment.  Under the Bill the merged body will have two approaches.  One will be the protection of the environment from human degradation, which is the function to which the EPA is generally recognised as being charged with undertaking.  The other will be to protect people from the harmful effects of radiation, which involves a number of functions.  Yesterday we concentrated on the radon gas issue which, as Senator Landy rightly pointed out, is an issue in his area.  It is also an issue in Wexford and other parts of the south and west of the country where there are high levels of radiation, sometimes up to ten times the recommended level.  I carried out a test on our house to find it was marginally above the limits.  We live in an area where we are at risk of very high levels of radon gas.<br \/>Over the years the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has done much work to create awareness about the issue.  This has inspired many people, including me, to use detectors to gauge the level of exposure experienced.  It is very much a silent killer in that lung cancer is often well past the stage when it can be arrested before one realises one has it.<br \/>Last week we applauded the Minister for Health on his efforts to curtail smoking, in particular with regard to plain packaging, and the awareness being created about the risks of smoking.  Unfortunately this does not prevent people from smoking but it has some mitigating effects.  The separate function regarding radiological protection should be fully recognised in the name of the new body in order that the awareness which already exists will continue.  If the merged body will be known as the Environmental Protection Agency it will not convey into the minds of people the issues for which the body will have overarching responsibility.  It would be a prudent and simple step to include &quot;radiological&quot; in the title of the body in order that it will be known as the environmental and radiological protection agency.  I hope the Minister of State can accept the amendment.  Yesterday all sides of the House expressed support for this suggestion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000011#L00800","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1404989100,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I wish to speak briefly in support of the amendment.  A number of us raised this issue yesterday on Second Stage with the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock.  That the merged entity will be known as the Environmental Protection Agency cannot but be a statement about the relative importance of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Environmental Protection Agency.  They have very different functions, as Senator Walsh has pointed out.  While human beings are certainly part of the environment, an agency which has strong and important responsibilities in respect of protecting the public with regard to radiation will be incorporated under the heading of environmental protection, but the protection of the person and individuals is very different from environmental protection.  I do not see any good reason not to incorporate the reality of both merged entities in the new name of the agency.<\/p><p>I did not manage to elicit much information from the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, yesterday, on this particular matter although he was very helpful in other ways.  I quoted a letter from the chairperson of the RPII, Professor William Reville, in which he outlined the concerns of the RPII in respect of the name of the new merged entity and in respect of the need to have stronger statutory underpinning for the role of the new office for radiological protection.  In his briefing to us he stated the RPII felt it had minimal influence on the Department.  It is the prerogative of the Government to lead with the proposal, but none the less one would have thought that in making these arrangements, very close attention would be paid to the concerns of the experts.  Professor Reville was not speaking for himself but for the RPII when he stated that, when these proposals were made on the naming and statutory underpinning of the new office for radiological protection, the RPII accepted the remit of the Government in coming forward with the legislative proposal.  However, it is noteworthy that he saw fit to state the RPII had minimal influence in persuading the Government, or the Government backed up by the Civil Service.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State were to give us an account of his sense of his contact with the RPII on this matter and why it feels it has had minimal influence on what should be a fairly straightforward matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000011#L00900","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1404989100,"counter":88,"content":"<p>It is important that the aims, objectives and good work of the RPII will be continued.

I made the point in that debate, and repeat it now, that it is important the role of the RPII is not lost but the research material provided to us indicates that a working group was set up to ensure the merger works properly.  Senator Walsh is very much a guardian of the public purse in this House but he may not be aware that the cost of changing a corporate name in an organisation such as the EPA, which has a budget of almost &euro;60 million, is a serious amount of money in terms of public funds.  I would be more interested in seeing that money spent on an awareness campaign highlighting that the RPII has merged with the EPA but will continue to function as part of the EPA.<\/p><p>As a member of a local authority, I recall several occasions when representatives of the RPII attended council meetings across the country as part of their awareness programme.  That brought home the seriousness of the issue to those of us in my area in Tipperary where the extent of radon gas is extremely high, and a great deal of work has had to be done by people in their houses to deal with the problem.  I would like to think that function will continue under the EPA but also that there would be an awareness that the RPII still exists as a full arm of the State to carry out its very important work.  I ask the Minister to give some assurances on that.  <\/p><p>When the role of the EPA is examined in the future, and following our Private Members' motion last night, I am sure that will be dealt with because revelations came out last night as part of that debate which indicate that the EPA, as the watchdog in terms of our environment, needs to be scrutinised more deeply than has been the case.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, in what was probably one of his last functions as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, gave commitments to that effect on specific difficulties throughout the country.

I want to give a reassurance, which Senators on all sides are entitled to and the Government is obliged to give, that there is no diminution in the functions or the powers of the RPII, which will be the same as previously.  There is no difference.  The point is that in recognition of its extremely important role in that area, there will be a new division within the EPA, which is the radiological division.  In other words, all the correspondence, statutory powers and functions remain the same but are located within a broader framework in terms of the Environmental Protection Agency.<br \/>It was believed that a more efficient and economic means of merging the two was to dissolve one and transfer all of its functions, staff and assets to the other rather than dissolving both and creating a completely new entity with a new name or whatever.  This approach requires significantly simpler legislation, and incurs fewer costs and less potential disruption to service delivery.  It makes it easier to ensure the ongoing maintenance of the functions of both agencies.  That is why the decision was made.  The merger will not result in any diminution of our commitment to protection.<br \/>If there was a radiological incident at, say, Sellafield and there was fallout over our country, the EPA and the RPII would be actively engaged in dealing with that.  They would both have roles to play.  For instance, it would be very important to monitor drinking water, the soil and air quality.  Those are functions the RPII would have to ask somebody else to do because it does not do that, although it would have to be involved in reading the results and explaining them to people.  The key point is that the change is not to its function.  There will be a new synergy because if an issue arises that has to be dealt with urgently, all the skills needed will be in the one unit.<br \/>The Government, the RPII and the EPA have been proactive in making sure that this merger is done efficiently and is as seamless as possible.  There is a project management group and a project working group, which has representatives of both organisations, as well as the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Both groups have met on a monthly basis to ensure that the merger is seamless in terms of administration, human resources, finance, accommodation, corporate governance and environmental functions and operations.<br \/>Sub-groups on this legislation were also set up.  Both agencies have provided inputs to the development of the principles and policies of this Bill.  Meetings have taken place between board members of the RPII and senior Department officials.  There has been correspondence on the issue also.  The aim of all of that is to get the amalgamation in operation before the summer, an issue that arose yesterday.  The sooner it happens, the better in terms of the financial organisation, the new synergies with regard to human resources and so on.<br \/>This Bill will repeal and amend all the relevant enactments and statutory instruments to ensure that the EPA has all the powers to assume the radiological protection role.  All of the current functions are transferring so there is no change in that regard.  There will be a new division within the EPA, which I believe will meet all of the needs and address the points made.<br \/>Senator Mullen raised a number of points.  I assure him that he need have no worries because there is consultation and involvement.

In fact, there are commentators, including union officials, who will tell one that there is no management in the public service and that there are only grades.  That is a matter of concern.  All one need do is look back at the financial crisis and the difficulties people have in this country to see that there were significant failures within the Department of Finance which, no more than the Central Bank and the Financial Services Regulator, was not fit for purpose.  Unfortunately, the lessons from the crisis that we have learned have not been applied to improve the system in any shape or form, and that is a matter of significant regret to me and to many taxpayers.<\/p><p>This body which had a singular focus will now be subsumed into the EPA.  If the EPA was the dynamic organisation that we would like it to be, perhaps the concerns would not be as significant.  While I am not objecting in principle to the merger, although I might have some qualms about it, the RPII has created awareness of the dangers of exposure to high levels of radioactive radon gas and we are taking steps, through that awareness, to get citizens to take action.  I am concerned that it could to some extent be lost within the remit of the much bigger conglomerate of the Environmental Protection Agency where it will not have that singular focus.<\/p><p>That is not only my concern.  That has been expressed by others, including the board of the RPII who were magnanimous in accepting, as I fully accept, that it is Government's prerogative to decide what should happen in relation to public bodies.

He has expressed to the committee, of which I am not a member, concerns that he and his board have about the loss of that identity, which had been created, within this new structure.  Yesterday, Senator Mac Conghail made the point that branding in any area is important.

It is a pity that it is not being accepted because it is a simple measure.  I take Senator Landy's point that there may be a cost attached, but there is a considerable cost attached to the medical services.  A significant proportion of the budget is spent annually in the HSE and in the health services, and here we have body which is charged with creating awareness to prevent what is a preventable disease.<\/p><p>It also shows the disparity in thinking or a lack of joined-up thinking within Government when one compares the treatment of smoking, which involves a carcinogenic agent and has dire consequences for 50% of those who smoke and who will probably lose their lives through smoking-related disease, which is being tackled vigorously and radon gas, which is equally a carcinogenic agent for lung cancer, the same disease.  A combination of both, for example, has significant additional risk factors for those involved.  While it is the case that we are moving for the sake of saving money - there well be the synergies of which the Minister of State mentions between both bodies which may enable some improvement or joined-up approaches to be taken - and there may be some arguments for doing it, the main reason for the existence of the RPII is to create awareness in that area.

The Department has reassured me on that point.  The Senator is right to stress the ongoing concerns, and the vigilance the State needs to ensure the views of this country continue to be strongly expressed to the Government of the United Kingdom.  Several meetings have taken place at ministerial level.  The RPII visits Sellafield regularly and is welcome.

Twice I was let in and once not.  The time I was not allowed in got great publicity because I had been invited but the people with me were deemed to be in breach of security.  In fact it was a Channel 4 news team which filmed it from the outside.  I think that rebounded on Sellafield.  That was in my role as a humble Senator.  As a Minister of State I deal with it through the Department.<br \/>On a serious note, the Senator can be absolutely reassured.  There is less evidence of discharge as time goes on because of environmental awareness, campaigning and actions by the British Government or the Sellafield management company, which is no longer called British Nuclear Fuels Limited, BNFL.  It is a serious issue and is under constant review.  That section of the EPA will have the same interest, knowledge, capacity to respond, powers and recognition as the RPII has now.  I have no concerns that there will be any diminution of this following the merger.<br \/>I agree with Senator Walsh about the EPA.  I did not hear the debate last night.  I am, however, personally aware of the importance of EPA pronouncements on environmental issues.  I know the independence of its views, the extent of its scientific opinion, its expertise and capacity to listen to communities.  It has always been available to deal with issues in my constituency.  Anybody can write to it.  Everybody will get a response.  It has always met me, visited and been available.  It spoke definitively, <i>ex cathedra<\/i>, with absolute knowledge and certainty about the processes and environmental issues I raised.<br \/>I was in another country recently whose environmental protection agency was much weaker because it was under government control.  It was not a political organisation but it was not entirely independent of the political system as our EPA and RPII are.  The Senator raises an important point about health issues and the campaigning on those.  I congratulate Dr. McGarry and her staff on the work they have done to make the public aware of the dangers of radon gas.  One can visit the EPA website and see the significant issues in one&rsquo;s townland.  These are colour-coded.  The deeper the yellow the greater the danger.  It published a report last week to show where the dangers are and what to do.  Dr. McGarry will lead the section within the EPA that deals with radiological protection.  I have no doubt that the campaigns and the resources put into them will not be in any way diminished.  I will ask her to write to reassure the Seanad on that point and to outline what it has done and is going to do.<br \/>The EPA wrote to every household in County Louth last year to outline dangers and gave out a very informative, professionally produced document which did not alarm people but alerted them.  It encouraged people to get testing done.  I have no doubt that will continue.  I appreciate that the Senator is not objecting in principle to the merger but that he has to push his amendment.  It is right and proper to debate these issues.  I have dealt with the RPII for many years, starting with Dr. Tom O&rsquo;Flaherty, a former chief executive, when I called meetings in my constituency as a councillor - that was a long time ago - about Sellafield.  It was always available to give fair and objective advice.  The merger will not change that role.  The EPA has committed to that.  I am confident the EPA is professional and independent.  It can bring in extra scientists to deal with a particular environmental or scientific controversy, if necessary.<br \/>In response to Senator Landy, the cost of rebranding the merged entity is prohibitive.  There is no need for it, notwithstanding the correspondence the Senator has to the contrary.  There is no diminution of roles.  That is the key point, whatever about the name.  The powers remain the same.  There will be new synergies and savings, notwithstanding the initial cost of the change.  It will be in the order of &euro;200,000 per annum.  It is not a large sum but it is important.  If there was a problem I would say so.  Senator Brennan and I are from the same county and know how important this is for us.  There is no way we would stand over any change.<br \/>The naming and branding were very carefully considered and several options were thoroughly examined prior to the final decision.  The merger working group established to implement the decision to merge the two bodies was made up of senior officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the RPII and the EPA.  It considered the name of the merged organisation in great detail and wrote a report for the Department.<\/p> <p>Several potential alternative names were considered and referred to the Minister.  After further deliberations and taking all relevant factors into account, the Minister decided to keep the EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, name.  This decision was communicated to the RPII, Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, board and the reasons explained along with correspondence.  I hope the explanation of the process is transparent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000014#O00400","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404991500,"counter":116,"content":"<p>The Minister of State&rsquo;s last word was &ldquo;transparent&rdquo;.

Its purpose is to ensure that in the submerging of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, into the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, the functions, operation and effectiveness of the body effectively will continue as it was.  I note that all Members are referring to this as a merger but it is in fact a submerging rather than a merger of the RPII into the EPA.  It will be only one of a number of functional areas or departments operating within that body.<br \/>In addition, it is important that the administration of radiological protection should continue with minimal disruption and should be as uninterrupted as possibly can be achieved within this body.  Unfortunately, the Bill does not contain statutory underpinning of what previously was an independent body.  It also is fair to note that in most European countries, radiological protection is the remit of a stand-alone independent body.  Ireland is going in a somewhat different direction than previously and as a consequence, Members must be cautious as to the effects and implications this will have on the operation of those functions.  This amendment would give statutory underpinning to the office of radiological protection within the EPA.  This appears to be a sensible approach that would ensure there will not be chopping and changing within the organisation, which tends to happen within larger organisations, often to the diminution of the import of the particular focus Members have here on the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  The Minister of State might have noticed that no one is talking about the EPA being affected by this proposal, as it is not.  The real concern is whether the smaller body, which has a singular focus, will have its remit diluted to the detriment of the health and protection of civil society.  The Minister of State is very familiar with the risks attached to nuclear fallout from Sellafield.  Yesterday, Members discussed in this Chamber a controversy that erupted some years ago when a predecessor of the Minister of State found that the system for protecting people, namely, the distribution of iodine tablets and so on, was insufficient.  That was exposed in a radio interview and unfortunately, I am unsure whether the checks and balances that must be in place within such systems will not be somewhat diluted by joining together these bodies, rather than having them function separately.<br \/>While, as I stated earlier, we accept the merger in principle, this amendment provides some statutory protection to the operation of that function within the larger EPA.  This would only enhance the operation and a highly respected remit has been built up within this area.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland was recognised internationally as a fairly effective body in this field.  Consequently, I ask the Minister of State to accept this amendment in the interests of ensuring that what I think is our shared objective will be met.  I do not believe the Minister of State has a justifiable reason for not accepting the amendment and not agreeing to it, if he wishes to meet the assurances he gave, which I accept fully were genuine.  This is a way of ensuring it is not simply a transitory assurance given in the House by somebody who could have a different portfolio next week but will be met.

Section 6(2) states \"References in any enactment ... passed before the dissolution day, or in any instrument made before the dissolution day under an enactment, to the [RPII] shall, on and after the dissolution day, be construed as references to the Agency\".  Section 6(3) specifies that references in any enactment or in any instrument under an enactment that obtained immediately before the dissolution day will be construed as references to the new body.  Consequently, I wish to state categorically to the Senator that all the legal and functions and powers mentioned and any powers that attach presently to the RPII are transferred 100% with no diminution whatsoever to the EPA.  There is no issue in this regard and I ask the Senator to reconsider this matter.<\/p><p>On the other points made by the Senator regarding the cost effectiveness of the measure, the 1992 Act set out that the agency shall consist of a director general and four other directors but this will increase to five post-merger.  Consequently, there will be a director within the EPA who has the responsibility for the office of radiological protection.  That is clear accountability at senior management level for radiological protection.  It will be the function of the director general of the new merged organisation to arrange the distribution of the business among its directors but this must be done having regard to the statutory functions and requirements, that is, the legal functions and obligations.<\/p> <p>I assure the Senator there will be no diminution of powers.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate or desirable to prescribe the divisional organisation of the EPA or to confer one of the offices with a pre-eminent or differentiated status.  None the less, the EPA board, including the director of the new Office of Radiological Protection, will have to continue to ensure that sufficient resources and effort are being directed to meet all of the merged bodies&rsquo; functions.  I have full confidence that it will manage its expertise and resources accordingly.<\/p><p>During the course of the Second Stage debate on this Bill in the D&aacute;il,  Deputy Kitt stated: &quot;[T]he proposed merger makes sense and I support the legislation.  The EPA has the capacity and experience to undertake the work currently under the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland&quot;.  He went on to state: &quot;[T]he advisory, research, licensing and educational role of the Institute can be adequately performed within the framework of the EPA&quot;.  I fully agree with the Deputy in this instance.  I hope this clarifies the issue and demonstrates the unanimous support for it in the other House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000016#R01100","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404992700,"counter":136,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has demonstrated that Fianna F&aacute;il is a broad church.  I support him in allaying concerns about this part of the Bill.  I am hopeful that the ethic of the RPII can improve the ethic of the EPA in regard to the issues I raised earlier.  When I criticised the lack of response by certain organs of the EPA it was based solely on the evidence.  I was not criticising public servants and I would not like any such inference to be taken from what I have said because I have the highest of respect for public servants.  Whenever someone on the other side of the House attacks public servants, I make it my business to defend them.  In a previous debate I outlined a story involving a staff member of a local authority who retired after 39 years of service.  I challenge anybody in any industry to put forward an employee who gave better service to the public than that individual.  I do not like blanket criticism of the public sector based on isolated issues.<\/p><p>I have no issue with the work of the EPA but I have an issue with the fact that it is not carrying out its functions in every case.  It does so in many cases, in which regard I acknowledge the comments by Senator Keane and the Minister of State, but the EPA must be completely foolproof because it is charged with protecting our people and an environment that we will be passing on to our children and grandchildren.

The Minister of State also referred to section 14(1), the purpose of which is to ensure that radiological protection will be prominent in the new structure to be put in place, which will be called the EPA rather than the \"environmental and radiological protection agency\".  The person who is in charge on the dissolution of the RPII shall on that day become a director of the new agency for a term ending not later than 30 April 2016, subject to the same terms and conditions.  That appears to have been inserted purely to protect the salaries of the public official involved, which is standard practice in these arrangements.  I am not so much concerned about the salary, because people are in unions and have protections in the public service, as by the importance of that functionary and how he or she will be held to account at board level.  Why is the termination date set for 30 April 2016?  It would be eminently sensible that whomever occupies that position in future should be a director.  That in itself would give status to the office of the radiological protection agency.  If the individual will become just another executive, staff member or clerk of the EPA, I would be concerned about the diminution of influence of that office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000017#S00300","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1404992700,"counter":138,"content":"<p>The Senator made an important point about the need for continuity in the holding of the office.

As I said previously, that will not quite work in practice because for genuine reform to take root, the senior management of an organisation needs to take ownership of the process.  It is really about persuasion and support.  Again, I repeat the point that the commission is well-placed, once it has developed a good working relationship with Oireachtas committees, to address any instances in which a public body refuses a request or presents a review or action plan that is inadequate.  A Minister or a CEO will not want to be in a position of explaining to the Oireachtas why a particular public body took a stand against complying with its statutory obligations.  For a CEO to have to explain why the body refused to develop a strategy to address real deficiencies in the way to meet its human rights and equality rights obligations would be a very uncomfortable and an unlikely position in which to put himself or herself but, otherwise, the idea that the commission might work with a public body to address identified deficiencies and areas that need attention and invite it and support it in undertaking a review or putting an action plan in place is a very useful addition to the Bill.  Again, I thank Senators Zappone and van Turnhout whose idea this was and which was supported by other Senators.<\/p><p>The second point of difference is that we are looking at evidence of a failure by a public body to meet its human rights and equality of treatment obligations rather than evidence of a systemic failure.  The rationale for this change involves me linking back to something I discussed previously, namely, the inquiry provision.  The inquiry provision in section 35 allows the commission to launch an inquiry if it has evidence of &quot;(a) a serious violation of human rights or equality of treatment obligations in respect of a person or class of persons, or (b) a systemic failure to comply with human rights or equality of treatment obligations; and (c) the matter is of grave public concern&quot;.<\/p><p>The new mechanism we are creating with this amendment should logically fit in before one comes to contemplating use of the inquiry function, and I addressed this on the last occasion we discussed it.  It has the potential to allow the commission and public bodies to work together in a positive way to solve problems before they become crisis situations.  That being so, logically, we do not need to wait until the matter is of grave public concern and can omit this element.  However, if we have evidence of a serious violation of individual rights, then the commission has the option of taking a case to court or assisting persons to take cases as appropriate, so we do not need paragraph (a) of the inquiry function.<\/p><p>We are left then with paragraph (b) which states &quot;a systemic failure to comply with human rights or equality of treatment obligations&quot;.  However, we also want to make this an attractive option for both the commission and a public body.  We propose to do that by not requiring the commission to make a statement that it has found evidence of a systemic failure.  That would be a very serious finding and public bodies might feel obliged to dispute it.  If we take that element out of the equation and merely require evidence of a failure, there might be less inclination in a public body to object and public bodies might find it easier to accept the commission's invitation and its offer to provide assistance as a positive thing, which is what we want to see.  We want organisations and bodies working with the commission to reach ever higher standards in regard to human rights.<\/p><p>As we discussed on Committee Stage, the assistance the commission can offer includes training and, as we know, both the existing bodies - the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission - have been active and successful in this area.<\/p><p>I should stress that the mechanism we are creating by this amendment would not be a power to be used routinely, with which I think Senators will agree.  It should be used strategically to address, in what I would call a learning and collaborative way, real problems and, in so doing, interrupt larger ones developing down the road.  The commission can use this mechanism to help public sector bodies and front-line public servants do a better job.  The commission will have to put its own internal processes in place to be satisfied that it has sufficient evidence.  It is important the commission has its own rationale for going down this route and has reasons to believe there has been a failure before it involves this new mechanism. <\/p><p>As a State agency itself, the commission is obliged to act reasonably and judiciously and would need, for example, to share that evidence it feels it has and the rationale for its conclusion with the public body concerned and take account of whatever representations the public body might make to it.  I hope Senators support this amendment.  I commend the amendments to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000019#U00400","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1404993900,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and apologise for being a few minutes late.  As I understand it, we only have one opportunity to speak on Report Stage, so I want to start with a preface to my remarks on the amendment.<\/p><p>I have found it to be a very special privilege, as part of my Seanad work in this Chamber and as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, to be involved in the shaping of law which will establish the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, a merged body which brings together the archives of the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority - I know of the Minister's previous involvement - their institutional memories and also the heritage of extraordinary public service commitment on the part of all the former staff, members of each body, former board members and commissioners.  I want to put on the record my personal gratitude to Dr. Maurice Manning and Mr. Niall Crowley, in particular.<\/p><p>I am aware, as I know the Minister is, that the international human rights sector, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and, closer to home, the European Group of National Human Rights Institutions, have watched very closely what we have done with this Bill and how we are completing it.  They have seen that the Government has engaged strenuously with civil society groups and individual human rights scholars and experts.  I want to express particular gratitude to the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Ms Judy Walsh of the school of social justice in UCD and the Equality and Rights Alliance.<\/p> <p>I am also grateful to the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority as well as the designate members of Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, for their contributions.  It is because of these robust and democratic changes to the Bill that the new body has a solid legal framework to achieve \"A\" status with regard to the Paris principles.  This founding legislation provides IHREC, as we fondly describe the new commission, with a host of appropriate functions to ensure its potential will have a wide and independent reach.<\/p><p>This brings me to the amendment which proposes the addition of a substantive dimension to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's function with regard to the ways it can support bodies to have regard to eliminating discrimination and promoting and protecting the human rights and equal opportunities of its staff and the people it serves.  The Minister, in her reflections on the substance of the amendment, provided a comprehensive insight into what the commission will be able to do and the potential impact of its actions in this regard.<\/p><p>I will add a few words on our efforts in respect of the amendment in its original form.  In addition to the commission having an opportunity to provide guidance and encouragement to public bodies through guidelines or codes of practice, the amendment proposes that it can use this new mechanism to invite the public body in question to undertake an equality and human rights review or prepare an equality and human rights action in support of the performance of its public duty.   As stated in the amendment, the trigger for the use of this tool is when the commission considers that there is evidence of a failure by the public body to perform its functions in a manner consistent with public duty.  The original amendment used the words &quot;systemic failure&quot;.  As the Minister outlined, the removal of the word &quot;systemic&quot; increases the potential for using this mechanism, enhances the independence of the commission in its use and expresses trust in the commission that it will come to appropriate decisions on the use of this mechanism.  As the Minister stated, it will not act always or often but when it needs to do so.  The text of the amendment reflects a positive change to the original wording. <\/p><p>I emphasised previously that the amendment provides the commission with a tool to secure an integrated approach and set of practices to the human rights and equality strands of its work.  If used strategically and well, it may also avoid the need for an inquiry down the track.<\/p><p>As the Minister is aware, we proposed an earlier version of the amendment on Committee Stage.  We express our gratitude to her and her officials for accepting the principle behind our amendment and, in doing so, we also acknowledge the stamp of her leadership on the Bill.<\/p><p>As Independent Senators, we are pleased to support the amended version of our original idea.  I and other Senators are aware, as is the Minister, that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission-designate is recruiting a chief commissioner and new director.  They will join the outstanding group of IHREC commissioners-designate and staff.  Our job, as law-makers, is almost complete and it is my hope that this legislation will be a good base upon which the commission undertakes the challenge of merging two cultures into one and utilising old and new powers to protect and promote human rights and equality in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000019#U00500","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404994500,"counter":192,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome, as always.

On the last day we also referred to some of what is contained in my amendment.<br \/>We tend to have some sectors of the economy which compete internationally and act as a model for the economy, of which the Minister has been champion by adding between 60,000 and 70,000 jobs annually.  The international trading sector has helped to tide us over a period when, to solve some of our debt problems, we had to deflate domestic demands.  The sector is very competitive while others are not.  The Minister mentioned some of them when he referred to liaising with other agencies.  They may not be competitive due to regulatory capture or due to being sheltered from the international winds of competition.<br \/>We support section 10(4) which states:<blockquote>The Minister may request the Commission to carry out a study or analysis of&mdash;(a) any issue relating to consumer protection and welfare,<br \/>(b) any practice or method of competition affecting the supply and distribution of goods or the provision of services, or<br \/>(c) any other matter relating to competition.<\/blockquote>My amendment adds to the provision by referring to the work of the competitiveness council, or any evidence that comes to the Minister's mind, or if people from outside the country say a service in Ireland is expensive in comparison with what they thought it would be from their experience in whatever country they come from, such as Canada or Germany.  One of the current issues of concern to me is that, even after years of domestic devaluation and promoting export-led growth, we still appear to have higher construction costs than Germany.  If the Minister and commission feel these matters are important, let us investigate and strengthen the hands of Ministers and the Oireachtas in order to have a competitive economy.  The purpose of my amendment is to assist the Minister in strengthening the Bill and, in the process, benefit us all by making the economy competitive.<br \/>My amendment also calls for the commission to have the power to intervene where it feels services and goods of any kind are too expensive for overall national competitiveness.  The Irish economy depends a great deal on export-led growth and faces, as a small open economy, a lot of competing imports in the traded sectors.  We do not want to burden either the exporters or those facing competing imports with excess costs for services of any kind within this economy.

Subsection (3)(n) provides that the commission, &quot;shall, as it considers appropriate, conduct or commission research, studies and analysis on matters relating to the functions of the Commission and may publish, in the form and manner that the Commission thinks fit, such findings as it considers appropriate (which may consist of, or include, a study or analysis of any development outside the State).&quot;  It has the power to study any sector that it considers is a sheltered sector of the economy.<br \/>Subsection (3)(a) provides that the commission:<blockquote>may, and shall at the request of the Minister, advise and, as appropriate, make recommendations to the Government, the Minister, any other Minister of the Government, any Minister of State, any public body or any prescribed body within the meaning of <i>section 19<\/i>in relation to any matter concerning, or which the Commission considers would be likely to impact on -(i) consumer protection and welfare, or<br \/>(ii) competition,<br \/>or both.  <\/blockquote>Between those two sections it has all the powers it needs to carry out an exploratory study to identify findings and to make whatever recommendations it believes are appropriate to Ministers.

I think it has all the powers in the Bill that the Senators believe are necessary.  To be fair, over the years, it has made a number of recommendations.  Some would say that those recommendations were not acted upon with sufficient determination in the past.  With the arrival of the troika to our shores, the various recommendations of the Competition Authority became a much greater focus of attention and many of those changes in areas of the sheltered sector have been made.  Last year it conducted a study into the ports sector to ascertain whether it needs to improve competition and so on.  It does have those powers and we are careful to make sure those powers are protected in the new competition and consumer protection commission.

The reason was that I had been involved in a hotel where one of the directors asked the manager to put a bright young attractive woman behind the reception desk.  The manager said there was a very good woman in the position.  The director again said he would like a bright young attractive woman in the position.  The manager then asked what he would do with the older lady in the position, to which the director replied, &quot;Just get rid of her&quot;.  I regarded that as very wrong.  Therefore, I sought to include &quot;age&quot; as one of the grounds on which one could not be dismissed and it was accepted.<\/p><p>I was very impressed when I received two letters the following week from trade unionists who said they had the Bill circulated to them and all their members and they had not thought of that issue.

Article 3(1) of that directive provides that \"this directive shall apply to unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices.\"  The Consumer Protection Act 2007 is, therefore, more concerned with what happens before, during and after a transaction rather than the status of the trader who engages with the consumer.  The Act defines \"trader\" as \"a person who is acting for purposes related to the person's trade, business or profession.\"  This is a wide definition and, therefore, any natural or legal person engaged in business to consumer transactions such as selling or offering to sell goods or services to consumers will have to adhere to fair commercial transacting.  The legal status of the body, or how it is financed, does not affect the applicability or otherwise of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  Public bodies, therefore, qualify as \"traders\" when they engage in commercial activities with consumers and are already liable to the enforcement provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 should they engage in unfair commercial practices.

This replicates the system that currently exists for the Competition Authority.<\/p><p>The mechanics of advertising, interviewing and then taking into account the need for successful applicants to give some months&rsquo; notice to their current employers - possibly up to three months - means that the entire recruitment and selection process could take a number of months to conclude, during which period the commission would not be allowed to function without the requisite membership if a number of vacancies had arisen.<\/p><p>Thus, the Bill replicates, at section 12(5), the provisions of the Competition (Amendment) Act 2010 which allows the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to appoint whole-time members for a short period to provide cover up to the point when whole-time members are appointed following the holding of a PAS competition.  In that context, as laid out in section 12(10) and section 12(11) of the Bill, such members may only be appointed for an initial maximum period of six months, with a further period, or periods, allowed provided the total period for that temporary member does not exceed 12 months.  This provision was utilised in 2010 and appointments were made for less than the 12-month period.  In addition, replacements were put in place within a very short time to ensure that the authority had its member complement.<\/p><p>Section 12(3)(b) also replicates the provisions of the Competition Act 2002 regarding the appointment of temporary whole-time members to address a situation where a member is temporarily unable to discharge his or her duties.  Such provisions are intended to cover illness of a member or unavailability to attend a meeting of the commission if that member is out of the country and cannot take part in that meeting with a knock-on impact on the statutory quorum for that meeting.  Thus, they are of very short duration and very specific to a given unforeseen situation.  They have, in the case of the Competition Authority&rsquo;s experience to date, consisted of members of staff being appointed for limited periods to ensure authority meetings could take place with the required quorum, often at short notice.<\/p><p>In summary, if a longer-term vacancy arises, the provisions under sections 12(5), 12(10) and 12 (11) will operate.  If there is a shorter-term vacancy, then section 12(3)(b) comes into operation.<\/p><p>It is not clear if the proposed amendment applies to both types of vacancy or just one type only.  If it relates to the longer-term vacancy, the provisions of sections 12(5), 12(10) and 12(11) will operate and replacements have to be found quickly.  If there is a shorter-term vacancy, then section 12(3)(b) operates and, as these are only temporary appointments appointed at short notice, there does not appear to be any requirement to set a time period.<\/p><p>Therefore, I do not believe that the proposed amendment is necessary and I am not in a position to accept it.  The competition board is not a board like the board of Enterprise Ireland where effectively the Minister appoints the board.  These are statutory positions that people hold and they are filled by way of a public competition.  Once a vacancy arises there would be no reason for not advertising that vacancy.  Seeking to constrain the selection process in the way the Senator is suggesting does not serve any interest.<\/p><p>The history has shown that the authority has had to make use of the provisions of the Bill to ensure that important statutory duties can be conducted in a timely way when they need to be.  In the nature of some of the issues that the competition and consumer protection commission will be dealing with, it needs to be in a position to respond quickly and make decisions, as appropriate, on important matters.

We had a fear over board positions generally not being filled.  Given the Government's track record on this, we believe that the solution is to have a timeframe within which positions should be filled rather than trying to circumvent that by allowing boards to continue to do their work without the full complement of positions being filled.

It is important in the Minister&rsquo;s discussions with the new body, the competition and consumer protection commission, that he makes it clear it does not opt out of the tackle after the first response from producer groups.  Producer groups are extremely powerful, organised and achieve regulatory capture while consumers are disparate, badly organised and can be easily crushed.  By combining competition and consumer protection, I hope the new body will take up the cudgel against producer dominance.  For instance, when the Irish Water legislation was going through the House, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government refused amendments to allow any role for the National Consumer Agency or that the Competition Authority should look at an industry which was being monopolised.  The consumer lobby, strengthened by this legislation, must be willing to lock horns and not just send in a submission which will be ignored.<\/p><p>I am sure the Minister will share the aspiration that the body will stay in longer to battle consumers&rsquo; interests.

These are fairly draconian powers where the commission is actually investigating a serious breach of competition law.  The Senator is raising a more general view.  Essentially, the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency have the right to comment on legislation coming before the Government which they do frequently.  They have been given that privileged position which is not available to any other body, as legislation generally only circulates to other Departments.  These bodies have the role of protecting consumers from anti-competition activity.<\/p><p>They are not always acted upon.  When one is forming public policy, competition or the consumer is not the sole issue.  We have had debates on proper planning, for example.  The Competition Authority would have a clear view about proper planning for supermarkets and the freedom of establishment, whereas some public policymakers would take a different view on the need to protect our town centres and look at other wider issues.

One must ask why there are so many lobbyists in Washington, London and Brussels.  As was discussed earlier, producer groups treat government as something to be manipulated while they achieve capture over agencies.  Producer groups are well-organised with professional advisers while consumers are disparate and badly organised.  No one consumer spends more than a fraction of income on any one commodity, whereas for big producers all of their income comes from one commodity.  Put the two together and one gets unequal competition.<br \/>In the past in Europe, we had one airline per country which got together and had their parent governments rubber-stamp their fares.  When the market was opened up, fares fell by 55% on the very first day.  This was a form of regulation by the then transport Department and the Civil Aviation Authority in the UK which were both out of touch with reality.  A regulatory body can get documents from the producers which it accepts without saying anything.  Consumers have no alternative but to grin and bear it.  Alfred E. Kahn pointed this out in the United States when he abolished the Civil Aeronautics Board.  If it had been left in place, the airlines would still continue to lobby to get special consideration.<br \/>There are concerns about the effects of large corporations in achieving regulatory capture.  If there is evidence of this, then the new agency should intervene on behalf of the consumer.  It is a worldwide concern.  For instance, while the world appears to becoming more unequal, certain large corporations can get governments to do whatever they like through the powers of lobbying and regulatory capture.  They get richer while the rest of society does not.<\/p> <p>Some of the Thomas Piketty literature comes in there.  I do not know if this has been addressed in Irish law before, although the Minister referred to it in his response to an earlier question.  Consumers are unequal when they deal with very large corporations, and very large corporations achieve control over government agencies which, as the Minister said, even when put back on the rails to represent consumers, revert to being dominated by producers.<\/p><p>We previously referred to the 55% increase in the public service obligation payment, PSOP, required to be added to every electricity bill.  Part of the rationale given is that due to reduced international energy prices Ireland is uncompetitive by international standards, therefore the cost of protectionism rises and the PSOP must increase.  Although there are arguments that this achieves security of supply, if international prices are decreasing it is good for Ireland and we can participate in the export-led growth which the Minister supports.<\/p><p>ComReg's opposition to the importation of gas from the US through the Shannon Estuary on the basis that it would leave the pipeline to the UK as a stranded asset could be used as an excuse not to do anything.  One could have argued that one should not have built railways because it would have left the canals as a stranded asset, or roads because it would have left the railways as a stranded asset, or that one should not build a new airport because it would leave the old airport as a stranded asset.<\/p><p>Sooner or later, the new CCPC, the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice and Equality will have to address this factor because it seriously distorts resource allocation in the modern economy.  There is much literature on it, to which the Minister alluded.  There may be a bias that can lead a reasonable person to favour producers having an undue influence on regulatory bodies.  In my experience, such producers do not answer very effectively when they are brought before Oireachtas committees.  If this is the case, somebody must say that it looks as if certain interest groups - the construction industry, farmers, the professions - have acquired an undue influence.  After what happened in 2008 we would have to include bankers and the people who are supposed to be regulating them in the list.  If these bodies do not serve the wider public interest, the broadly based body the Minister proposes must research, publicise and counteract regulatory capture.  The evidence is that the problem is large and damages the wider public interest.  If there is any way we can accommodate that here or elsewhere, I would be grateful for the Minister's thoughts on developing a competitive Irish economy.  It is an elephant in the room which we can no longer ignore.  I am sure the Minister and his OECD colleagues will have also discussed it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000025#BB00500","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404997500,"counter":250,"content":"<p>No doubt the Senator is correct that there have been instances of regulatory capture or where people might take the view that a regulator has been unduly influenced by producers.  The new CCPC must be alert to this.  The two bodies have had no compunction about challenging practices that might be evolving in sectors which they do not believe in the interests of consumers.  The Senator's amendment is to section 19, which provides for co-operation between the commission and certain of these regulations.  Under this section, there would be the capacity for exchanges of information, conducting joint analyses to reach a shared understanding of certain issues and to understand the performance of their functions.  I can only see it as beneficial that the CCPC would have co-operation agreements with some of the bodies such as the Financial Regulator or ComReg.  Those co-operation agreements will result in better understanding, more sharing of information and analysis, and more influence for the consumer view within the regulator, and this would be beneficial.<\/p><p>It is unclear what the Senator's provision would do.  Already, the Competition Authority has ample powers both of investigation into specific sectors and of making recommendations to Ministers in respect of instances where it believes regulatory capture is occurring.  Where a regulator scrutinises a sector as a whole, there will be a series of policy objectives in the sector which may not be restricted to concerns about competition and consumers.  The Senator can well conceive of considerations, such as safety issues, which might be involved in the bodies.  Those regulators report to their respective Ministers and have responsibilities under their Acts according to the provisions of those Acts.  The Competition Authority has ample powers to challenge what it believes are bad practices in a marketplace and the development of these co-operative agreements will serve only to improve its capacity to influence.<\/p><p>Although the Senator's amendment is undoubtedly well intentioned, in that it would alert the commission to the possibility of regulatory capture, from a legislative point of view it does not serve any new purpose.  The CCPC's predecessors have shown ample understanding of the dangers.  The Senator cited instances when they have leaned against the view of another regulator, for example the taxi regulator.  The legislation will give the CCPC greater powers in many instances and I hope the influence of the two predecessor bodies will grow with the merger.  I see this as leveraging more benefit for consumers.

The Minister mentioned water.  We tried to get a consumer dimension into the Irish Water legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, was badly advised not to accept the amendments proposed in the Seanad by Senators Cullinane and &Oacute; Clochartaigh, me and others.  Recently, Ben Dunne said that if he had a shop and 40% of the stock disappeared, he would not blame the customers.  If 40% of the water is wasted, why is that visited upon the customers?  The equivalent body in the UK, a specialised body from water regulation, found that if left to themselves, engineers invested approximately 40% more than is indicated because it becomes a form of welfare for engineers.  We have a metering target of 100% while the UK's metering rate is approximately 40%, which means they can charge for water without spending &euro;600 million, or whatever we are spending on meters.  Left to the engineers, they will continue to do it.<\/p><p>There is no evidence that ComReg has yet acquired any expertise to take on the sector.  The excuse was that people such as Senator Barrett would complain if the Government created a special regulator for water - and there is probably some truth in that - and therefore it was thrown in with energy.<\/p> <p> The Competition Authority was unable to get any response from the National Transport Authority about opening 10% of bus routes.  What routes were chosen and was there any indication of the economics of these routes so people would know whether to apply?  It was just a matter of taking it or leaving it.  It was much the same when the newly-promoted deputy leader of the Labour Party put a 91% barrier before new entrants to the taxi business by requiring them to have a wheelchair-accessible vehicle but did not put the burden on incumbents.  The Competition Authority at that stage may have got a polite request to butt out, and producer bodies will keep that up.<\/p><p>We have lost 300,000 customers from the health insurance sector and there has been a massive increase in costs.  The Minister may say some of this is to recoup the cost of hospital beds but although the State lost cases in the Supreme Court and the European court, it still implements policies to benefit its own health insurance company and not open competition.  For example, it has never produced evidence that other companies refused to recruit old people or put them at any financial disadvantage.<\/p><p>I share the Minister's aspiration to get better representation for the consumers of energy, insurance such as health insurance and transport, including air travel.  This is just not working very well, if this is meant to be a review of customer rights protection in this country.  Consumers are at the back of the queue and the culture of our public services will always favour the incumbent State company and its way of doing things.  It is not just an Irish syndrome but we are a pretty pronounced case, as one can see in the examples I provided.  According to Dr. Vincent Power there has never been a court case by the commission to implement competition policy.  A stronger line is needed in this respect.<\/p><p>As of yesterday, it seems the Irish taxpayer will be called upon to bail out 75,000 customers of a Maltese insurance company called Setanta.  That arises because of a 2011 Act - when we all came here - which bailed out Quinn Insurance for over &euro;700 million.  Even if people insure with companies outside the country, the Irish consumer seems to bear the burden.  Another aspect of a degree of capture in an industry is moral hazard, with inefficient companies repeatedly bailed out at the expense of consumers who had the wit to choose an efficient producer or those which had the wit not to engage in the inefficient practices that led to the other bankruptcies.  If we go down the road that we will now bail out inefficient foreign producers of financial services, the estimate is the bill will rise from the infamous &euro;64 billion for bailing out Irish banks to &euro;117 billion.  That is the amount that Rabobank, the Belgian banks and the UK banks lost in this country.<\/p><p>The bankers get together and the producers get together but the consumers get big bills.  I want to see a new agency getting in far more tackles than we have seen until now and not opting out so easily when these issues arise.  A large number of elements dealt with in the section are examples of how the consumer has not been well served.  In Parliament we find it very difficult to get any redress, so we hope there is an ally in both the Minister and the new competition and consumer protection agency.  Regulatory capture is a factor with which we have not really displayed much energy.  Our performance would be more akin to the Brazil soccer team than that of Germany in tackling some of these problems.  I hope the new body will put more energy into the issue, as the results have not been going our way heretofore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000026#CC00300","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404998100,"counter":253,"content":"<p>The Senator's amendment does not help the issue.

This is a provision to ensure the various regulatory bodies take competition and consumer protection issues more seriously and embrace them in an arrangement between the competition and consumer commission and the regulatory body in question.

The reason we could not give Cork Airport autonomy recently was because airport management love building terminals and one was built for &euro;168 million and we do not know what to do with it.  Shannon Airport, on the other hand, was given autonomy.  Negotiations on airport charges, for example, must start on the basis that the people in charge love building terminals but consumers may be less enamoured and particularly when they must pay for them.  Charges increased by 40% in order to pay for Terminal 2 in Dublin and only now has tourism returned to the level where we want it.  There was a problem with higher air fares and the original decision ignored the views of consumers.<\/p> <p>There is quite a tradition of that in the other fields, some of which the Minister referred to.  <\/p><p>The starting point in these agreements must be an uphill one for the consumer and the competition interests.  The bodies are used to being dictated to by producers but we should spin them around, for which the Minister has my support, and insist they give an even break to the consumer.  That has not been the tradition because they usually support incumbents.  In that kind of economics the new entrants are the worthwhile people and the incumbents are the people who usually try to obstruct competition.  <\/p><p>I thank the Minister for his fine observations and share his sentiments.  Perhaps he would make some of the points stronger, thus recognising the tradition where the producer dominates and consumers do not.  It is an uphill struggle and I wish him, his Department and the new agency every success in that goal.  It is not an attractive starting point in many places.  We are willing, in the case of health insurance, to defy the European court and the Irish Supreme Court because we have a particular view of the market and are going to make the consumption of that product compulsory.  In the insurance case there is regulatory failure, which was considered by the finance committee yesterday.  We need a mechanism that allows the consumer agency to say it would like the insurance sector to be better regulated here, particularly as half a dozen insurance companies have gone broke, and for it to be financed by a fund paid for by consumers.  I share the Minister's goal and, therefore, will not push my amendment but remind him that we are not at a propitious starting point.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned the interests of different Ministers.  A lot of Ministers favour their own sectors against the wider competitive implications for the economy.

That is why I stipulated reports had to be published before 30 June of the following year.  After a short period the different Departments decided that no matter what happened they would include the proviso that a report must take place by 30 June, which was also included in this legislation.  Today I ask the Minister to consider having an annual report published earlier than 30 June.  I was delighted to hear what he said about another item that I argued strongly for in the past.<br \/>Section 32(4) states, &quot;The Commission shall arrange for an annual report that has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas in accordance with <i>subsection (1) <\/i>to be published on the internet as soon as practicable after copies of the report are so laid.&quot;  Section 32(4)states, &quot;The Commission shall not later than 30 June.&quot;  I suggest the date is amended to 31 March as it is now possible to compile a report a lot earlier, particularly an annual report, rather than automatically wait until June.

Unfortunately the Bill has not dealt with an anomaly that has existed for a long number of years in competition legislation.  As the Minister will know, this fact was acknowledged by the social partnership agreement called Towards 2016.  In light of previous discussions, I declare that I have been lobbied on this issue by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and SIPTU.   They raised concerns with me about the Minister not taking the opportunity to deal with a long running issue.  <br \/>I want to put the issue in context and remind everyone of what we are talking about.  SIPTU had a collective agreement with the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland which set a minimum rate of pay, overtime and rest breaks for voiceover actors.  In 2004, the Competition Authority ruled that the agreement was in breach of section 4 of the 2002 Competition Act as each writer was, in effect, a business undertaking or, in layman's terms, a business.  <\/p> <p>They decided it was unlawful for these undertakings to agree to fixed prices, as they put it, for the sale of their services.  The Competition Authority then went on to threaten to fine both Equity and SIPTU &euro;4 million if either sought to use the collective agreement in place.  The unions argued at the time that a gun was put to their head, signed up to the Competition Authority's agreement.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions pressed the Competition Authority to review its decision, which it did, and unfortunately it upheld its decision in 2006.  After this SIPTU and the National Union of Journalists looked to social partnership to pursue legislative change.  It has to be said that they had greater success with the former Government than with this Government.<br \/>Let me read from the social partnership agreement 2016 which states:<blockquote>The Government is committed to introducing amending legislation in 2009 to exclude voice-over actors, freelance journalists and session musicians, being categories of workers formerly or currently covered by collective agreements, when engaging in collective bargaining, from the provisions of Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2002, .....<\/blockquote>It then goes on to discuss the logic of that.<br \/>Unfortunately they have had less success with this Government than they had with the previous Government.  My understanding is that negotiations between ICTU and the Labour Party and Fine Gael parties broke down in 2012.  I suppose yet again this is the Labour Party in government failing to progress the rights and protections of vulnerable workers.  In 2012, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions wrote to the Minister seeking an exemption from the Competition Act.  It is my understanding that in 2013, the Minister's private secretary told the unions the troika was blocking the Government from exempting the workers from the competition legislation.  I think that is laughable for a number of reasons.  First all the political parties and the Independent groupings had opportunities to meet the troika when they were here.  The troika had been very clear that its job in this State was to ensure that the Government reached its deficit reduction targets.  How the Government went about its business and achieved those targets was, it would argue, entirely a matter for Government and not for it.  In other words it was not micro-managing all of the policies and certainly not worker's rights or competition legislation, industrial relations and to suggest that it was in the business of doing that is laughable.<br \/>Even if we were to take that at face value and imagine for a second that the troika members were of that view, which I do not believe they were, they are no longer here so there is nothing stopping the Government from doing the right thing.  The Competition Authority judgment is wrong - and that is plain and simple - and has unduly impacted on the income of freelance journalists, photographers, voice-over actors whose rates of pay have dropped significantly.  The Competition Authority in this instance has taken a very heavy handed and rigid interpretation of section 4 of the 2002 Act.  This Bill is an opportunity to address that but unfortunately the Minister has not taken the opportunity to do so but he can by accepting the amendment which we in Sinn F&eacute;in have tabled.<br \/>The second part of our amendment states, &quot;(11) Representatives of retailers may engage in commercial discussions with large suppliers for the purposes of advice only.&rdquo;.  We have had representations from small business organisations in respect of this part of the amendment, which seeks to provide effective representation and expert technical advice to small retailers who believe that they should be free to request their representative organisations to assist them in negotiations in keeping with the determinations of the Competition Authority or the IMO.  They would argue that this is neither radical nor anti-competitive.  For example, in Australia it is specifically provided for that retailers can engage with two lottery companies and can engage with all newspaper publishers.  The alternative to allowing small businesses to have a centralised and a well financed advocacy group discussing terms on their behalf would be to permit suppliers such as tobacco companies, newspaper distributors, telephone top-up companies and so on to dictate terms and conditions on a take it or leave it basis.  Retailers of products exclusively supplied by one company would be forced to accept its terms. Again we see the logic in the amendment being accepted and we do not see that it would be in conflict in any way with competition rights.<br \/>I have outlined the logic of  this amendment and I look forward to the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000028#EE01300","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404999300,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Cullinane for tabling this amendment.  It is an important debate and I think it is worth spending a little bit of time on it.<\/p><p>There was a proposal to look afresh at the ruling of the Competition Authority but I understand that commitment was subject to consistency with EU competition rules.  It is not consistent with EU competition rules to have such an arrangement.  The case we are talking about is not about employees who entered into an agreement, but self employed people who were involved in this agreement.<\/p><p>Under both EU and Irish competition legislation, self-employed persons, including professionals who are not employees, are regarded as &quot;undertakings&quot;.  There is ample evidence of EU case law at the European Court of Justice on this issue.<\/p><p>Section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 prohibits and makes void all agreements between undertakings, decisions by bodies representing undertakings and concerted practices which have, as their object or effect, the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade in any goods or services in the State or in any part of the State.  This reflects the provisions of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, which contains a similar prohibition in relation to agreements, decisions and concerted practices, which may affect trade between member states.<\/p><p>The current situation is that self-employed undertakings, acting collectively or through their representative bodies, can neither decide on the fees for services provided nor agree a price between themselves for their services, as this is regarded as price fixing contrary to the Competition Act 2002.  Competition law does not prevent consultation with groups of self-employed undertakings as long as the power to ultimately set the price does not lie with that collective group.  The reason for this is good.  If one allows groups of self-employed people to fix their fees or to be involved in practices like this, it does ultimately act against the interests of consumers.  Employees are in a different position and they are protected in negotiations.<\/p><p>As Senator Cullinane will know, he is putting forward a view for actors and voice-over actors but there are 250,000 self-employed groups and as he knows there are many groups who would like to have the ability to collude to set their fees.  We have seen lots of battles.  We discussed with Senator Barrett how we have tended to take a view of competition law, that we should have an exemption for this that or another group.  If one has those exemptions, one prevents the interests of consumers being protected by competition law.  That is the backdrop to this.  <\/p><p>I think we are being consistent with EU rules.  The troika members were very clear and it was not an added extra, of which they were indifferent, that further exemptions from competition law was not something that the Irish economy wanted or needed.  They were very strong in their view and were supported by the Commission, that Ireland should not be seeking to erode the area of operation of competition law.  We responded to that and undertook that we would not erode the operation of competition law.  I think we must stand up and accept that competition law is an important part of a system of protection of consumers and making sure that markets operate in a fair way.  We cannot pick one group of self-employed and say would it not be nice to give them some sort of an agreement and then say to others that they will not get a similar agreement.<\/p><p>This is a consistent rule that has been at the heart of EU competition law and is one that we have to uphold.<\/p> <p>In the second part of the Senator's amendment, he is proposing that discussions may take place \"for the purposes of advice only\".  Collusion and price-fixing are the only things we are prohibiting undertakings from doing.  If we were to accept the Senator's proposal that the only permissible form of engagement between representatives of retailers and large suppliers should be commercial discussions for the purposes of advice, we would undermine freedom to contract and add nothing to competition law requirements.  They are not prevented from entering into discussions and negotiations.  The only thing that is prevented is price-fixing.  The Senator's amendment would be more restrictive than the existing law.  I do not think the second part of the amendment would achieve the purpose the Senator is hoping to achieve.

Replacing the word &quot;prevalent&quot; with the word &quot;present&quot; would change the meaning of the definition because the word &quot;present&quot; is more absolute than the word &quot;prevalent&quot; and it would make the proper measure of diversity extremely complex.<br \/>We had a debate on this issue in the D&aacute;il.

The only issue here arose from an expert group on media mergers which looked at the way in which we handle mergers as they affect the media, therefore, competition law always has dealt with mergers.  What we have here is a provision where there is a number of loops in dealing with a media merger.  First, there is the competition test when one tests on competition grounds alone, whether this is a concentrated market and would the proposed merger represent a diminution of competition that would interfere with the public interest.  There is the capacity to make that decision.  If the competition commission decides that the merger does not offend competition rules, there is a second test already in Irish law which involves looking at whether the wider public interest in terms of diversity of content, plurality of ownership and so on, is served.  That is a separate test.  Under the existing law that test is exercised by me, as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, following an evaluation of the public interest by the Competition Authority.  What is proposed is that in future that second element, the public interest test, would be conducted by a panel appointed by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources involving the Broadcasting Authority.  The reason for that was the belief that media mergers increasingly occur across a diverse range of communications, newspapers, radio, social media and so on and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources would have access to better information, better opportunities to evaluate the public interest element than the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  That is one element of it.  It also provides for consultation before the Minister makes his decision and an order is made.  What is being done here is not new as media mergers have always been subject to a dual test, a competition test and a public interest test.  We are setting a more modern set of criteria, a more consultative arrangement including consultation with the relevant Oireachtas committee, and the decision will ultimately be made by a Minister who has oversight across a range of media outlets that reflects the changing nature of media.<\/p><p>I believe the basis for this amendment, which lies in a report of the media mergers groups chaired by Mr. Sreenan, is the right way to proceed.  I commend it to the House.  Clearly the diversity of ownership of media is an important public interest in a democracy.  Separate from measuring the market concentration or other measures that would be viewed from a very narrow competition perspective, there is a broader public interest in the merger of media outlets.  It is correct that this should be reviewed, it speaks for itself.  The Competition Authority itself has made pronouncements about the unsatisfactory nature of competition in this marketplace.  There is a record of public concern, including by the Competition Authority, in respect of the healthy state of competition in this marketplace and, therefore, I believe this provision amendment is valid.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000032#JJ00500","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1405000500,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  The Minister referred to the history of this issue, which goes back a long time.  There used to be a fear, almost paranoia, that imported newspapers would dominate the home newspapers. There was a certain amount of media self-obsession.  There are 363 media outlets listed in the Institute of Public Administration Yearbook and Diary, that invaluable publication.  I am sure the Minister and I could easily find another 40 imported publications on the shelves of the nearest newsagent.  If one does not much like a particular newspaper one can buy another.   Government is expensive, it is a difficult enough task and we have enough tasks on our hand.  The reason I tabled the amendment, which effectively seeks to do nothing about this, is that I believe the problem is solving itself and that the Minister has many other duties to fulfil such as those we mentioned earlier.  I will not push the amendment but the belief in Ireland that the media is anti-competitive is not borne out by the vast array of media, including many new media such as the new radio stations, the new newspapers - I mentioned those in Kerry yesterday.  The risk that Mr. Murdoch that or somebody else who we may not like would buy it all is counteracted by the fact that it is an easy business to enter and the capital costs have been reduced.  There will always be anti-establishment publications, such as<i>Phoenix<\/i>or whatever, where people can read alternative views.  The concerns are ill-founded and based on a view that having governments, lawyers, review committees and competition authorities working in this area is a waste of resources because it does not have a competition problem.<br \/>I thank the Minister.  I will not push the question to a vote but it is important that somebody gets the view into the parliament that if one does not like media one can simply buy a different set.

We had a long consultation period between the different parties, including farmers, suppliers and grocery interests, to try to work out whether a voluntary code could be agreed, based on grocery goods as originally defined. This was not possible.<\/p><p>We then had to move to decide to have a regulatory system which would be overseen through the Competition Authority.

The &euro;50 million figure is the threshold to carry the new obligations in respect of recording contracts, having compliance officers and so on.<\/p><p>First, it is intended to ensure these provisions are not disproportionate by including a broader swathe of processors, suppliers and retailers who are not regarded as major players in the national grocery goods sector.  Second, the European Commission uses a threshold figure of &euro;50 million in respect of turnover for making the distinction between a small and medium enterprises and what constitutes a large firm.  We are obviously trying to contain this to large firms.  Third, we should be anxious to ensure regulatory and red tape obligations imposed by regulatory authorities on small and medium enterprises are kept to a minimum and the reduction in the threshold levels as proposed would see a much higher incidence of administrative burden on many SMEs in the grocery goods sector.  If the turnover threshold was reduced from &euro;50 million to &euro;10 million, the number of retailers and wholesalers that would be affected, according to CSO figures and definitions, would rise from approximately 210 to approximately 3,250 businesses.  Fourth, in the UK the threshold for qualifying &quot;designated retailers&quot; for the purposes of the Groceries (Supply Chain Practices) Market Investigation Order 2009 is any retailer with a turnover exceeding &pound;1 billion with respect to the retail supply of groceries in the UK.  A &euro;50 million turnover was estimated based on an extrapolation of the qualifying turnovers under the UK legislation.<\/p><p>Finally, on the basis of the public consultation process undertaken on this issue, the figure of &euro;50 million emerged as a suggested figure.

The purpose of this Bill is to regulate the relationship between various parts of the supply chain to ensure there are no abuses and the contract terms are fair and are entered into and negotiated freely.  The terms are set out to be fair.  The Senators are trying to introduce something new specifically about disclosure of profits.<\/p><p>As has been stated on previous occasions, companies operating in Ireland are free to establish and organise themselves in the most suitable form to promote and run their businesses, provided that they comply fully with relevant national and EU legislation, including relevant legislation on the content of their financial statements.  The requirements regarding the preparation and publication of the financial statements of limited companies and groups are determined by the first, fourth and seventh EU company law directives and by the EU Regulation 1606-2002 and international financial reporting standards adopted by the EU under its provisions.  These requirements are largely reflected in the Companies Act 1963, the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 and the European Communities (Companies: Group Accounts) Regulations 1992, as amended.  Equivalent requirements apply across the EU.  The fourth and seventh directives have been replaced by a new Accounting Directive 2013-34-EU which is required to be transposed by July 2015.  The requirements concerning the accounts of unlimited companies are governed by domestic legislation.<\/p> <p>The extent to which profits are or are not disclosed is of general application and is not determined on the basis of the sector in which a company or group operates.  The requirements under company law are essentially the same for companies or groups that operate supermarkets as they are for companies or groups active in any other sector of the economy.  I consider that a disclosure regime targeting a specific sector could be viewed as disproportionate and discriminatory and could have negative consequences in terms of business costs and in attracting foreign direct investment.  Thus, I am not in a position to accept the amendment on this issue.<\/p><p>Contrary to what Senator Darragh O'Brien said, Dunnes Stores is a private concern and does not reveal its profits.  I do not propose to interfere in the accounting arrangements of different companies in this sector.  I seek fairness in the relationships between small suppliers and large suppliers in the grocery chain, regardless of who they may be.

I do not buy this as it favours secrecy over openness and transparency, which is what the Minister argued this Bill stood for.  This is a matter of competition and consumer protection so surely it is in the consumer's interests to know how much profit a company like Tesco makes in Ireland compared to the UK.  This will allow consumers to see retailers' profit margins.  To suggest this might adversely affect foreign direct investment buys into the general notion that no questions can be asked of multinational companies.  The same debate goes on around whether multinationals pay full corporation tax and a similar controversy applied to Apple.

However, I have committed that there will be consultations, including with the Oireachtas committee, in order that there will be an opportunity to discuss this matter.<br \/>Essentially, the argument here is that on the issue of payment, the Bill clearly sets out at section 63B(2)(<i>q<\/i>) that the regulations may &quot;specify the manner and timeframe in which payments for grocery goods supplied to relevant grocery goods undertakings are to be made&quot;.  It is believed that the issue of the timeframe for payment should be considered in the context of any regulations, rather than in primary legislation, to allow for more flexibility if required in any statutory instrument.  Payments also are covered by the prompt payment legislation and this must be factored into any regulations.  Setting out a period of 30 days or indeed any set period of days in primary legislation may be too rigid compared with the making of regulations and thus, whilst the text of any regulations is not yet finalised or agreed, I believe these amendments are neither required nor appropriate to this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000037#OO00800","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405003200,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1405003200,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 19 and 22 are related and may be discussed together.

Irish and EU law recognise simple retention of title clauses of the kind set out in the amendment and the courts have upheld such clauses.  However, to take up Senator Quinn's point, it is one thing for the law to uphold certain forms of retention of title clause freely agreed by contracting parties, but another for it to insert a mandatory title retention clause into commercial contracts.  To the best of my knowledge, no other jurisdiction has introduced a legislative provision of this kind.<\/p><p>While the aim on the Bill's provisions on grocery goods is to achieve a proper balance in the commercial relations between suppliers and retailers, it should not be done by introducing a potential imbalance into the relationship between suppliers, retailers and other parties.  The proposed amendment would affect the interests of third parties, including the Revenue Commissioners, employees and unpaid service providers - who have no equivalent option of taking back services that they have provided - by reducing the pool of assets available for distribution to other creditors of an insolvent buyer and effectively permitting an unpaid seller to jump the queue of creditors.  The potential for retention of title clauses to lead to inequity between creditors has led to a number of jurisdictions, including the US, Australia and New Zealand, to treat such clauses as a form of security interest against third parties that must be registered by the seller.<\/p><p>Although the Law Reform Commission proposed a similar system of registration and other conditions relating to the retention of title clauses, the recommendations were not implemented.  In its comprehensive report of 2011 on the legislation governing the sale of goods, the sales law review group also concluded that because of their impact on third parties who had had no say in the contract, any reform of the retention of title clauses had to be considered in the context of a broader reform of the law relating to personal property security interests.  Although I have some sympathy with the aim behind the amendment, I cannot accept it.<\/p><p>I will now refer to the part which calls for powers for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to issue directions to retailers not to sell grocery goods at a price that is less than the net invoice price of the goods.  As the Senators are well aware, the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 prohibited below invoice price selling of certain goods rather than banning below cost selling of those goods.  In effect, the order allowed wholesalers and suppliers to determine minimum retail prices being charged to consumers, thereby seriously constraining competition in the grocery trade.  Since the repeal of that order in 2006, no statutory basis exists for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to make a minimum pricing order in any sector.  The use of aggressive pricing strategies in any business is a legitimate marketing tool and is the normal outcome of the competitive process.<\/p><p>Low-cost and below-cost selling by a retailer is not of itself an offence unless it involves abuse of a dominant position.  A determination on whether a retailer is abusing a dominant position in the marketplace would necessitate a comprehensive investigation by the Competition Authority.  The Competition Authority is the independent statutory body responsible for enforcing competition law in the State and complaints of any alleged anti-competitive practice should be referred to it.  As stated clearly in earlier debates, it is not believed that there are grounds for the re-introduction of such a restrictive measure.  It would effectively reintroduce retail price maintenance, which flies in the face of the free market and would be a retrograde step.  Thus, I am not in a position to accept the proposed amendment.<\/p><p>Price fixing by writing an invoice price would be resale price maintenance, which used to be one of the offences of competition law.  For the State to introduce it and police it as an obligation would be very strange.  The amendment is not right.  We are trying to ensure the contract terms are fair in how they are assembled and we have taken powers to examine different elements of the contract terms that could be cast in an unfair way or not provided, and allow very arbitrary changes by the more powerful player in the relationship.  This would be an anti-competitive measure and I do not support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000038#PP00200","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1405003800,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I will consider the Minister's response before Report Stage on Tuesday, and therefore I withdraw amendment No. 21 and reserve the right to resubmit it on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000038#PP00300","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405003800,"counter":358,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405003800,"counter":359,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 22 to 25, inclusive, not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1405003800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That section 83 stand part of the Bill.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1405003800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>Section 83 has ten pages and approximately 4,000 words meddling in the grocery business under the illusion that it is an uncompetitive business, which it is not.  The existence of new entrants is one of the basic criteria for competition to work.  Two new entrants, Aldi and Lidl, have entered the Irish grocery market and have approximately one fifth of it.  There are at least eight completely different competing places where one can shop around.  During the week, I received a complaint from a member of the agriculture lobby that the price of beef was too low and we needed a regulator.  Too many producers in Ireland try to abuse consumer law, such as that which is before us, to engage in restrictive practices, rent seeking and trying to rig the market.  The grocery market in Ireland is as near to competition as one will get in the real world.<\/p><p>I wonder why the energy devoted to writing the nearly 4,000 words of the section were not instead put into something such as industrial policy or science and technology as we develop.  The Minister is pretending the grocery market is not competitive when it obviously is.  There is ease of entry and many producers and consumers.  It is old style industrial policy, lobbying and wasting the time of the departmental staff and others engaged in it when they should be out competing and talking to the consumer.  That is how a market economy operates.  The old industrial policy was clientelism and protectionism whereby people went to the Department seeking tariffs and quotas.  We need a contestable market.  The thinking in the section is at a substantial cost in terms of administration, the Minister's time and lawyers to accomplish nothing.<\/p><p>Even if the Minister does not like all the people to whom I referred, Bord Bia has a most interesting publication on 133 farmers' markets throughout the country.  Farmers do not like any of the people, including Aldi, which advertised that it buys its ice cream in Mallow and its beef in County Laois.  If the Senators who were here do not like any of the grocery retailers, Bord Bia lists farmers' markets, which provide alternative ways for farmers to sell products and for consumers to buy.  There are six farmers' markets in Waterford, nine in Clare, 17 in Cork, 26 in Dublin, 14 in Kerry, five in Meath and 12 in Galway.  I refer just to the counties of the Senators who were here during the debate.  I agree with Senator Quinn that there is no lack of competition in the Irish grocery trade and it is a pity we waste so much valuable Government and bureaucratic intelligence when we should do something better with our time.  This is why I oppose the sections on the grocery trade.<\/p><p>In this Bill we promote competition and the consumer.  This is an area in which competition works, and the evidence is before our eyes.  So what if some producers do not like it?  Yesterday, I mentioned that in the UK the cost of food has decreased from 30% of the family budget to 9%.  The grocery trade is working and there is no need to reinvent a &quot;Joe Stalin&quot; style economy to regulate the grocery business.  I look forward to the day when we grow up, accept that it is a competitive business and stop trying to introduce all these petty regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000038#PP00600","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1405004400,"counter":362,"content":"<p>It is not often I find myself in complete disagreement with Senator Barrett.  I am pretty stunned by what he has said.  If some producers do not like it, that is tough.  I firmly stand by the belief that we have an indigenous industry that successive governments have continued to promote, including promoting Ireland as a food island.  The Food Harvest 2020 document produced by the former Minister, Deputy Smith, and followed on by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, indicates the importance of the agrifood sector and dairy sector.  That can only happen if people can trust the quality and the nature of the product, based on where it is sourced, how it is produced and the expertise that is there.<\/p><p>While it is correct to say that the household budget for food in the UK has dropped from 30% to 9%, that is not necessarily good.  In Britain, farmers in particular as well as producers, growers and market gardeners have gone out of business.  Family-run businesses have been screwed to the wall by certain multiples that have squeezed every last drop out of them.  Tesco and other companies buy the farms, produce vegetables themselves and drive down costs, just as Aldi, Lidl and others do from time to time.  I am not talking about putting a tariff on the consumer; I am asking whether we value the industry itself.  Do we want to look back in 30 years at a fantastic industry, but one that is entirely owned by foreign companies?  Would that be acceptable?<\/p><p>I invite Senator Barrett to meet the growers and small business owners in my area in north County Dublin and put his case to them.

I do not favour artificially supporting a sector.<\/p><p>I will be resubmitting on Report Stage my amendment No. 25 on appointing an independent ombudsman.  The Cathaoirleach of the Seanad ruled that out of order on the basis that it could have brought a cost on the Exchequer.  I will be resubmitting it and asking the Minister to look at how it works in Britain which has an ombudsman over this sector.  That ombudsman costs &pound;800,000 which is fully funded by the retail sector.  That office is manned by one ombudsman and three staff.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister's interaction in our discussion on the Bill today which has been very useful.  We want to work with him on this.  The Bill had been promised for many years.  Many small family-run businesses have been waiting for this Bill to offer them some protection and fair play.  To have legislation such as this without an ombudsman removes any type of real power that could be there.  I believe the Cathaoirleach's ruling was incorrect.<\/p><p>On Report Stage I will be proposing an amendment that the Minister should appoint an independent ombudsman to oversee and implement the regulations provided for in section 60(3)(b) funded fully by the retail sector.  It is done in Britain and it can be done here.  I am not looking to overburden the authority with additional work, but we can build on this legislation.  I will be opposing the section on the basis that the Minister has not taken the opportunity of this legislation to have an ombudsman.  That is a mistake and needs to be rectified.  I will be returning to the issue on Report Stage.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for the time he has given throughout the process.  I know this is a complex Bill and we will not agree on everything, but it represents a start.  I am not sure whether the Minister will be back here on Tuesday to take Report Stage, but whatever happens over the weekend, I wish him-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000039#QQ00100","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1405004400,"counter":363,"content":"<p>The Senator should stick to the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000039#QQ00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1405004400,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I am sure I will wake up some day and the reshuffle will be done, hopefully sooner rather than later.

I heard the Minister talk about resale price maintenance.  There have been so many efforts to control the grocery business over the years, but the ideal control is competition, and Senator Barrett is absolutely right.  In my years, a huge number of companies did not succeed and went out of business.  However, they went out of business to companies that started.  They were small businesses that started.  While there are some very large international companies here now, the second biggest company is the Musgrave Group.  That is owned by private individuals with a supplier coming to them.  This is a competitive marketplace.<\/p><p>When I look back on the controls that manufacturers and suppliers would like, I can remember one group of farmers coming to me and complaining that our meat was too cheap and they were going to place a picket on our stores.  I told them they were very welcome to do so because I could not imagine a better advertisement we could get.  They did not place a picket.  Competition has been very healthy in Ireland and I hope it will continue on that basis in the years ahead.  The fewer controls and difficulties we have on that basis, the healthier it will be for competition and therefore for the consumer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000039#QQ00400","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1405004400,"counter":366,"content":"<p>Most countries have looked at the grocery sector and found that it has problems that are particular to it because of the presence of very substantial retailers relative to pretty small players on the supply side in some cases.  We have ensured it will also apply to relatively small retailers which might have supply chain problems with very large distributors.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett is right in saying this is not an industry in which there are large barriers to entry, but that is not the only test of competition and it never has been.  There is also the issue of abuse of dominance and whether it is easy to pursue cases of dominance.  Previous competition law recognised that by banning so-called hello money because it was not consistent with a proper approach.<\/p><p>While there are broad principles of competition law, which are set out in European treaties and reflected in our law, there are cases when, based on the operation of a particular market, it is necessary to introduce other protections.  If the Senator looked through the sections - I do not know if he bothered to read the ten pages he found so irksome - he would find they cover issues such as what happens when the forecast of supply of goods is wrong and how the cost of that is shared out.  Who pays for the cost of a discount promotion in a grocery store?  How is that fairly worked out?  We are seeking to ensure there are written contracts and these matters are handled fairly.  Most large grocers, particularly ones that operate in other jurisdictions - Aldi and Lidl in particular have come in from other jurisdictions - are used to operating these sorts of rules in respect of reasonable contracts for their suppliers.  This is not something really cumbersome and irksome for many of them.  The same would be true of Tesco.<\/p><p>They provide, as they have done in the UK and other markets, a fair approach to handling things that are pretty unique to groceries, such as shrinkage, wastage, losses and so on.  I am not trying to pretend I have anything like the knowledge Senator Quinn has of the sector, but while it is competitive in many ways and people do shop around, we need to ensure the rules are fairly applied because there are large players in this sector.  Other countries have taken this approach.<\/p><p>I turn to Senator Darragh O'Brien's point.<\/p> <p>The original approach developed by Mr. John Travers was to have a code of practice and an ombudsman.  As the Senator knows, a code of practice is essentially voluntary and an ombudsman makes recommendations which one then hopes people will act upon.  We have taken the view that the voluntary approach did not work so we are introducing regulations with legal force and with criminal sanctions.  We are using the Competition Authority not as an ombudsman, but as an enforcer.  It is a not a body which will weigh arguments and make a recommendation that does not have the force of law behind it.  This will be a set of regulations that will have the force of law which we will expect to see reflected.  Where the regulations are not abided to, there will be the opportunity to enforce them.  There will also be other measures available, such as the possibility that the Competition Authority would issue a compliance notice so that if an action was inadvertent or a first-time misdemeanour, there might be no action beyond the compliance notice.  If a party refused to act on a compliance notice, an enforceable instrument would be used.<\/p><p>The debate about the ombudsman has passed.  It was an alternative approach involving codes, an ombudsman and a voluntary arrangement.  It was assumed that everybody would be a good scout and play by the rules but it did not prove possible to achieve that kind of approach.  This approach would use the Competition Authority, as it regulates every other sector and it has intimate knowledge of fair practice in the market.  It has enforcement powers and legal, economic and other machinery to do this right.  It would make no sense for us to set up a new quango to do what we can now with the joining of two agencies.  The Senator's amendment would not add to the Bill.  I have spent most of my life on the Senator's side of the House and I know a charge cannot be introduced on the Exchequer either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000039#QQ00500","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405005000,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I will try and see how I get on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000040#RR00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1405005000,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Perhaps the ruling has changed and I do not want to prejudice proceedings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000040#RR00300","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1405005000,"counter":370,"content":"<p>It may be allowed in the reformed Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000040#RR00400","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1405005000,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I see.

I am aware the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has said it will continue to talk about the issue, but that is not the same as releasing files.  Those files have been in secure locations for the past 40 years.  As stated recently in this House by me and others, if my country was accused of mass murder, the first thing I would say is that we had nothing to do with it, we have nothing to hide, we have information that might be of assistance and if we can be of assistance in identifying the perpetrators we will assist our neighbours.  One cannot say on the one hand that we have improved relations with our neighbours, as we have in many areas in the past 40 years, while on the other hand they are accused of the largest killing in one day where collusion is suspected.  Many reports, including the Barron report, have said it is most likely that the British security forces were involved.  The question is whether it had sanction.  Was it cleared at the highest level?<\/p><p>The next issue is the shootings that took place in Ballymurphy where ten unarmed civilians were shot in the space of 72 hours by the Parachute Regiment which, a few weeks later, went to Derry to carry out the killing of unarmed civilians there in a matter of minutes.  What is the British Government doing in respect of seeking justice for those who were killed?  I posed the question in the House on the day I raised the issue.  In Ballymurphy a mother of eight was shot in the face and died.  Those children of Joan Connolly are entitled to know who killed their mother.  They are not seeking revenge.  I fear justice would elude them but they are entitled to the truth. <\/p><p>The next issue on which I seek a response is on the military reaction force which was uncovered by a BBC Panorama documentary which highlighted the that this was an official undercover unit, sanctioned by the British army, which would go around west Belfast into Catholic areas and shoot civilians.  Its intention was to shoot armed men at checkpoints but that did not always happen.  Innocent civilians were killed.  The former British Prime Minister, Mr. Ted Heath, at Downing Street was shown a memo.  BBC Panorama uncovered the document which stated that the Prime Minister had asked that the next unit being constructed after the military reaction force should operate within the law, which is a clear admission that he was aware that the military reaction force had operated outside the law.  As a Prime Minister being aware that his own army was acting outside the law in going around part of a territory to which he had a claim, one would imagine he should have taken action if it had not been sanctioned.  Unfortunately, as we now suspect, it was sanctioned at the highest level.<\/p><p>The last issue is the most serious as it has consequences for citizens around the world.  It concerns the RTE documentary about the hooded men and the case taken by the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, to Europe.<\/p> <p>The Government pursued the British Government for the torture of those citizens, disputed or otherwise of Ireland.  It won the initial court case, but on appeal the judgment that those hooded men were tortured was overturned.  It was said that while the torture tactics employed - the use of stress, the hooding of the men, their subjection to white noise and interrogation for hours on end without a break - was a case of enhanced interrogation techniques, it was not torture.  It decided that because the evidence provided by the British side in regard to the effects on the men in question was such that it could not be construed as torture.  However, what was uncovered by the RTE documentary was that the effect was traumatic.  Lives were shortened, suicides occurred and these men were never the same again after being detained and tortured by the British Government.<\/p><p>In light of this new evidence and of the fact that the Government is now entitled to revisit the case, will it do so?  I ask this not because of the historic nature of the offences that occurred against these citizens but in view of the fact that the ruling made by that European Court of Human Rights is now used by states and democracies around the world.  They say that because Ireland took this case, those forms of interrogation are legitimate, because a European court has said they did not have an adverse effect on the people subject to them.  We now know, because of RTE's excellent report, that they had a hugely traumatic, debilitating and life-changing effect and that, by any measure, the forms of interrogation used were torture.  It is beholden on the Government now, in light of this new evidence, to set the record straight, so that no democracy can use the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights, which is false because of the evidence withheld from it by the British Government at the time.<\/p><p>I raise this not because of the historic nature of much of what I have talked about, but it is important the record is set straight on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000042#TT01500","speaker":"1159","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405006500,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  As he is aware, the legacy of the past continues to seriously disrupt political and community life in Northern Ireland.  The Government is committed to playing an active and constructive role in dealing with the issues, including through raising relevant matters with counterparts in the British Government.<br \/>The Government continues to support the all-party D&aacute;il motions of July 2008 and May 2011 urging the British Government to allow access by an independent international judicial figure to all original documents in its possession relating to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  In May 2014, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade raised this matter with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, who undertook to reflect afresh on the Government's request to grant access to the relevant documents.  The Government has expressed its solidarity with the victims and survivors of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and their families.  The Taoiseach, the Minister of State with responsibility for development and I participated in memorial events on the 40th anniversary of the bombings and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade recently announced renewed funding for Justice for the Forgotten,<i><\/i>a group which works with the families affected by the bombings, through that Department's reconciliation fund.<br \/>I would like to stress to Senator Daly that when I participated in that event, I was left in no doubt that the loss felt by those families is keen and acute and that their desire for justice and an investigation of this serious issue remains strong.  This is one of the reasons the Taoiseach participated in the recent event and updated the families of the victims of the bombing on what the Government is doing and how it seeks to pursue the issues they have raised, which have been the subject of all-party motions in the D&aacute;il.<br \/>Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade expressed their disappointment at the decision of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 29 April 2014 not to appoint a Hillsborough-style panel to review the Ballymurphy cases the Senator raised.  They have since raised the matter with Prime Minister Cameron and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, respectively.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade informed the Secretary of State that, lacking agreement on a new model for contending with the past, a poorly functioning historical inquiries team and a severely backlogged coroner's court, the British Government should support reasonable and considered requests such as that made by the Ballymurphy families.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has stressed strongly to his counterpart our view that the British Government should support these reasonable and considered requests from the families that have suffered in respect of this terrible incident.<br \/>The House will be aware of the RTE &quot;Prime Time&quot; special programme on the &quot;hooded men&quot; case, which alleged that the British Government may have misled the European Court of Human Rights in the case taken by Ireland against the UK on the hooded men and other matters.  In that case, the European Court of Human Rights considered an earlier report by the European Commission on Human Rights that the in-depth interrogation methods used by the British authorities in Northern Ireland amounted to torture.  The court found that, while the interrogation methods were &quot;inhuman and degrading&quot;, they did not amount to torture.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been in contact with RTE and with the Pat Finucane Centre, on whose work much of the programme was based, and is currently reviewing archival records in order to fully assess the claims made by the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme.<br \/>The House will also be aware of the issues raised in a BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; documentary in November 2013 concerning the alleged activities of an undercover British army unit, the military reaction force, MRF.  The Northern Ireland Director of Public Prosecutions, Barra McGrory, has asked the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to investigate these allegations.  The DPP has been provided with a detailed analysis by the PSNI of the comments made by three former soldiers in the course of the programme.  In respect of the serious allegations surrounding the activities of the MRF, the PSNI is seeking to identify those who appeared on the programme and those who provided information to it.<br \/>Cases like Ballymurphy, the military reaction force and the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the hooded men and other legacy cases, underline the need to find a comprehensive, fair and balanced framework for dealing with the past.  If not dealt with, the past will continue to have a deeply corrosive effect on politics.  In this regard, it is disappointing that Unionist parties withdrew last week from talks in Belfast on parades, flags and dealing with the legacy of the past.  It is hoped that this is only a temporary setback and that all the parties will return to the talks as early as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000043#UU00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1405006500,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Minister of State for his reply and for the work of the Government in raising these issues on a continual basis.

Democracies use them because the European Court of Human Rights said they did not have an adverse effect on those 14 citizens in Northern Ireland.  The evidence the British Government withheld from the Irish Government and from the court shows quite clearly that it did.  This country has an obligation to ensure that the record is set straight and that the countries using this technique stop and do not use the EU court ruling as justification for doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000043#UU00300","speaker":"1159","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405007100,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising these important issues.

The school applied for summer works funding and was unsuccessful in both funding rounds.  I appreciate that schools with the most need and the most pressing issues were allocated funding.<\/p><p>Many primary and post-primary schools from County Louth were successful, which I welcome.  This school, however, has major problems.  It asked for external security lighting and CCTV installation.  The consulting engineer for the application advised that it be listed under category three electrical works but the Department advised the school that its application would in fact be listed under category ten for consideration.  Those of us who represented schools in applying for summer funding works were consistently told that in the first round it was category one or category two but if one was in category ten the chances of getting any of this funding were slim.  I am not aware of any who got it.<\/p><p>The school has been plagued with break-ins and anti-social behaviour over the past year.  It has lost over &euro;60,000 in stolen or damaged equipment.  The principal has been routinely called to the school outside school hours to deal with the ongoing anti-social behaviour.  It is fortunate to have such a good principal who goes there straightaway when he gets the call and is frequently on-site after school hours.<\/p><p>The insurer for the school site insists that further measures be taken to improve the security and lighting on the campus but the school is in negotiations with the insurance company to pay for the damaged and stolen goods.  In February the principal had to make an executive decision to reorder and replace equipment at a cost of over &euro;40,000 to the school so that the students would not lose out due to the action of others.  It is a Catch-22 situation because the insurance company says the school needs to put in more money or security equipment but it cannot get the equipment.<\/p><p>The Government had a fantastic idea to replace prefabs with buildings in schools.  As a teacher I could see how much money was being wasted on renting prefabs.  If we invest in our schools and put money into situations like this we will save money in the long run.  Many classes were left without equipment that they needed for courses for many days.  This is an emergency because if equipment is stolen one cannot run the class and should be entitled to emergency funding.  Special iMac computers were stolen and the pre-leaving certificate students need that hard disc on the machines for assessment for their final year exams.  This is a very serious matter.  The students are suffering.<\/p><p>The school is known for being very innovative and offering a very high standard of education.  I was delighted that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, accepted my invitation to visit the school during the year because I was so impressed by the school's activities.  He was equally impressed.  It relies on a range of equipment to cater for a range of courses.  The school is working very closely with the garda&iacute; in the area but they also insist that security works be carried out.  I appreciate that resources are limited but the school has engaged proactively on this and does need further assistance as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000044#VV00400","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1405007100,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position in relation to the application made by O'Fiaich College for funding under the summer works scheme 2014 to address security measures at the school.<\/p> <p>Last March, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, announced that 386 schools would receive funding to the tune of almost &euro;36 million to undertake gas, electrical and mechanical works under the summer works scheme 2014.  In a further announcement on 2 May, the Minister announced a second round of approvals under the summer works scheme 2014.  Almost &euro;35 million is being provided by the Department under this second round of funding to a further 386 schools and this aims to upgrade toilets and roofs in primary and secondary schools nationwide.  The Department has now approved the spending of more than &euro;70 million on the summer works scheme to allow over 770 schools undertake vital improvement works during the summer months when pupils are on holidays, in order to minimise any disruption to the schooling.  These improvement works represent applications submitted for categories 1 to 6, in order of priority.<\/p><p>Commensurate with the level of funding set aside for the scheme, applications were assessed on a top-down basis in accordance with the prioritisation criteria outlined in the circular accompanying the scheme.  Unfortunately, due to the scale of demand for funding under the scheme, it was not possible to grant aid all applications, including the application from O'Fiaich College.  However, in accordance with the scheme's circular, the school's application will be retained and will be prioritised for consideration under further rounds of the summer works scheme in the future, subject to availability of funding.<\/p><p>Despite the difficult economic environment, we are continuing to prioritise investment in school buildings which will enhance the learning and working environment for pupils and teachers.  The Senator will be aware that my Department has provided significant grant aid to the school in recent years which has facilitated considerable improvement works.  The projects undertaken include refurbishment works, roof works and improvements to the heating system, installation of an elevator, fencing, windows, external doors, electrical and toilet upgrade, mechanical works and energy upgrade.

It is unfortunate for the Minister of State because this matter was tabled by me last week and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Tom Hayes, who is a good Tipperary man, as am I, was supposed to deal with it.  In the intervening period he put the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, in the hot seat after we beat Galway by nine points in Thurles.  He will have to answer to his maker for that.  On a serious note, I know the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, has a great interest in hurling and the fate of our native ash tree.<\/p><p>In 2012, ash dieback arrived in Ireland and by April 2014 some 120 cases had been identified and 1,300 acres of forest had been destroyed.  The industry supports 400 jobs and ash wood is used for many purposes, one of which is the making of hurleys.  Some 350,000 hurleys are produced every year in Ireland but the cost of ash for this production has increased dramatically, even in recent months.  Ash now costs &euro;12 per plank, the raw material for a hurley, and it was previously &euro;9.50.  I commend the Department on the work it has done to date in trying to control the disease but it is a fact that Ireland imports 80% of its ash from elsewhere in Europe.  Much of this comes from the UK where ash dieback is now accepted as unstoppable by scientists.  It is expected that the ash crop in England will be destroyed in the coming years.  The situation facing hurley makers is so serious that we have resorted to such drastic actions as enlisting the help of Queen Elizabeth II of England in providing ash from her royal forests in Sandringham Estate, Norfolk.  This is something that has pleased Prince Philip and in which he has taken an active interest.<\/p><p>Coillte informed us prior to this outbreak that Ireland could be self-sufficient in terms of ash growth by 2018.  How realistic is this estimate now?  Work is being carried out in Norwich on a tree known as Tree 35 that may be resistant to the disease.  Has the Irish Government or Coillte been involved in this work and what progress has been made with regard to the Irish case?  How many outbreaks have occurred in 2014 and how widespread is the disease in Ireland?  What percentage of ash trees has been affected by the outbreak and how is this issue being communicated to the general public?  Teagasc held a number of public awareness meeting for farmers and those involved in forestry but many members of the public who walk through national parks do not recognise the signs of ash dieback and, thus, cannot notify the authorities.  Can the Minister of State make a comment on medium and long-term stock level projections for Ireland?<\/p><p>The Galway hurlers have no further part to play in the championship but the Tipperary hurlers hope to be in Croke Park in September.  I hope that hurleys made from Irish ash will be available in future because it is our national game and something in which we all take great pride.  Hurling is a conversation ice-breaker in all situations and I take a great interest in it.  I hope the Minister of State has good news on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000045#WW00500","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1405007700,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Landy for this opportunity to update the House on the current situation on chalara fraxinea, the disease otherwise known as ash dieback.  I assure him that we in Galway intend to make significant use of ash for many years to come.<\/p><p>The disease, which was identified for the first time in Ireland in October 2012 has, I regret to inform the House, spread throughout the country.  At the current time there are a total of 120 cases of the disease.  Some 47 of these cases are located in forest plantations, 21 are in nurseries and garden centres, 21 are in farms, some of which were planted as part of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, and rural environment protection scheme, REPS, four were in private gardens, 25 were roadside plantings and two were in hedgerows.  A total of 14 of the 120 cases were confirmed in 2014.<\/p><p>It is important that I take this opportunity to highlight the significant effort that the Department has put into trying to contain this very destructive disease.  As a first step ash has been removed from the list of tree species approved under the afforestation grant schemes.<\/p> <p>In recent years 10% of the planting programme was made up of ash.  This was followed up in November 2012 when national legislative measures were introduced under the Destructive Insects and Pest Acts 1958 and 1991 to regulate the import of ash seed, plants and wood.  In tandem, similar legislation was introduced in Northern Ireland.  A major winter survey of ash plantations was undertaken by the Department soon after the disease was identified.  This exercise focused on trees planted between 2008 and 2012.  It included surveying of hedgerows, nurseries, roadside, landscape and farm plantings as well as forest plantations, the outcome of which was the confirmation of further findings of the disease.  The survey was broadened to an ongoing growing season survey of ash planted over a much longer period.<br \/>Officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have worked closely with colleagues in Northern Ireland so that a framework could be put in place to support the implementation of a cohesive all-Ireland response to this issue.  To this end, the all-Ireland <i>Chalara<\/i>control strategy was launched by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Tom Hayes, and Minister O'Neill from Northern Ireland in July 2013.  We continue to implement this strategy and see it as an important contributor in addressing the threat posed by <i>Chalara<\/i>on the island of Ireland.<br \/>In terms of controlling the disease itself, arrangements have been put in place to remove all ash trees from the forest sites where the disease has been confirmed and from associated sites where trees from the same infected batches have also been planted.  Eradication is also being carried out under the Department's supervision at non-forest locations.  This work is being undertaken by staff from the forest service of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in conjunction with the relevant forestry contractors, the IFA and landowners in order to ensure as smooth a process as possible.  In March 2013 a <i>Chalara<\/i>reconstitution scheme was introduced to help forest owners affected by the disease.  This scheme provides financial support for site clearance, as well as funding for the replanting of the site with a suitable alternative species.  So far funding has been allocated in respect of 560 ha under the scheme and over &euro;1 million has been paid to forest owners in grants.<br \/>The Department also continues its efforts to increase awareness of ash dieback and the serious threat posed by this disease.  Early detection can allow for these plantations to be destroyed as soon as possible, thereafter preventing further infection from occurring.  To this end a total of 22 <i>Chalara <\/i>information meetings, organised by the Department and Teagasc, were held throughout the country.  These took place during the month of May 2013.  Approximately 800 people attended and information was provided on what to look out for and the implications in terms of clearance of a forest plantation.  Clarification was also given at these meetings on the implications for AEOS and REPS farmers where the disease is found on the trees planted under these schemes.  These farmers can apply to the Department for <i>force majeure<\/i>consideration, in which case payments will continue unaffected and there is no obligation to replant.<br \/>Following discussions with the GAA a one-page advertisement was placed in the match programme for the 2013 All-Ireland Hurling Final replay requesting patrons to look out for symptoms of ash dieback.  In addition, the GAA has included an article in the monthly newsletter sent out to every club in the country in an effort to raise awareness further.  Information continues to be disseminated through a poster campaign, advertisements and posting information to the Departments website.  In May of this year an all-Ireland <i>Chalara <\/i>conference was held, the aim of which was to update all interested parties on the latest developments with regard to the disease in Ireland and Europe as a whole.  This conference, which was also attended by Minister O'Neill, provided an opportunity for experts to share information on dealing with this disease and to focus on the most recent developments regarding resistant strains of the species.<br \/><i>Chalara<\/i>is a relatively new disease to science and consequently research is going to play a key role in stopping it.  The Department has been working with scientists in Britain on a <i>Chalara<\/i>modelling exercise.  This will help predict the likely patterns of spread and, in turn, facilitate a more focused allocation of resources in terms of surveillance and control measures.  In the longer term we must continue to work with industry, universities, farmers, landowners, voluntary organisations and the general public to explore and develop ways of minimising both the economic and environmental impacts of ash dieback.  One of the most important areas of work is in the identification of possible resistance in ash.  As part of this effort, Irish ash plants have been planted at a range of sites in south-east England to test for resistance.  The research, which is funded in part by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, is being carried out by Forest Research, an agency of the Forestry Commission.  In addition, the Department has launched a competitive call for research proposals on breeding ash for resistance and on modelling disease spread.<br \/>In terms of supply, Ireland requires in the region of 2,100 cu. m of hurley ash per annum, representing approximately 360,000 hurleys.  Well over 70% of ash timber is imported to meet this demand.  There is almost 20,000 ha of ash in the country, most of which is less than 20 years old.  It is anticipated that we will rely on imports for the next five to seven years until these ash plantations reach the appropriate size.  In the longer term, we must concentrate our efforts on trying to identify resistant species of ash so that we can begin to plant ash again as part of a national planting programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014071000045#WW00600","speaker":"1042","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1405008300,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his very comprehensive reply.
