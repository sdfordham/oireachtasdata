In doing so, I would like to welcome everyone to the public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today, we continue our hearings with senior officials from the Department of Finance who had key roles during the crisis period.  At this morning's session we will hear from Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist, Department of Finance.  John McCarthy joined the Central Bank as an economist in 1996 but has spent most of his career on secondment to the Department of Finance.  At all times in the Department, he worked in the economic section of the budget and economic division.  He was appointed chief economist at the Department in November 2013 following an open competition.  Mr. McCarthy, you are very welcome before the committee this morning.<\/p><p>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.

I can be very brief, Mr. Chairman, as I have submitted a more detailed witness statement to the joint committee already.  Just by way of introduction, you have directed me to give evidence relating to my role as chief economist\/assistant secretary and all other roles in the Department of Finance.  As you mentioned, I was appointed to the position of chief economist in November 2013.  Prior to that I worked at a technical level in the Department, at grades equivalent to that of assistant principal and principal officer from about 2001 onwards, with the exception of 2004 when I was back working in the Central Bank.  For the most part, during this period, my work involved producing economic forecasts for the Department, as well as undertaking some technical work on the public finances, mainly related to the Stability and Growth Pact, the structural budget balance, fiscal stability treaty and so forth.  Please let me briefly summarise the, the main points of ... or what I see as the main points of my witness statement.<\/p> <p>  As I've, as I've outlined, the stance of macroeconomic policy during the first decade of monetary union was, was completely inappropriate.  While monetary policy was exogenous, it was determined externally by the European Central Bank with regard to economic conditions in the euro area as a whole, fiscal and incomes policies in Ireland should have been counter-cyclical with the view to stabilising aggregate demand in the Irish economy, which was essentially operating at full capacity or even beyond full capacity for most of this period.  The contraction of the tax base and the ramping up of public expenditure on a permanent basis were clear policy mistakes and ultimately led to a very large structural deficit once the crisis kicked in.  That the public finances were in broad compliance with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact during most of this period provides no comfort.  Let me say a little bit on the ... on the Department's warnings.  The Department did advise, both internally and externally, regarding the pro-cyclicality of fiscal policy, regarding the loss in competitiveness, as well as the over-dependence of the economy on new house building and construction more generally.  This is acknowledged in various report, various reports, Wright and Nyberg being good examples.  However, it is also clear that the Department should have adapted the tone of its warnings as the imbalances were becoming more acute and I would certainly agree with this analysis.<\/p> <p>  Now, in relation to the housing market, the general approach in the Department was to highlight the central scenario of a soft landing but also to outline, in various internal memos and so forth, that there were risks to the ... to this ... such a benign outcome.  I think it's important on the outset to stress what is meant by a soft landing.  This was the assumption that prices would level off or even decline moderately so that with continued consumer price inflation, real house prices would realign with fundamentals over time.  In addition, it involved the assumption that activity would revert to more sustainable levels in a gradual manner, rather than in a very disruptive manner.  Clearly a soft landing did not materialise and this was an incorrect call.<\/p> <p>  Finally, if I could just say a few words on the resources of the Department, and specifically within the economic division.  Certainly, when the crisis hit there were very few economists working in the economic division.  The number of people that I would consider as, as technical economists, you could count on, on one hand, I think it's fair to say, in the division at that time.  But I think it's fair to say the picture has changed in the intervening period with improved resourcing, especially on, on the quality.  Okay?  I think we are now approaching a critical mass of economists within the Department and we are publishing some of our technical work, something which never happened before, and we are engaging in a more structured manner with the wider economic community.  So, from an economic perspective, I think it's fair to say that the Department is in a much better place now.  Chairman, with this brief summary I will conclude my opening statement.  Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1435100400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Thank you very much for your opening remarks, Mr. McCarthy, and if I can invite our first lead questioner this morning, Senator Sean Barrett.

Not all of those are filled at the moment.  I have about 15 people on my team.  There are a number of vacancies including one crucial vacancy on the macro-economics side.  I am holding that vacancy for the next month or two because there is an excellent economist employed in the Department but in another division, so I am willing to wait.  When his job finishes there he will move across.<\/p> <p>  I think you need to look beyond the economic division as well, there are economists elsewhere in the Department and I also think it's important to highlight the fact that the role of the Irish Government economic and evaluation service, which was established I think in about 2011 or 2012, it is situated within the Department of Public Expenditure and the rational for this is to create an economic service for the Civil Service as a whole.  So there has been a large amount of recruitment there both at the AO level, there is currently recruitment ongoing at the AP level so the rationale and I'll finish here is to create a career structure for economists all the way up to and including chief economist which is at the assistant secretary grade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1435100400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Outside your 20, how many other economists are there in the Department of Finance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062400002#D00300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435100400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I think the number with masters level degrees or more is just under 40.

One of the problems in the past has been that there is this generalist versus specialist approach.  I think there is a general recognition that there was a lack of specialist at the time.  Not just in economics but I think in other areas as well.  There was no career path for economists within the Department.  John FitzGerald has spoken about this, I think in this forum, but certainly at other fora he has spoken quite a lot about this.  He had to leave the Department because he felt if he wanted to move up he would have to move outside the economic space and into the sort of ... and that is what we are trying to address now is to create a career structure so you can join as an economist and you can move up the ranks as an economist.

We would, sort of, exchange views on where things were going.  There were a lot more people employed in the bank, so you could argue maybe there was a comparative advantage there but we would have informal discussions pretty much around the Central Bank's quarterly bulletin, we would discuss where things were going.

We made the assumption in various budgetary forecasts, and we modelled a soft landing on the basis of we were currently, or at the time, producing 70, 80, 90,000 units at the peak.  At the time, it was estimated that, on the basis of demographic trends, and on the basis of fall in headship rates, in other words an increase in the percentage of the population who are heads of household, that there was an underlying need for about 50,000 units per annum.

That was the central scenario but we did model internally -  in a document that I wrote with a colleague who is now the Secretary General - what would be the implications on the public finances of a hard landing if output was to go from 90 down to sustainable levels more rapidly?  In fact, it didn't go to sustainable levels, it overshot on the way down, as sometimes happened.  And we concluded that the impact on overall economic activity of each 10,000 reduction would be to shave about a percentage point of the growth rate, add about a percentage point to ... a half or a percentage point, I can't remember, to the unemployment rate,  add a half a percentage point to the deficit, and these were simply the first round effects.

So, in 2008, when we brought forward the budget, we based it on the IMF's forecasts, which were published at the beginning of October.  The budget was then in mid-October.  A week or so afterwards, the IMF revised its forecasts, so even though there was all of these economists, it simply was not possible to foresee the crisis.  The number of economists and the quality of policy-making: the ECB, not an institution I have particular affection for.

The Minister was in favour of us doing it, not because he necessarily agreed but he doesn't want the, sort of, groupthink to take hold again.  This was reported in parts of the media.  So we are making these submissions on issues that we think are important and they're not necessarily in line with Government policy.  So there is a practical example in that particular one, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062400002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1435100400,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Okay.

The committee has gone over NAMA in a lot of detail already but there are still certain elements that we want to look into.  And one thing I'd like to ask you about is, the first tranche of loan valuations by NAMA was completed in March 2010 and Governor Honohan has written that &quot;it was clear then, extrapolating from this information at the time, that this would be the most costly banking crisis ever recorded&quot;, and that's page 76 in the book <i>Lenihan: In Calm and Crisis<\/i>.

We were dealing with the crisis we had, we weren't going around trying to compare this with someone else's crisis and say which was the most costly and which wasn't.  That's simply the case.  The more pertinent issue for us was that the first round ... the first tranche, was coming in at a discount of I think around 50%, certainly heading for that, maybe 47%, and the NAMA draft business plan which was only a short few months old at that stage, had been based around a 30% discount.  So the more ... much more pertinent concern than whether it was better or worse than someone else's crisis was what this meant for our crisis.  And what this meant, in fact was more capital and that was a serious consideration - and it was a serious consideration from then on.  More seriously still, the discounts got bigger as we went down to the smaller borrowers.  Remember the first two tranches, I think it was, covered the first 30 borrowers.  The tranches later had a great many more borrowers in smaller amounts and, as I recall it, when NAMA got to those borrowers, they were finding a lot of ... a lot of incomplete legal work, a lot of concern about title, a lot of those kinds of issues, which wouldn't have been evident at the time the NTMA was working on the NAMA business plan because they were working at that point, as was very explicit, on data from the banks themselves.  Some other factors in the meanwhile would have been that the ... all this had to be cleared with the European state aid people and they were quite explicit that they wanted very strict adherence both to their guidelines but also to valuation procedures and so forth.  So there was a serious issue; but the issue wasn't whether, you know, ours was the best crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062400002#X01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Cardiff"},{"type":"speech","time":1435100400,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I think, Mr. Cardiff, Mr. Honohan's point was that this was going to be worse than we'd anticipated ... is the point that he was making, looking at the first tranche passing over.

I'm not saying it wasn't.  Just to be clear, the idea of a NAMA programme or of an IMF programme, one imagined the guarantee and the associated responses in 2008 or 2009 had gone badly wrong.  Well, at that point, we might have looked for some .... we might have had to look for some external support.  Certainly, it wasn't the plan ... it was nobody's intention but the first time I asked for some very, very preliminary and informal work on, you know, how one actually gets an IMF programme, was in September 2008, and at that point, I was thinking, you know, there was no work done on it.  I just asked a colleague to make a discreet inquiry as to how you get into these things, if you do need them, just as a precaution because things were very bad from then.  Then in 2009, I believe there were hints in Washington, possibly also in Dublin, that, you know, IMF would be available if we wanted them.  At that point, the Minister gave a pretty firm instruction to me and to others that we were not engaging with that suggestion but in part because ... remember, a bank crisis means you have to fill gaps in liquidity and gaps in bank liquidity are enormous.  Capital is a lesser problem; liquidity is an enormous gap.  And you really need the fire power of a Central Bank to do that.  Now, in 2009 and into 2010, we had no problem getting funds for the Government, which is what the IMF provides.  What we had a problem with was the banks getting funds for themselves and, for that, we needed the ECB.  So there would have been no huge advantage, let's say, to an IMF programme before we got it, if it didn't come with some ongoing access to bank liquidity.   The banks were our problem and then by the time we got into the IMF programme, the sovereign itself had a problem and that's what IMF programmes are for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062400002#Y00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Cardiff"},{"type":"speech","time":1435100400,"counter":464,"content":"<p>Perhaps the Governor looking at what was happening with NAMA and speaking to the IMF was looking forward to September and what would happen in terms of a banking problem becoming a sovereign problem but Governor Honohan has written that he was quickly put in his place by Merrion Street officials when he conveyed this request or the suggestion from the IMF person in Ireland.

You talk about the \"fiction that the ECB was present in negotiations only to do with banking matters\"; \"an increasingly hectoring tone on the part of the ECB'' - this is in October after the Deauville Declaration; then moving into November, ''increasingly strident rhetoric from the ECB\"; \"the ECB's panicky state of mind\"; the November Trichet letter to Lenihan was \"a very direct warning and threat\"; \"It is easy to attribute a bullying attitude in retrospect\"; on recapitalising the banking system, \"the ECB had a different agenda\"; on the proposed interest rate, \"ECB showed a little less solidarity''; on burden-sharing you talk about \"the fallacy that the ECB was simply giving advice\".  So what was the relationship with the ECB like?  And do you blame the ECB for the fact that we had to enter a bailout?  And do you blame them for those terms that were not favourable to Ireland in that final agreement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062400002#Z02200","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435100400,"counter":510,"content":"<p>No.  Look, this is a negotiation.  All parties have something they want out of it.  So, I mean you have read out a lot of comments I made there and they are honest and I mean every one of them.  But almost every single time I made the comment, there is a counter-comment in the next paragraph, almost always, which you haven't read out.  Remember, think of us and Anglo or not Anglo.  Just take Ireland and a bust Bank and just reverse the situation somewhat.  We had all of the same problems with the bust banks as the ECB would probably say they had with us.  And the bust banks might say that were increasingly hectoring in our tone and so forth.  This was a negotiation.  People who I was dealing with were very tough at times, definitely hectoring.  Sometimes they changed their minds and it didn't suit; other times they seemed to make a promise and it didn't seem to be kept.  But they were doing their job to negotiate.  So, I mean if you were to go into any negotiation that's a tough negotiation with a lot of different agendas and found that there was no one was being tough, then there was something wrong with the negotiation, frankly.  I don't think they were doing anything other than what they saw as their job and, remember, as I make abundantly plain more than once in my statement, they were giving us a huge amount of support.  The slight irony in it was that they were dong so with a public reluctance, which actually made the level of support that was required, I think, slight  ... bigger.  So if the ECB had said November 2010, just after we had agreed to go on the bailout ... if they had said in a very public way, ''Okay, so long as the Irish are sticking to the programme, we are supporting them come what may''.  They would probably have actually have to give us less support than actually arose because in the event, they, sort of, said it's a good thing that they are joining the programme but no big supportive statement.  The big supportive statement only came in March after a lot of effort and, you know, the ECB will tell you, legally, they couldn't make those kind of statements.<\/p><p>I don't know if that's true, I expect it's not, or they might tell you that, you know, it wasn't appropriate because we hadn't done all that they wanted us to do, those kind of things.

If you remember, in April, or thereabouts, 2010, there was actually an optimistic moment or two.  The Central Bank had announced its stress test results.  The Government had announced what it would do, in terms of capital, about those stress test results.  I think the Bank of Ireland even got in a modicum of private sector equity, which implied that, for that month, the private sector was convinced that things were changing in Ireland.  And then the sovereign crisis happened - April, May, a little bit of it in March, even, but accelerating a lot into April, May, June; the Greek crisis.  And at that point bond investors became really, really risk averse, both in relation to banks and in relation to sovereigns.  So the Irish guarantee became worth less, if you like.  So, by the time we got into September 2010, at the time when ... well, even June, July, August, September 2010, at a time when really the banks ought to have been renewing their long-term loans to ... to deal with the end-September cliff, it simply wasn't possible for them to get into the ... into the market because they were relying on the sovereign credit and the sovereign credit was suddenly less good, so in that sense, the combination of the two was difficult but, you know, it wasn't so much the structure of the guarantee as that the end of the guarantee happened to coincide with this ... this huge risk averseness arising from the Greek crisis and then spreading to others later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062400002#DD01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Cardiff"},{"type":"speech","time":1435100400,"counter":623,"content":"<p>So, given what you're saying there about the banking guarantee and the cliff that was relating to it, the structural deficit that was in place, the funding cliff that was arising out of the banking guarantee and the sovereign relationship to the banks because it was a written guarantee, as opposed to a political guarantee, could I now ask you were Irish banks that were covered by the guarantee still solvent and, therefore, qualifying for ECB ELA funding at the time of Minister Lenihan's last letter to Mr. Trichet?

But remember, the outcome of their discussions and of the initial thoughts on NAMA were not for anyone to say that, you know, there's a ... there's suddenly a &euro;30 billion hole here.  The outcome was that we were looking at a capitalisation of the two big banks that amounted to &euro;7 billion, with a requirement for them also to raise capital.  So for the two bigger banks, we're talking about &euro;10 billion and then ... I forget what we were talking about for Anglo.  We were saying ... I think by then Anglo was going to be put on a drip feed, so it was ... it was never going to get all of the capital it might want upfront.  But even ... even into the middle of that year, I don't think anyone was talking about &euro;10 billion for Anglo.<\/p> <p>  The ... there were two things happening at once.  First of all, with the NAMA process later in 2010, the loans were being exposed and their loan qualities were being exposed in a way that wasn't known before.  But, at the same time, the economy was performing worse and worse and the property values within the economy were performing worse and worse.  So there was a sort of a rolling worsening on almost all fronts of the situation, which hadn't happened.  I mean, it got worse and worse so if you pick any time between September '08 and, you know, the middle of 2010 or into 2011 probably, you could find you'd have a different estimation of capital requirements based on what the particular position of the economy was at that moment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062400002#FF02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Cardiff"},{"type":"speech","time":1435100400,"counter":703,"content":"<p>Okay.

The asset protection scheme-type approach had been just started in the UK.  The big difference ... about pros and cons, the big difference is that, with the NAMA approach you value every single loan and you know exactly what your exposure is but it takes a year to do it.  Big problem.  The asset protection scheme, you take a punt up front on what the values are going to be.  Now, as it happens, had we taken the punt up front we'd have been very wrong.<\/p><p>That's a simple fact.  The banks would've made a killing at our expense.

I don't know whether that was because the banks themselves didn't understand their situation or because what ... I don't know why.  But certainly that's what NAMA found as it worked.

I think that even if ... and if they do, NAMA is legally obliged to report the matter to the guards, or it is committing an offence.  There's all sorts of provisions and so forth in there about confidentiality, about ensuring that the State's position is protected.  There are even provisions in there about ... we had a concern about ransom strips, in other words that if a borrower had control of both a building and a piece of land outside the building, that he wouldn't be able to manipulate the control of the piece of land outside the building to the, to manipulate also the value of the underlying asset.<\/p><p>There were planning provisions and so forth to make sure we could ... that NAMA could get access, could complete its business.  So, there was a huge effort in the NAMA legislation to try to anticipate what kind of tactics could a reluctant borrower engage in and to address each one of those as much as we could in legislation.  So, a very big effort there and then in relation to the institutions themselves, well, I mean Anglo had been nationalised, new board, new management and they were expected to manage in the best interests of the bank, not in the best interests of any borrower.  And in 2010 then ... beginning of 2010, the NTMA was given a ... had a form of roll up to them but it was given the job of being the Minister's ... acting for the Minister in negotiations with the various institutions and to ensure that there was a professionalisation, let's say, of the relationship management with the institutions and at that stage then, new chief executive in NTMA and so forth, they were able to bring in a new approach, a new set of staffing to deal with that.  So there was a pretty intensive effort to make sure that ... that things were being looked after more or less right but it still, and still I imagine even now, relies hugely on the managements of individual institutions to ... to do their job.  NAMA was a bit different.  NAMA, sort of, progressed from a point of not really trusting because we were taking all these loans on to the State's balance sheet.

First of all, if you mark to market ... remember, a bank typically earns ... I don't know, a few per cent on a loan.  In fact, it earns the difference between the few per cent they pay to the depositor and the few extra per cent that it gets on the loan.  So, it's working on a return of, you know, a net return of a margin of a couple of per cent on any given loan.  Now, if you take that loan and you sell it into the market, which is what a mark-to-market approach would do, then you're selling it to people who are looking for a return of maybe 10% or 12% or 15%.  So, the market value of that loan will be ... could be quite ... quite heavily discounted relative to what the value it would be on the bank's books and the banks assume, generally speaking, unless things have changed very radically, they assume that over time, they will hold that loan over time and they will get the ... they will get the full payment in the end less whatever provision they might make for the likelihood of ... of a default and the amount they get on default.  So, the mark-to-market value would be quite different from the going concern value for a bank that is ... is in ongoing mode.  Now, at the end of, you know, in the week before the 29th, 29 September 2008 just to be clear, we spoke to Goldman Sachs and they were saying, \"Well, look actually the loan book may be not quite so bad as we had initially thought it might be and that in fact, over time they, they might just trade through all this, they could trade through all this without actually burning through all their capital, assuming they are allowed to trade through.\"  That was the difference in the assumption, I suppose, assuming allowed to trade through, they were saying, \"Not, on that basis insolvent.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062400002#LL00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Cardiff"},{"type":"speech","time":1435100400,"counter":785,"content":"<p>A very short supplementary, now, Deputy.

Other subsidiaries too.  So they ... we thought ... but, again, this is ... as I said, you don't know until the very end, until someone turns over the cards, you don't know exactly what ... what cards people were playing.  But we thought that they were going much too slow on that.  I recall a quite tough conversation in which AIB said, ''Look, you've always been [I've always been] negative on the Polish subsidiary'', and I said, ''No, I think the Polish subsidiary is great.  The problem is I'm negative on AIB and you need to sell the Polish subsidiary to support AIB''.  It was the jewel in the crown, naturally they didn't want to get rid of it.  But there were other subsidiaries too, other asset disposals they could do.  In ... in Bank of Ireland, at least they thought ... they started thinking quite quickly about their UK mortgage book.  I mean, it's evident, from that document you just gave me last night, they were at least thinking well, here we have this mortgage book if we could sell that we would ... that would generate capital also.

If you read what I said, I said get into it, deliver the best services you can, with less money, because we had less money, there was no choice about that.  We had less money.  We had two possibilities at that point; either the country could go bankrupt ... three possibilities ... either the people would continue to lend to us, in which case we could continue to provide services, but nobody would lend to us based on the level of fiscal adjustment that had been planned up to the middle of that year.  There had to be more or we would have no lenders ... no market lenders.<\/p> <p>  The second possibility was that we would have to seek assistance from the EU and IMF, and it was fairly clear at that point that they also would require very substantial fiscal adjustments, therefore, we would have no choice there.  And the third possibility was that we would cease to be able to fund ourselves at all, in which case our fiscal adjustment would have had to be, instead of being of the order of 4% or 5% of GDP, it would have to have been of the order of the entire scale of our deficit, which in 2011, even without the adjustment, was around about 10% of GDP.

Look, I also said in that speech that at that time our ... the scale of our deficit was about the budget, I think, of the education and health sector combined.  That's what we had to find.  Without fiscal adjustment, without cuts that really hurt people, we would have had to do an awful lot more.  And even if it was a dreadful situation for us to find ourselves in, it was a situation in which people a whole lot more vulnerable than the people making the decisions would suffer, but the alternative was a decision ... was a non-decision approach where we would let worse things happen.  So that's what I was saying and when I was telling people to fight, I meant it.  They had to get out there and find ...

You see, what you hope when you do a merger is if you take, say, a bank that's reasonably well capitalised but is short on funding, and you put it into a bank that has plenty of funding but may need the capital, you have a synergy there that really works, but there didn't seem to be a strong enough case for doing that, especially since you would lose time and effort in the merger arrangements.  There was a significant ... I think the most likely merger that didn't happen, if you like, was between ILP and EBS, in part because EBS had access ... EBS had a set-up of what they call a covered bond bank, so it had a mode of funding which ILP did not have, and ILP had a very high loan-to-deposit ratio and this might have helped.  But, to be honest, as things went on, it seemed clear that first of all EBS's loan-to-deposit ratio itself wasn't so healthy and it was not big enough to create a big difference for ILP and even covered bonds, in other words secured bonds, were getting hard to issue, so at that stage, I think people just said, \"Well, look, there's not much more to pursue here.\"  So it ... it mostly was because there were no marriages of institutions that looked like it would make a stronger couple than they were as individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062400002#NN01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Cardiff"},{"type":"speech","time":1435100400,"counter":822,"content":"<p>Did the troika have a particular view or were they taking the advice, the knowledge on the ground, or were they saying, \"There has to be something...\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062400002#NN01700","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435100400,"counter":823,"content":"<p>Later on there was a few different views from the troika and they weren't actually at one on all of this.

In essence, this related to putting in place, in the Statute Book, the regulatory framework applying to financial institutions.  In practice, this primarily involved my unit participating in the negotiation and transposition into Irish law of what was at the time described as an avalanche of EU financial service directives, under the EU financial services action plan or FSAP.  The FSAP was designed to put in place a common pan-EU framework for the regulation of the financial sector.  This was considered essential to building a single market in financial services in the EU and promoting the provision of financial services on a cross-border basis.  Each of the directives was the outcome of an extended period of expert analysis and debate at the EU level.  The process involved in advanced ... in addition to finance ministries, the European Commission, committees of the EU financial supervisors and intensive consultation with industry representatives.  The financial service directives were regarded and represented as embodying cutting-edge modern models and approaches to financial regulation, such as the state-of-the-art Basel II accord for banks, which I'll say a little bit more about later.<\/p> <p>  The existence and presumed full implementation of this detailed and comprehensive EU regulatory framework, endorsed at EU level by all member states and supervised domestically by the Financial Regulator, provided very substantial reassurance to the Department as to the safety and soundness of individual institutions and indeed, of the stability of the domestic financial system as a whole.  Once this EU-determined regulatory framework had been put in place in legislation by the Department of Finance, the Financial Regulator was responsible for implementing and enforcing it and supervising the financial firms to which it applied.  The legislation establishing the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland and the EU regulatory framework did not provide the Minister of Finance with any statutory role in overseeing or scrutinising the Financial Regulator's performance or the exercise of its supervisory functions and responsibilities.<\/p><p>Strict supervisory independence was a key principle internationally, such as under the Basel core principles for effective banking supervision.  The concept of supervisory independence was also central to the design of the EU framework for financial regulation.  The authoritative expert consensus at the time was that banking supervisors should benefit from the same high degree of independence as central bankers.  It was therefore integral to my area of the Department's relationship with the Financial Regulator that we should not take any significant action or step which could interfere or encroach on that strict supervisory independence.  This was essential to rule out any scope for any perception of political interference in financial regulation and supervision, given the major conflicts of interest that might potentially arise.  Any perceived breach of that principle would certainly have given rise to major concerns at regulatory authority level, given the authority's statutory mandate.  In addition, the professional secrecy obligations under which the Financial Regulator operated, set out in EU and domestic law, prohibited the disclosure of information held by the Financial Regulator by virtue of the exercise of its statutory role and responsibilities.  This was a very wide non-disclosure provision.<br\/><br\/>The strict independence conferred on the Central Bank under the CBFSAI legislation, and the EU treaties as part of the Eurosystem, created an identical dynamic in terms of my area's responsibilities <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the Central Bank on financial stability matters.  The stability of the financial system was a core function of the Central Bank under national legislation and the EU statute establishing the European system of central banks.  My unit in the Department did not therefore have any legal mandate or statutory role which would have permitted it to seek to critically assess or second-guess the Central Bank's assessments of the financial conditions and the capital buffers available to the banks to deal with economic shocks, as set out in the Central Bank's financial stability reports during the relevant period.  <br\/><br\/>Against this backdrop, the Basel II accord provided what proved to be entirely unwarranted reassurance to the Department that the supervisory, prudential and financial stability systems in the CBFSAI were operating effectively.  Basel II was the detailed and comprehensive regulatory regime for determining capital requirements and carrying out bank supervision introduced under the EU capital requirements directive or CRD.  The CRD was officially adopted by member states in June 2006 to enter into force from the start of 2007.  The very substantial programme of work in both the Financial Regulator and the credit institutions involved in transitioning to compliance with the CRD is evidenced, for example, by the extensive consultation documentation issued by the Financial Regulator in October 2006.  Basel II and the CRD were characterised as modernising and making capital requirements for banks more robust, comprehensive and risk-sensitive, fostering enhanced risk management in credit institutions, as well as strengthening financial stability overall.  However, as early as February 2009 the high-level group on financial supervision in the EU, commissioned by the President of the Commission to make proposals to strengthen European supervisory arrangements, concluded that the international banking crisis heightened the need for a fundamental review of the Basel II CRD framework.  The high-level group concluded that Basel II underestimated some important risks and overestimated banks' ability to handle them, that the Basel methodology seemed to have been disproportionately based on recent past economic data and good liquidity conditions and that these mistakes led to too little high-quality capital being held by the banks.<br\/><br\/>In summary, from my perspective the sophisticated and technically complex modelling of banks' risks and reliance on risk-weightings based on assessments by external credit rating agencies to determine capital requirements under Basel II helped contribute to an entirely misplaced confidence in the capital adequacy of banks and the efficacy of bank supervision, even as the liquidity crisis intensified.  Indeed one regulatory expert in his evidence to the UK parliamentary commission on banking standards characterised Basel II as &quot;a complete waste of time&quot;.  It contributed to a situation where bank supervision seems to have essentially comprised an administrative procedure to review systems and processes for the management of risk put in place by the banks themselves.  According to the Nyberg report, prudential supervision comprised tick-box checks that formal procedures were in place, not checks on how they operated in practice.  The false sense of security engendered by the CRD was compounded by the outcome of the stress tests reported in the Central Bank's financial stability reports.  These extreme but plausible scenarios appeared to show that even if a hard rather than a soft landing occurred for the property market, capital buffers in the bank were adequate.  <br\/><br\/>I turn now to contingency planning in the period 2005 to 2006.  Financial stability planning carried out in my unit involved the development of contingency plans for any Government intervention required to resolve an individual financial institution in distress or stabilise the banking system as a whole.  There are a number of distinct strands to this work stream in my area of the Department over the period from mid-2005 onwards and an important focus of our work, at least initially, was in reviewing the Central Bank's crisis management manual, the black or red book, and reviewing the case for putting in place a corresponding manual for the Department.  It also encompassed a first assessment of the many legal issues that arose in relation to the successful resolution of a distressed financial institution.  This included consideration in particular of the legal issues involved in facilitating a market solution, where a large overseas bank might be encouraged to take over a distressed, at risk, domestic institution.  It also identified the need to review the legal framework for crisis management, and examine the legal powers that should comprise part of the public authority's toolbox where intervention was required to support an individual institution or the banking system as a whole.  There was also a significant EU dimension to this work at the EU financial services committee, at which the Department of Finance was represented at second Secretary General level, relating to arrangements for responding to the failure of a cross-border financial institution.  A critical backdrop to this work throughout 2005 and 2006 was that the Financial Regulator consistently and strongly highlighted to the Minister and the Department that the credit union movement represented the most significant risk to financial stability in Ireland during ... at that time.  In light of the Financial Regulator's assessment of national financial stability risk, in the Department we prioritised the assessment of the credit union sector and undertook and completed a major programme of work to review, assess and respond to the various issues and concerns raised.  In parallel we continued to progress broader financial stability planning, tracking developments and recommendations at EU level.  <br\/><br\/>Turning to financial stability planning in 2007 and 2008, in terms of broader financial stability planning, an important focus in 2007 was aligning national planning with developments at EU level, given the growth in the cross-border provision of financial services and following participation in the EU crisis simulation exercise in April 2006.  A key next step flowing from deliberations at EU level was the establishment of a national ... of national domestic standing groups, on which work commenced in the Department in the last quarter of 2006.  This led to the formal establishment of the DSG, comprising representatives of the Department, the Financial Regulator, and the Central Bank in July 2007.  The DSG played a crucial role from August 2007 with the onset of the liquidity crisis, ensuring that the Minister was fully informed of the Financial Regulator's and Central Bank's assessment ... assessments of financial conditions and the funding pressures on the banking system.  The stringent confidentiality requirements that I've already referred to would otherwise have seriously inhibited communication between the public authorities and this crucial information flow from Dame Street to Merrion Street.  The DSG was a forum for communication and information exchange.  It provided the basis for multiple reports to the Minister and Government on financial conditions, many of which are in the public domain.  The DSG did not have a decision-making role, nor did it have any joint mandate in relation to the distinct and differentiated responsibilities of the organisations participating on it.  <br\/><br\/>As the crisis intensified in 2008, and as foreseen by the governing documents for the DSG, management of the crisis migrated to the top management level in the Central Bank, Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance, with the NTMA involved from end-2007 and increasingly prominent.  As set out in my written statement, from the autumn of 2007 we did seek to utilise the DSG to seek to develop the principles and agree a shared analysis and methodology that would better guide and inform crisis management on a co-ordinated basis among the public authorities.  This work did not progress significantly beyond the Department's February 2008 scoping paper on financial stability planning on account of, for example, the important differences in emphasis with the Central Bank's assessment, as reflected in the Central Bank's comments on the Department's scoping paper, and its own paper on resolution options circulated in June 2008, the Financial Regulator's evident preoccupation over that time with the resolution of the CFD-related share overhang issue in one institution and the Central Bank and Financial Regulator's enduring assessment that the crisis was exclusively attributable to international liquidity situation, and the consequent sole focus on supporting bank funding.<\/p><p>The Department, therefore, continued to prioritise over the period, the preparation of draft emergency legislation to nationalise a bank.  In early September 2008, this work was re-orientated to taking a building society into public ownership on the basis of a major contribution from the office of the Attorney-General, and, at a late stage, the Department's commercial legal advisers.  By end September 2008, our contingency planning advanced to the point that legislation to do either could be finalised for publication and enactment at very short notice.  The draft legislation also contained provisions to set aside competition law requirements to facilitate a market solution, provide financial assistance to credit institutions in the form of guarantees or capital, and provide the required legislative basis for the proposed secured liquidity scheme for bank funding.<\/p><p> In conclusion, my written statement and the supporting document I have submitted to the committee covers the foregoing issues, as well as those lines of inquiry which I have not referenced in this overview in considerably greater detail.

So there was a high degree of sensitivity and secrecy around our own work.  But more than that, I mean there was a strong sense, and this probably reflected the work that had been done at EU level up to then, in looking at the issues that would arise if there was a failure in a cross-border financial institution, that there was a major ... I mean, all of the crisis management done at EU level related to this issue of, \"Well, what about if a major European cross-border bank got into difficulties\", and what arrangements would need to be put in place for what they used to, what was referred to, and what I'm sure is still referred to as \"burden-sharing\", where governments in different member states where that bank operated would get involved in resolving that, those issues.  So that was the focus of work at, kind of, in the, sort of, the EFC, that is the economic and financial committee, and the FSC, two high level European committees.  There was no sense of there, I mean that was as far as that, there was a sense of any kind of EU response to difficulties in any particular member state, and that would arise if you were talking about a cross-border bank.  And it's interesting to make the point that, I mean, those kind of, that work stream I won't say broke down, but where it really got into difficulties was getting to a point with member states where there was any sense the member states were willing to agree, kind of, burden-sharing arrangements.

I mean maybe a good illustration of the complexity that was involved in Basel II; the original Basel I framework I think is described is 30 pages long, the second one is well over 300 and is, you know, hugely complex, technical, based on what was considered, at the time, best practice in terms of risk modelling, credit assessment and so on.<\/p> <p>  I think part of the difficulty was that from, obviously from the banks' perspective - to the extent that they paid any attention to this - but certainly from the regulator's, that as sometimes happens with all kinds of models, the model itself becomes the oracle in terms of whether something is working, is perceived to be working, or otherwise, rather than, as I'm sure people more expert to talk about Basel II would tell you, that it's meant to be just an aid to decision making or to the exercise of supervisory judgment.<\/p> <p>  But, I mean, it's important to make the point that when you talk about Basel II that it wasn't just a kind of technical modelling exercise.  There was three pillars to it and one of the most ... the second pillar to it was what was called the supervisory review.  It was characterised by the IMF in June 2008 as the heart and soul of the framework, which adds a solid layer of supervisory judgment to more rules-based approach of pillar 1.  That's the modelling piste.  It's built around principles that define roles and responsibilities of banks and their supervisors in the assessment of capital adequacy which include, as well as go beyond, the risk covered in pillar 1.<\/p> <p>  So, Basel I envisaged that you'd have this modelling and you'd have this sophisticated risk management systems but you'd also have supervisors assessing whether the modelling of risk was capturing all the risks in the institutions.  But I mean it's absolutely clear, although I don't have direct knowledge of it, that the time, energy and resources in the Financial Regulator in just putting that model in place in a small country - you would have heard in talking to the people from the FR, you know, their staff resources, the limits on staff resources - it was a huge exercise, and in the banks themselves.  And I think that point is made, either in the Honohan report or the Nyberg report that, as far as the banks were concerned, the risk management experts were taken off the day-to-day assessment of the risks the banks were carrying, to help create this infrastructure that the banks would need going forward to be competitive in capital markets, you know, under the Basel framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062400002#BBB00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Beausang"},{"type":"speech","time":1435100400,"counter":1001,"content":"<p>Was it the intention of Basel II that banks would supervise themselves?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062400002#BBB00300","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435100400,"counter":1002,"content":"<p>I think ... you know it ... it's a contentious issue and ... obviously I mean ... you will talk to people who will hold that ... that kind of, the Basel ... you know, that in moving from Basel I to Basel II there was an ... you know, there was an improvement, in principle, in terms of the design and the regulatory system.

Why did the Irish principles\/rules-based regulation, which was similar to other EU countries' rules-based regulation, fail so much worse than those other countries who had similar regulatory systems?<\/p><p>This is a question I have put to other witnesses Mr. Beausang.

We put in place those rules, that was our job.  As I outlined in my witness statement and in my overview, we took, as far as prudential regulations were concerned, consumer protection legislation was done and it was obviously a domestic initiative but we took these models of financial regulation.  They were carefully worked through by experts in Brussels, committees of financial supervisors, significant consultation with industry.  We took those models, having negotiated those models and those models had been agreed by all member states and put them in place.  It was then the responsibility of the Financial Regulator to implement the regulation and to supervise the banks in the manner that those regulations suggested.  So the contrast that is often drawn is between the approach taken in Ireland and let's say the approach taken in Spain.  Although I couldn't say this definitively, in broad terms they were operating the same framework, they were operating the same pan-EU framework of financial regulation.  Of course they had their own difficulties in Spain eventually but the Spanish regulator is seen and the Spanish central bank is seen to have been more intrusive and having people on the ground in the banks rather than as occurred in Ireland.  So that is the conclusion I would come to as to why things were disproportionately worse here.  Apart from the conduct of the banks which is a separate issue there were significant supervisory failures as documented in Nyberg and as documented in the Honohan report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062400002#DDD00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Beausang"},{"type":"speech","time":1435100400,"counter":1011,"content":"<p>Can I ask you your view in relation to, you are talking about a prudential regulation of the institutions.

Now, these two statements, the draft Government press release, which is document TAB AM, and then TAB AN, which is the revised version, right, there's no great difference in those documents bar you say the first one states that \"The Government stressed all institutions will continue to operate as normal with their customers on the basis of this guarantee\", and the revised one said \"All customers should continue to operate as normal\".  First reason, I know I have a limited time, Chairman, the first thing I want to know, why did that change happen?  And secondly, comparing it to the Government press statement, that issued on 30 September, the content of it, outside of maybe changes, it's the same language, it's using, it uses \"has decided\", uses words like \"market turmoil\", it uses the \"Government to remove any uncertainty\", \"objective ...[take] ..... decisive action ... to maintain financial stability\", \" designed to safeguard the Irish financial system\".<\/p> <p>  The key differences are: in terms of the language used, I think, Mr. Beausang, it's very similar, one could state that it's just purely an editing of the, of language that's used, but the document, the press statement you prepared with Eoin Dorgan, is a six-month guarantee purely for deposits.  The revised, the Government guarantee deals with ... it covers, in addition it covers covered bonds, senior debt and dated subordinated debt, dated lower tier 2 debt.  Also, this was purely for six months but the Government's one is a two-year guarantee from 29 September 2008 to 28 September 2010.  So the question, I suppose, I'm asking you is, is that, when was the first occasion that you became aware of this Government press statement, where it stated the six-month guarantee, the one you received from David Doyle?
