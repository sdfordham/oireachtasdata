We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to this committee.  I welcome everyone back and trust everyone is alive and well and ready for more work.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Josepha Madigan.  I understand she will be stepping down from this committee to take up her new post as Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  It is up to the Oireachtas to announce her replacement so we will deal with that when it arises.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the agenda are the minutes for the meetings on 11, 12 and 13 July 2017.  These were the last meetings we had before the summer break.  Are these minutes agreed?  Agreed.  The next item concerns matters arising from those minutes.  Is there anything in particular arising?  I do not think so.  The one thing I noticed was that we agreed on the last day, when looking at the accounts presented for an organisation called An Ch&eacute;im, to hold over its 2016 accounts until the next meeting.  We will have to deal with An Ch&eacute;im when we come to the list of financial statements.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence.  We have a long list of up to 60 items since our last meeting two months ago and this volume of correspondence shows how busy the Committee of Public Accounts is.  We will move through it as efficiently and promptly as we can while still giving everything proper consideration.  Category A correspondence concerns today's public meeting - there is none for today as we have no witnesses in public session.  Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers along with follow-up correspondence and items that we requested.  All these items are for publication.  The first item in the schedule is No. 705B, dated 14 July 2017, from Claire Byrne, CEO of St. Raphael's Garda Credit Union, in relation to media coverage concerning comments made about the credit union during the committee's examination of the Garda college.  The correspondence states that the credit union confirmed to GIAS that it is happy to co-operate fully with the investigation, subject to the receipt of the appropriate lawful authority to release the information requested.  There are some items here relating to our work before the summer.  They might sound a bit dated but we have to deal with them in public.  This item is noted.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 706B, correspondence 1-2, dated 14 July 2017, from Neil McDermott of the Higher Education Authority.  This is in response to a request from the committee for information on Dundalk Institute of Technology's long-term contract with a sole supplier for recruiting international students, essentially from Asia and China.  The letter sets out the rationale for these arrangements, principally based on the fact that it is a unique service.  The HEA also states that it is surveying higher educational institutions in order to gather an understanding of the issues surrounding international student recruitment.  It is not particularly unique; I do not see how these services are as unique as we have been told they are and I imagine that there are a number of agencies providing similar services.  I propose, however, that we note this item for the moment and ask the HEA to keep us informed of the review it is carrying out.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 707B, received from the Higher Education Authority and dated 14 July 2017.  This concerns further information requested by the committee on contracts, following the meeting with third level institutions and the HEA on 22 June.  The committee's request was very extensive, namely, a review of all contracts for the last ten years.  The HEA has replied that the colleges contacted have stated that this requires a significant volume of work because many of the records involved are archived and some are manual.  The letter states that the HEA proposes to request that the institutions report on the engagement and associated costs of all external consultancy firms and consultants appointed to carry out investigations and inquiries into internal matters going back ten years, as well as on the engagement and associated costs of legal firms and the nature of such services going back ten years.  The HEA expects that it will facilitate detailed reporting by each institution on expenditure of specific interest to the committee in terms of internal investigations and legal advice.  I propose that we reply to the HEA advising that the committee agrees with its proposal and that the information will be reviewed when received.  What we are essentially talking about here is where investigations are carried out and outside consultants and legal firms are brought in.  The HEA is going to obtain this information and put it out on a formal basis so that we get a report in the future.  Is that okay?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092100002#B00100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1505980800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>The HEA says that it will incorporate this into its annual report.  Will it furnish us with the full information in a separate report beforehand?  That is what we sought.  Things can get lost when they get incorporated into annual reports.  We will have a lot to evaluate there when that comes before us.  What we sought was a very specific piece of work about consultancy firms carrying out investigations and I do not really see why it would be difficult to get that information.  I do not accept that it is as difficult to obtain as the HEA says it is here, but notwithstanding that, I would prefer it if we were to get that information separately.  The HEA can by all means incorporate it into its annual report, but I would rather it gave it to us as a separate report.  Could that be requested?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092100002#B00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505980800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>My reading of that is an annual statement required from the chair of the governing body of each third level institution to the HEA about the middle of every year.

We will ask for a specific report on previous years.  No. 708B, correspondence 1-4, dated 14 July 2017, is also from the HEA and concerns further information on the combined liabilities of universities and the most commonly procured consultancy firms; the salaries of the presidents of all the third level institutions; and a review of HEA procurement across the third level sector.  The review is something that members may be interested in considering further and I suggest that we note it for now.  It gives details on all the items we asked for, including the salaries of the heads of all the third level institutions, which are provided on a separate list.  Finally, it includes a very comprehensive report produced by Deloitte, reference number 708\/3B, and produced on 4 May 2017.  This report is very extensive.  Nothing in it strikes me, but I think that we have to write to HEA to request a timeline of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report.  It is fine to get the report but we want to make sure that some action is taken.  It is reasonable to suggest we do not just put the report on the shelf but ask the HEA to come back to us on this at some point before the end of the year.  We will give it a few months for that.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 710B, correspondence dated 17 July 2017, from Ed Silvey, director of credit institution and supervision and acting registrar for credits unions in the Central Bank.  The letter concerns St. Raphael's Garda Credit Union and states that, due to confidentiality requirements, it is not possible to provide the information requested by the committee regarding any investigation that may have been carried out into the Garda credit union.  However, sets out, in general terms, what the credit union's expectations are and we can note this.  It is standard practice for the Central Bank not to get into specific confidential items and I think we can understand that.<\/p> <p>  The next item, No. 711B, is an extensive letter from the HSE, dated 11 July 2017, concerning further information requested at our meeting on 15 June.  The correspondence includes information notes as requested by the committee.  Members may wish to study these and return to this.  We will be specifically engaging with the HSE in the coming week as a section 38 and section 39 organisation.  We had a list of approximately 15 questions, which have all been answered in this documentation to varying degrees.  I suggest that members of the committee study them and if anybody wishes to come back on anything, please do.  There is a lot of good information here, which we note.  I will not read out the 15 questions again.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 712B, dated 14 July 2017, and received from Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of the Health.  This provides information requested by the committee on 15 June regarding contingent liabilities; a reconciliation of outturn figures; and an explanation for the exclusion of home helps from staffing numbers.  Again, I suggest members study this and use it as they see fit.<\/p><p>If anyone wants to come back to it again, we can do so.  We note that.<\/p><p> No. 714B is from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills enclosing the 2014 KPMG report regarding allegations against Cork Institute of Technology, as requested by the committee.  The report has been redacted very heavily primarily because not to do so would identify individuals concerned.  We note this and I am sure it is a matter that will be considered in our work programme for the coming year.  It is extensive but there are a lot of redactions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092100002#B00700","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505980800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>It is actually unreadable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092100002#C00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1505980800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092100002#C00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1505980800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Can we get an unredacted version?

We now have a document from the Department that sets out properties without a single date as to when this process started.  I would like a comment from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We are doing our best to bring accountability.  We know about the Ryan report and the deal that was entered into following that.  Properties were to be transferred.  My attention was drawn to this because of the Lenaboy site in Taylor's Hill in Galway, which is the last building on that list.  That building has been empty at least since 2009.  When this item came before us, it was confirmed that the decision was made to hand it over in 2009.  I and other Deputies raised questions about other properties.  I will be general and specific.  Precisely when was the decision made to hand over all these properties?  Where are the dates?  They should be included in the document from the Department of Education and Skills.  We should not have to drag this out given the painful history, which I will not go into here, of the children who suffered in these institutions.   When was the decision made to hand over all these properties?  Why is there such a delay?  What is going on?<\/p> <p>  I will finish with the specific building in Lenaboy.  It has been empty since 2009.  At the most recent meeting of the council there was a positive news story, which I welcome, that this building was donated to the council.  There is no donation involved.  It is a welcome news story but it was part of a negotiated settlement.  The questions are why it sat vacant and why it has deteriorated.  Why are we reduced to getting a positive spin on a story that it was handed over with a substantial cash contribution, which it would appear is now going towards addressing the deterioration of the building?  I think the sum to be handed over is &euro;750,000.  If this is just one building where it has deteriorated, I do not think this is the way to deal with it.

Are we going to be further short-changed?  As a result of numerous delays, the properties are falling into a poor state and are not being maintained.  When they are eventually transferred over, money has to be spent to bring them up to standard so there is no value at all to the State.  It might even do the religious orders a favour to take them off their hands in some cases.  There are serious issues in that regard and I would like to get the Comptroller and Auditor General's view on the matter.  It is my understanding that this was part of the orders' way to pay the compensation.  I imagine that a value was attached to these properties at the time.

One was a negotiated process which occurred around 2002-2003 and which involved a deal or a contract with legal obligations on both sides.   As I understand it, the agreement in 2009 was a moral or voluntary agreement whereby the congregations agreed to provide further recompense.  There is a difference between properties in respect of which a handshake occurred and an agreement was made and those in respect of which, essentially, the congregations can live up to the obligations they made or, in law, from which they could walk away.  It is important that the time factor is taken into account in all of this.  Certainly, the fact that an agreement made in 2009 to transfer properties and some of them are still not settled is a concern.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of value, and the point at which value is struck, my general understanding is that the value that is credited to the congregations is the value at the date of the agreement.  Any movement in values of property, either up or down afterwards, is the State's risk in the exchange.  It could be argued that properties valued in 2009 at, let us say, &euro;100 million might now, in aggregate, current market terms, be valued at &euro;150 million or &euro;200 million.  There may be those kinds of movements.  In the context of our presentation of it, we have always treated it as the value on the date the agreement was made.

We must make it very clear to him, as the Accounting Officer with a direct line of accountability to this committee, that this is not on.  Surely he should have realised that at this stage given everything that has happened.  Not alone do I want a letter written to the acting commissioner, I want him to present himself here to make an account of himself, provide us with a rationale and set out clearly the analysis, data and methodology by which decisions were taken to reopen some Garda stations while leaving others closed, in particular the Stepaside Garda station.

It did not result from proactive work by the Health Service Executive.  It is the result of very painful experiences by two whistleblowers, one of whom came before us in private session.  I do not think there was a single member of the Committee of Public Accounts that did not shed a tear on the day, not for the whistleblower who deserved tears, but for her description of what Grace had gone through and what the health board had done, in the whistleblower's opinion.  This report came about through the whistleblower's creativity and that of her partner who found a way to bring the matter before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I must say the Chairman's predecessor, Deputy McGuinness, played a blinder in working with them as did the committee members at the time.<\/p> <p>  All of that pain and extreme effort to get before the Committee of Public Accounts involved creativity in ensuring consideration of the value for money of the tendering for the reports that the Health Service Executive commissioned and then left sitting on a desk, and in terms of that body being deprived of money and, in effect, being punished.  Our attention was drawn to minutes where it was recorded that the voluntary body should be reminded where its money came from.  The Chairman may recall all of that. <\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien receives a huge salary, had access to a newspaper on a Sunday to say that politicians were reluctant to make difficult decisions and has very strong opinions.  He has absolutely failed to provide us with a report that was produced by an independent accountancy firm on a simple matter to clarify what reduction in funding, if any, was made to a voluntary body that had gone out on a limb to support the two whistleblowers in their very difficult time.  The whistleblowers suffered that difficulty over the period from 2009 to 2017, and they continue to do so.  What in God's name did Grace and the other people placed inappropriately in foster accommodation suffer?  The Committee of Public Accounts analyses value for money but the necessary Deloitte report has not been furnished to us.  The report has nothing to do with a commission of inquiry.  It is a factual report on whether the body did or did not receive money or if funding was reduced or increased.<\/p> <p>  We have talked about the Garda and I fully agree with accountability.  Today's item is one on which we should stand together.  Mr. O'Brien should be brought back before the committee.  The report must be furnished to us immediately so we can peruse it and discuss it with Mr. O'Brien.  That is the least we owe to Grace, and it is the least we owe to the whistleblowers upon whom we are utterly reliant.  <\/p> <p>  Last Monday, I attended a Public Accounts Committees Network conference with the Clerk to the Committee, Mr. Lenihan, in Cardiff, Wales.  The one thing that came across at the conference was our utter reliance on whistleblowers.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is doing a brilliant job, as are his counterparts in Northern Ireland and England, but at the end of the day we rely utterly on whistleblowers.  If this is the way we treat them, then God help us as a democracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092100002#H00400","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1505980800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>When Mr. O'Brien was with us earlier in the year, he told us that we would be provided with the report imminently.

He claimed that he had not been provided with the report, it had to be given to the people who would be named in it, and there were a whole lot of different things that he had not anticipated.  We had him back when the inquiry was announced and told him we could differentiate between what work the inquiry would do and what work the Committee of Public Accounts would do.  At no point did he say to us that the work of the inquiry would act as an impediment to us receiving the report.  That is a new development today.

It is correspondence dated 15 May 2017 from an individual regarding evidence relating to an ongoing dispute between North Meath Community Development Association and the HSE.  The matter has been before the committee on several occasions and at the meeting on 25 May 2017, the committee came to the view that the matter was outside its remit but agreed to review the correspondence that had been sent to the Department of the Taoiseach in 2016.  The secretariat has reviewed this correspondence.  When the previous correspondence raised the matter with the Department of the Taoiseach in January 2016, it did not request any specific action.  Since then the matter was reviewed by the Department of Health, which concluded it was not appropriate to intervene in an HSE operational matter.  In March 2017 we wrote to this body, enclosing correspondence from the committee from the Minister for Health, to convey the position of the committee that this is ultimately a contractual matter and that the committee cannot provide further assistance on the matter.  We should acknowledge efforts by the HSE to protect taxpayers' money in dealing with such contracts.  I propose that we write a further letter to reiterate that the matter is outside the remit of the committee and the committee's consideration of this matter is now closed.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>The next item is 698C, dated 12 July from Deputy Catherine Murphy requesting the committee to include an upgrade on the <i>www.jobsireland.ie<\/i>website undertaken by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in the top six the committee may choose to examine in our work programme.

He has had no recourse.  He was dismissed from the Prison Service after basically stopping an escapee from leaving the prison.  The Minister for Justice and Equality was in the locality of Portlaoise recently and listed a number of those in the Prison Service who had done the State some service.

The Olympic Council of Ireland is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and, therefore, is not within the remit of this committee.

In the first instance, I propose to circulate the report to members and if they wish to raise specific issues to be brought to the attention of the Irish Sports Council, we will write to it.  This issue has been dealt with by an Oireachtas committee.

The liquidation began on 7 February 2013.<\/p><p>At the time, control and oversight over remuneration for liquidators was governed by the Companies Act 1963, which also provided for scrutiny by a committee of inspection in the High Court.  No committee of inspection has been established in respect of the IBRC or provided for in the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act 2013.  Ordinarily these committees of inspection are made up of shareholders and creditors and their function is to assist the liquidator with approval fees and legal actions and to attend meetings on an ongoing basis to review the progress of the liquidation.  The role of the committee was further enhanced in the Companies Act 2014 and as a result most liquidators seek to ensure that a committee is appointed.  Special liquidators for the IBRC have not done so.  If there is a dispute with the liquidator on remuneration, for example, or on fees or things of that nature, an application can be made to the court to determine the matter.  Two examples of that happening were the case concerning ESG Reinsurance Limited before Mr. Justice Kelly and the case concerning Mouldpro International Limited in 2012 before Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan, as a result of which the liquidator's fees were reduced.  <\/p><p> Sections 646 and 647 of the Companies Act 2014 provide that the basis of a liquidator's remuneration is to be agreed with the committee of inspection to which I referred earlier.  Another section provides for challenges to liquidators' remuneration and provides for arbitration and so on in that regard.  Again, this is missing in the case of the IBRC liquidation.  Control and oversight and a mechanism to effectively challenge the cost of the special liquidators are also missing in this case.  Consultation meetings behind closed doors on the issue of fees with officials from the Department of Finance are, to my mind, not sufficient.  <\/p><p> Fees to the end of December 2016 were in the region of &euro;225 million.  While if the fees are broken down to hourly rates, they are based on reduced rates negotiated by NAMA for general professional fees - though NAMA has no function or role in this at all - the number of hours and the grades associated with the work being carried out are unknown.  Based on parliamentary questions I have tabled, it would be my humble conclusion that there is really no oversight.  The liquidators may well be paying themselves rock bottom in terms of actual fees per hour, but the number of hours and the amount of work being carried out would certainly be the greatest in Irish commercial history for a liquidation.  I would say that it would compare unfavourably with some big international liquidations.  In terms of the level of scrutiny, we do not have a committee of inspection or a route to challenge.  I do not know why those elements were omitted or whether the Bill to establish the liquidation in 2013 just remained silent on them and the IBRC chose not to have a committee of inspection.  <\/p><p> In the replies to the first round of parliamentary questions I circulated - and I sent more around this morning in which I sought further clarification on the first set of answers - it was stated that in 2016 there were eight meetings between the Department of Finance and the liquidators.  In 2017, with costs rising, there were only three and a fourth is planned towards the end of this month.  I specifically asked for a breakdown of the minutes of the meetings.  Commercial sensitivity was given as the reason they could not be provided, yet in a standard liquidation those minutes would be available to a committee of inspection, to shareholders and to creditors.  That is us, the people, albeit through the Minister, who owned the company.  The replies also would not provide details of the grades of the people who are operating.  Again, commercial sensitivity was cited.  That too would be information which would be available to the company owners - in effect the people through the Minister.  <\/p><p> It is very worrying that one of the parliamentary question replies said the Minister and the Comptroller and Auditor General have no role in this.  I asked if any external parties or external State agencies were asked to assist the Department of Finance in the oversight of this matter, in challenging fees or in anything along those lines.  The replies were silent on that issue, so we can assume that there is not any external help.  We are told that the Comptroller and Auditor General has no role, the Department has no role and the Minister depends on quarterly reports on these issues issued and published by the IBRC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092100002#M01900","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505980800,"counter":292,"content":"<p>The Deputy said the IBRC.

The target here - not that there is a target - is not KPMG.  It is paying itself and doing its work as it is allowed to do.  Effectively, however, it has been let off.  It is paying itself from recoveries, work-outs and various things.  Those fees are effectively box-ticking exercises for the Department of Finance.  I worry that there is no mechanism to challenge these fees and that the level of oversight which would be available in a standard liquidation of, let us say Marc MacSharry Limited, through a committee of inspection and other means, does not apply in this case, yet it is ultimately the taxpayers' money.<\/p> <p>  So far, to the end of 2016, the fees total &euro;225 million including VAT.  It would be reasonable to assume that they will head towards &euro;300 million by the end of 2017.  If one applies a per annum rate into the future, it is reasonable to assume, if there are five to ten years left to run in this, that the fees would be heading very close to &euro;1 billion, notwithstanding the 175 legal cases, two of which are the large and high profile Quinn cases.  If any of those cases were to be lost we would looking at many hundreds of millions of euro or - pick a number - who knows?  <\/p> <p>  Auto-pilot is a phrase that comes to mind in the context of how this is happening.  Applying the basic accountancy duty of care to clients, I do not think that the taxpayer can be confident that this is being run correctly and with the level of oversight that is required.  I know the practice is not to bring the Minister in except in extraordinary circumstances.  I know we had him in on NAMA.  I feel this is one of those occasions on which the Minister ought to be invited, along with the Secretary General and the liquidators themselves.  We should certainly hear Mr. McCarthy's views as well.  <\/p> <p>  This has been going on under the covers.  Perhaps everything is done correctly and fantastically well for the least money possible, but perhaps not.  In any event, given the amounts of money involved so far, the likely amounts going forward and the length of time involved, it would be reckless and foolish in the extreme if we did not involve ourselves in some way.  If that requires legislation or an amendment to the 2013 Act then this committee should recommend that, following the questioning of the people I have outlined. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092100002#N00500","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1505980800,"counter":296,"content":"<p>Prior to the liquidation, there was a very unhappy relationship between the Department of Finance and the IBRC.

On the level of scrutiny and challenge that must be in play on an ongoing basis, it is clear from the answers that I got, and Mr. McCarthy will see the ones because the meeting had started when I circulated the other ones, that the Department of Finance is going through the motions.  I should have mentioned it earlier but at one stage there were two rebates of &euro;5 million and &euro;3 million.  If that was a negotiated write-down on a &euro;225 million gross fee, it is 3%.  It does not sound great to me for that amount of money.  We also do not know the grades and number of hours per grade that were billed.  We have the hourly rates.  They were refused to me in the first round of questions and provided in the second, basically because the then Deputy, Lucinda Creighton, had been given that information before.  However, initially they were not being given it to me.  If it goes where I think it is going, and I might be reaching in saying this, we need a committee of inspection.  I do not know if it is a role for the Comptroller and Auditor General but we do need an oversight body that will take a lot more of a hands-on approach.  As I said, maybe the outcome will be that we are getting the best deal there ever was.  However, with a clock ticking towards a billion or an unknown number and an unknown period of time, a quarterly report provided by IBRC, as authors paying themselves without significant challenge and knowledge on the part of the Department of Finance which is representing the people, is not sufficient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092100002#O02400","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1505980800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>The Deputy's point is very clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092100002#O02500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1505980800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>In parallel with what Mr. McCarthy is doing, we need to press ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092100002#O02600","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1505980800,"counter":335,"content":"<p>To get it in under the remit of the committee, given that it is not voted expenditure, all I am saying is that Mr. McCarthy's chapter opens the door for it to be within our remit.

The work was carried out without the involvement of HEAnet, which was taking over the functions, so, effectively, the systems were developed without consultation with the people who were going to be operating them.  In addition, payments of &euro;941,000 were made to the service provider during the year without an appropriate competitive tender process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092100002#P01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1505980800,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Was this a full subsidiary of Dublin Institute of Technology?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092100002#P01700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505980800,"counter":384,"content":"<p>It was, but it was like a shared service for all of the institutes of technology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092100002#P01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1505980800,"counter":385,"content":"<p>We will write to Dublin Institute of Technology asking for a detailed response on the issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092100002#P01900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505980800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>They have set out the circumstances of the procurement in considerable detail in the statement on internal financial control, SIFC.

This was an organisation that was barely able to operate at board level for a long period because it did not have the numbers on the board.  Specifically, there are positions on that board which, for obvious reasons, are designated specialist positions relating to areas such as engineering, finance, etc., and many have been left vacant.  A couple of the positions have been filled in the past few weeks or months.  We need to correlate whether the procurement issues or any other issues relate to the fact that, effectively, we have a board that is barely functioning, despite it having a very good chairperson.  We also need to discover whether this is having consequences.  I use this as an example because, while it is not the only example, it is a particularly sensitive one in light of the organisation involved.

We had the HSE before us previously.  There are aspects of its accounts that would be in any other company's accounts but, because the Minister who sets up the accounts says that it does not include, say, its outstanding liabilities for clinical negligence in its accounts, that is not there.

The final one is InterTradeIreland - clear audit opinion.  These are noted.<\/p> <p>  The next item is the work programme.  Last year,  we completed all of the chapters in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report as well as three special reports on NAMA, Templemore - the interim report -  and third level.  During the summer we lined up a number of meetings for the first few weeks.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report will be out next Friday so we will not have it by next Thursday.  At our meeting on 5 October, we will have the opportunity to discuss this report and identify our priorities and, depending on what is in the report, decide which organisations we need to bring in first.  Whomever we decide to bring in will need a bit of time in advance.  In that context, I suggest a few meetings in the next month so as to show them the road.  HIQA will be coming before us and IDA Ireland is up the following week.  We are making provision for Mr. Tony O'Brien and for the acting Garda Commissioner to appear next Thursday if we have not received the report by tomorrow.  We will have to squeeze that time in.<\/p> <p>   I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to name the biggest outfit he audits that has not appeared before us in quite a while.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland is a big outfit, and there is not a constituency in Ireland that does not have a view on something to do with transport.  A lot of people, then, will want to talk to its representatives.  Tusla keeps cropping up.  It cropped up again today and I think we need to talk to it.  With regard to the HSE, we held off dealing with section 38 and 39 organisations last year but I think we need to go back to them now.  We do not need to spend the year dealing with them but we have not dealt with that matter in a while.  I propose that we talk to representatives from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on the 9 November and deal with local government on the 16 November.  That will take us up to the 26 November.  So we will meet representatives from HIQA, IDA Ireland, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Tusla and the HSE - on section 38 and section 39 organisations - in the period up to the end of November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092100002#Q05300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1505980800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092100002#Q05400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1505980800,"counter":459,"content":"<p>We may decide, after seeing the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, to move the meetings for the beginning of November.

On this special occasion, I also extend a heartfelt welcome to our MLAs, MEPs and MPs who join us for this special meeting of three Oireachtas committees, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence and the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The purpose of the meeting is to engage in an exchange of views with Mr. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's co-ordinator on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt, I welcome you to the Houses of the Oireachtas and invite you to take your seat in the Chamber.  You honour us with your visit to our Parliament today.  We are pleased to welcome you for this important discussion. <\/p> <p>  By way of background, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, sitting together in committee on 11 May last, met Mr. Michel Barnier, chief negotiator of the task force for the preparation and conduct of negotiations with the United Kingdom.  The meeting provided an opportunity for Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad to outline directly to Mr. Barnier their concerns for Ireland in relation to the negotiation process and its outcome.  Ireland's priorities include Northern Ireland, the Border and the Good Friday Agreement; the economic impact of Brexit, which has already manifested itself in the agrifood sector; the Single Market; and free movement, in particular of people in the common travel area.  As a result, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and European Union are being followed very closely in Ireland.  Mr. Verhofstadt, as the European Parliament's co-ordinator, has a key role in framing and presenting the final UK exit package to the European Parliament. <\/p> <p>  The unique position of and special circumstances confronting the island of Ireland were referenced in the European Parliament's resolution of 5 April on the exit negotiations.  This early recognition of the challenges facing Ireland is welcome and reassuring but we need to maintain this focus.  While the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU has clear implications for Ireland, it also draws our attention again to the debate about the future of Europe and any changes that may emerge from the process now under way.  Mr. Verhofstadt, as you will hear, this is an issue of crucial importance to all of us, as parliamentarians representing our citizens who share a deep concern about where this bumpy road will lead us, as citizens of Ireland and Europe.  We are very interested in hearing your views on the process, the potential outcomes of the negotiations and the implications for the European Union.  I have great pleasure in asking you to address this unique meeting of the joint committees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#A00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505986200,"counter":514,"content":"<p>Thank you very much a Cheann Comhairle, a Chathaoirligh and chairs and members of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence and the joint committee in relation to the negotiations under article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.  It is an honour for me to be here today and address you in this historic D&aacute;il Chamber.  I thank all of you for giving me the opportunity to address you here today because I am aware that it is not every day that a Member of the European Parliament responsible for such an important matter can address a meeting of joint committees of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  I first want to deliver a message of solidarity with Ireland, its citizens and people.  We will never allow Ireland to suffer as a result of the British decision to leave the European Union.  That is a commitment given by the European Parliament and European Union as a whole.  I will come back to this later in my contribution. <\/p> <p>  Next year, it will be exactly 20 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  Yesterday was the first time I visited Belfast.  It was a strange experience because for the past 20 years, we in the rest of Europe have not heard anything about Belfast on our television screens.  It is good to remember that because it is 20 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Agreement is not a practical arrangement on passports, borders, customs or tariffs - it is not about these matters - but an agreement about peace and the reconciliation of divided communities.  It is about rebuilding confidence and trust.<\/p> <p>  The Good Friday Agreement is also a successful innovation of citizenship itself.  Personally, I find the following sentence to be the most important sentence in the Agreement.  It is \"the birthright of all the people in Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may choose\".  In my opinion, these four simple words, \"as they may choose\", go against the outdated version of some states that do not like ambiguity, contingency or multiplicity.  They give to the people and individual citizens, rather than states, the power to choose their own destiny.  They are four simple words which have brought peace and stability to Northern Ireland based on openness and a common understanding that identities are multi-layered and complex and should bring people together rather than divide them.  In my opinion, these four simple words not only define Northern Ireland but Ireland as a whole. <\/p> <p>  I know that some British politicians, not to name Boris Johnson, criticise their country men and women for wanting to keep their European identity.  He even accused them of split allegiance.  This is a binary, old-fashioned and reductionist understanding of identity.  We need to be smarter and more open and inventive than that.  It is not one's origin or the fact that, by accident, one was born in this or that village, city or country that makes one a good citizen.  It is the fact that one embraces the values of one's community and cherishes the fundamental rights and freedoms of the society in which one lives.<\/p><p>These are values, rights and freedoms that are common in our European Union in all nations and in every one of our member states so I think it is nonsense to talk about a split allegiance.  It is perfectly possible, I think, but I have not practised it, to feel English, British and European at the same time and it is perfectly normal to be a Dubliner, Irish and European at the same time without being schizophrenic.  There is no question of split allegiance.  It is this vision that needs to be defended by our European Union just as the Union needs to defend, I think, and this is my second point, that there is no return to the past to a time of hard borders on our Continent, and certainly not to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  Members will know that is a point we made very clear in the European Parliament's resolutions we adopted on 5 April 2017.  <\/p><p> I am mistaken when I state that the Irish Border is in no way a natural one.  It is not a river or a mountain ridge.  It meanders for 310 miles through meadows, forests and farmlands.  It cannot be securely poised and is, therefore, an illogical divide.  The Border should at least remain invisible just as it is today.  It is a little bit visible because one can see a marking in yellow when one enters the Irish Republic.  The colour of the marking changes from white to yellow.  That is the big lesson that I learned yesterday. <\/p><p> I spent yesterday afternoon visiting the Border in County Monaghan where I met people who live and work there.  At one point, I stood astride the Border, with one foot in Northern Ireland and my other foot in the Republic.  I found it completely impossible to see where one jurisdiction ended and the other started.  Certainly, the cows could not see it.  The cows from the North ate grass in the South, they were milked in the North by a farmer from the South and their milk was bottled in the South.  I am a Belgian so surrealism comes naturally to me.  To re-instate a border would be more than surreal, it would be totally absurd, even for me.<\/p><p> There are borders and then there are borders.  Borders can be lines on maps, physical barriers or, worst of all, can run through people's hearts and minds.  These are the worst kind of borders because they breed division, discrimination and hostility.  I remind everyone, if I may, that the history of Europe is in many ways a history of borders.  Over the centuries our Continent has seen borders shift, disappear and re-appear.  As a liberal, my natural inclination is to be against borders.  It seems to me that borders are best when they are just lines on maps.  In many ways, the European Union is all about reducing borders to lines on maps and this is certainly the case, I think, for Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  The Border between both jurisdictions created chaos, hate and violence.  To reduce it to a line on a map was a crucial achievement 20 years ago in which the European Union, the UK and Ireland played a decisive role.  I saw the results for myself yesterday.  Whether one is speaking about the economy, commerce, agriculture, health or other social services, the Border is featuring less and less as a factor in the economic and social life of the region, and that is precisely its greatest achievement.  It is a border that does not divide people but enables them to live together in peace.  It is a border that is not divisive, that does not run through people's hearts but instead does the opposite and creates a common purpose.  <\/p><p> Dear colleagues - if I may use those words as a parliamentarian - you know better than I that Ireland underwent a dramatic transformation over the past three decades economically and but also socially.  The Republic was a country defined by Catholicism and nationalism.  In 1973, the birth year of the current Prime Minister, only 7% of Irish were born abroad and today this number is 17%, which makes Ireland very diverse when compared with European standards.  The Irish economy has successfully integrated migrants from all over the world, from Poland to Nigeria.  Ireland is also the home of international IT giants.  All of this is an example, I think, of constructive and fair globalisation.  To summarise it, Ireland is no longer a nation of immigration but a country of destination.<\/p><p> Ireland has gained a lot of self-confidence over the past decades, and rightly so.  We, as a European Union, also share that.  Let us never forget that Europe is far more than co-operation between the two old enemies of France and Germany.  Today, Europe goes beyond a Franco-German relationship.  We need all hands on deck.  All 27 member states are needed to make Europe work because we belong to the same European civilisation.  Europe would not be half of what it is today without dynamic countries like Ireland, countries that have dealt with complex border and identity issues, and countries that were able to re-invent themselves with a respect for tradition, so Ireland is crucial to the Union.<\/p><p> The Irish Border and all things related are a priority in the negotiations.  In the new resolution that the European Parliament will adopt in early October we will state that Ireland must not pay the price for Brexit and that Ireland or any other member state will not be used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations.  The interests of Ireland are part and parcel of the interests of the EU 27.  The Irish position is the European position and the European position is the Irish position. <\/p><p> In this joint position, let me also make one last thing very clear.  The re-emergence of the Border question between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic has not been caused by the Irish Republic or the rest of the European Union.  The issue is the inevitable consequence of the choice by Britain to leave the European Union so the resolution of this issue is entirely the responsibility of the United Kingdom.  It is for them to come up with a workable solution, one which safeguards the Good Friday Agreement, preserves the common travel area, avoids a hardening of the Border and last, but not least, does not compromise Irish membership and the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union.  In my opinion, this can only be a unique solution.  Most of the people I met yesterday, on both sides of the Border, believe that this unique solution requires that one way or another Northern Ireland should remain part of the customs union and the Single Market.  I know the UK Government, in its paper on Ireland and Northern Ireland, has rejected this idea.  That is fair enough, but the UK must come forward with another proposal that avoids any disruption.  Simply saying that the problem will be solved by using new technology is, in my opinion, not convincing.<\/p><p> I am pleased to say that the Irish MEPs, some of whom are here today and seated in the corner, are working very hard to defend all of this, a position I can assure the members that is shared right across the whole European Parliament.  We know the Irish people have made the choice to be a core member state of the EU and, because of this, we will never let them down.  The EU also needs their help to reform Europe because that is something we also urgently need to do.  I think that Brexit is an ideal moment to reflect on the future of the Union we belong to.  There are enough challenges ahead, challenges that transcend national borders such as climate change, international terrorism and remaining economic difficulties. These are all issues that individual countries cannot tackle on their own.  Currently, they have also recognised that Europe is too weak to take on these challenges.  In order for us to beat, for example, international terrorism, we need European capabilities.  To overcome the economic crisis, we need a banking union to clean up our banks and a fiscal union to protect our single currency, the euro.<\/p><p>To fight the protectionism of President Trump and Brexit, we must have a Europe that is vocal and strong on the world stage.<br\/><br\/>To conclude, I believe that Brexit has opened the eyes of many people.  Do not misunderstand me - people are still very critical of the European Union, and for good reason.  However, nobody wants to leave and destroy Europe.  On the contrary, it is fair to say there is a renewed belief in Europe, not in this Europe but in a different, reformed Europe.  In any case, people have started voting pro-European again.  They did it in Austria, the Netherlands, and France and soon, hopefully, they will do so in Germany.  However, these are not votes for a <i>status quo<\/i>.  This is a way of people saying, &quot;Look, we are giving you one last chance to make Europe work and to make it better and fit for the future&quot;, or, in the words of Seamus Heaney, we &quot;Believe that further shore\/Is reachable from here&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Guy Verhofstadt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":517,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Verhofstadt.

The last time we met he welcomed a delegation from the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to the European Parliament, so I am delighted to be able to join the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad in returning the hospitality to him today.<\/p><p>To be blunt, this is a horrible problem.  It is a mess, and there is nothing nice about it.  People do not realise how detrimental an effect this will have on their lives and those of their children.  The UK's withdrawal from the European Union, the implications for Ireland and the implications for the European Union are all profound.  Quite frankly, I was saddened by the decision.  However, it was clear and we must respect it.  We all must work on the challenges the decision presents.  Members of this House have been doing that across a number of committees and the European Parliament has also been doing it.  We see the hard, thoughtful and diligent work the European Parliament's committees have been doing in considering Brexit and the Irish MEPs have been playing a strong role in that.  I acknowledge their work and thank them for it.<\/p><p>My committee has met a number of stakeholders and Government Ministers and is following the negotiations carefully through the documentation that is published.  I have been heartened by the supportive comments and the positions taken by the European Parliament, many governments and the European Commission.  However, the chips are down now.  Reality is starting to bite.  There are substantial and significant choices to be made by the negotiators and those they represent.  Ultimately, Mr. Barnier and his team, Mr. Verhofstadt and the other Members of the European Parliament represent the citizens of Europe, including the citizens of Ireland, who will feel the impact in their daily lives.  It is up to all of us to work together on practical solutions to minimise the impact as much as possible on the daily lives of citizens, on the quality of what they eat, the amount they must pay for it, how secure their savings and pensions are, whether they can go to shops or to mass up or down the road without going through border checks, how easily they can study abroad, what prices farmers get for their beef, lamb and milk, what price the consumer must pay for it and whether they can make friends with whoever they wish and set up a home together wherever they wish, be it in London, Brussels, Dublin or Belfast.  All of these matters could be impacted upon by Brexit.  All of them could be changed into something that resembles the parts of the past that we thought we had left far behind us.<\/p><p>We must work together and remain involved in and practical about the negotiations.  We are not alone in this.  There are two sides to a negotiation.  I had hoped to see more practical and pragmatic suggestions from the British side by now, but perhaps they will come forward.  They might even come forward in the Prime Minister's speech.  I certainly hope so.<\/p><p>On the European side, the transparent way in which negotiation documents have been shared with citizens is good and must continue.  National parliaments must continue to be involved in debates and discussions.  I would be interested in any recommendations or ideas Mr. Verhofstadt has to strengthen the relationship between the European Parliament and national parliaments in considering Brexit.  For example, is there any intention to hold interparliamentary meetings involving national parliaments and the European Parliament's Brexit steering group?  There would be huge value and benefit in that.  Mr. Verhofstadt travelled to the Border yesterday and I am delighted that he enjoyed meeting the cows there.  I hope this visit will have given him a valuable insight into why we value the current Border arrangements so much and why they should be preserved.<\/p><p>The biggest challenge will be goods.  There was an interesting letter in yesterday's edition of the <i>Financial Times<\/i>from a Belgian customs official.  It suggested that border goods should be applied for at the Irish Sea and that the customs union rules could be applied by the European Union customs officials operating in ports in Northern Ireland.  That was imaginative.  Are such suggestions helpful?  Of course, it would be best if the UK would decide to stay in the customs union, but that decision is out of our hands.  It is one for the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>The economic impact on Ireland is significant.  Each time an Oireachtas committee examines a new issue, a new box of challenges is opened - how aeroplanes will land, how goods will get to the market from Irish ports through Wales and England to eventually reach Belgium and so forth.  There are endless challenges.  I remain concerned about Brexit for Irish citizens but, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, I am also concerned about the impact on the rest of the European Union.  Even if Brexit were not on the horizon, it would be important to consider the future of Europe and where we should be going.  My committee has started a public consultation process in Ireland and a series of engagements with stakeholders to examine what type of Europe we want in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#C00300","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#C00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":520,"content":"<p>It is clear that Ireland sees its role at the heart of the EU, perhaps not geographically but at the heart and soul of Europe.

I am sure we will find his address and interaction with us today very useful and beneficial.  As he will have seen and heard during his visits to Belfast, Monaghan and Dublin, Brexit impacts on every policy area across this island and will have a knock-on effect on the lives of citizens across the European Union and beyond.<\/p><p>Ireland, as Mr. Verhofstadt knows, stands to be significantly and disproportionately affected.  I speak for the members of our committee when I tell him that we, as public representatives, are greatly concerned at the negative domestic impact Brexit will have on the island of Ireland.  I know from listening to what he has said in recent months that he is very aware of and interested in our concerns, a fact demonstrated by his visit, North and South, yesterday and today.<\/p><p> As our committee looks outward in its work, I will focus my remarks on how Brexit impacts on the external environment, however as a Deputy for two Border counties, one of which Mr. Verhofstadt visited yesterday, it would be remiss of me not to remind him of the great damage the resurrection of a border would have on the communities I represent here in the national Parliament.  I welcome his comments made yesterday and hope he can expand on them later.<\/p><p> Much of the progress made in the improved Irish-British relations over the past 25 years was due in no small part to our common EU membership.  I recall, from my own time as a Minister being told that Irish and British officials were meeting approximately 26 times per day in Brussels.  The loss of this high level of ongoing and important interactions with our nearest neighbour and close ally is deeply regrettable.  Its loss will be keenly felt.  We will be doing our utmost to compensate as best we can for that loss of engagement.<\/p><p> As Mr. Verhofstadt knows, Ireland is militarily neutral but that does mean that we in Ireland stand aside when it comes to promoting peace and development through the UN, the European Union and our own bilateral actions - far from it.  We have a long, proud and strong record in peace support and humanitarian operations via our Defence Forces.  At present, 600 members of the Defence Forces are serving on UN-mandated missions across the globe.  Given our policy remit for both foreign affairs and defence, our committee knows and recognises the global challenges and security threats we face, both within the EU and in the EU's neighbourhood.  For those reasons we recognise a good and strong relationship with the Britain on foreign policy, security and defence is essential and is in all our interests.  For those reasons, we welcome last week's publication by the British Government of a paper on foreign policy, defence and development, and we are pleased to see the British Government outline its willingness and desire to continue to have a close partnership with the EU on foreign, defence, security and development issues.  We note that Britain proposes the exchange of foreign and security policy experts, military personnel and the exchange of classified information to support external actions.  Ongoing co-operation is much needed and is common sense in these very fraught times for Europe and neighbouring areas as well.<\/p><p> I wish to refer specifically to development co-operation and the impact Brexit may have on the world's poorest people whose voices are often unheard in these debates.  While Brexit may be happening far from the poorest countries in the world, they also stand to be adversely affected.  It is unknown what will become of the significant aid contributions Britain makes both to the European Development Fund - at present it contributes 15% of the fund, amounting to &euro;4.48 billion, and 13% of the total of the aid portion of the EU's general budget for 2016, or &euro;1.23 billion.  Loss of that substantial British funding would have huge ramifications for the many programmes in the poorest regions of the world which depend so heavily on it.  The committee hopes a solution will be found that will allow and encourage Britain to continue to contribute.  I believe there are precedents for that with Switzerland and Norway participating in EU-managed trust funds.<\/p><p> Brexit will result in the loss of an important, influential and respected voice on the shaping of EU development policy from around the EU table.  Our committee will encourage the Government to step up and play its part in filling those gaps as much as possible.  There is also the significant concern that developing countries could lose their duty free, quota free access to British markets, as is currently provided for under EU agreements.<\/p><p> More generally, we are concerned about the Paris Accord and climate action.  All those issues must be taken into account in the complex negotiations that lie ahead.  I have no doubt the European Parliament will ensure those concerns are brought to the fore in his engagements with the Council and the Commission.  As Mr. Verhofstadt said, our island has been transformed since 1998.  We cannot countenance any agreement that would set us back or hinder the necessary progress for the further development of all of this island.  To echo Mr. Verhofstadt, it would be absolutely absurd to put obstacles in the way of the 30,000 people who cross the Border on a daily basis going about their business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#C00900","speaker":"1270","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":526,"content":"<p>We move to Deputy Declan Breathnach, Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.

Today is world International Day of Peace, as designated by the United Nations and that should not be lost on our defining moment in 1998 with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent establishment of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in 2007 to monitor and oversee the ongoing implementation of that historic peace agreement.<\/p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Verhofstadt to Leinster House.  The attendance of the many dignitaries, ambassadors, officials, MPs, MEPs and MLAs, sends out a clear signal of the need for solutions to Brexit and peace and if those solutions can be found on this island our many problems in the EU may also be resolved.  I commend the membership of the committee, its officials and witnesses on their ongoing work on Brexit and exploring solutions while extremely cognisant of building on our fragile peace and progressing the many legacy issues.<\/p> <p>  For many of us there can be various defining moments in our history but for me the main aim of the Treaty of Rome, the forerunner to the EEC or EU, was to ensure that peace not war would unite us in prosperity.  I am 59 years of age and was born ten years before the further outbreak of the Troubles in 1969 that broke many families and fractured communities and their prosperity in Northern Ireland, the Border region and beyond.  I also remember life pre-EEC and post-EEC membership and the transformation that this great island achieved as a result of EU investment in trade and infrastructure, much of which is ongoing.  For all of us in this Chamber and beyond the strides that this country has made have been significantly enhanced with peace, which has encouraged communities North and South to face each other with a common purpose, respect and recognition that there is strength in unity and friendship is what is important.<\/p> <p>  Politicians will not be forgiven by this generation and future ones if they fail to progress and enhance this fragile peace.  Let there be no mistake, Brexit has the potential to derail so many of the gains of this island and we must not allow that to happen.  Some key findings of the report from our committee have found that the all-Ireland economy must not be affected or allowed to regress.  A tailored solution taking into account its very unique circumstances is required.  We are concerned about the commitment to continue both the INTERREG and PEACE programmes, which provided &euro;3.5 billion in the past 20 years.  It is important that such a commitment would immediately be set out clearly so that people can plan and communities can continue to prosper from the PEACE moneys.<\/p> <p>  The committee calls on the Government and the EU to undertake a detailed study on the potential implications of Brexit on reconciliation.  Allied to that is the psychological impact identified by the committee that Brexit will further affect many families in the North and along the Border corridor.  Whether one has been a victim, a combatant or an innocent bystander the emotional scars of murder, death and explosions remain deep rooted and continue to need healing.<\/p> <p>  Brexit presents many challenges but there are also opportunities.  The committee believes the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement can step up and take on additional responsibilities, including the British-Irish Council and the North-South Ministerial Council, whose remit needs to be reviewed and enhanced.  Like Mr. Verhofstadt, the committee has visited many groups in Northern Ireland who feel they have no voice in the current political stalemate and it is the committee's responsibility to bring those anxieties to his attention.<\/p><p>These need to be represented in the all-Ireland debate.  Indeed, the absence of unionism and a unionist voice at the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is regrettable.<\/p><p> Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, widely recognised as the cornerstone of peace.  That anniversary takes place at a time of uncertainty in North-South and British-Irish relations.  Perhaps it is an opportune time for the EU and the European Parliament to reinvigorate its investment in making our peace process a world model and exemplar that will show war-torn regions around the world how a lasting peace can be achieved.  I should add that many representatives of such regions have visited us to look at what we are doing.  Politics is about the art of the possible and we owe it to our children and our children&rsquo;s children to live in peace, prosperity and harmony on this island.<\/p><p> Both Mr. Verhofstadt and Mr. Barnier continue to use the term \"unique solution\" in their deliberations.  Will Mr. Verhofstadt suggest what his thoughts are on that solution and what he feels it could look like?<\/p><p> With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I have been asked by my colleagues from the British Parliament on the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement committee, who are here with us today, to ask Mr. Verhofstadt if he will produce a report on his fact-finding visit after he returns to Brussels.  Will he share his experience of the last 48 hours with Mr. Barnier?  How concerned does he believe the European Parliament is about the impact of Brexit on the Good Friday Agreement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#D00300","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":529,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I thank our committee chairs and committee members for organising what has already been described as a unique but very important meeting and gathering.<\/p> <p>  It is extremely important to thank Mr. Verhofstadt for his willingness to come to Ireland but also, and most importantly, for his willingness to deepen his understanding of the Good Friday Agreement, the peace process and, of course, the Border issues.  It is very clear from his statement that he has a very real understanding of how fragile the peace process is.  I thank him for his work to date as the European Parliament's lead negotiator on Brexit.  As the European Parliament plays such an important role in the Brexit negotiations, it is important to thank him for his supportive statements to date on the peace process and on the Border and for his words of solidarity with the Irish people today.<\/p> <p>  While Brexit may not be the first priority for all member states, it is, of course, a very real and imminent concern for many Irish citizens, for Irish businesses large and small, and for our industries, in particular the agrifood sector which is already feeling the effect of Brexit.  I know that Members here, throughout this debate, will be very keen to hear Mr. Verhofstadt's views and an update on how negotiations are progressing, but also to hear his further views on the future of Europe.  The future of Europe is not Brexit.  It is a Europe without the UK and we need to ensure it is a Union that protects, empowers and defends its citizens.  It is even more important that this conversation is one that all citizens should be involved in.<\/p> <p>  I look forward to a very positive engagement with Members and our three committees as, I am sure, does Mr. Verfhofstadt.

I also thank him for his strong support for Ireland, for the manner in which he has facilitated the ALDE group in supporting the Irish cause in respect of Brexit, and for his determination that Ireland would not suffer.  In the limited time that is available I will put two key points to Mr. Verhofstadt, if I may.  He rightly drew attention to the citizenship dimension of the Good Friday Agreement and the idea of multiple identities - of Irish citizenship and European citizenship.  It is extremely important that in the ultimate resolution of this, the idea of Irish citizenship as enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement is protected in the context of the resolution between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  In a post-Brexit scenario, Northern Ireland will have the largest concentration of European Union citizens outside of the union's borders.  It is essential that mechanisms are found which will ensure those citizens are in a position to continue to enjoy the rights and privileges of European citizenship.<\/p> <p>  Second, notwithstanding the British position at the moment in terms of the customs union, which is ultimately the key issue in terms of the Border question, we have been putting forward the idea that a special economic zone needs to be considered.  There are many examples of economic zones across the world.  Economic zones in themselves do not challenge or undermine the unique constitutional framework of east-west, North-South and the Northern Ireland settlement.  In other words, it is possible within the existing constitutional framework to devise an economic zone for the North and the Border counties which would maintain freedom of trade - goods, services and people - North and South.  We need to move on from the language of a \"frictionless border\" or \"no border\" and start working on concrete ideas and solutions that could ultimately bring a resolution to the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#E00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":533,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte m&oacute;r roimh an tUasal Verhofstadt.  T&aacute;imid bu&iacute;och de faoi choinne a chuairt.  I offer Mr. Verhofstadt a hundred thousand welcomes and thank him for his visit to our island.  I welcome the content of his speech very much.  In his remarks today, Mr. Verhofstadt acknowledged that people are very critical of the European Union.  That is Sinn F&eacute;in's position.  We want to see a more democratic, demilitarised, peaceful European Union which embraces economic and social justice, international solidarity and an end to poverty.  Notwithstanding that, we campaigned in the North for a Remain vote, because it is our view that to have one part of the island outside the European Union and another part inside is just folly.  It is a really significant fact which has been ignored by some, but people in the North supported that position.  They voted to remain within the EU and we believe that vote should be upheld and actively defended.  The various policy positions which the British Government has unveiled, including leaving the customs union, will all cost jobs, undermine the economy and subvert sectors in both parts of the island.<\/p> <p>  I particularly want to welcome Mr. Verhofstadt's remarks on the Good Friday Agreement.  I know that he values the peace process and I understand he met some of our colleagues: Martina Anderson MEP, our group leader in the European Parliament, our national spokesperson on Brexit, Deputy David Cullinane, and our Members of the European Parliament.  His description of the Border and of partition is very much appreciated, as are his warnings of the dire consequences if it is reinforced.<\/p> <p>  To move on to my questions, will Mr. Verhofstadt give us an assessment of the possibility of agreement, given that there has only been limited information available thus far and that there does not appear to have been any real progress from the British side?  I welcome his suggestion that the North remain within the customs union and the Single Market.  That is effectively the designated status for the North which we have campaigned for and which the D&aacute;il, the majority of MLAs and the European Parliament support.  The threat and the danger to the Good Friday Agreement could be averted if the agreement was incorporated in full as a protocol in the withdrawal agreement.  I commend that position to Mr. Verhofstadt and ask him to give his support to that proposition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#E00600","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I welcome the visit of Mr. Verhofstadt.  His engagement with the people of Northern Ireland, particularly those in the Border region, and his comments in relation to enabling Northern Ireland to retain access to the Single Market and customs union are warmly welcomed.<\/p><p>I concur with my fellow speakers who have said that by any objective analysis, as co-ordinator Mr. Verhofstadt has displayed a thorough understanding of the dynamics at play on the island of Ireland.  He is right when he says that responsibility for finding a solution to the Irish Border question lies with the UK and no realistic proposals have yet emerged from that quarter.<br\/><br\/>My first question is very simple.  Will Mr. Verhofstadt and his colleagues, Mr. Brok and Mr. Gualtieri, consider including within the wording of any final European Parliament resolution a clause that ensures the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement is maintained and the principle of parity of esteem and human rights protection is upheld, especially given that 56% of the population in Northern Ireland voted to remain within the EU?  If no such protections are forthcoming from the UK, will the European Parliament veto any outcome that does not satisfy those fundamental rights?<br\/><br\/>My second question relates to a very good article by Mr. Verhofstadt that was published in <i>The Observer<\/i>on 9 July last, in which he wrote very rationally about the UK position in relation to citizens' rights.  He referred particularly to third country nationals, the new status that will pertain in the UK, the need for separate applications for settled status and the five-year residence requirement.  This is another simple question.  How seriously is the European Parliament taking the UK's negotiating position, which is grossly insulting to any Irish person living in the UK who has settled there for years and has an intergenerational relationship and which will set back the cause of Anglo-Irish relations by years?  I would like to know Mr. Verhofstadt's opinion on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#E00700","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Verhofstadt to address those questions as briefly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#F00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505986200,"counter":537,"content":"<p>It is a question of how many minutes I will be given to respond to all the remarks that have been made.  I thank the honourable Members and the Chairs of the committees.  Maybe I can pick three elements from the various interventions that have been made.  Reference was made to the state of the negotiations and I was asked whether we will use our veto.  One needs to have something to veto before one can use one's veto.  For the moment, there is nothing to veto because - let us be honest - no real progress has been made in the negotiations.  We have had three rounds of negotiations.  The first round involved the formal start of negotiations, the second round involved the presentation and the third round involved the clarification.  I think it is time for the negotiation in the fourth and fifth rounds.  That is what we are hoping for now.  Maybe the intervention of the British Prime Minister will lead to a breakthrough in the coming days.  Based on the state of play now, those of us on the European Parliament side do not see sufficient progress to call for the so-called \"second stage\" of the negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.  The sequencing is important because Article 50 of the treaty says that there needs to be an agreement on withdrawal in the first instance before a new relationship can start to be established between the EU and the withdrawing country.  Let us be very blunt about it - the first three rounds were very slow.  We hope the fourth and fifth rounds in October can speed up the negotiations.  It is time for the uncertainty to stop, in the interests of everybody, particularly businesses and citizens.  This uncertainty is having a negative impact on the hearts and minds of citizens and on daily economic life.  The only way to stop it is to go forward in the negotiations.<\/p> <p>  The second point I want to make relates to the Good Friday Agreement.  The European Parliament has made it very clear from day one - it pushed this in the guidelines of the European Council - that the wording of the Good Friday Agreement should be included in all its parts.  This has been a request from the European Parliament.  Keeping the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement is a key element for us.  We cannot risk the possibility of Brexit creating a return to the Troubles that we saw in the past.  That is a key element for this whole negotiation.  I found that this point - the risk to the Good Friday Agreement posed by the Brexit discussion - was not touched on sufficiently during the whole debate before the referendum in Britain.  I accept that this is in the past now.  Ireland can count on the European Parliament to defend the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  We will never allow whatever solution is reached to put that in danger.  As the EU played an important role in the Good Friday Agreement, it is keen to defend its own work and its own achievements.<\/p> <p>  The third issue is the solution for Northern Ireland.  As I said earlier, I have heard many solutions for Northern Ireland already.  It has been suggested that an economic zone could be created, or that the Single Market and the customs union could continue to be extended to Northern Ireland.  All of these solutions are possible.  As the European Parliament will express in its next resolution, however, the position paper that the British Government has put on the table is not possible because it says that there should be a return to a border and that it will be made invisible.  I have always thought that if a border is not visible, it is no border.  If a border is visible, it is a border.  It is not only with a number of technical features that the problem can be solved.  We are in favour of any solution that avoids in any way a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  That is going to be our goal.  As I indicated in my intervention yesterday, the main proposal for avoiding a hard border that I have heard involves Northern Ireland continuing to participate in the Single Market and the customs union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Guy Verhofstadt"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Verhofstadt and call Deputy Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#F00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Verhofstadt for his contribution.

Given that the EU insisted on the cruel punishment of our citizens for the banking collapse, can we take Mr. Verhofstadt seriously when he says that the EU will not allow Ireland to be punished for Britain's decision to leave the EU?  For example, the EU insisted on the imposition of dreadful austerity on our citizens for things that were not their responsibility.  Given that the EU insists on borders of steel, barbed wire and police camps enforced by Frontex in order to keep out tens of thousands of desperate refugees who are fleeing warzones like Syria, can we take Mr. Verhofstadt seriously when he says noble things about the EU not believing in borders and wanting to reduce borders to lines on maps?  If the EU is willing to do this to desperate and vulnerable people, some of whom are drowning in the Mediterranean as a result, how can we take seriously Mr. Verhofstadt's pledge to try not to impose borders here?  What Britain decides to do is one thing, but I would like to hear an absolute guarantee that the EU will not insist on some sort of border in order to protect its Single Market.  If we were to get such a commitment from Mr. Verhofstadt, we could deal with Britain and the problems it is imposing.<\/p><p>Can he give us that guarantee?

At the founding of the EU its principles were peace, harmony and economic and social development for everybody but those principles are being undermined by the way Europe responded to the migrant crisis and by the economic crash, which showed a widening division between rich and poor.  Is this an opportunity for the EU to redefine its vision and to become more committed to the values on which it was set up?  There is an issue around development aid and we are seeing an increasing securitisation agenda.  There is a fear that this will divert badly needed funding and there will now be a further shortfall from Britain.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to Ireland as we will be particularly affected in many areas because of Brexit and its potential economic consequences.  How can Europe support Irish jobs and businesses in that area?  A terrible gamble is being taken with the Good Friday Agreement.

They need to look at that, and comments from some very senior people after Brexit were not very helpful.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt might elaborate on what he meant by a frictionless border.  There is a massive border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is much bigger than ours with three checkpoints and which was built with EU funding.

I am very heartened by what Mr. Verhofstadt said because it marks a change from what Mr. Barnier said when he was here a few months ago, to the effect that a border is a border.  He said there would be free movement of people but not of trade or goods, but Mr. Verhofstadt has said the solution has to be one where an effective customs union or the Single Market is upheld.  Will that be the red line?  Will the Parliament, which has the ultimate veto on any agreement, accept it?  We are now into the second phase of the negotiations because the first phase was primarily about people.  It seems Mr. Verhofstadt said that he will protect this island in the area of customs, goods and services.  He concentrated on four words, which were, \"as they may choose\", and in respect of the Good Friday Agreement there are another four key words, \"in all its parts\".  How will the European Parliament choose when it comes to preserving the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts?  Mr. Verhofstadt's language today could not have given a clearer signal that we were going to preserve an island for the trade in goods and services and not just people.  I welcome his clarity on this as it is the right position.  Mr. Verhofstadt should be strong on it or the negotiations will take place and, at the very end, the British will say they did not know that was his position.  I agree with the position he has set out today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#G00500","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505986200,"counter":545,"content":"<p>The bottom line, the red line for the European Parliament, will be no hard border.

Do Members know the budget of the European Border and Coastguard Agency, which used to be known as Frontex?  It is &euro;250 million.  Homeland security in the United States is &euro;62 billion.  We think we can solve problems at a European level without giving the means and the possibility to do so.  People say the Union does not tackle the challenges of today and does not have good results, but to have good results one needs good policies, for which one needs the financial means.  In terms of a European asylum system to replace Dublin - excuse me for criticising Dublin but I refer to its place in asylum policy, in the form of the Dublin Regulation - we need ways of having legal migration because this is the only way to tackle illegal migration.  We push asylum seekers into the arms of criminal organisations because the only way to ask for asylum is to set foot on European soil.<\/p><p>I remember the first time I attended the European Council as Belgian Prime Minister.  It was in 1999 in the north of Finland, in Tampere, where it is always dark.  We decided that we should have a common European asylum and migration policy.

It is not only a question of announcing things but also of making them really happen.<\/p><p> The third question was on the specificities and interests of Ireland.  The strategy we and the EU negotiator are following is that all the interests of Ireland are taken on board in the negotiation mandate of the European Union.  That is the way to work on this.  That is the way to ensure that those interests are taken on board in the final agreement.  It is also the best way to keep the unity of the EU 27 because - let us be very realistic - there are going to be attempts to undermine it, which cannot happen.  The only way to prevent it is to fully take on board the interests of Ireland - the Irish Republic - in the negotiation mandate, and that is what we in the European Parliament will try to secure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Guy Verhofstadt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Verhofstadt and call Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#H00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I compliment Mr. Verhofstadt on his visit to this House, his visit to Northern Ireland and the Border area, and his obviously thorough knowledge of the situation as to how Brexit affects this country.

It is very much appreciated.  I would like to ask him about the customs union.  I met recently with members of the British Government in London.  They are resolute that they are leaving the customs union and were pretty clear that they are open to regulatory divergence, including in food, animal welfare and so on.  As we all know, they insist both are possible without any borders.<\/p> <p>  There has been a bovine theme this morning so I will give an example in keeping with it.  Brazil produces high-quality, grass-fed beef at just above half the price that British and Irish farmers can afford.  If the UK, outside the customs union, were to reach a zero-tariff agreement with Brazil on beef, large containers of high-quality Brazilian beef would land in Belfast.  Smugglers would convey that beef into the Republic.  Some of those smugglers have links to paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland.  Inevitably, the beef would continue on to the rest of Europe.  Northern Ireland would thus be used as a back door for cheap, high-quality, tariff-free, illegal beef to come into Europe.  Inevitably, the EU would have to respond and, inevitably, we would see a hard border.  We would have a nationalist community in Northern Ireland pulled out of Europe against its will, seeing a fence built around it, at the same time as profits from smuggling would start funnelling into paramilitary organisations there.  Brazilian cows could contribute to the material destabilisation of the peace process.<\/p> <p>  I sense some softening of a position in the UK on the customs union.  The British are saying they will leave the customs union but might be able to talk about a customs union.  What is the European Parliament's position on trying to find the space where people can save face politically but, by changing the word \"the\" to \"a\", where the UK can stay in the customs union in all but name, thus avoiding a hard border around the Six Counties?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#H00500","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Verhofstadt for being here and for meeting all parties in Stormont yesterday, as well as communities across the Border.

That is something we saw in the European Commission's paper as well and I welcome it.  We want to hear what, in the final analysis, the term \"unique\" will mean for Ireland.  I welcome that Mr. Verhofstadt says that the North of Ireland must remain in the customs union.  As we know, the British Government is against this.  That needs to be a very clear, firm view not just of the European Parliament but also of the Commission.  It has to be an absolute red line issue.  If the North is taken out of the European Union against its will and if it is also taken out of the customs union and Single Market against its will, there will be an EU frontier on the island of Ireland.  There will be a border.  We do not want a hard border, a soft border or any type of border.  It has to be a very clear, firm position of the European Commission that the North should remain in the customs union.<\/p> <p>  We also want it set as a protocol that the Good Friday Agreement, as was said, be attached to the withdrawal agreement.

Reform means different things to different people.  My view of reform of the European Union might be different from that of Mr. Verhofstadt.

I am delighted to hear him talk about the new-found solidarity of a post-Brexit EU in which Irish citizens will not have to pick up the cost of reckless banking across Europe in the future.  I will move on from that matter, however.<\/p> <p>  There is a notion that the UK is responsible for the Border and that it is, therefore, its problem.  Let us be totally honest; it is not.  As the Deputy across the Chamber just pointed out with his Brazilian beef example, the problem is Europe's and not the UK's.  The British will have no interest whatsoever in putting a border in place.  Their sole concern is migration.  They can control migration on the boats and aircraft travelling from Northern Ireland.  One has to have one's passport to get a flight to Britain as matters stand.  How do we protect the Single Market when confronted with a Britain that could not care less about a border in Northern Ireland?

With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I will start with the last point on citizenship because we have talked a lot about borders and economic interests but perhaps not enough about citizenship.  The position of the Parliament, which will be reiterated in the new resolution, is that we need to protect fully the EU citizenship that several hundred thousands of Northern Irish citizens who have Irish passports have.  We must take this seriously.  It concerns all the elements linked to EU citizenship.  EU citizenship is not something from which one can pick and choose - consular aid, yes, but voting rights, no.  It is a concept that is linked to EU citizenship and the position of the European Parliament is that we must protect it.  In the Brexit steering group, one of the priorities is to look into this and be sure that we on the European side defend this concept during the negotiations.  It cannot be the case that we say these people are EU citizens but that EU citizenship does not mean anything.  That is not possible.  It must mean what it is: all the rights that are in fact linked to that concept.<\/p> <p>  With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I will respond to another question that has been put forward: what is happening now in this discussion about citizens' rights in general?  This also concerns Irish citizens living in Britain.  Our concept, our proposal, from the European side and the European Parliament side is that we simply continue collectively the rights that the more than 3 million EU citizens living in the UK have currently.  We are very critical - and we will reiterate this in the next resolution - of the UK side's proposal to introduce a new concept of settled status in British immigration legislation that will require each one of these millions of citizens to make an individual request to continue to have his or her rights.  Individual means individual, so if there are four family members, four requests need to be initiated.  There will be a number of conditions and a need to prove a number of things.  This will create an enormous administrative burden on these millions of European citizens, including many Irish citizens in Britain.  The same goes for UK citizens living on the Continent but I do not think this is such a big problem because all the remaining EU member states recognise that the best way forward is simply to continue the rights those citizens have now.  I am saying this because this is a key issue that must be solved, it is to be hoped as quickly as possible, to end the uncertainty for these millions of people who are today already subject to a number of practices by which they are losing a number of their rights.  This is not to mention that some of them received a letter - apparently it was a mistake - stating they had simply to leave the country as quickly as possible.  This is completely against the EU treaties because, until withdrawal, the UK continues to be a member of the European Union, needs to apply fully EU law and does not have the right to send such letters.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about the customs union and the example of beef was given.  Other examples are possible.  The problem for the European Union is not that the British side may say tomorrow they want to continue in the customs union.  Nobody in the European Union will say that is not possible.  However, to be in the customs union also means that the competence to make trade agreements continues to be exercised by the European Union.  That is the consequence of a customs union.  In a customs union a country does not negotiate tariffs and trade agreements individually; it is the European Union that does that based on the treaties.  One cannot say one wants to be in the customs union but will manage trade oneself.  That is not the European Union.  I think everyone will accept, certainly now that it has already been proposed by some in Britain, that the UK should stay for a transitional period in the customs union, but it cannot pick and choose and say it wants to be in this but not that.  One cannot say, \"I want to be in the customs union and the Single Market but I do not want to pay, I do not want the oversight of the European Court of Justice, I do not want migrants coming from eastern Europe and I do not want it to be the European Union that negotiates trade deals in the future.\"  That is not possible.  Membership comes with positive things but also with obligations.  One cannot create a system in which not being a member of the European Union is more favourable than being a member.  One would then destroy the European project.  I am very open to and positive about what Deputy Donnelly said in his question but, as I said, it is not a question of taking the benefits and putting the burden on the remaining 27 member states.  That will not happen and will not be allowed to happen.  That is not objective, not serious and certainly not the kind of European Union we all want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Guy Verhofstadt"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":560,"content":"<p>We have nine further questioners.

A new trade negotiating mandate will need to be given by the Council to the Commission.  In his role in the European Parliament, will Mr. Verhofstadt seek for environmental, equality and employment standards to be central in any negotiating mandate so as to ensure that there is no race to the bottom, which would damage Ireland deeply?  Given that Mr. Verhofstadt's country of Belgium has referred investor courts to the European Court of Justice to test their compatibility with European law, can we expect that any trade negotiating mandate given to the Commission by the Council and supported by the Council will not include such mechanisms?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#K00500","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Mr. Verhofstadt's words were heartening to us all, particularly his assurance on behalf of the European Parliament regarding the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.

However, the reality for many people in this State is that the decision of the British people to leave the EU has been having a dramatic economic impact for some considerable time already.<\/p> <p>  In solidarity with hard-pressed sectors of our economy, will the EU respond with assistance and supports for struggling Irish enterprises?  As has been mentioned, these enterprises are found especially in the agrifood industry.  Mr. Verhofstadt may have met some of them yesterday.  Coming from County Monaghan, where Mr. Verhofstadt was yesterday, and representing Cavan and Monaghan as I do in this Chamber, I am conscious of the reality of daily life for many people.

There is nothing the UK Government has done that gives any bit of solace to us that the solution will come from the UK.  Along with all of my colleagues, I believe that if Mr. Verhofstadt can take one message from his visit here today, it is that we are depending on the EU to ensure that Ireland, as the country most exposed to this decision, does not suffer.  If we are depending on the UK to come up with a solution, as Mr. Verhofstadt said, that simply will not happen.  We have to proceed on the basis that it is the EU's responsibility to protect us, and that is what we need it to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#K00900","speaker":"1321","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505986200,"counter":572,"content":"<p>On the questions on external security, as I have already indicated in the first resolution, we in the European Parliament think that for the future relationship, the best way is to use an association agreement, as was seen in the Lisbon Treaty.  That gives the possibility not only to talk about trade but also to talk about the other issues we have to tackle in the future and the other parts of that relationship.  It can be on culture, on education or on research, and it can be on internal and external security matters.  I think it is in the interests of everybody, including the Union, that we do that.  Therefore, it will not only be about trade and economics; it will be a broader decision, in that sense.  I underline what has been said, namely, that the British side has proposed a number of ideas.<\/p> <p>  Second, many speakers said that it is all very well what I am saying but asked how, in practice and on practical matters, it will work.  I can tell them that, yesterday, I spoke with many representatives of sectors, especially about the practical consequences of Brexit and how to deal with these.  I did not only talk about borders and avoiding a hard border.  We spoke a lot about the general position of the Irish economy and of the Republic of Ireland, and the threats because of Brexit, because it is a main trading partner of Britain.  We spoke of how to secure this trading position and also the trading position of Ireland towards the rest of the European Union because the normal streams of goods towards the European continent are under threat if we have no good solutions in these Brexit negotiations.  I spoke about very concrete solutions for that with the different representatives of the sectors in order to understand their fears, their problems and how they see they could be solved in the future.  I have taken on board a number of very practical suggestions on how that could be done within an agreement with the UK while defending the economic and trade position of Ireland after the withdrawal.<\/p> <p>  I have noted also the suggestion that has been made by some speakers to put the Good Friday Agreement as an annex of the withdrawal agreement.  It is also a suggestion that has been made in the European Parliament and we are discussing that at the moment in the Brexit steering group.<\/p> <p>  On the divisions and the development of opinions in Britain, it is true that these are not for the moment helping the negotiations move forward.  However, let us hope that these divisions of opinion will be overcome in the coming days and weeks in order that this fourth negotiation round can be a step forward towards the future.<\/p> <p>  Another element, having noted the negative impact of Brexit, is whether the Union will take its responsibility.  Naturally, the Union will take its responsibility.  We have the instruments for that and the funds for that, and it will certainly be done.  However, let us first negotiate a good withdrawal agreement and a good association agreement on future relationships to minimise the impact, and then see what will be the nature of that impact.<\/p> <p>  On a last point, when I said in my introduction that it is for the UK to take responsibility and to come forward, this is not for lack of ideas because I have given ideas in my introduction and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has made a proposal here about an economic zone.  I have spoken about what some have said to me, which is that the best way to solve it is to extend the Single Market and the customs union to Northern Ireland.  All this is on the table.  However, the reason I am saying this is that it is true that the decision to go out of the European Union has not been taken by Ireland, by the Irish Government or by the European Union.  It is a consequence of a British decision so there is also, in that sense, a responsibility on their side to come forward with proposals that can work - not proposals which create a hard border, but proposals which avoid that.  That is the reason I am recalling that all the time.  There is, on their side, responsibility to accept a solution that is workable and, at the same time, that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.<\/p> <p>  We have to see it a little bit as an element of the negotiation.  It is not that they have taken a decision to go out and, so, we have all the problems on our back and have to find solutions for all the problems.  No.  There is a responsibility also on their side.  For example, financially, one cannot go out of the European Union and say that the whole financial burden is for the remaining 27.  Commitments made by 28 member states cannot be later on paid by the remaining 27.  In one or another way, it is like a divorce.  I have to tell the House I have no practical experience of divorces personally but I know that, in a divorce, you cannot go out and leave your partner alone in the house and say, \"Now, all the financial things are for you.  Bye-bye.\"  That is not the way it works.  Commitments have been made and if commitments have been made, then it is also normal that payments will be required based on these commitments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Guy Verhofstadt"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":573,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

The purpose of the meeting is to engage in an exchange of views with Mr. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's co-ordinator on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt, I welcome you to the Houses of the Oireachtas and invite you to take your seat in the Chamber.  You honour us with your visit to our Parliament today.  We are pleased to welcome you for this important discussion. <\/p> <p>  By way of background, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, sitting together in committee on 11 May last, met Mr. Michel Barnier, chief negotiator of the task force for the preparation and conduct of negotiations with the United Kingdom.  The meeting provided an opportunity for Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad to outline directly to Mr. Barnier their concerns for Ireland in relation to the negotiation process and its outcome.  Ireland's priorities include Northern Ireland, the Border and the Good Friday Agreement; the economic impact of Brexit, which has already manifested itself in the agrifood sector; the Single Market; and free movement, in particular of people in the common travel area.  As a result, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and European Union are being followed very closely in Ireland.  Mr. Verhofstadt, as the European Parliament's co-ordinator, has a key role in framing and presenting the final UK exit package to the European Parliament. <\/p> <p>  The unique position of and special circumstances confronting the island of Ireland were referenced in the European Parliament's resolution of 5 April on the exit negotiations.  This early recognition of the challenges facing Ireland is welcome and reassuring but we need to maintain this focus.  While the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU has clear implications for Ireland, it also draws our attention again to the debate about the future of Europe and any changes that may emerge from the process now under way.  Mr. Verhofstadt, as you will hear, this is an issue of crucial importance to all of us, as parliamentarians representing our citizens who share a deep concern about where this bumpy road will lead us, as citizens of Ireland and Europe.  We are very interested in hearing your views on the process, the potential outcomes of the negotiations and the implications for the European Union.  I have great pleasure in asking you to address this unique meeting of the joint committees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017092100002#A00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505986200,"counter":582,"content":"<p>Thank you very much a Cheann Comhairle, a Chathaoirligh and chairs and members of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence and the joint committee in relation to the negotiations under article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.  It is an honour for me to be here today and address you in this historic D&aacute;il Chamber.  I thank all of you for giving me the opportunity to address you here today because I am aware that it is not every day that a Member of the European Parliament responsible for such an important matter can address a meeting of joint committees of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  I first want to deliver a message of solidarity with Ireland, its citizens and people.  We will never allow Ireland to suffer as a result of the British decision to leave the European Union.  That is a commitment given by the European Parliament and European Union as a whole.  I will come back to this later in my contribution. <\/p> <p>  Next year, it will be exactly 20 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  Yesterday was the first time I visited Belfast.  It was a strange experience because for the past 20 years, we in the rest of Europe have not heard anything about Belfast on our television screens.  It is good to remember that because it is 20 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Agreement is not a practical arrangement on passports, borders, customs or tariffs - it is not about these matters - but an agreement about peace and the reconciliation of divided communities.  It is about rebuilding confidence and trust.<\/p> <p>  The Good Friday Agreement is also a successful innovation of citizenship itself.  Personally, I find the following sentence to be the most important sentence in the Agreement.  It is \"the birthright of all the people in Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may choose\".  In my opinion, these four simple words, \"as they may choose\", go against the outdated version of some states that do not like ambiguity, contingency or multiplicity.  They give to the people and individual citizens, rather than states, the power to choose their own destiny.  They are four simple words which have brought peace and stability to Northern Ireland based on openness and a common understanding that identities are multi-layered and complex and should bring people together rather than divide them.  In my opinion, these four simple words not only define Northern Ireland but Ireland as a whole. <\/p> <p>  I know that some British politicians, not to name Boris Johnson, criticise their country men and women for wanting to keep their European identity.  He even accused them of split allegiance.  This is a binary, old-fashioned and reductionist understanding of identity.  We need to be smarter and more open and inventive than that.  It is not one's origin or the fact that, by accident, one was born in this or that village, city or country that makes one a good citizen.  It is the fact that one embraces the values of one's community and cherishes the fundamental rights and freedoms of the society in which one lives.<\/p><p>These are values, rights and freedoms that are common in our European Union in all nations and in every one of our member states so I think it is nonsense to talk about a split allegiance.  It is perfectly possible, I think, but I have not practised it, to feel English, British and European at the same time and it is perfectly normal to be a Dubliner, Irish and European at the same time without being schizophrenic.  There is no question of split allegiance.  It is this vision that needs to be defended by our European Union just as the Union needs to defend, I think, and this is my second point, that there is no return to the past to a time of hard borders on our Continent, and certainly not to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  Members will know that is a point we made very clear in the European Parliament's resolutions we adopted on 5 April 2017.  <\/p><p> I am mistaken when I state that the Irish Border is in no way a natural one.  It is not a river or a mountain ridge.  It meanders for 310 miles through meadows, forests and farmlands.  It cannot be securely poised and is, therefore, an illogical divide.  The Border should at least remain invisible just as it is today.  It is a little bit visible because one can see a marking in yellow when one enters the Irish Republic.  The colour of the marking changes from white to yellow.  That is the big lesson that I learned yesterday. <\/p><p> I spent yesterday afternoon visiting the Border in County Monaghan where I met people who live and work there.  At one point, I stood astride the Border, with one foot in Northern Ireland and my other foot in the Republic.  I found it completely impossible to see where one jurisdiction ended and the other started.  Certainly, the cows could not see it.  The cows from the North ate grass in the South, they were milked in the North by a farmer from the South and their milk was bottled in the South.  I am a Belgian so surrealism comes naturally to me.  To re-instate a border would be more than surreal, it would be totally absurd, even for me.<\/p><p> There are borders and then there are borders.  Borders can be lines on maps, physical barriers or, worst of all, can run through people's hearts and minds.  These are the worst kind of borders because they breed division, discrimination and hostility.  I remind everyone, if I may, that the history of Europe is in many ways a history of borders.  Over the centuries our Continent has seen borders shift, disappear and re-appear.  As a liberal, my natural inclination is to be against borders.  It seems to me that borders are best when they are just lines on maps.  In many ways, the European Union is all about reducing borders to lines on maps and this is certainly the case, I think, for Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  The Border between both jurisdictions created chaos, hate and violence.  To reduce it to a line on a map was a crucial achievement 20 years ago in which the European Union, the UK and Ireland played a decisive role.  I saw the results for myself yesterday.  Whether one is speaking about the economy, commerce, agriculture, health or other social services, the Border is featuring less and less as a factor in the economic and social life of the region, and that is precisely its greatest achievement.  It is a border that does not divide people but enables them to live together in peace.  It is a border that is not divisive, that does not run through people's hearts but instead does the opposite and creates a common purpose.  <\/p><p> Dear colleagues - if I may use those words as a parliamentarian - you know better than I that Ireland underwent a dramatic transformation over the past three decades economically and but also socially.  The Republic was a country defined by Catholicism and nationalism.  In 1973, the birth year of the current Prime Minister, only 7% of Irish were born abroad and today this number is 17%, which makes Ireland very diverse when compared with European standards.  The Irish economy has successfully integrated migrants from all over the world, from Poland to Nigeria.  Ireland is also the home of international IT giants.  All of this is an example, I think, of constructive and fair globalisation.  To summarise it, Ireland is no longer a nation of immigration but a country of destination.<\/p><p> Ireland has gained a lot of self-confidence over the past decades, and rightly so.  We, as a European Union, also share that.  Let us never forget that Europe is far more than co-operation between the two old enemies of France and Germany.  Today, Europe goes beyond a Franco-German relationship.  We need all hands on deck.  All 27 member states are needed to make Europe work because we belong to the same European civilisation.  Europe would not be half of what it is today without dynamic countries like Ireland, countries that have dealt with complex border and identity issues, and countries that were able to re-invent themselves with a respect for tradition, so Ireland is crucial to the Union.<\/p><p> The Irish Border and all things related are a priority in the negotiations.  In the new resolution that the European Parliament will adopt in early October we will state that Ireland must not pay the price for Brexit and that Ireland or any other member state will not be used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations.  The interests of Ireland are part and parcel of the interests of the EU 27.  The Irish position is the European position and the European position is the Irish position. <\/p><p> In this joint position, let me also make one last thing very clear.  The re-emergence of the Border question between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic has not been caused by the Irish Republic or the rest of the European Union.  The issue is the inevitable consequence of the choice by Britain to leave the European Union so the resolution of this issue is entirely the responsibility of the United Kingdom.  It is for them to come up with a workable solution, one which safeguards the Good Friday Agreement, preserves the common travel area, avoids a hardening of the Border and last, but not least, does not compromise Irish membership and the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union.  In my opinion, this can only be a unique solution.  Most of the people I met yesterday, on both sides of the Border, believe that this unique solution requires that one way or another Northern Ireland should remain part of the customs union and the Single Market.  I know the UK Government, in its paper on Ireland and Northern Ireland, has rejected this idea.  That is fair enough, but the UK must come forward with another proposal that avoids any disruption.  Simply saying that the problem will be solved by using new technology is, in my opinion, not convincing.<\/p><p> I am pleased to say that the Irish MEPs, some of whom are here today and seated in the corner, are working very hard to defend all of this, a position I can assure the members that is shared right across the whole European Parliament.  We know the Irish people have made the choice to be a core member state of the EU and, because of this, we will never let them down.  The EU also needs their help to reform Europe because that is something we also urgently need to do.  I think that Brexit is an ideal moment to reflect on the future of the Union we belong to.  There are enough challenges ahead, challenges that transcend national borders such as climate change, international terrorism and remaining economic difficulties. These are all issues that individual countries cannot tackle on their own.  Currently, they have also recognised that Europe is too weak to take on these challenges.  In order for us to beat, for example, international terrorism, we need European capabilities.  To overcome the economic crisis, we need a banking union to clean up our banks and a fiscal union to protect our single currency, the euro.<\/p><p>To fight the protectionism of President Trump and Brexit, we must have a Europe that is vocal and strong on the world stage.<br\/><br\/>To conclude, I believe that Brexit has opened the eyes of many people.  Do not misunderstand me - people are still very critical of the European Union, and for good reason.  However, nobody wants to leave and destroy Europe.  On the contrary, it is fair to say there is a renewed belief in Europe, not in this Europe but in a different, reformed Europe.  In any case, people have started voting pro-European again.  They did it in Austria, the Netherlands, and France and soon, hopefully, they will do so in Germany.  However, these are not votes for a <i>status quo<\/i>.  This is a way of people saying, &quot;Look, we are giving you one last chance to make Europe work and to make it better and fit for the future&quot;, or, in the words of Seamus Heaney, we &quot;Believe that further shore\/Is reachable from here&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017092100002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Guy Verhofstadt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":585,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Verhofstadt.

I have been heartened by the supportive comments and the positions taken by the European Parliament, many governments and the European Commission.  However, the chips are down now.  Reality is starting to bite.  There are substantial and significant choices to be made by the negotiators and those they represent.  Ultimately, Mr. Barnier and his team, Mr. Verhofstadt and the other Members of the European Parliament represent the citizens of Europe, including the citizens of Ireland, who will feel the impact in their daily lives.  It is up to all of us to work together on practical solutions to minimise the impact as much as possible on the daily lives of citizens, on the quality of what they eat, the amount they must pay for it, how secure their savings and pensions are, whether they can go to shops or to mass up or down the road without going through border checks, how easily they can study abroad, what prices farmers get for their beef, lamb and milk, what price the consumer must pay for it and whether they can make friends with whoever they wish and set up a home together wherever they wish, be it in London, Brussels, Dublin or Belfast.  All of these matters could be impacted upon by Brexit.  All of them could be changed into something that resembles the parts of the past that we thought we had left far behind us.<\/p><p>We must work together and remain involved in and practical about the negotiations.  We are not alone in this.  There are two sides to a negotiation.  I had hoped to see more practical and pragmatic suggestions from the British side by now, but perhaps they will come forward.  They might even come forward in the Prime Minister's speech.  I certainly hope so.<\/p><p>On the European side, the transparent way in which negotiation documents have been shared with citizens is good and must continue.  National parliaments must continue to be involved in debates and discussions.  I would be interested in any recommendations or ideas Mr. Verhofstadt has to strengthen the relationship between the European Parliament and national parliaments in considering Brexit.  For example, is there any intention to hold interparliamentary meetings involving national parliaments and the European Parliament's Brexit steering group?  There would be huge value and benefit in that.  Mr. Verhofstadt travelled to the Border yesterday and I am delighted that he enjoyed meeting the cows there.  I hope this visit will have given him a valuable insight into why we value the current Border arrangements so much and why they should be preserved.<\/p><p>The biggest challenge will be goods.  There was an interesting letter in yesterday's edition of the <i>Financial Times<\/i>from a Belgian customs official.  It suggested that border goods should be applied for at the Irish Sea and that the customs union rules could be applied by the European Union customs officials operating in ports in Northern Ireland.  That was imaginative.  Are such suggestions helpful?  Of course, it would be best if the UK would decide to stay in the customs union, but that decision is out of our hands.  It is one for the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>The economic impact on Ireland is significant.  Each time an Oireachtas committee examines a new issue, a new box of challenges is opened - how aeroplanes will land, how goods will get to the market from Irish ports through Wales and England to eventually reach Belgium and so forth.  There are endless challenges.  I remain concerned about Brexit for Irish citizens but, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, I am also concerned about the impact on the rest of the European Union.  Even if Brexit were not on the horizon, it would be important to consider the future of Europe and where we should be going.  My committee has started a public consultation process in Ireland and a series of engagements with stakeholders to examine what type of Europe we want in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017092100002#C00300","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017092100002#C00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":588,"content":"<p>It is clear that Ireland sees its role at the heart of the EU, perhaps not geographically but at the heart and soul of Europe.

Mr. Verhofstadt has a strong vision for the future of Europe, so I would appreciate knowing more on how he sees us bridging the gap between the ideals and the need to deliver for our citizens.

I am sure we will find his address and interaction with us today very useful and beneficial.  As he will have seen and heard during his visits to Belfast, Monaghan and Dublin, Brexit impacts on every policy area across this island and will have a knock-on effect on the lives of citizens across the European Union and beyond.<\/p><p>Ireland, as Mr. Verhofstadt knows, stands to be significantly and disproportionately affected.  I speak for the members of our committee when I tell him that we, as public representatives, are greatly concerned at the negative domestic impact Brexit will have on the island of Ireland.  I know from listening to what he has said in recent months that he is very aware of and interested in our concerns, a fact demonstrated by his visit, North and South, yesterday and today.<\/p><p> As our committee looks outward in its work, I will focus my remarks on how Brexit impacts on the external environment, however as a Deputy for two Border counties, one of which Mr. Verhofstadt visited yesterday, it would be remiss of me not to remind him of the great damage the resurrection of a border would have on the communities I represent here in the national Parliament.  I welcome his comments made yesterday and hope he can expand on them later.<\/p><p> Much of the progress made in the improved Irish-British relations over the past 25 years was due in no small part to our common EU membership.  I recall, from my own time as a Minister being told that Irish and British officials were meeting approximately 26 times per day in Brussels.  The loss of this high level of ongoing and important interactions with our nearest neighbour and close ally is deeply regrettable.  Its loss will be keenly felt.  We will be doing our utmost to compensate as best we can for that loss of engagement.<\/p><p> As Mr. Verhofstadt knows, Ireland is militarily neutral but that does mean that we in Ireland stand aside when it comes to promoting peace and development through the UN, the European Union and our own bilateral actions - far from it.  We have a long, proud and strong record in peace support and humanitarian operations via our Defence Forces.  At present, 600 members of the Defence Forces are serving on UN-mandated missions across the globe.  Given our policy remit for both foreign affairs and defence, our committee knows and recognises the global challenges and security threats we face, both within the EU and in the EU's neighbourhood.  For those reasons we recognise a good and strong relationship with the Britain on foreign policy, security and defence is essential and is in all our interests.  For those reasons, we welcome last week's publication by the British Government of a paper on foreign policy, defence and development, and we are pleased to see the British Government outline its willingness and desire to continue to have a close partnership with the EU on foreign, defence, security and development issues.  We note that Britain proposes the exchange of foreign and security policy experts, military personnel and the exchange of classified information to support external actions.  Ongoing co-operation is much needed and is common sense in these very fraught times for Europe and neighbouring areas as well.<\/p><p> I wish to refer specifically to development co-operation and the impact Brexit may have on the world's poorest people whose voices are often unheard in these debates.  While Brexit may be happening far from the poorest countries in the world, they also stand to be adversely affected.  It is unknown what will become of the significant aid contributions Britain makes both to the European Development Fund - at present it contributes 15% of the fund, amounting to &euro;4.48 billion, and 13% of the total of the aid portion of the EU's general budget for 2016, or &euro;1.23 billion.  Loss of that substantial British funding would have huge ramifications for the many programmes in the poorest regions of the world which depend so heavily on it.  The committee hopes a solution will be found that will allow and encourage Britain to continue to contribute.  I believe there are precedents for that with Switzerland and Norway participating in EU-managed trust funds.<\/p><p> Brexit will result in the loss of an important, influential and respected voice on the shaping of EU development policy from around the EU table.  Our committee will encourage the Government to step up and play its part in filling those gaps as much as possible.  There is also the significant concern that developing countries could lose their duty free, quota free access to British markets, as is currently provided for under EU agreements.<\/p><p> More generally, we are concerned about the Paris Accord and climate action.  All those issues must be taken into account in the complex negotiations that lie ahead.  I have no doubt the European Parliament will ensure those concerns are brought to the fore in his engagements with the Council and the Commission.  As Mr. Verhofstadt said, our island has been transformed since 1998.  We cannot countenance any agreement that would set us back or hinder the necessary progress for the further development of all of this island.  To echo Mr. Verhofstadt, it would be absolutely absurd to put obstacles in the way of the 30,000 people who cross the Border on a daily basis going about their business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017092100002#C00900","speaker":"1270","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":594,"content":"<p>We move to Deputy Declan Breathnach, Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.

Today is world International Day of Peace, as designated by the United Nations and that should not be lost on our defining moment in 1998 with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent establishment of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in 2007 to monitor and oversee the ongoing implementation of that historic peace agreement.<\/p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Verhofstadt to Leinster House.  The attendance of the many dignitaries, ambassadors, officials, MPs, MEPs and MLAs, sends out a clear signal of the need for solutions to Brexit and peace and if those solutions can be found on this island our many problems in the EU may also be resolved.  I commend the membership of the committee, its officials and witnesses on their ongoing work on Brexit and exploring solutions while extremely cognisant of building on our fragile peace and progressing the many legacy issues.<\/p> <p>  For many of us there can be various defining moments in our history but for me the main aim of the Treaty of Rome, the forerunner to the EEC or EU, was to ensure that peace not war would unite us in prosperity.  I am 59 years of age and was born ten years before the further outbreak of the Troubles in 1969 that broke many families and fractured communities and their prosperity in Northern Ireland, the Border region and beyond.  I also remember life pre-EEC and post-EEC membership and the transformation that this great island achieved as a result of EU investment in trade and infrastructure, much of which is ongoing.  For all of us in this Chamber and beyond the strides that this country has made have been significantly enhanced with peace, which has encouraged communities North and South to face each other with a common purpose, respect and recognition that there is strength in unity and friendship is what is important.<\/p> <p>  Politicians will not be forgiven by this generation and future ones if they fail to progress and enhance this fragile peace.  Let there be no mistake, Brexit has the potential to derail so many of the gains of this island and we must not allow that to happen.  Some key findings of the report from our committee have found that the all-Ireland economy must not be affected or allowed to regress.  A tailored solution taking into account its very unique circumstances is required.  We are concerned about the commitment to continue both the INTERREG and PEACE programmes, which provided &euro;3.5 billion in the past 20 years.  It is important that such a commitment would immediately be set out clearly so that people can plan and communities can continue to prosper from the PEACE moneys.<\/p> <p>  The committee calls on the Government and the EU to undertake a detailed study on the potential implications of Brexit on reconciliation.  Allied to that is the psychological impact identified by the committee that Brexit will further affect many families in the North and along the Border corridor.  Whether one has been a victim, a combatant or an innocent bystander the emotional scars of murder, death and explosions remain deep rooted and continue to need healing.<\/p> <p>  Brexit presents many challenges but there are also opportunities.  The committee believes the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement can step up and take on additional responsibilities, including the British-Irish Council and the North-South Ministerial Council, whose remit needs to be reviewed and enhanced.  Like Mr. Verhofstadt, the committee has visited many groups in Northern Ireland who feel they have no voice in the current political stalemate and it is the committee's responsibility to bring those anxieties to his attention.<\/p><p>These need to be represented in the all-Ireland debate.  Indeed, the absence of unionism and a unionist voice at the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is regrettable.<\/p><p> Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, widely recognised as the cornerstone of peace.  That anniversary takes place at a time of uncertainty in North-South and British-Irish relations.  Perhaps it is an opportune time for the EU and the European Parliament to reinvigorate its investment in making our peace process a world model and exemplar that will show war-torn regions around the world how a lasting peace can be achieved.  I should add that many representatives of such regions have visited us to look at what we are doing.  Politics is about the art of the possible and we owe it to our children and our children&rsquo;s children to live in peace, prosperity and harmony on this island.<\/p><p> Both Mr. Verhofstadt and Mr. Barnier continue to use the term \"unique solution\" in their deliberations.  Will Mr. Verhofstadt suggest what his thoughts are on that solution and what he feels it could look like?<\/p><p> With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I have been asked by my colleagues from the British Parliament on the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement committee, who are here with us today, to ask Mr. Verhofstadt if he will produce a report on his fact-finding visit after he returns to Brussels.  Will he share his experience of the last 48 hours with Mr. Barnier?

I thank him for his work to date as the European Parliament's lead negotiator on Brexit.

I also thank him for his strong support for Ireland, for the manner in which he has facilitated the ALDE group in supporting the Irish cause in respect of Brexit, and for his determination that Ireland would not suffer.  In the limited time that is available I will put two key points to Mr. Verhofstadt, if I may.  He rightly drew attention to the citizenship dimension of the Good Friday Agreement and the idea of multiple identities - of Irish citizenship and European citizenship.  It is extremely important that in the ultimate resolution of this, the idea of Irish citizenship as enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement is protected in the context of the resolution between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  In a post-Brexit scenario, Northern Ireland will have the largest concentration of European Union citizens outside of the union's borders.  It is essential that mechanisms are found which will ensure those citizens are in a position to continue to enjoy the rights and privileges of European citizenship.<\/p> <p>  Second, notwithstanding the British position at the moment in terms of the customs union, which is ultimately the key issue in terms of the Border question, we have been putting forward the idea that a special economic zone needs to be considered.  There are many examples of economic zones across the world.  Economic zones in themselves do not challenge or undermine the unique constitutional framework of east-west, North-South and the Northern Ireland settlement.  In other words, it is possible within the existing constitutional framework to devise an economic zone for the North and the Border counties which would maintain freedom of trade - goods, services and people - North and South.  We need to move on from the language of a \"frictionless border\" or \"no border\" and start working on concrete ideas and solutions that could ultimately bring a resolution to the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017092100002#E00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":601,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte m&oacute;r roimh an tUasal Verhofstadt.  T&aacute;imid bu&iacute;och de faoi choinne a chuairt.  I offer Mr. Verhofstadt a hundred thousand welcomes and thank him for his visit to our island.  I welcome the content of his speech very much.  In his remarks today, Mr. Verhofstadt acknowledged that people are very critical of the European Union.  That is Sinn F&eacute;in's position.  We want to see a more democratic, demilitarised, peaceful European Union which embraces economic and social justice, international solidarity and an end to poverty.  Notwithstanding that, we campaigned in the North for a Remain vote, because it is our view that to have one part of the island outside the European Union and another part inside is just folly.  It is a really significant fact which has been ignored by some, but people in the North supported that position.  They voted to remain within the EU and we believe that vote should be upheld and actively defended.  The various policy positions which the British Government has unveiled, including leaving the customs union, will all cost jobs, undermine the economy and subvert sectors in both parts of the island.<\/p> <p>  I particularly want to welcome Mr. Verhofstadt's remarks on the Good Friday Agreement.  I know that he values the peace process and I understand he met some of our colleagues: Martina Anderson MEP, our group leader in the European Parliament, our national spokesperson on Brexit, Deputy David Cullinane, and our Members of the European Parliament.  His description of the Border and of partition is very much appreciated, as are his warnings of the dire consequences if it is reinforced.<\/p> <p>  To move on to my questions, will Mr. Verhofstadt give us an assessment of the possibility of agreement, given that there has only been limited information available thus far and that there does not appear to have been any real progress from the British side?  I welcome his suggestion that the North remain within the customs union and the Single Market.  That is effectively the designated status for the North which we have campaigned for and which the D&aacute;il, the majority of MLAs and the European Parliament support.  The threat and the danger to the Good Friday Agreement could be averted if the agreement was incorporated in full as a protocol in the withdrawal agreement.  I commend that position to Mr. Verhofstadt and ask him to give his support to that proposition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017092100002#E00600","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I welcome the visit of Mr. Verhofstadt.  His engagement with the people of Northern Ireland, particularly those in the Border region, and his comments in relation to enabling Northern Ireland to retain access to the Single Market and customs union are warmly welcomed.<\/p><p>I concur with my fellow speakers who have said that by any objective analysis, as co-ordinator Mr. Verhofstadt has displayed a thorough understanding of the dynamics at play on the island of Ireland.  He is right when he says that responsibility for finding a solution to the Irish Border question lies with the UK and no realistic proposals have yet emerged from that quarter.<br\/><br\/>My first question is very simple.  Will Mr. Verhofstadt and his colleagues, Mr. Brok and Mr. Gualtieri, consider including within the wording of any final European Parliament resolution a clause that ensures the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement is maintained and the principle of parity of esteem and human rights protection is upheld, especially given that 56% of the population in Northern Ireland voted to remain within the EU?  If no such protections are forthcoming from the UK, will the European Parliament veto any outcome that does not satisfy those fundamental rights?<br\/><br\/>My second question relates to a very good article by Mr. Verhofstadt that was published in <i>The Observer<\/i>on 9 July last, in which he wrote very rationally about the UK position in relation to citizens' rights.  He referred particularly to third country nationals, the new status that will pertain in the UK, the need for separate applications for settled status and the five-year residence requirement.  This is another simple question.  How seriously is the European Parliament taking the UK's negotiating position, which is grossly insulting to any Irish person living in the UK who has settled there for years and has an intergenerational relationship and which will set back the cause of Anglo-Irish relations by years?  I would like to know Mr. Verhofstadt's opinion on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017092100002#E00700","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Verhofstadt to address those questions as briefly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017092100002#F00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505986200,"counter":605,"content":"<p>It is a question of how many minutes I will be given to respond to all the remarks that have been made.  I thank the honourable Members and the Chairs of the committees.  Maybe I can pick three elements from the various interventions that have been made.  Reference was made to the state of the negotiations and I was asked whether we will use our veto.  One needs to have something to veto before one can use one's veto.  For the moment, there is nothing to veto because - let us be honest - no real progress has been made in the negotiations.  We have had three rounds of negotiations.  The first round involved the formal start of negotiations, the second round involved the presentation and the third round involved the clarification.  I think it is time for the negotiation in the fourth and fifth rounds.  That is what we are hoping for now.  Maybe the intervention of the British Prime Minister will lead to a breakthrough in the coming days.  Based on the state of play now, those of us on the European Parliament side do not see sufficient progress to call for the so-called \"second stage\" of the negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.  The sequencing is important because Article 50 of the treaty says that there needs to be an agreement on withdrawal in the first instance before a new relationship can start to be established between the EU and the withdrawing country.  Let us be very blunt about it - the first three rounds were very slow.  We hope the fourth and fifth rounds in October can speed up the negotiations.  It is time for the uncertainty to stop, in the interests of everybody, particularly businesses and citizens.  This uncertainty is having a negative impact on the hearts and minds of citizens and on daily economic life.  The only way to stop it is to go forward in the negotiations.<\/p> <p>  The second point I want to make relates to the Good Friday Agreement.  The European Parliament has made it very clear from day one - it pushed this in the guidelines of the European Council - that the wording of the Good Friday Agreement should be included in all its parts.  This has been a request from the European Parliament.  Keeping the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement is a key element for us.  We cannot risk the possibility of Brexit creating a return to the Troubles that we saw in the past.  That is a key element for this whole negotiation.  I found that this point - the risk to the Good Friday Agreement posed by the Brexit discussion - was not touched on sufficiently during the whole debate before the referendum in Britain.  I accept that this is in the past now.  Ireland can count on the European Parliament to defend the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  We will never allow whatever solution is reached to put that in danger.  As the EU played an important role in the Good Friday Agreement, it is keen to defend its own work and its own achievements.<\/p> <p>  The third issue is the solution for Northern Ireland.  As I said earlier, I have heard many solutions for Northern Ireland already.  It has been suggested that an economic zone could be created, or that the Single Market and the customs union could continue to be extended to Northern Ireland.  All of these solutions are possible.  As the European Parliament will express in its next resolution, however, the position paper that the British Government has put on the table is not possible because it says that there should be a return to a border and that it will be made invisible.  I have always thought that if a border is not visible, it is no border.  If a border is visible, it is a border.  It is not only with a number of technical features that the problem can be solved.  We are in favour of any solution that avoids in any way a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  That is going to be our goal.

I have no doubt about the stupidity and, frankly, obnoxiousness of the Tory position when it comes to the negotiations about Britain's exit from the EU.  I am thinking particularly of its anti-immigrant policies.  Given that the EU insisted on the cruel punishment of our citizens for the banking collapse, can we take Mr. Verhofstadt seriously when he says that the EU will not allow Ireland to be punished for Britain's decision to leave the EU?  For example, the EU insisted on the imposition of dreadful austerity on our citizens for things that were not their responsibility.  Given that the EU insists on borders of steel, barbed wire and police camps enforced by Frontex in order to keep out tens of thousands of desperate refugees who are fleeing warzones like Syria, can we take Mr. Verhofstadt seriously when he says noble things about the EU not believing in borders and wanting to reduce borders to lines on maps?  If the EU is willing to do this to desperate and vulnerable people, some of whom are drowning in the Mediterranean as a result, how can we take seriously Mr. Verhofstadt's pledge to try not to impose borders here?  What Britain decides to do is one thing, but I would like to hear an absolute guarantee that the EU will not insist on some sort of border in order to protect its Single Market.  If we were to get such a commitment from Mr. Verhofstadt, we could deal with Britain and the problems it is imposing.<\/p><p>Can he give us that guarantee?

At the founding of the EU its principles were peace, harmony and economic and social development for everybody but those principles are being undermined by the way Europe responded to the migrant crisis and by the economic crash, which showed a widening division between rich and poor.  Is this an opportunity for the EU to redefine its vision and to become more committed to the values on which it was set up?  There is an issue around development aid and we are seeing an increasing securitisation agenda.  There is a fear that this will divert badly needed funding and there will now be a further shortfall from Britain.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to Ireland as we will be particularly affected in many areas because of Brexit and its potential economic consequences.  How can Europe support Irish jobs and businesses in that area?  A terrible gamble is being taken with the Good Friday Agreement.

I am very heartened by what Mr. Verhofstadt said because it marks a change from what Mr. Barnier said when he was here a few months ago, to the effect that a border is a border.  He said there would be free movement of people but not of trade or goods, but Mr. Verhofstadt has said the solution has to be one where an effective customs union or the Single Market is upheld.  Will that be the red line?  Will the Parliament, which has the ultimate veto on any agreement, accept it?  We are now into the second phase of the negotiations because the first phase was primarily about people.  It seems Mr. Verhofstadt said that he will protect this island in the area of customs, goods and services.  He concentrated on four words, which were, \"as they may choose\", and in respect of the Good Friday Agreement there are another four key words, \"in all its parts\".  How will the European Parliament choose when it comes to preserving the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts?  Mr. Verhofstadt's language today could not have given a clearer signal that we were going to preserve an island for the trade in goods and services and not just people.

Do Members know the budget of the European Border and Coastguard Agency, which used to be known as Frontex?  It is &euro;250 million.  Homeland security in the United States is &euro;62 billion.  We think we can solve problems at a European level without giving the means and the possibility to do so.  People say the Union does not tackle the challenges of today and does not have good results, but to have good results one needs good policies, for which one needs the financial means.  In terms of a European asylum system to replace Dublin - excuse me for criticising Dublin but I refer to its place in asylum policy, in the form of the Dublin Regulation - we need ways of having legal migration because this is the only way to tackle illegal migration.  We push asylum seekers into the arms of criminal organisations because the only way to ask for asylum is to set foot on European soil.<\/p><p>I remember the first time I attended the European Council as Belgian Prime Minister.

It is also the best way to keep the unity of the EU 27 because - let us be very realistic - there are going to be attempts to undermine it, which cannot happen.

They are resolute that they are leaving the customs union and were pretty clear that they are open to regulatory divergence, including in food, animal welfare and so on.  As we all know, they insist both are possible without any borders.<\/p> <p>  There has been a bovine theme this morning so I will give an example in keeping with it.  Brazil produces high-quality, grass-fed beef at just above half the price that British and Irish farmers can afford.  If the UK, outside the customs union, were to reach a zero-tariff agreement with Brazil on beef, large containers of high-quality Brazilian beef would land in Belfast.  Smugglers would convey that beef into the Republic.  Some of those smugglers have links to paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland.  Inevitably, the beef would continue on to the rest of Europe.  Northern Ireland would thus be used as a back door for cheap, high-quality, tariff-free, illegal beef to come into Europe.  Inevitably, the EU would have to respond and, inevitably, we would see a hard border.  We would have a nationalist community in Northern Ireland pulled out of Europe against its will, seeing a fence built around it, at the same time as profits from smuggling would start funnelling into paramilitary organisations there.  Brazilian cows could contribute to the material destabilisation of the peace process.<\/p> <p>  I sense some softening of a position in the UK on the customs union.  The British are saying they will leave the customs union but might be able to talk about a customs union.

That is something we saw in the European Commission's paper as well and I welcome it.  We want to hear what, in the final analysis, the term \"unique\" will mean for Ireland.  I welcome that Mr. Verhofstadt says that the North of Ireland must remain in the customs union.  As we know, the British Government is against this.  That needs to be a very clear, firm view not just of the European Parliament but also of the Commission.  It has to be an absolute red line issue.  If the North is taken out of the European Union against its will and if it is also taken out of the customs union and Single Market against its will, there will be an EU frontier on the island of Ireland.  There will be a border.  We do not want a hard border, a soft border or any type of border.

I will move on from that matter, however.<\/p> <p>  There is a notion that the UK is responsible for the Border and that it is, therefore, its problem.  Let us be totally honest; it is not.  As the Deputy across the Chamber just pointed out with his Brazilian beef example, the problem is Europe's and not the UK's.  The British will have no interest whatsoever in putting a border in place.  Their sole concern is migration.  They can control migration on the boats and aircraft travelling from Northern Ireland.  One has to have one's passport to get a flight to Britain as matters stand.  How do we protect the Single Market when confronted with a Britain that could not care less about a border in Northern Ireland?

With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I will start with the last point on citizenship because we have talked a lot about borders and economic interests but perhaps not enough about citizenship.  The position of the Parliament, which will be reiterated in the new resolution, is that we need to protect fully the EU citizenship that several hundred thousands of Northern Irish citizens who have Irish passports have.  We must take this seriously.  It concerns all the elements linked to EU citizenship.  EU citizenship is not something from which one can pick and choose - consular aid, yes, but voting rights, no.  It is a concept that is linked to EU citizenship and the position of the European Parliament is that we must protect it.  In the Brexit steering group, one of the priorities is to look into this and be sure that we on the European side defend this concept during the negotiations.  It cannot be the case that we say these people are EU citizens but that EU citizenship does not mean anything.  That is not possible.  It must mean what it is: all the rights that are in fact linked to that concept.<\/p> <p>  With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I will respond to another question that has been put forward: what is happening now in this discussion about citizens' rights in general?  This also concerns Irish citizens living in Britain.  Our concept, our proposal, from the European side and the European Parliament side is that we simply continue collectively the rights that the more than 3 million EU citizens living in the UK have currently.  We are very critical - and we will reiterate this in the next resolution - of the UK side's proposal to introduce a new concept of settled status in British immigration legislation that will require each one of these millions of citizens to make an individual request to continue to have his or her rights.  Individual means individual, so if there are four family members, four requests need to be initiated.  There will be a number of conditions and a need to prove a number of things.  This will create an enormous administrative burden on these millions of European citizens, including many Irish citizens in Britain.  The same goes for UK citizens living on the Continent but I do not think this is such a big problem because all the remaining EU member states recognise that the best way forward is simply to continue the rights those citizens have now.  I am saying this because this is a key issue that must be solved, it is to be hoped as quickly as possible, to end the uncertainty for these millions of people who are today already subject to a number of practices by which they are losing a number of their rights.  This is not to mention that some of them received a letter - apparently it was a mistake - stating they had simply to leave the country as quickly as possible.  This is completely against the EU treaties because, until withdrawal, the UK continues to be a member of the European Union, needs to apply fully EU law and does not have the right to send such letters.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about the customs union and the example of beef was given.  Other examples are possible.  The problem for the European Union is not that the British side may say tomorrow they want to continue in the customs union.  Nobody in the European Union will say that is not possible.  However, to be in the customs union also means that the competence to make trade agreements continues to be exercised by the European Union.  That is the consequence of a customs union.  In a customs union a country does not negotiate tariffs and trade agreements individually; it is the European Union that does that based on the treaties.  One cannot say one wants to be in the customs union but will manage trade oneself.  That is not the European Union.  I think everyone will accept, certainly now that it has already been proposed by some in Britain, that the UK should stay for a transitional period in the customs union, but it cannot pick and choose and say it wants to be in this but not that.  One cannot say, \"I want to be in the customs union and the Single Market but I do not want to pay, I do not want the oversight of the European Court of Justice, I do not want migrants coming from eastern Europe and I do not want it to be the European Union that negotiates trade deals in the future.\"  That is not possible.  Membership comes with positive things but also with obligations.  One cannot create a system in which not being a member of the European Union is more favourable than being a member.  One would then destroy the European project.  I am very open to and positive about what Deputy Donnelly said in his question but, as I said, it is not a question of taking the benefits and putting the burden on the remaining 27 member states.  That will not happen and will not be allowed to happen.  That is not objective, not serious and certainly not the kind of European Union we all want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017092100002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Guy Verhofstadt"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":628,"content":"<p>We have nine further questioners.

In this Oireachtas, I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Those of us in the North who are Irish do not derive our Irishness from the Good Friday Agreement.  It, of course, runs much deeper than that.  When the agreement was lodged with the EU and the UN, however, it affirmed our legal rights in the eyes of the world as Irish and, therefore, EU citizens.  It says that on the front of our passports to remind us.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt has referenced comprehensively something that we discussed yesterday, namely, the importance of the psychology of citizenship and our place within the world.  While our Irish citizenship in the North should never be partial, conditional or second class, nor should our EU citizenship.  Mr. Verhofstadt was clear in his remarks regarding a future for EU citizens living in the North, but perhaps he might expand on what that will mean for the EU citizen who is a farmer in Fermanagh, a worker in Strabane or an entrepreneur in Newry.  If such people are to access their rights and entitlements as full EU citizens, what will that look like?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017092100002#K00300","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Verhofstadt.

Most of the parliamentarians from Scotland, Ireland, England, Wales and other jurisdictions are concerned about this situation and would like to see a change.

Mr. Verhofstadt has been clear, in that the European Parliament will have a say over whether we enter those negotiations.  A new trade negotiating mandate will need to be given by the Council to the Commission.  In his role in the European Parliament, will Mr. Verhofstadt seek for environmental, equality and employment standards to be central in any negotiating mandate so as to ensure that there is no race to the bottom, which would damage Ireland deeply?

Until Mr. Johnson, who Mr. Verhofstadt mentioned, is removed, banished or whatever and the British Cabinet reaches a single position, progress will be slow.  Perhaps a little time has to be allowed for that.  Does Mr. Verhofstadt agree that, as negotiations proceed, the British Cabinet will have to become more realistic?

However, the reality for many people in this State is that the decision of the British people to leave the EU has been having a dramatic economic impact for some considerable time already.<\/p> <p>  In solidarity with hard-pressed sectors of our economy, will the EU respond with assistance and supports for struggling Irish enterprises?  As has been mentioned, these enterprises are found especially in the agrifood industry.  Mr. Verhofstadt may have met some of them yesterday.

There is nothing the UK Government has done that gives any bit of solace to us that the solution will come from the UK.

That gives the possibility not only to talk about trade but also to talk about the other issues we have to tackle in the future and the other parts of that relationship.  It can be on culture, on education or on research, and it can be on internal and external security matters.  I think it is in the interests of everybody, including the Union, that we do that.  Therefore, it will not only be about trade and economics; it will be a broader decision, in that sense.  I underline what has been said, namely, that the British side has proposed a number of ideas.<\/p> <p>  Second, many speakers said that it is all very well what I am saying but asked how, in practice and on practical matters, it will work.  I can tell them that, yesterday, I spoke with many representatives of sectors, especially about the practical consequences of Brexit and how to deal with these.  I did not only talk about borders and avoiding a hard border.  We spoke a lot about the general position of the Irish economy and of the Republic of Ireland, and the threats because of Brexit, because it is a main trading partner of Britain.  We spoke of how to secure this trading position and also the trading position of Ireland towards the rest of the European Union because the normal streams of goods towards the European continent are under threat if we have no good solutions in these Brexit negotiations.  I spoke about very concrete solutions for that with the different representatives of the sectors in order to understand their fears, their problems and how they see they could be solved in the future.  I have taken on board a number of very practical suggestions on how that could be done within an agreement with the UK while defending the economic and trade position of Ireland after the withdrawal.<\/p> <p>  I have noted also the suggestion that has been made by some speakers to put the Good Friday Agreement as an annex of the withdrawal agreement.  It is also a suggestion that has been made in the European Parliament and we are discussing that at the moment in the Brexit steering group.<\/p> <p>  On the divisions and the development of opinions in Britain, it is true that these are not for the moment helping the negotiations move forward.  However, let us hope that these divisions of opinion will be overcome in the coming days and weeks in order that this fourth negotiation round can be a step forward towards the future.<\/p> <p>  Another element, having noted the negative impact of Brexit, is whether the Union will take its responsibility.  Naturally, the Union will take its responsibility.  We have the instruments for that and the funds for that, and it will certainly be done.  However, let us first negotiate a good withdrawal agreement and a good association agreement on future relationships to minimise the impact, and then see what will be the nature of that impact.<\/p> <p>  On a last point, when I said in my introduction that it is for the UK to take responsibility and to come forward, this is not for lack of ideas because I have given ideas in my introduction and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has made a proposal here about an economic zone.  I have spoken about what some have said to me, which is that the best way to solve it is to extend the Single Market and the customs union to Northern Ireland.  All this is on the table.  However, the reason I am saying this is that it is true that the decision to go out of the European Union has not been taken by Ireland, by the Irish Government or by the European Union.  It is a consequence of a British decision so there is also, in that sense, a responsibility on their side to come forward with proposals that can work - not proposals which create a hard border, but proposals which avoid that.  That is the reason I am recalling that all the time.  There is, on their side, responsibility to accept a solution that is workable and, at the same time, that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.<\/p> <p>  We have to see it a little bit as an element of the negotiation.  It is not that they have taken a decision to go out and, so, we have all the problems on our back and have to find solutions for all the problems.  No.  There is a responsibility also on their side.  For example, financially, one cannot go out of the European Union and say that the whole financial burden is for the remaining 27.  Commitments made by 28 member states cannot be later on paid by the remaining 27.  In one or another way, it is like a divorce.  I have to tell the House I have no practical experience of divorces personally but I know that, in a divorce, you cannot go out and leave your partner alone in the house and say, \"Now, all the financial things are for you.  Bye-bye.\"  That is not the way it works.  Commitments have been made and if commitments have been made, then it is also normal that payments will be required based on these commitments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017092100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Guy Verhofstadt"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":641,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

You honour us with your visit to our Parliament today.  We are pleased to welcome you for this important discussion. <\/p> <p>  By way of background, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, sitting together in committee on 11 May last, met Mr. Michel Barnier, chief negotiator of the task force for the preparation and conduct of negotiations with the United Kingdom.  The meeting provided an opportunity for Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad to outline directly to Mr. Barnier their concerns for Ireland in relation to the negotiation process and its outcome.  Ireland's priorities include Northern Ireland, the Border and the Good Friday Agreement; the economic impact of Brexit, which has already manifested itself in the agrifood sector; the Single Market; and free movement, in particular of people in the common travel area.  As a result, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and European Union are being followed very closely in Ireland.  Mr. Verhofstadt, as the European Parliament's co-ordinator, has a key role in framing and presenting the final UK exit package to the European Parliament. <\/p> <p>  The unique position of and special circumstances confronting the island of Ireland were referenced in the European Parliament's resolution of 5 April on the exit negotiations.  This early recognition of the challenges facing Ireland is welcome and reassuring but we need to maintain this focus.  While the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU has clear implications for Ireland, it also draws our attention again to the debate about the future of Europe and any changes that may emerge from the process now under way.  Mr. Verhofstadt, as you will hear, this is an issue of crucial importance to all of us, as parliamentarians representing our citizens who share a deep concern about where this bumpy road will lead us, as citizens of Ireland and Europe.  We are very interested in hearing your views on the process, the potential outcomes of the negotiations and the implications for the European Union.

It is an honour for me to be here today and address you in this historic D&aacute;il Chamber.  I thank all of you for giving me the opportunity to address you here today because I am aware that it is not every day that a Member of the European Parliament responsible for such an important matter can address a meeting of joint committees of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  I first want to deliver a message of solidarity with Ireland, its citizens and people.  We will never allow Ireland to suffer as a result of the British decision to leave the European Union.  That is a commitment given by the European Parliament and European Union as a whole.  I will come back to this later in my contribution. <\/p> <p>  Next year, it will be exactly 20 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  Yesterday was the first time I visited Belfast.  It was a strange experience because for the past 20 years, we in the rest of Europe have not heard anything about Belfast on our television screens.  It is good to remember that because it is 20 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Agreement is not a practical arrangement on passports, borders, customs or tariffs - it is not about these matters - but an agreement about peace and the reconciliation of divided communities.  It is about rebuilding confidence and trust.<\/p> <p>  The Good Friday Agreement is also a successful innovation of citizenship itself.  Personally, I find the following sentence to be the most important sentence in the Agreement.  It is \"the birthright of all the people in Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may choose\".  In my opinion, these four simple words, \"as they may choose\", go against the outdated version of some states that do not like ambiguity, contingency or multiplicity.  They give to the people and individual citizens, rather than states, the power to choose their own destiny.  They are four simple words which have brought peace and stability to Northern Ireland based on openness and a common understanding that identities are multi-layered and complex and should bring people together rather than divide them.  In my opinion, these four simple words not only define Northern Ireland but Ireland as a whole. <\/p> <p>  I know that some British politicians, not to name Boris Johnson, criticise their country men and women for wanting to keep their European identity.  He even accused them of split allegiance.  This is a binary, old-fashioned and reductionist understanding of identity.  We need to be smarter and more open and inventive than that.  It is not one's origin or the fact that, by accident, one was born in this or that village, city or country that makes one a good citizen.  It is the fact that one embraces the values of one's community and cherishes the fundamental rights and freedoms of the society in which one lives.<\/p><p>These are values, rights and freedoms that are common in our European Union in all nations and in every one of our member states so I think it is nonsense to talk about a split allegiance.  It is perfectly possible, I think, but I have not practised it, to feel English, British and European at the same time and it is perfectly normal to be a Dubliner, Irish and European at the same time without being schizophrenic.  There is no question of split allegiance.  It is this vision that needs to be defended by our European Union just as the Union needs to defend, I think, and this is my second point, that there is no return to the past to a time of hard borders on our Continent, and certainly not to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  Members will know that is a point we made very clear in the European Parliament's resolutions we adopted on 5 April 2017.  <\/p><p> I am mistaken when I state that the Irish Border is in no way a natural one.  It is not a river or a mountain ridge.  It meanders for 310 miles through meadows, forests and farmlands.  It cannot be securely poised and is, therefore, an illogical divide.  The Border should at least remain invisible just as it is today.  It is a little bit visible because one can see a marking in yellow when one enters the Irish Republic.  The colour of the marking changes from white to yellow.  That is the big lesson that I learned yesterday. <\/p><p> I spent yesterday afternoon visiting the Border in County Monaghan where I met people who live and work there.  At one point, I stood astride the Border, with one foot in Northern Ireland and my other foot in the Republic.  I found it completely impossible to see where one jurisdiction ended and the other started.  Certainly, the cows could not see it.  The cows from the North ate grass in the South, they were milked in the North by a farmer from the South and their milk was bottled in the South.  I am a Belgian so surrealism comes naturally to me.  To re-instate a border would be more than surreal, it would be totally absurd, even for me.<\/p><p> There are borders and then there are borders.  Borders can be lines on maps, physical barriers or, worst of all, can run through people's hearts and minds.  These are the worst kind of borders because they breed division, discrimination and hostility.  I remind everyone, if I may, that the history of Europe is in many ways a history of borders.  Over the centuries our Continent has seen borders shift, disappear and re-appear.  As a liberal, my natural inclination is to be against borders.  It seems to me that borders are best when they are just lines on maps.  In many ways, the European Union is all about reducing borders to lines on maps and this is certainly the case, I think, for Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  The Border between both jurisdictions created chaos, hate and violence.  To reduce it to a line on a map was a crucial achievement 20 years ago in which the European Union, the UK and Ireland played a decisive role.  I saw the results for myself yesterday.  Whether one is speaking about the economy, commerce, agriculture, health or other social services, the Border is featuring less and less as a factor in the economic and social life of the region, and that is precisely its greatest achievement.  It is a border that does not divide people but enables them to live together in peace.  It is a border that is not divisive, that does not run through people's hearts but instead does the opposite and creates a common purpose.  <\/p><p> Dear colleagues - if I may use those words as a parliamentarian - you know better than I that Ireland underwent a dramatic transformation over the past three decades economically and but also socially.  The Republic was a country defined by Catholicism and nationalism.  In 1973, the birth year of the current Prime Minister, only 7% of Irish were born abroad and today this number is 17%, which makes Ireland very diverse when compared with European standards.  The Irish economy has successfully integrated migrants from all over the world, from Poland to Nigeria.  Ireland is also the home of international IT giants.  All of this is an example, I think, of constructive and fair globalisation.  To summarise it, Ireland is no longer a nation of immigration but a country of destination.<\/p><p> Ireland has gained a lot of self-confidence over the past decades, and rightly so.  We, as a European Union, also share that.  Let us never forget that Europe is far more than co-operation between the two old enemies of France and Germany.  Today, Europe goes beyond a Franco-German relationship.  We need all hands on deck.  All 27 member states are needed to make Europe work because we belong to the same European civilisation.  Europe would not be half of what it is today without dynamic countries like Ireland, countries that have dealt with complex border and identity issues, and countries that were able to re-invent themselves with a respect for tradition, so Ireland is crucial to the Union.<\/p><p> The Irish Border and all things related are a priority in the negotiations.  In the new resolution that the European Parliament will adopt in early October we will state that Ireland must not pay the price for Brexit and that Ireland or any other member state will not be used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations.  The interests of Ireland are part and parcel of the interests of the EU 27.  The Irish position is the European position and the European position is the Irish position. <\/p><p> In this joint position, let me also make one last thing very clear.  The re-emergence of the Border question between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic has not been caused by the Irish Republic or the rest of the European Union.  The issue is the inevitable consequence of the choice by Britain to leave the European Union so the resolution of this issue is entirely the responsibility of the United Kingdom.  It is for them to come up with a workable solution, one which safeguards the Good Friday Agreement, preserves the common travel area, avoids a hardening of the Border and last, but not least, does not compromise Irish membership and the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union.  In my opinion, this can only be a unique solution.  Most of the people I met yesterday, on both sides of the Border, believe that this unique solution requires that one way or another Northern Ireland should remain part of the customs union and the Single Market.  I know the UK Government, in its paper on Ireland and Northern Ireland, has rejected this idea.  That is fair enough, but the UK must come forward with another proposal that avoids any disruption.  Simply saying that the problem will be solved by using new technology is, in my opinion, not convincing.<\/p><p> I am pleased to say that the Irish MEPs, some of whom are here today and seated in the corner, are working very hard to defend all of this, a position I can assure the members that is shared right across the whole European Parliament.  We know the Irish people have made the choice to be a core member state of the EU and, because of this, we will never let them down.  The EU also needs their help to reform Europe because that is something we also urgently need to do.  I think that Brexit is an ideal moment to reflect on the future of the Union we belong to.  There are enough challenges ahead, challenges that transcend national borders such as climate change, international terrorism and remaining economic difficulties. These are all issues that individual countries cannot tackle on their own.  Currently, they have also recognised that Europe is too weak to take on these challenges.  In order for us to beat, for example, international terrorism, we need European capabilities.  To overcome the economic crisis, we need a banking union to clean up our banks and a fiscal union to protect our single currency, the euro.<\/p><p>To fight the protectionism of President Trump and Brexit, we must have a Europe that is vocal and strong on the world stage.<br\/><br\/>To conclude, I believe that Brexit has opened the eyes of many people.  Do not misunderstand me - people are still very critical of the European Union, and for good reason.  However, nobody wants to leave and destroy Europe.  On the contrary, it is fair to say there is a renewed belief in Europe, not in this Europe but in a different, reformed Europe.  In any case, people have started voting pro-European again.  They did it in Austria, the Netherlands, and France and soon, hopefully, they will do so in Germany.  However, these are not votes for a <i>status quo<\/i>.  This is a way of people saying, &quot;Look, we are giving you one last chance to make Europe work and to make it better and fit for the future&quot;, or, in the words of Seamus Heaney, we &quot;Believe that further shore\/Is reachable from here&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017092100002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Guy Verhofstadt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":653,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Verhofstadt.

The last time we met he welcomed a delegation from the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to the European Parliament, so I am delighted to be able to join the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad in returning the hospitality to him today.<\/p><p>To be blunt, this is a horrible problem.  It is a mess, and there is nothing nice about it.  People do not realise how detrimental an effect this will have on their lives and those of their children.  The UK's withdrawal from the European Union, the implications for Ireland and the implications for the European Union are all profound.  Quite frankly, I was saddened by the decision.  However, it was clear and we must respect it.  We all must work on the challenges the decision presents.  Members of this House have been doing that across a number of committees and the European Parliament has also been doing it.  We see the hard, thoughtful and diligent work the European Parliament's committees have been doing in considering Brexit and the Irish MEPs have been playing a strong role in that.  I acknowledge their work and thank them for it.<\/p><p>My committee has met a number of stakeholders and Government Ministers and is following the negotiations carefully through the documentation that is published.  I have been heartened by the supportive comments and the positions taken by the European Parliament, many governments and the European Commission.  However, the chips are down now.  Reality is starting to bite.  There are substantial and significant choices to be made by the negotiators and those they represent.  Ultimately, Mr. Barnier and his team, Mr. Verhofstadt and the other Members of the European Parliament represent the citizens of Europe, including the citizens of Ireland, who will feel the impact in their daily lives.  It is up to all of us to work together on practical solutions to minimise the impact as much as possible on the daily lives of citizens, on the quality of what they eat, the amount they must pay for it, how secure their savings and pensions are, whether they can go to shops or to mass up or down the road without going through border checks, how easily they can study abroad, what prices farmers get for their beef, lamb and milk, what price the consumer must pay for it and whether they can make friends with whoever they wish and set up a home together wherever they wish, be it in London, Brussels, Dublin or Belfast.  All of these matters could be impacted upon by Brexit.  All of them could be changed into something that resembles the parts of the past that we thought we had left far behind us.<\/p><p>We must work together and remain involved in and practical about the negotiations.  We are not alone in this.  There are two sides to a negotiation.  I had hoped to see more practical and pragmatic suggestions from the British side by now, but perhaps they will come forward.  They might even come forward in the Prime Minister's speech.  I certainly hope so.<\/p><p>On the European side, the transparent way in which negotiation documents have been shared with citizens is good and must continue.  National parliaments must continue to be involved in debates and discussions.  I would be interested in any recommendations or ideas Mr. Verhofstadt has to strengthen the relationship between the European Parliament and national parliaments in considering Brexit.  For example, is there any intention to hold interparliamentary meetings involving national parliaments and the European Parliament's Brexit steering group?  There would be huge value and benefit in that.  Mr. Verhofstadt travelled to the Border yesterday and I am delighted that he enjoyed meeting the cows there.  I hope this visit will have given him a valuable insight into why we value the current Border arrangements so much and why they should be preserved.<\/p><p>The biggest challenge will be goods.  There was an interesting letter in yesterday's edition of the <i>Financial Times<\/i>from a Belgian customs official.  It suggested that border goods should be applied for at the Irish Sea and that the customs union rules could be applied by the European Union customs officials operating in ports in Northern Ireland.  That was imaginative.  Are such suggestions helpful?  Of course, it would be best if the UK would decide to stay in the customs union, but that decision is out of our hands.  It is one for the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>The economic impact on Ireland is significant.  Each time an Oireachtas committee examines a new issue, a new box of challenges is opened - how aeroplanes will land, how goods will get to the market from Irish ports through Wales and England to eventually reach Belgium and so forth.  There are endless challenges.  I remain concerned about Brexit for Irish citizens but, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, I am also concerned about the impact on the rest of the European Union.  Even if Brexit were not on the horizon, it would be important to consider the future of Europe and where we should be going.  My committee has started a public consultation process in Ireland and a series of engagements with stakeholders to examine what type of Europe we want in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017092100002#C00300","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017092100002#C00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":656,"content":"<p>It is clear that Ireland sees its role at the heart of the EU, perhaps not geographically but at the heart and soul of Europe.

I am sure we will find his address and interaction with us today very useful and beneficial.  As he will have seen and heard during his visits to Belfast, Monaghan and Dublin, Brexit impacts on every policy area across this island and will have a knock-on effect on the lives of citizens across the European Union and beyond.<\/p><p>Ireland, as Mr. Verhofstadt knows, stands to be significantly and disproportionately affected.  I speak for the members of our committee when I tell him that we, as public representatives, are greatly concerned at the negative domestic impact Brexit will have on the island of Ireland.  I know from listening to what he has said in recent months that he is very aware of and interested in our concerns, a fact demonstrated by his visit, North and South, yesterday and today.<\/p><p> As our committee looks outward in its work, I will focus my remarks on how Brexit impacts on the external environment, however as a Deputy for two Border counties, one of which Mr. Verhofstadt visited yesterday, it would be remiss of me not to remind him of the great damage the resurrection of a border would have on the communities I represent here in the national Parliament.  I welcome his comments made yesterday and hope he can expand on them later.<\/p><p> Much of the progress made in the improved Irish-British relations over the past 25 years was due in no small part to our common EU membership.  I recall, from my own time as a Minister being told that Irish and British officials were meeting approximately 26 times per day in Brussels.  The loss of this high level of ongoing and important interactions with our nearest neighbour and close ally is deeply regrettable.  Its loss will be keenly felt.  We will be doing our utmost to compensate as best we can for that loss of engagement.<\/p><p> As Mr. Verhofstadt knows, Ireland is militarily neutral but that does mean that we in Ireland stand aside when it comes to promoting peace and development through the UN, the European Union and our own bilateral actions - far from it.  We have a long, proud and strong record in peace support and humanitarian operations via our Defence Forces.  At present, 600 members of the Defence Forces are serving on UN-mandated missions across the globe.  Given our policy remit for both foreign affairs and defence, our committee knows and recognises the global challenges and security threats we face, both within the EU and in the EU's neighbourhood.  For those reasons we recognise a good and strong relationship with the Britain on foreign policy, security and defence is essential and is in all our interests.  For those reasons, we welcome last week's publication by the British Government of a paper on foreign policy, defence and development, and we are pleased to see the British Government outline its willingness and desire to continue to have a close partnership with the EU on foreign, defence, security and development issues.  We note that Britain proposes the exchange of foreign and security policy experts, military personnel and the exchange of classified information to support external actions.  Ongoing co-operation is much needed and is common sense in these very fraught times for Europe and neighbouring areas as well.<\/p><p> I wish to refer specifically to development co-operation and the impact Brexit may have on the world's poorest people whose voices are often unheard in these debates.  While Brexit may be happening far from the poorest countries in the world, they also stand to be adversely affected.  It is unknown what will become of the significant aid contributions Britain makes both to the European Development Fund - at present it contributes 15% of the fund, amounting to &euro;4.48 billion, and 13% of the total of the aid portion of the EU's general budget for 2016, or &euro;1.23 billion.  Loss of that substantial British funding would have huge ramifications for the many programmes in the poorest regions of the world which depend so heavily on it.  The committee hopes a solution will be found that will allow and encourage Britain to continue to contribute.  I believe there are precedents for that with Switzerland and Norway participating in EU-managed trust funds.<\/p><p> Brexit will result in the loss of an important, influential and respected voice on the shaping of EU development policy from around the EU table.  Our committee will encourage the Government to step up and play its part in filling those gaps as much as possible.  There is also the significant concern that developing countries could lose their duty free, quota free access to British markets, as is currently provided for under EU agreements.<\/p><p> More generally, we are concerned about the Paris Accord and climate action.  All those issues must be taken into account in the complex negotiations that lie ahead.  I have no doubt the European Parliament will ensure those concerns are brought to the fore in his engagements with the Council and the Commission.  As Mr. Verhofstadt said, our island has been transformed since 1998.  We cannot countenance any agreement that would set us back or hinder the necessary progress for the further development of all of this island.  To echo Mr. Verhofstadt, it would be absolutely absurd to put obstacles in the way of the 30,000 people who cross the Border on a daily basis going about their business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017092100002#C00900","speaker":"1270","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":662,"content":"<p>We move to Deputy Declan Breathnach, Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.

Today is world International Day of Peace, as designated by the United Nations and that should not be lost on our defining moment in 1998 with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent establishment of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in 2007 to monitor and oversee the ongoing implementation of that historic peace agreement.<\/p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Verhofstadt to Leinster House.  The attendance of the many dignitaries, ambassadors, officials, MPs, MEPs and MLAs, sends out a clear signal of the need for solutions to Brexit and peace and if those solutions can be found on this island our many problems in the EU may also be resolved.  I commend the membership of the committee, its officials and witnesses on their ongoing work on Brexit and exploring solutions while extremely cognisant of building on our fragile peace and progressing the many legacy issues.<\/p> <p>  For many of us there can be various defining moments in our history but for me the main aim of the Treaty of Rome, the forerunner to the EEC or EU, was to ensure that peace not war would unite us in prosperity.  I am 59 years of age and was born ten years before the further outbreak of the Troubles in 1969 that broke many families and fractured communities and their prosperity in Northern Ireland, the Border region and beyond.  I also remember life pre-EEC and post-EEC membership and the transformation that this great island achieved as a result of EU investment in trade and infrastructure, much of which is ongoing.  For all of us in this Chamber and beyond the strides that this country has made have been significantly enhanced with peace, which has encouraged communities North and South to face each other with a common purpose, respect and recognition that there is strength in unity and friendship is what is important.<\/p> <p>  Politicians will not be forgiven by this generation and future ones if they fail to progress and enhance this fragile peace.  Let there be no mistake, Brexit has the potential to derail so many of the gains of this island and we must not allow that to happen.  Some key findings of the report from our committee have found that the all-Ireland economy must not be affected or allowed to regress.  A tailored solution taking into account its very unique circumstances is required.  We are concerned about the commitment to continue both the INTERREG and PEACE programmes, which provided &euro;3.5 billion in the past 20 years.  It is important that such a commitment would immediately be set out clearly so that people can plan and communities can continue to prosper from the PEACE moneys.<\/p> <p>  The committee calls on the Government and the EU to undertake a detailed study on the potential implications of Brexit on reconciliation.  Allied to that is the psychological impact identified by the committee that Brexit will further affect many families in the North and along the Border corridor.  Whether one has been a victim, a combatant or an innocent bystander the emotional scars of murder, death and explosions remain deep rooted and continue to need healing.<\/p> <p>  Brexit presents many challenges but there are also opportunities.  The committee believes the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement can step up and take on additional responsibilities, including the British-Irish Council and the North-South Ministerial Council, whose remit needs to be reviewed and enhanced.  Like Mr. Verhofstadt, the committee has visited many groups in Northern Ireland who feel they have no voice in the current political stalemate and it is the committee's responsibility to bring those anxieties to his attention.<\/p><p>These need to be represented in the all-Ireland debate.  Indeed, the absence of unionism and a unionist voice at the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is regrettable.<\/p><p> Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, widely recognised as the cornerstone of peace.  That anniversary takes place at a time of uncertainty in North-South and British-Irish relations.  Perhaps it is an opportune time for the EU and the European Parliament to reinvigorate its investment in making our peace process a world model and exemplar that will show war-torn regions around the world how a lasting peace can be achieved.  I should add that many representatives of such regions have visited us to look at what we are doing.  Politics is about the art of the possible and we owe it to our children and our children&rsquo;s children to live in peace, prosperity and harmony on this island.<\/p><p> Both Mr. Verhofstadt and Mr. Barnier continue to use the term \"unique solution\" in their deliberations.  Will Mr. Verhofstadt suggest what his thoughts are on that solution and what he feels it could look like?<\/p><p> With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I have been asked by my colleagues from the British Parliament on the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement committee, who are here with us today, to ask Mr. Verhofstadt if he will produce a report on his fact-finding visit after he returns to Brussels.  Will he share his experience of the last 48 hours with Mr. Barnier?

I also thank him for his strong support for Ireland, for the manner in which he has facilitated the ALDE group in supporting the Irish cause in respect of Brexit, and for his determination that Ireland would not suffer.  In the limited time that is available I will put two key points to Mr. Verhofstadt, if I may.  He rightly drew attention to the citizenship dimension of the Good Friday Agreement and the idea of multiple identities - of Irish citizenship and European citizenship.  It is extremely important that in the ultimate resolution of this, the idea of Irish citizenship as enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement is protected in the context of the resolution between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  In a post-Brexit scenario, Northern Ireland will have the largest concentration of European Union citizens outside of the union's borders.  It is essential that mechanisms are found which will ensure those citizens are in a position to continue to enjoy the rights and privileges of European citizenship.<\/p> <p>  Second, notwithstanding the British position at the moment in terms of the customs union, which is ultimately the key issue in terms of the Border question, we have been putting forward the idea that a special economic zone needs to be considered.  There are many examples of economic zones across the world.  Economic zones in themselves do not challenge or undermine the unique constitutional framework of east-west, North-South and the Northern Ireland settlement.  In other words, it is possible within the existing constitutional framework to devise an economic zone for the North and the Border counties which would maintain freedom of trade - goods, services and people - North and South.  We need to move on from the language of a \"frictionless border\" or \"no border\" and start working on concrete ideas and solutions that could ultimately bring a resolution to the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017092100002#E00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":669,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte m&oacute;r roimh an tUasal Verhofstadt.

In his remarks today, Mr. Verhofstadt acknowledged that people are very critical of the European Union.  That is Sinn F&eacute;in's position.  We want to see a more democratic, demilitarised, peaceful European Union which embraces economic and social justice, international solidarity and an end to poverty.  Notwithstanding that, we campaigned in the North for a Remain vote, because it is our view that to have one part of the island outside the European Union and another part inside is just folly.  It is a really significant fact which has been ignored by some, but people in the North supported that position.  They voted to remain within the EU and we believe that vote should be upheld and actively defended.  The various policy positions which the British Government has unveiled, including leaving the customs union, will all cost jobs, undermine the economy and subvert sectors in both parts of the island.<\/p> <p>  I particularly want to welcome Mr. Verhofstadt's remarks on the Good Friday Agreement.  I know that he values the peace process and I understand he met some of our colleagues: Martina Anderson MEP, our group leader in the European Parliament, our national spokesperson on Brexit, Deputy David Cullinane, and our Members of the European Parliament.  His description of the Border and of partition is very much appreciated, as are his warnings of the dire consequences if it is reinforced.<\/p> <p>  To move on to my questions, will Mr. Verhofstadt give us an assessment of the possibility of agreement, given that there has only been limited information available thus far and that there does not appear to have been any real progress from the British side?  I welcome his suggestion that the North remain within the customs union and the Single Market.  That is effectively the designated status for the North which we have campaigned for and which the D&aacute;il, the majority of MLAs and the European Parliament support.  The threat and the danger to the Good Friday Agreement could be averted if the agreement was incorporated in full as a protocol in the withdrawal agreement.

He is right when he says that responsibility for finding a solution to the Irish Border question lies with the UK and no realistic proposals have yet emerged from that quarter.<br\/><br\/>My first question is very simple.  Will Mr. Verhofstadt and his colleagues, Mr. Brok and Mr. Gualtieri, consider including within the wording of any final European Parliament resolution a clause that ensures the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement is maintained and the principle of parity of esteem and human rights protection is upheld, especially given that 56% of the population in Northern Ireland voted to remain within the EU?  If no such protections are forthcoming from the UK, will the European Parliament veto any outcome that does not satisfy those fundamental rights?<br\/><br\/>My second question relates to a very good article by Mr. Verhofstadt that was published in <i>The Observer<\/i>on 9 July last, in which he wrote very rationally about the UK position in relation to citizens' rights.  He referred particularly to third country nationals, the new status that will pertain in the UK, the need for separate applications for settled status and the five-year residence requirement.  This is another simple question.  How seriously is the European Parliament taking the UK's negotiating position, which is grossly insulting to any Irish person living in the UK who has settled there for years and has an intergenerational relationship and which will set back the cause of Anglo-Irish relations by years?  I would like to know Mr. Verhofstadt's opinion on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017092100002#E00700","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":672,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Verhofstadt to address those questions as briefly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017092100002#F00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505986200,"counter":673,"content":"<p>It is a question of how many minutes I will be given to respond to all the remarks that have been made.  I thank the honourable Members and the Chairs of the committees.  Maybe I can pick three elements from the various interventions that have been made.  Reference was made to the state of the negotiations and I was asked whether we will use our veto.  One needs to have something to veto before one can use one's veto.  For the moment, there is nothing to veto because - let us be honest - no real progress has been made in the negotiations.  We have had three rounds of negotiations.  The first round involved the formal start of negotiations, the second round involved the presentation and the third round involved the clarification.  I think it is time for the negotiation in the fourth and fifth rounds.  That is what we are hoping for now.  Maybe the intervention of the British Prime Minister will lead to a breakthrough in the coming days.  Based on the state of play now, those of us on the European Parliament side do not see sufficient progress to call for the so-called \"second stage\" of the negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.  The sequencing is important because Article 50 of the treaty says that there needs to be an agreement on withdrawal in the first instance before a new relationship can start to be established between the EU and the withdrawing country.  Let us be very blunt about it - the first three rounds were very slow.  We hope the fourth and fifth rounds in October can speed up the negotiations.  It is time for the uncertainty to stop, in the interests of everybody, particularly businesses and citizens.  This uncertainty is having a negative impact on the hearts and minds of citizens and on daily economic life.  The only way to stop it is to go forward in the negotiations.<\/p> <p>  The second point I want to make relates to the Good Friday Agreement.  The European Parliament has made it very clear from day one - it pushed this in the guidelines of the European Council - that the wording of the Good Friday Agreement should be included in all its parts.  This has been a request from the European Parliament.  Keeping the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement is a key element for us.  We cannot risk the possibility of Brexit creating a return to the Troubles that we saw in the past.  That is a key element for this whole negotiation.  I found that this point - the risk to the Good Friday Agreement posed by the Brexit discussion - was not touched on sufficiently during the whole debate before the referendum in Britain.  I accept that this is in the past now.  Ireland can count on the European Parliament to defend the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  We will never allow whatever solution is reached to put that in danger.  As the EU played an important role in the Good Friday Agreement, it is keen to defend its own work and its own achievements.<\/p> <p>  The third issue is the solution for Northern Ireland.  As I said earlier, I have heard many solutions for Northern Ireland already.  It has been suggested that an economic zone could be created, or that the Single Market and the customs union could continue to be extended to Northern Ireland.  All of these solutions are possible.  As the European Parliament will express in its next resolution, however, the position paper that the British Government has put on the table is not possible because it says that there should be a return to a border and that it will be made invisible.  I have always thought that if a border is not visible, it is no border.  If a border is visible, it is a border.  It is not only with a number of technical features that the problem can be solved.  We are in favour of any solution that avoids in any way a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  That is going to be our goal.  As I indicated in my intervention yesterday, the main proposal for avoiding a hard border that I have heard involves Northern Ireland continuing to participate in the Single Market and the customs union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017092100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Guy Verhofstadt"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Verhofstadt and call Deputy Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017092100002#F00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":675,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Verhofstadt for his contribution.  I have no doubt about the stupidity and, frankly, obnoxiousness of the Tory position when it comes to the negotiations about Britain's exit from the EU.  I am thinking particularly of its anti-immigrant policies.  Given that the EU insisted on the cruel punishment of our citizens for the banking collapse, can we take Mr. Verhofstadt seriously when he says that the EU will not allow Ireland to be punished for Britain's decision to leave the EU?  For example, the EU insisted on the imposition of dreadful austerity on our citizens for things that were not their responsibility.  Given that the EU insists on borders of steel, barbed wire and police camps enforced by Frontex in order to keep out tens of thousands of desperate refugees who are fleeing warzones like Syria, can we take Mr. Verhofstadt seriously when he says noble things about the EU not believing in borders and wanting to reduce borders to lines on maps?  If the EU is willing to do this to desperate and vulnerable people, some of whom are drowning in the Mediterranean as a result, how can we take seriously Mr. Verhofstadt's pledge to try not to impose borders here?  What Britain decides to do is one thing, but I would like to hear an absolute guarantee that the EU will not insist on some sort of border in order to protect its Single Market.  If we were to get such a commitment from Mr. Verhofstadt, we could deal with Britain and the problems it is imposing.<\/p><p>Can he give us that guarantee?

At the founding of the EU its principles were peace, harmony and economic and social development for everybody but those principles are being undermined by the way Europe responded to the migrant crisis and by the economic crash, which showed a widening division between rich and poor.  Is this an opportunity for the EU to redefine its vision and to become more committed to the values on which it was set up?  There is an issue around development aid and we are seeing an increasing securitisation agenda.  There is a fear that this will divert badly needed funding and there will now be a further shortfall from Britain.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to Ireland as we will be particularly affected in many areas because of Brexit and its potential economic consequences.  How can Europe support Irish jobs and businesses in that area?  A terrible gamble is being taken with the Good Friday Agreement.  Flawed as it is, it has ensured peace for a generation who have not experienced the violence their parents and grandparents experienced.

I interpreted him as saying there was one last chance to be more democratic, but democracy in Brussels has been lost.  I welcome our MEPs here today, but there have been many regulations and restrictions as to what we can and cannot do and that is why Brexit happened.  They need to look at that, and comments from some very senior people after Brexit were not very helpful.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt might elaborate on what he meant by a frictionless border.  There is a massive border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is much bigger than ours with three checkpoints and which was built with EU funding.  Mr. Verhofstadt says it will not happen here and that Great Britain will have to look after the Border, but that is not good enough for us.  We need concrete and tangible measures.

I am very heartened by what Mr. Verhofstadt said because it marks a change from what Mr. Barnier said when he was here a few months ago, to the effect that a border is a border.  He said there would be free movement of people but not of trade or goods, but Mr. Verhofstadt has said the solution has to be one where an effective customs union or the Single Market is upheld.  Will that be the red line?  Will the Parliament, which has the ultimate veto on any agreement, accept it?  We are now into the second phase of the negotiations because the first phase was primarily about people.  It seems Mr. Verhofstadt said that he will protect this island in the area of customs, goods and services.  He concentrated on four words, which were, \"as they may choose\", and in respect of the Good Friday Agreement there are another four key words, \"in all its parts\".  How will the European Parliament choose when it comes to preserving the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts?  Mr. Verhofstadt's language today could not have given a clearer signal that we were going to preserve an island for the trade in goods and services and not just people.  I welcome his clarity on this as it is the right position.

When there are problems with the external borders of the European Union, they are mainly because of a lack of European Union.

It is nonsense to do that.  In that respect the position of the European Parliament is that we support a European border management in a decent, human way.  This is absolutely needed.  Do Members know the budget of the European Border and Coastguard Agency, which used to be known as Frontex?  It is &euro;250 million.  Homeland security in the United States is &euro;62 billion.  We think we can solve problems at a European level without giving the means and the possibility to do so.  People say the Union does not tackle the challenges of today and does not have good results, but to have good results one needs good policies, for which one needs the financial means.  In terms of a European asylum system to replace Dublin - excuse me for criticising Dublin but I refer to its place in asylum policy, in the form of the Dublin Regulation - we need ways of having legal migration because this is the only way to tackle illegal migration.  We push asylum seekers into the arms of criminal organisations because the only way to ask for asylum is to set foot on European soil.<\/p><p>I remember the first time I attended the European Council as Belgian Prime Minister.  It was in 1999 in the north of Finland, in Tampere, where it is always dark.  We decided that we should have a common European asylum and migration policy.

It is not only a question of announcing things but also of making them really happen.<\/p><p> The third question was on the specificities and interests of Ireland.

That is the way to ensure that those interests are taken on board in the final agreement.  It is also the best way to keep the unity of the EU 27 because - let us be very realistic - there are going to be attempts to undermine it, which cannot happen.

They are resolute that they are leaving the customs union and were pretty clear that they are open to regulatory divergence, including in food, animal welfare and so on.  As we all know, they insist both are possible without any borders.<\/p> <p>  There has been a bovine theme this morning so I will give an example in keeping with it.  Brazil produces high-quality, grass-fed beef at just above half the price that British and Irish farmers can afford.  If the UK, outside the customs union, were to reach a zero-tariff agreement with Brazil on beef, large containers of high-quality Brazilian beef would land in Belfast.  Smugglers would convey that beef into the Republic.  Some of those smugglers have links to paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland.  Inevitably, the beef would continue on to the rest of Europe.  Northern Ireland would thus be used as a back door for cheap, high-quality, tariff-free, illegal beef to come into Europe.  Inevitably, the EU would have to respond and, inevitably, we would see a hard border.  We would have a nationalist community in Northern Ireland pulled out of Europe against its will, seeing a fence built around it, at the same time as profits from smuggling would start funnelling into paramilitary organisations there.  Brazilian cows could contribute to the material destabilisation of the peace process.<\/p> <p>  I sense some softening of a position in the UK on the customs union.  The British are saying they will leave the customs union but might be able to talk about a customs union.

That is something we saw in the European Commission's paper as well and I welcome it.  We want to hear what, in the final analysis, the term \"unique\" will mean for Ireland.  I welcome that Mr. Verhofstadt says that the North of Ireland must remain in the customs union.  As we know, the British Government is against this.  That needs to be a very clear, firm view not just of the European Parliament but also of the Commission.  It has to be an absolute red line issue.  If the North is taken out of the European Union against its will and if it is also taken out of the customs union and Single Market against its will, there will be an EU frontier on the island of Ireland.  There will be a border.  We do not want a hard border, a soft border or any type of border.

I will move on from that matter, however.<\/p> <p>  There is a notion that the UK is responsible for the Border and that it is, therefore, its problem.  Let us be totally honest; it is not.  As the Deputy across the Chamber just pointed out with his Brazilian beef example, the problem is Europe's and not the UK's.  The British will have no interest whatsoever in putting a border in place.  Their sole concern is migration.  They can control migration on the boats and aircraft travelling from Northern Ireland.  One has to have one's passport to get a flight to Britain as matters stand.

With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I will start with the last point on citizenship because we have talked a lot about borders and economic interests but perhaps not enough about citizenship.  The position of the Parliament, which will be reiterated in the new resolution, is that we need to protect fully the EU citizenship that several hundred thousands of Northern Irish citizens who have Irish passports have.  We must take this seriously.  It concerns all the elements linked to EU citizenship.  EU citizenship is not something from which one can pick and choose - consular aid, yes, but voting rights, no.  It is a concept that is linked to EU citizenship and the position of the European Parliament is that we must protect it.  In the Brexit steering group, one of the priorities is to look into this and be sure that we on the European side defend this concept during the negotiations.  It cannot be the case that we say these people are EU citizens but that EU citizenship does not mean anything.  That is not possible.  It must mean what it is: all the rights that are in fact linked to that concept.<\/p> <p>  With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I will respond to another question that has been put forward: what is happening now in this discussion about citizens' rights in general?  This also concerns Irish citizens living in Britain.  Our concept, our proposal, from the European side and the European Parliament side is that we simply continue collectively the rights that the more than 3 million EU citizens living in the UK have currently.  We are very critical - and we will reiterate this in the next resolution - of the UK side's proposal to introduce a new concept of settled status in British immigration legislation that will require each one of these millions of citizens to make an individual request to continue to have his or her rights.  Individual means individual, so if there are four family members, four requests need to be initiated.  There will be a number of conditions and a need to prove a number of things.  This will create an enormous administrative burden on these millions of European citizens, including many Irish citizens in Britain.  The same goes for UK citizens living on the Continent but I do not think this is such a big problem because all the remaining EU member states recognise that the best way forward is simply to continue the rights those citizens have now.  I am saying this because this is a key issue that must be solved, it is to be hoped as quickly as possible, to end the uncertainty for these millions of people who are today already subject to a number of practices by which they are losing a number of their rights.  This is not to mention that some of them received a letter - apparently it was a mistake - stating they had simply to leave the country as quickly as possible.  This is completely against the EU treaties because, until withdrawal, the UK continues to be a member of the European Union, needs to apply fully EU law and does not have the right to send such letters.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about the customs union and the example of beef was given.  Other examples are possible.  The problem for the European Union is not that the British side may say tomorrow they want to continue in the customs union.  Nobody in the European Union will say that is not possible.  However, to be in the customs union also means that the competence to make trade agreements continues to be exercised by the European Union.  That is the consequence of a customs union.  In a customs union a country does not negotiate tariffs and trade agreements individually; it is the European Union that does that based on the treaties.  One cannot say one wants to be in the customs union but will manage trade oneself.  That is not the European Union.  I think everyone will accept, certainly now that it has already been proposed by some in Britain, that the UK should stay for a transitional period in the customs union, but it cannot pick and choose and say it wants to be in this but not that.  One cannot say, \"I want to be in the customs union and the Single Market but I do not want to pay, I do not want the oversight of the European Court of Justice, I do not want migrants coming from eastern Europe and I do not want it to be the European Union that negotiates trade deals in the future.\"  That is not possible.  Membership comes with positive things but also with obligations.  One cannot create a system in which not being a member of the European Union is more favourable than being a member.  One would then destroy the European project.  I am very open to and positive about what Deputy Donnelly said in his question but, as I said, it is not a question of taking the benefits and putting the burden on the remaining 27 member states.  That will not happen and will not be allowed to happen.  That is not objective, not serious and certainly not the kind of European Union we all want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017092100002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Guy Verhofstadt"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":696,"content":"<p>We have nine further questioners.

Does he not think the Commission and the Parliament could also have some draft proposals on solving our particular problem?  Regarding the future of Europe, the Commission has put forward five scenarios.  I think the President of the Commission put forward a sixth scenario in all but name during the week.  Ireland has concerns about proposals for corporate tax harmonisation and a deepening common defence policy.  We are losing a friend as we lose the UK from the European Union.

In this Oireachtas, I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Those of us in the North who are Irish do not derive our Irishness from the Good Friday Agreement.  It, of course, runs much deeper than that.

It says that on the front of our passports to remind us.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt has referenced comprehensively something that we discussed yesterday, namely, the importance of the psychology of citizenship and our place within the world.  While our Irish citizenship in the North should never be partial, conditional or second class, nor should our EU citizenship.  Mr. Verhofstadt was clear in his remarks regarding a future for EU citizens living in the North, but perhaps he might expand on what that will mean for the EU citizen who is a farmer in Fermanagh, a worker in Strabane or an entrepreneur in Newry.  If such people are to access their rights and entitlements as full EU citizens, what will that look like?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017092100002#K00300","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Verhofstadt.

Mr. Verhofstadt has been clear, in that the European Parliament will have a say over whether we enter those negotiations.  A new trade negotiating mandate will need to be given by the Council to the Commission.  In his role in the European Parliament, will Mr. Verhofstadt seek for environmental, equality and employment standards to be central in any negotiating mandate so as to ensure that there is no race to the bottom, which would damage Ireland deeply?

However, the reality for many people in this State is that the decision of the British people to leave the EU has been having a dramatic economic impact for some considerable time already.<\/p> <p>  In solidarity with hard-pressed sectors of our economy, will the EU respond with assistance and supports for struggling Irish enterprises?

There is nothing the UK Government has done that gives any bit of solace to us that the solution will come from the UK.  Along with all of my colleagues, I believe that if Mr. Verhofstadt can take one message from his visit here today, it is that we are depending on the EU to ensure that Ireland, as the country most exposed to this decision, does not suffer.  If we are depending on the UK to come up with a solution, as Mr. Verhofstadt said, that simply will not happen.  We have to proceed on the basis that it is the EU's responsibility to protect us, and that is what we need it to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017092100002#K00900","speaker":"1321","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505986200,"counter":708,"content":"<p>On the questions on external security, as I have already indicated in the first resolution, we in the European Parliament think that for the future relationship, the best way is to use an association agreement, as was seen in the Lisbon Treaty.  That gives the possibility not only to talk about trade but also to talk about the other issues we have to tackle in the future and the other parts of that relationship.  It can be on culture, on education or on research, and it can be on internal and external security matters.  I think it is in the interests of everybody, including the Union, that we do that.  Therefore, it will not only be about trade and economics; it will be a broader decision, in that sense.  I underline what has been said, namely, that the British side has proposed a number of ideas.<\/p> <p>  Second, many speakers said that it is all very well what I am saying but asked how, in practice and on practical matters, it will work.  I can tell them that, yesterday, I spoke with many representatives of sectors, especially about the practical consequences of Brexit and how to deal with these.  I did not only talk about borders and avoiding a hard border.  We spoke a lot about the general position of the Irish economy and of the Republic of Ireland, and the threats because of Brexit, because it is a main trading partner of Britain.  We spoke of how to secure this trading position and also the trading position of Ireland towards the rest of the European Union because the normal streams of goods towards the European continent are under threat if we have no good solutions in these Brexit negotiations.  I spoke about very concrete solutions for that with the different representatives of the sectors in order to understand their fears, their problems and how they see they could be solved in the future.  I have taken on board a number of very practical suggestions on how that could be done within an agreement with the UK while defending the economic and trade position of Ireland after the withdrawal.<\/p> <p>  I have noted also the suggestion that has been made by some speakers to put the Good Friday Agreement as an annex of the withdrawal agreement.  It is also a suggestion that has been made in the European Parliament and we are discussing that at the moment in the Brexit steering group.<\/p> <p>  On the divisions and the development of opinions in Britain, it is true that these are not for the moment helping the negotiations move forward.  However, let us hope that these divisions of opinion will be overcome in the coming days and weeks in order that this fourth negotiation round can be a step forward towards the future.<\/p> <p>  Another element, having noted the negative impact of Brexit, is whether the Union will take its responsibility.  Naturally, the Union will take its responsibility.  We have the instruments for that and the funds for that, and it will certainly be done.  However, let us first negotiate a good withdrawal agreement and a good association agreement on future relationships to minimise the impact, and then see what will be the nature of that impact.<\/p> <p>  On a last point, when I said in my introduction that it is for the UK to take responsibility and to come forward, this is not for lack of ideas because I have given ideas in my introduction and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has made a proposal here about an economic zone.  I have spoken about what some have said to me, which is that the best way to solve it is to extend the Single Market and the customs union to Northern Ireland.  All this is on the table.  However, the reason I am saying this is that it is true that the decision to go out of the European Union has not been taken by Ireland, by the Irish Government or by the European Union.  It is a consequence of a British decision so there is also, in that sense, a responsibility on their side to come forward with proposals that can work - not proposals which create a hard border, but proposals which avoid that.  That is the reason I am recalling that all the time.  There is, on their side, responsibility to accept a solution that is workable and, at the same time, that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.<\/p> <p>  We have to see it a little bit as an element of the negotiation.  It is not that they have taken a decision to go out and, so, we have all the problems on our back and have to find solutions for all the problems.  No.  There is a responsibility also on their side.  For example, financially, one cannot go out of the European Union and say that the whole financial burden is for the remaining 27.  Commitments made by 28 member states cannot be later on paid by the remaining 27.  In one or another way, it is like a divorce.  I have to tell the House I have no practical experience of divorces personally but I know that, in a divorce, you cannot go out and leave your partner alone in the house and say, \"Now, all the financial things are for you.  Bye-bye.\"  That is not the way it works.  Commitments have been made and if commitments have been made, then it is also normal that payments will be required based on these commitments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017092100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Guy Verhofstadt"},{"type":"speech","time":1505986200,"counter":709,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

I am the CEO of the Irish South &amp;amp; West Fish Producers Organisation.  The organisation is based in Castletownbere, County Cork, and represents the greatest number of fishing vessels in Ireland's fishing fleet.  Our membership comprises fishermen who operate in every segment of Ireland's fishing industry with vessels that range in length between 9 m and 27 m.  Our members utilise every type of fishing method - inshore and offshore - along the south and west coast of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I come from a fishing background.  My family has a proud tradition of earning a living from coastal waters.  I have been told that I come from many generations of fishermen and I hope my son follows in my footsteps.  The fishing industry is very dear to my heart.  I have a young family who are interested in the sea but I fear for the future of the industry.  I fear that future employment in the fishing industry for our young people will not be an option.  My fear is based on the Government's current proposal to reduce the Irish fishing fleet in the 12 m to 24 m sector by up to 50 vessels.  I fear that the three proposals put forward to address the matter will mean the end of many of our rural communities that depend on the coastal fishing boats, and the end of an era for many thousands of families who live along our coastline.<\/p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s natural resource-based seafood industry provides an important source of economic activity in remote coastal regions.  It provides jobs on fishing vessels, fish farms, in processing operations and in the distribution and marketing of seafood at home and to export markets abroad.  Jobs are also provided in a large number of smaller ancillary companies that provide services to the mainstream industry operators such as net makers, etc.<\/p> <p>  The industry contributes approximately &euro;700 million annually to the national income and employs an estimated 11,000 people, mainly in the coastal communities of Donegal and Louth.  It is the duty of fishermen's representatives to ensure the future viability of this industry for all those who currently work in it.  Fishing, as practised on the seas around our coastline, is not comparable with any other industry that is based on land.  One must take account of the many different fishing methods that are used by the skippers and masters of fishing vessels.  They have sole responsibility for the safety and well-being of their crews and vessels.  Everyone must understand that fishing involves a dangerous and unpredictable working environment.<\/p> <p>  I shall address the topic that has caused much anguish in the industry to date.  A sizeable number of our members who own fishing vessels under 15 m in length have been in touch with us.  They have asked us to convey the message that they cannot contract available qualified non-EEA crew to go to sea due to the fact that the scheme only relates to vessels over 15 m in length.  Also, they are seriously disadvantaged in their ability to hire qualified crew for their licensed fishing vessels.<\/p><p>We have been made aware that fishing vessels occasionally have no choice but to go to sea with one or two fewer crew members than would be preferred.  If this is allowed to continue it could turn in to a health and safety issue as reduced crew numbers mean longer working hours for those on board.  We respectfully request that the committee reconsider the parameters under which the atypical scheme is administered and possibly recommend that vessels under 15 m be included in it.  We have circulated a petition among our membership and other boats in our area and have collected 50 signed petitions from the crew of vessels who say they would like to see that happen.  That took place in the past couple of weeks and is ongoing.<\/p><p> The 2015 Government task force report said that the scheme was to allow for the structured and transparent employment of non-EEA workers within a defined framework in the Irish fishing fleet.  It did not mention vessel size.  In making its recommendations the task force was focused on practical arrangements which would enable the risks of exploitation to be minimised while ensuring reputable employers are able to recruit trained and experienced crew members.  Ireland&rsquo;s whitefish sector will benefit from the implementation of the main recommendations of the report.  Allegations made last year in certain quarters and reported in the mainstream media gave the perception that the task force had failed in that objective.  However, operations to follow up on the allegations were carried out in several fishing ports by many of the agencies involved in the task force, assisted by armed garda&iacute;, the Navy and the Garda dog unit at what I assume was no small cost to the State but none of the alleged 2,000 illegal trafficked non-EU workers were found.<\/p><p> The 2015 report also noted that crew members on fishing vessels are traditionally share fishermen, meaning they receive a share of the proceeds of the vessel&rsquo;s catch rather than a regular wage.  In the 1980s skippers and vessel owners brought a High Court challenge which resulted in the crewmen in that case who were share fishermen being re-classified as self-employed rather than employees.<\/p><p> The crew of a fishing boat operate like a family who work together as a unit and share the workload to achieve one purpose, which is to leave the safety of the harbour to face the elements and spend days and nights at sea as hunter-gatherers and catch a valuable and important part of society's diet.  In a world with a rapidly increasing population, food security is becoming more and more important.<\/p><p> Anything that adds risk or uncertainty to the changing of fishing operations should be considered very carefully.  However, only one consultation was held with fishing industry experts prior to the atypical scheme.  It would have been preferable if the industry had been fully included in its drafting.  There is a consensus among fishermen with whom I have spoken that the complexities of how vessels operates and how operators often have to change a plan of operation in a moment is not understood or taken into consideration.  When the weather or the catch of fish changes, a skipper has to respond and he or she puts the safety of his or her crew and boat as a priority in this unpredictable industry.  In the farming sector one has to harvest crops based on weather conditions and long hours are put in, often even overnight.  It is a mistake to imply that the fishing industry is unique.  Weather conditions also affect the time it takes to shoot, haul and process the catch.  For example, for safety reasons a net must be taken on board and not left on the outside of the boat because it could foul the boat's propeller with serious danger to the crew and vessel.  The quality of fish also depends on the speed at which the crew process the haul.  The crew cannot leave the deck and leave fish from a haul and come back to it later because, for food quality and safety reasons, it needs to be processed in as short a time as possible.  Depending on the amount of haul in the boat there could be an extension of the duration for which the crew are expected to work.  No responsible skipper or master will put the well-being of his or her crew at risk but in the environment in which he or she operates decisions are occasionally made that breach the working time regulations but nevertheless must be made for the safety of the vessel and its crew.<\/p><p> We advocate that legislators be informed of the complexities of this industry.  It is not the same as a factory environment because it is an unpredictable hunter-gatherer industry that rewards skill, experience and those who endeavour to make their living in the face of the risk of facing the elements.  I thank the committee for listening to my address and hope to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505998800,"counter":720,"content":"<p>The Irish Fish Producers Organisation, IFPO, welcomes the opportunity to present to the committee on issues regarding migrant workers in the Irish fishing industry.  Much has been said in the print media and on the airwaves since <i>The Guardian <\/i>newspaper broke its story in November 2015 on alleged abuses of migrant workers in the Irish fishing industry.  I stress that neither I nor the IFPO in any way condone the mistreatment of any employee, either Irish or non-EEA, within our industry or any other.  The IFPO has been at the forefront in the national media to condemn any abuses of human rights of either Irish or non-Irish persons working in our industry.  Like any industry, there may be those who are not committed to abiding by the law and we cannot and will not support that.  However, very little of a positive nature has been said in the media about, for example, those in my organisation who are fully compliant with the atypical scheme for migrant workers and who are paying well above the minimum wage.<br\/><br\/>The IFPO does not support the employment of undocumented people on Irish fishing vessels which is why it has always pushed for a permit scheme.  In 2008 the IFPO wrote to the Government to highlight the issue of undocumented workers.  I wrote to the then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, in October 2015 to ask for a meeting to address employment issues within the fishing industry and, in particular, that he consider a work permit for non-EU citizens.  I released those documents to the media two years ago to clear up any misconceptions the public may have had on where we stood on this issue.  It is important to point out that happened before <i>The Guardian<\/i>broke its story or the Government set up the task force which ultimately resulted in the non-EEA scheme for migrant workers within the Irish fishing industry.  Moreover, I wrote to the then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, in January of this year to outline that the current scheme needed to be reviewed.  In particular, I felt that a non-transferable permit put employees at risk and left them vulnerable.  That letter has been given to the committee.<br\/><br\/>On 4 July 2017 the Migrant Rights Centre and the International Transport Workers' Federation presented to this committee in relation to migrant non-EEA workers in the Irish fishing industry.  On foot of that I wrote to the committee asking that the fishing industry be allowed to give its account and clarify several important issues.  Having viewed the footage of the committee meeting of 4 July I felt that the entire Irish fishing industry was painted as criminals involved in slavery.  Much of the commentary was made under privilege.The suggestion that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was tipping off fishing vessel owners prior to inspections or raids was of particular concern.  That was an incredible suggestion and I can say with confidence that in my opinion it has never happened.  It is a very serious allegation.<br\/><br\/>The committee was told that only 42 permits were applied for under the scheme.  Dermot Conway, solicitor, who is sitting beside me, can confirm that his office alone has dealt with 135 individual applications.  Other solicitors are processing similar applications.  That does not include the numbers of renewals.  The committee was told that there are 1,500 non-EEA fishermen in the country without a visa.  As of 20 July 2017 the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, had inspected 150 of the 176 whitefish vessels and none of the five resultant prosecutions relates to a crew member being on board without the necessary visa.  If the Migrant Rights Centre and the International Transport Workers' Federation have evidence of the mistreatment of non-EEA workers in the Irish fishing industry they should hand that information to the WRC or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is incredible to think that serious allegations of criminal activity which were alluded to on 4 July - not 3 July as I wrote in my presentation which was given to the committee - could be discussed at this committee and that those files, if they exist, have not been furnished to the relevant authorities.<\/p><p>I ask them to do so now in the interests of fairness to the employee, the employer, the WRC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Not handing over this information would either suggest they are not doing their job, or that there is no such information to hand over.  One way or the other, the accusations made are very damaging to the reputation of genuine fishermen and women and the wider fishing industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Francis O'Donnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505998800,"counter":722,"content":"<p>I am CEO of the Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation.  As my colleagues have gone into the details of how the fishing industry works, I will keep my address brief.<\/p> <p>  The Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation, ISEFPO, thanks members for giving us the opportunity to present and clarify some misconceptions about the treatment of migrant workers in the fishing industry.  Our organisation does not condone the mistreatment of any person, worker or otherwise, and encourages anyone who is aware of such ill-treatment to bring it to the attention of the appropriate authorities.  With other industry organisations, we have been proactive in looking for a scheme to regularise the status of non-EEA workers in the industry.  This was achieved in 2016 with the introduction of the atypical workers scheme which was a welcome development, but like all new schemes, it needed some time to bed in and overcome the learning curve.  To this end, we were ably assisted by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in guiding the organisation and individual skippers-owners on the necessary measures to comply with the new legislation.<\/p> <p>  I refute completely any suggestion, as recorded here in July, that the WRC was not doing its job and fulfilling its role.  We take issue with the fact that people who had vilified the industry with misleading and unsubstantiated accusations at every opportunity in various media were invited to come before this committee and make false allegations against the industry, the WRC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Portraying these bodies as condoning modern day slavery - the words used in the presentation - was outrageous and I am surprised that it was tolerated in this chamber.  Wildly inaccurate figures for migrant workers from the same presenters have been bandied about.  In fact, on an RTE news programme in 2015 it was claimed that there were 8,000 such workers in the industry, when a figure of a few hundred would have been more accurate, but, of course, sensational stories make the news.  If the ITF or migrant rights people have evidence to substantiate their claims, they should pass on the evidence to the proper authorities, as otherwise they are aiding and abetting criminal activity and should be answerable to the Garda.<\/p> <p>  For us, there has been a serious misrepresentation of the facts of the engagement of non-EEA workers in the industry.  We ask the committee to take account of factual information and not wildly outrageous claims made by parties who may have a vested interest in distorting these same facts.<\/p> <p>  I will answer any question or elaborate on the points I have made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugo Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1505998800,"counter":723,"content":"<p>Ms Parke represents the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#F00300","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505998800,"counter":724,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for giving me the opportunity to make what will be a very short presentation.  <\/p> <p>  The Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation does not have a problem at this time as its members do not employ any non-EEA personnel.  Therefore, we can take a dispassionate view of the situation, particularly the ongoing process at the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  However, the organisation has been closely involved during the years on a wide range of issues concerning the welfare of fishermen.  We have engaged freely and proactively with the agencies concerned and made every effort to disseminate relevant information, clarify some of the more obscure ramifications and consequences of regulations and, in fact, lobby for the improved protection of fishermen - Irish, European Union and non-EEA alike.  In addition, the CEO, Mr. Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Donoghue, was a member of the interdepartmental task force set up by the then Minister with responsibility for the marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, in November 2015 to regularise the employment of non-EEA fishermen.<\/p> <p>  The Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation has been a supportive member of the Santa Marta group &ndash; the North Atlantic Maritime Project - since its launch in Ireland in May 2016.  I suggest the reports and views expressed at the most recent Santa Marta group meeting in Dublin on 20 June 2017 which appear to overlap considerably with this joint committee group should be given some consideration.  My own experiences in dealing with Irish fishermen who were attempting to legally employ non-EEA workers might shed some light on the reasons there are occasions when it is simply impossible to be compliant, leading to both employers and workers falling through the cracks.<\/p> <p>  I can say categorically that there is no vessel owner, skipper or other member of the KFO organisation who has any desire to exploit his or her workers, let alone treat them as slave labour, and I am sure I also speak for my industry colleagues in that regard.  However, we need to live in the real world and acknowledge that sometimes things go wrong.  If a law does not work or is a bad law, we need to change it, but a successful change requires dealing with the facts, not emotional, exaggerated and sometimes slanderous allegations.  Let us take the opportunity to identify the drivers of non-compliance, not alone regarding non-EEA nationals but also employed fishermen from our communities and within the European Union.  This is not a situation which will be rectified by greater enforcement of short-term solutions but by appropriate regulation.<\/p> <p>  I will be happy to answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Norah Parke"},{"type":"speech","time":1505998800,"counter":725,"content":"<p>Ms Trudy McIntyre is the south east member of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#F00500","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505998800,"counter":726,"content":"<p>On behalf of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, NIFF, I thank the joint committee for the invitation to attend the meeting.  <br\/><br\/>The fishing vessels that come within the remit of the NIFF are trawlers, lobster and crab boats, whelks, razor, scallopers, gill-netters and small pelagics.  The very nature of this meeting, the atypical work permit scheme and the position of the non-EEA crew on Irish fishing vessels do not cause any direct involvement for us, as under our terms of reference, we represent fishing vessels under 12 m, while the scheme has been designed for vessels over 15 m.<br\/><br\/>On the atypical work permit scheme, the NIFF has no formal position on what is a complex issue.  To explain this, I will reiterate our chairman&rsquo;s explanation at another committee meeting:<\/p><blockquote>On policy and legislative issues such as this, the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, NIFF, takes direction from the six Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums, RIFFs.NIFF tries to form consensus based on the views expressed from each individual regional forum.<\/blockquote> <p>Following on from this, no formal issues have been identified or raised by any of the RIFFs in relation to the scheme, as it stands.  Notwithstanding this, however, we would like to point out that the issues with lack of crew that our colleagues in the whitefish and prawn sectors face now also pose a big issue for fishing vessels in the under-12 m sector.  Whether this is a direct result of skilled inshore crewmen heading into positions that may have been occupied by our non-EEA co-workers remains to be seen, but the fact of the matter is that we are finding it more difficult to crew our vessels with skilled, trained and competent individuals who understand what their jobs will entail.  Life at sea is tough, regardless of the vessel one is on.  Every fishery comes with its own challenges, even more so in the inshore sector as our jobs are more weather-dependent than for those on larger vessels.  Our size often leaves us without income for weeks on end.  Being a self-employed fisherman on any boat, one understands that when one is not fishing, one does not get paid.  One understands one can haul one's nets or pots for a couple of boxes of fish or crabs that will not earn enough to cover the expenses to enable the boat to go out fishing that day or for that trip and one comes home with little or no money.  One thing we are guaranteed is that there are no guarantees.<br\/><br\/>Considering these challenges, we would like to see the atypical permit scheme extended to the under-12 m sector, something which was mentioned as an option under consideration by the Government on a &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme segment on 6 April this year pertaining to the non-EEA fishermen in the fishing industry.  We are calling for a scheme that could be adapted to include the inshore sector in a manner that would be fair to all.  We acknowledge the complex issues with the scheme, but we are willing to come to the table to see what can be done in that respect.<br\/><br\/>I take the opportunity to relay a few observations from my own personal experience outside the NIFF on some of the circumstances surrounding the scheme.<\/p><p>We have enough people here today speaking about the facts and issues surrounding why we are here.  I would like to tell the committee a bit about the other side of this awful story, one that has garnered much less attention and acknowledgement. <br\/><br\/>I am a proud member of the Irish fishing industry and take my participation in this industry very seriously.  I take great offence at the recent attacks on the Irish fishing industry and the corresponding effort to paint us all with the same vile brush by individuals who know little or nothing about what it takes to be a fisherman or to be involved in the fishing community.  In Ireland everyone is so quick to believe what is printed.  A person is guilty until proven innocent and having to prove one's innocence often comes at a huge financial and personal cost.  The losses incurred are felt by all those involved in the business, be it ashore or on the boat.  What that also does is break a person.  It causes mental anguish, it attacks his or her character, makes that person paranoid about what is going on and about who he or she can trust.  The ripple effect extends to that person's family and to see that person crying and being hurt at the accusations being made against him or her is one of the hardest things anyone will ever go through.  I know this because my dad, Lenny Hyde, and his business partner, Pat O'Mahony, have been living this for well over 15 months, and even today when hearing anything to do with this issue, they relive the nightmare. <br\/><br\/>Another proud member of the fishing community, Lia N&iacute; Aodha, sent an open letter to the editor of <i>The Guardian <\/i>in response to an article published in that newspaper on 2 November 2015.  She quite rightly states that the article unfairly and unnecessarily damages a small industry on the edge of Europe and harms the livelihoods of good, honest people, not only Irish skippers and crews but also the non-Irish.  Further, it defames countless hard-working people, their families and their colleagues and causes insurmountable hurt to individuals, their families and their communities.  She pointed out that the instances referred to in the article &quot;are isolated and the exception rather than the norm&quot;.  The people who may be guilty of the mistreatment of others do not differentiate between Egyptians, Filipinos, Irish, or with respect to skin colour.  They treat everyone the same.  This is a reflection of the person, perhaps, not knowing any different, carrying out his or her duties, oblivious to his or her ignorance and moral duties.  These very people who have been spoken about in many interviews by the International Transport Workers Federation, ITF, have still not been brought to justice despite the &ldquo;reams and reams&rdquo; of evidence allegedly gathered against them.  I am curious to know if this evidence and information has been handed over to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and investigated.<br\/><br\/>At this committee meeting's meeting on 4 July, the Chair asked whether this is a racist issue.  Mr. Ken Flemming of the ITF answered that it was.  I absolutely disagree with that answer.Across all levels of society, one will find individuals in positions of power who mistreat people in pay grades below them.  If the owner of a restaurant mistreats one of his employees, does that mean every restaurant owner is guilty of the same?  I put it to the committee this way.  Just because one or two individuals within the fishing sector of more than 2,000 fishing vessels may be guilty of mistreatment, why is the whole industry on trial? <br\/><br\/>I came across a presentation by the ITF and SIPTU to Seafish in Scotland.  The last two points of that presentation got me really thinking.  They read as follows:<\/p><blockquote>As the internationally recognised premier organisation involved in looking after the welfare of seafarers the ITF is willing to inspect all Irish vessels and certify whether or not they comply with the ETI.  ETI firms should only purchase produce from ITF certified vessels.<\/blockquote><p>If the ITF and SIPTU are so concerned about bringing justice to the allegedly mistreated fishermen, why has this been drawn out?  Why do they not hand over the information as it comes in?  What of the dozens of fishermen whom the ITF has holed up in safe houses?  Would these men not prefer to be at home with their families?  In Irish law is it not illegal knowingly to assist an illegal immigrant to stay in the country?  Withholding information from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a criminal offence.  It is an offence that is not tolerated in the fishing industry, but it seems to be acceptable for the ITF to do so.  Discrimination comes in many forms and can be interpreted by individuals as a personal attack.  As an Irish citizen and a member of the Irish fishing community, I feel that we are being discriminated against by organisations and persons with an ulterior motive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Trudy McIntyre","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505998800,"counter":728,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Ms McIntyre.

As Chairman of the committee and on behalf of my colleagues, I would like to state quite clearly that I take issue with his comment.  This is a fair and impartial, balanced committee.

Allegations have been made of extensive mistreatment and abuse of people within an industry.  As somebody who lives in north County Dublin, I am very proud of the ports along our coastline, our fishing industry and the men and women who are involved in fishing.  I am proud of the manner in which they do their work.  As others have pointed out, they seek to feed our people.  They are challenged not just by the market, but also by the weather, like many farmers.  The huge difference between them and farmers is that their lives are challenged and their safety is at risk.  All too often, sadly, we lose valued and loved members of our community.  All here would hope to be able to support those involved in the industry in making it as safe as possible.  I was talking to some of the organisation members today about the moves that have taken place in that regard such as, at a bare minimum, wearing a life jacket at all times.<\/p> <p>  I want to comment on the issues raised by a number of people around the scheme itself and how it does not apply to vessels under 15 m.  As was pointed out, the task force never mentioned boat size when it came into being.  I would support that changing and being open to all operators.  We have a duty as legislators and as members of this committee in particular, however, to make sure that the scheme is fit for purpose.<\/p> <p>  I find a lot of the witnesses' evidence very compelling.  What I do not find credible is the idea that there are no rogue operators within any industry or profession, including my own.  We need to be realistic.  I take on board the point that if there is evidence there, it should be made available to the appropriate authorities.  Senator Gavan informs me that several cases of illegal trafficking are with the authorities at the moment.  Let us be on the one side here, namely, the side of justice and fairness to all parts of the industry.

I do not think Mr. Boyle does himself or his industry any service by coming in with those remarks.<\/p> <p>  I would like to start with a couple of positives.  I highlight Mr. O'Donnell's speech.  His point about the permit scheme being altered to ensure that a worker does not \"belong\" to any particular employer is one we should heed.  I welcome his comments.  I also support what Senator James Reilly has said.  Common sense suggests that boats under 15 m should be included in the scheme.  Let us try to recognise that.<\/p> <p>  Overall, I must be frank in saying that I am very disappointed.  There seems to be a large degree of denial from our guests today.  The problem is that there is a large number of non-EEA, undocumented workers in the industry.  I have huge respect for Ken Fleming, who is a trade unionist of high renown and a man of honour and integrity.  We do not have to take his word for it, however.  We can take the word of the MRCI, a body that has worked courageously with undocumented migrants for years.  It is very clear about the abuses that unfortunately are going on within significant sectors of the industry.  We will also hear from the Defence Forces later on this afternoon.  I will cite their document.  They inspected 63 Irish-registered fishing vessels and found 134 non-EEA crew members, of whom only 39 had the required letter of approval.  Some 95 did not or, in other words, two thirds of the workers were working illegally.  Are the witnesses seriously telling us that the Defence Forces are lying?  If we are going to make progress on this issue, we need to acknowledge that there is a major problem with undocumented workers.

The second point I would make is that there is a big distinction, which would require clarification, between someone being asked for a letter and not having it but having a visa to be within the State.  We are talking about a trawler of some description.  It is not someone's office.  It is not the same as my office.  It is not the same as a human resources, HR, department in Tesco.  Not every piece of paper that is required to be in an office is necessarily on a trawler.  That is the first comment I would make, and it is something that would have to be clarified.  In my experience of dealing with the visa issue, there has been a huge take-up of visas by owners who are engaging these non-EEA people.  The numbers the Senator is quoting are from inspections by a naval vessel and I would be much more interested in hearing what the WRC has to say because if it carries out an inspection, it can require, under legislation, the owner-operator of that vessel to supply the information at a later date if the owner-operator does not have that information on the day of the inspection.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the WRC statistics about no documentation whatsoever, the WRC breakdown of the numbers I have seen ranges from payslips to not having the contracts of employment, to not having the actual authorisations on the boat on the day of the inspection.  It is a range of documentation which goes above and beyond the actual authorisation itself.  That is something that needs to be clarified because it is not appropriate to say that 70 boats had zero paperwork towards these authorisations.  What is factually clear from the statistics that were released by the WRC is that there are five prosecutions taking place, and that was after it could not get the owner-operator to co-operate or supply what had been demanded of them by way of legislation.  It is five, not 70.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the trafficking cases that are taking place, I have not seen a single statistic issued by anyone as to the number of cases that have commenced.

It is very important to remember that.<\/p> <p>  I would make a couple of comments about the Marine Survey Office logbooks.  Senator Gavan said there was a widespread failure to recognise a problem within the industry.  The Marine Survey Office logbooks have to do with crew composition and trips.  They have nothing to do with non-EEA fishermen authorisation within the State.  In fact, and I am sure the WRC will confirm this, we - by that I mean almost everyone on this side of the room - have attended at least two meetings with the WRC to discuss issues about certain documents the WRC was requesting.  Number one on the list was the MSO book because the MSO book contains information about share fishermen as well as the non-EEA fishermen.<\/p><p>The owner-operators were warned there were data protection control issues over giving information which the WRC was not entitled to, and the WRC very correctly pointed out that it needed to make sure what the crew composition was on a boat, and that if somebody was a non-EEA national that it would be able to identify that person and be able to ascertain whether or not that person was legally working within the State.  Two meetings were held about that, because it was a compromise.  From my perspective, the Marine Survey Office, MSO, logbook is not the issue to be concerned about here.  The issue to be concerned about is whether or not there is enough uptake of non-EEA visas.  The second issue is whether or not there is a cohort of owners who are not complying with the legislation, and the third issue whether or not the representations made by the two organisations the Senator referred to are fair and accurate.  We say that of course the observations being made are not fair.  The question then becomes whether or not they are accurate.  As someone who acts for the fishing industry and for the owners and representative bodies I do not pretend that there is not a single owner out there who is not capable of happily breaching the law.  What I am saying is that I can give evidence that 134 visas were applied for through my office alone.  One does not need to do the maths to wonder, given the fact that if I did 134 visa applications and there are only 500 available, where the other non-EEA fishermen who are being dealt with by the system in some shape, fashion or form are.  By that I mean that the owner being prosecuted for having someone illegally working on their place of work or the INIS dealing with the person who is unlawfully in the jurisdiction.<\/p><p> There are other issues, such as what roles the Naval Service, the MSO and the WRC are playing.  Are all these organisations simply not processing the evidence the Senator says exists that says that we, as an industry, are in denial?  The answer is that I do not think that the numbers stack up with the actions of the organs of the State.  The Naval Service has not prosecuted anybody for it.

I can assure Ms McIntyre that where the ITF or SIPTU has any evidence whatsoever in relation to suspected breaches or, indeed, any unlawful activity that that has been, to the best of my knowledge, passed on to the authorities, as should be the case.  I want to put on record that I have met some individuals who have claimed that they have been trafficked into this country and I, along with other colleagues, have taken the necessary action, as one would expect from a Member of the Oireachtas and from a responsible citizen, to bring those matters to the attention of the authorities.  I want to advise Ms McIntyre that where workers are designated as employees, trade unions such as the ITF and SIPTU are quite entitled to organise collectively with those workers and to seek to represent their interests.  That is a fundamental human right and something that I do not believe anybody in this Chamber will apologise for.  It was a hard-won right which is defended by the Constitution and international law, and that happens within in a legal framework.  There are no passes for any industry in terms of the protection and vindication of the rights of anybody.  I hope that she would accept that.<\/p> <p>  Nobody here wants to see any kind of ritualistic hand wringing and declarations that there are no problems at all.  In fairness to some of the witnesses, they have recognised that there are some operators in the industry who do not uphold best practice, to put it charitably, and who are under suspicion for a whole host of reasons in terms of alleged breaches of this particular scheme and, indeed, much more serious elements of Irish legislation.  It is in the interests of the industry in general to accept that there is an issue and to work with the authorities to address it because it is in the interests of good operators in this industry to root out those rogue elements and to ensure the reputational damage to the Irish fishing industry is arrested and addressed.<\/p> <p>  It is probably useful at this point in time to perhaps reflect on some WRC figures presented to us, which I understand are publically available.  The WRC has only been statutorily responsible for monitoring and regulating sectors of the industry since the introduction of the scheme.  Going back to first principles, the whole idea of the scheme was to classify people who were working here, in some cases illegally, and give them some kind of a status, but classifying them as employees.  When they are classified as employees, the WRC as the labour inspectorate and the authority responsible for employment rights vindication in this country, takes responsibility for the way in which those workers are treated, at least from the perspective of employment rights.  The information we have today, which the witnesses may or may not have, suggests that there have been 232 inspections to date up to September of this year.  The scheme only went live in the middle of 2016.  That is a significant number of inspections.  Across a range of different elements of employment rights legislation 198 contraventions were detected.  That is a very high non-compliance rate in anybody's language.  The Naval Service had different responsibilities for regulating the fisheries industry over the years, but this is new for the WRC because of the classification of employees in the sector.  In any person's language that is extremely high, and we all have to be concerned when we see figures produced by the WRC in the course of its work which suggest that 29 individuals did not have the relevant permission to work.  The permission to work can mean a permit through the permit scheme or another type of arrangement that would ensure these individuals are lawfully here.  That is high, and so is the reference to the fact that in the context of the 198 contraventions, 70 of them involved having no records whatsoever in their possession.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Conway referred to the fact there are only a small number of prosecutions, at least at this point in time, which are being pursued by the WRC.  Of course, it is the function of the WRC to work with industry and trade unions to ensure there is compliance, and the WRC will comment on that later on today in terms of how that is working out.  I am very interested to hear their views on the record in that regard.  In anyone's language, the numbers are high.  They are high for any sector.  This is notwithstanding the difficulties that some may have had in bedding down and understanding how this new system operates.  I know the WRC went to enormous lengths to work with the industry to brief it on what not just our expectations are but what the legal obligations of the industry operators are to the people who are working in their industry.<\/p><p>I would like to refer to a number of points made by the witnesses in the course of their contributions.  Mr. Murphy and Ms McIntyre referenced the need to expand the scheme to vessels under 15 m and 12 m, respectively.  That is worthy of consideration.  Senators Gavan and Reilly expressed the view that they are open to that.  It was also suggested that non-EEA fishermen should be enabled to be share fishermen, which is an issue previously discussion by the committee.  I would be interested in hearing the witnesses elaborate on how that would be done.  This scheme was introduced in response to complaints by the ITF, other trade unions and the <i>Guardian<\/i>investigation which highlighted a number of issues in the sector, including allegations of exploitation of fishers, particularly those from non-EEA states.  I find it difficult to square that circle.  If a person continues to be a self-employed share fisherman and he or she has no status in this country how can we as a state afford that person the type of protections I believe every citizen in this country or anybody working here should be entitled to.  If the witnesses have a view on how that circle can be squared I would be pleased to hear it.  I take a keen interest in this area at a policy level and I have not yet figured out how that could be permitted.<br\/><br\/>Mr. O'Donnell is on record over the years as identifying that it is very difficult to attract people to work in the fishing industry for a host of different reasons.  We all understand the conditions are very difficult, that it is a unique industry in many respects and as such it is difficult to retain skilled and trained staff.  Pay is an issue in the sector.  There is no doubt about that.  There are many fishing villages in my own constituency and I know that during the so-called boom years many people left fishing to work in construction and other sectors which were much more profitable and on their return to the fishing industry found it was not as profitable as when they have left it.  I understand people make decisions in terms of what is best for them and their families and so on.  That being the case, would the industry consider engaging in a sectoral employment order with those in the industry who seek to represent workers to ensure there is a basic statutory floor of pay and terms and conditions in the sector in order to retain staff and to promote the industry as a good employer and a sustainable industry?  This is something that the industry should consider and keep an open mind on.  We could be here all day and all year talking about the challenges the industry faces and how we can improve this scheme but at the end of the day fixing this scheme will not fix all the industry's problems.  The industry has an issue in terms of sustainability of profitability in some sectors, on which I would like them to elaborate.  I understand and accept that.  Would it consider a collective agreement for the sector, which is enabled by the 2015 Industrial Relations Act to ensure that there is a basic floor of pay and terms and conditions in an industry about which it is clear all of the witnesses are very passionate?  If they are as passionate about the industry as I think they are they should consider that.  <br\/><br\/>I have a couple of questions for Mr. O'Donnell, to which some of the other witnesses might want to contribute as well.  Mr. O'Donnell indicated that he had been in contact with the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, who is now the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation in regard to various amendments to the scheme which he believes would enable it to work better.  Has he had any response from the Minister or any other Minister in recent months given that this issue has been front and centre in terms of public commentary?  It seems that one of the problems is that there is no one Minister taking responsibility for the operation of this scheme or the improvement of it.  I have a theory as to why that is the case, which I will share with the witnesses later.  Has Mr. O'Donnell had any response on this issue?  I want to him to be clear in that regard because what he says will help us to resolve the issues he is experiencing and the issues workers in the sector and the trade unions that represent them are experiencing.<br\/><br\/>How many non-EEA fishers are in the industry?  I am of the opinion that there are more than are covered by this scheme.  Does Mr. O'Donnell agree with the upper limit of 500 permits per annum provided for in the original scheme?  The official record suggests that far fewer permits have been applied for.  The original limit may have been garnered from contributions by the industry at the meetings around design of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#M00700","speaker":"1398","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505998800,"counter":794,"content":"<p>Before I call Mr. O'Donnell and Mr. Murphy to respond would Ms McIntyre or Mr. Boyle like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#N00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505998800,"counter":795,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Trudy McIntyre"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505998800,"counter":796,"content":"<p>I accept the Chairman's comments about my presentation.

In regard to share fishermen, before the scheme was implemented these people were employed in the same way and treated in the same way as the other share fishermen on the boat, such that they got a share in the percentage of the catch.  They were treated no better or no worse than other people.  The point I was making was that in introducing this scheme the work they had chosen to sign up was changed.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of trafficking, I am not long in my position and as such I am playing catch up.  As I said earlier to Senator Gavan, I am not aware of the figures he mentioned.  I have never seen them and so it would be unfair of me to comment.  I apologise if I misheard the Senator and quoted 13 instead of 19.  As far as I am aware, as shown in the case of Ms McIntyre's father's challenge in the courts, fishermen worked through an agent from the country who paid fees to bring the workers in, and the workers agreed terms and conditions with the person who brought them into the country.  This is deemed to be trafficking.<\/p><p>There could be a misconception by the general public that fishermen went over, smuggled guys in crates and boxes and brought them into the country.  That was not the case.  The fishermen of this country operated in the only system that was available to them at the time.  When it was found out that this system was not correct, we negotiated and tried to get to work with the task force.  As I stated, there was only one meeting I was aware of where industry was actually involved in the setting up of this.  As my colleague here has pointed out in the letters, every time we saw there was a problem there, we initiated contact with the Departments as asked to, to see if it could be rectified.  We believe that we are definitely trying to represent the best interests of every fisherman in this country, regardless of what people deem as colour, creed or where they come from.  We try to treat everybody equally, yet the Senator said that he believes that no industry is immune to wrong-doers within the industry.  We have not said that.  We have not claimed that there have not been wrong-doers.  As Mr. O'Donnell has clarified, when we come across something like that, we too insist - that is why we have said \"united\" here - that any information that points to it should be brought to the relevant authorities and we will comply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#N01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505998800,"counter":804,"content":"<p>In fairness, Senator Reilly said that.

Those are the words that I used on RT&Eacute; about this.  I have been frustrated myself.  We went in and presented in front of the task force.  We initially thought we would be part of that task force.  Like other organisations, we gave our view as to how we thought this should be rolled out.  Like any scheme, after a period of time, there should be a review of that to see how it is working for everybody, for the employee, for the employer and for the State itself.  That has not happened.  In fact, the task force was disbanded and I wrote to Deputy Frances Fitzgerald to try to get everybody into a room.  I was not asking to control who was going to be there but for somebody to take the lead on this to get us into a room and to get us talking about it.  I was personally concerned that the structure of the permit system left migrant workers very exposed.  A permit is a person's permit.  If it is assigned to just one vessel and that is written into law then that person, technically, if he or she falls out with the master of the vessel, is in serious trouble and could find himself or herself on the side of a pier, homeless, and would be a major burden on the State.

Many of my vessels in their very early stages would have had non-EEA workers on board.

We are on record in 2008 for writing to Fianna F&aacute;il at the time asking for this to be looked at and addressed.  We have done that on numerous occasions since.  We could not say that it was not happening prior to 2006 and I cannot honestly say that it is still not happening now, but we are trying to do something about it.  That is where we are.  Nobody has responded to us.  No one Minister is responsible.<\/p> <p>  I welcome what has happened here today because it has teased out some of the issues.  I think we have to be fair.  It is not that we are coming in and saying that we are angels.  We are not saying that at all, but the arms of the State that are charged with policing and managing this have to be given due process and a fair crack at dealing with the problems.  I said it myself on record.  This is not about the industry and the International Transport Workers' Federation, ITF, or anybody else.  I am more than willing to go with Ken Fleming or anybody else into any Garda station in this country and hand over any information or files because this is extremely damaging to us.  Somebody, at some point, has to present the information, give it to the authorities and let justice take its course.  The committee will not hear me saying that this should not happen or is wrong.<\/p> <p>  I remember one of the first raids that happened in Howth and Castletownbere.  Everybody here knows about it.  I was quite critical of the Garda approach at that time.  They came on board fishing vessels with automatic weapons, sidearms and Alsatians.  They inspected the vessels to see where employers were breaching the atypical working scheme or, even worse, if they had people on board who did not have visas.  I felt it was very heavy-handed.  I made a complaint to GSOC at the time because I felt there were other ways of doing this.  Uniformed members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could have come down onto fishing vessels and carried out the inspections.  I felt that it did not need that level of force.  The job could have been done just as well.  We were on the back foot again because this made international news: Alsatians and automatic weapons made the industry look very bad.  In hindsight, I look back at it and think that it was not a bad thing.  We had a very serious problem with all of these undocumented people.  Nobody knew that this was happening.  My phone started ringing that morning.  I do not believe anybody was tipped off about this whatsoever.  It was as much of a shock for us as it was for everybody else.<\/p> <p>  If there were thousands of migrant workers in Ireland who were undocumented, surely at two of our major fishing ports, Castletownbere and Howth - Howth probably is not that big - this would start to surface and would have surfaced since.  There may be some problems and there may be rogue operators, but at the moment we find ourselves here in front of the committee because there has really been no mechanism to address the issues if they are there.  Nobody is taking responsibility and we have asked.  We have not been sitting idle on this because we know it is very damaging.

Allegations have been made against the industry, which the witnesses refute and about which they are pretty annoyed, saying that the evidence does not bear it out.  They are in a very competitive industry and there are huge pressures, globally and locally, not to mention the question of fishing resources with the sea losing resources on a yearly basis.  The sea has been overfished and fishermen are not catching as much as they would have done previously.  As native Irishmen and Irishwomen, they will have noticed that other industries have exploited foreign workers, such as the building industry, the au pair industry and many others.  People will remember the Gama workers from Turkey some years ago and there have been investigations into migrant workers in the domestic and hospitality industries.  It is not unusual in industries that are coming under pressure and are competitive.  I would not find it at all unusual if there was evidence of exploitation within this industry but I would not find it acceptable.  What is the opinion of witnesses on the abuse and misuse of labour from other countries?  Do they regard it as something that happens because they cannot control everything or do they abhor it and think it should never happen, and should be totally outlawed and policed properly?

On foreign vessels, there would have been identification papers because of language issues.  With the scheme having come into play, it is not entirely clear to what extent the Navy, in particular, has communicated to the owners that they must have a certain type of paperwork on board.  Likewise, an awful lot of the back-office work documents of a trawler, such as payslips and accounts, would not be on board.  Those documents would tend to be at the owner's place of business or work and would not be on the boat at all.<\/p> <p>  With regard to identification documents for migrant non-EEA workers, they must have their basic safety training course card which is issued by Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The card is not transferable from another jurisdiction to this one.  One has to acquire it in this jurisdiction.  The second document one would expect crew to have on board is the identification paper.<\/p> <p>  Certainly, the question has never been asked of me whether the non-EEA fishermen have to have their letters of authorisation on board.  I am frequently asked to send on a copy of the letter of authorisation because the owner has lost it.  I have frequently been asked to send it on because the crew member has lost it but I have never been asked whether the crew member has to have it at sea.  The answer is that I have never come across a legal requirement for the non-EEA person to have it at sea.  I have never been asked whether the owner or master has to ensure the non-EEA crew member has it at sea.  It is a curious question because, ultimately, this is the original atypical worker scheme, with the fishermen added on.  The original atypical worker scheme applied to a totally different type of business, such as a restaurant.  In that case, the office is in the restaurant.  It would be expected that the documentation would be available there.<\/p> <p>  As I said, I would be very interested to know whether the 70 fishermen on board the vessels in question had a visa but did not have the letter of authorisation.  Those are obviously two distinct documents.  Not having paperwork and being illegally on board is one matter but not having paperwork and being legally on board is an entirely different matter.  I do not know the answer because I had not heard the number mentioned in any way before.<\/p> <p>  The other question I was asked was about the agents, particularly in the Philippines.  Egypt and the Philippines are the two main locations from which the non-EEA fishermen are coming.  That is not an exclusive list but those are the main two.  When we first got involved with the visa scheme, we were attending a meeting with the WRC and I had come across several so-called manning agencies in the Philippines, not Egypt.  It was stated that for the fishermen to get a visa to leave the Philippines to work for an owner in Ireland, they had to be registered with a manning agency.  The manning agency, in turn, was looking for 80% of all the wages to be repatriated to the Philippines.  Ostensibly, discounting the agency fee, the money was going to the family of the fisherman.  Ultimately, when we consulted the WRC, as Patrick Murphy has already indicated, it made it abundantly clear that this is not a relationship that would be tolerated by it.  Certainly as far as the IFPO was concerned, that was communicated to its members.  I am certain that is the case for the other producer organisations.  The matter was clarified at a very early stage.  There is no doubt that there were some fishermen here under the arrangement in question.  When the arrangement became the subject of sharp focus because the fishermen were now employees rather than self-employed, the clarification was sought and given.  It was certainly communicated at that point.<\/p> <p>  The manning agencies still exist.  My inquiries tell me that, under Philippines law, that is how one gets out of the country to go work.  It is certainly the national policy of the Philippines because it is very involved in the merchant navy as well as the fishing navy.  It has a stated national policy of having a percentage of all seafarers across the world coming from the Philippines.  That is where the manning agencies allegedly come from.  As far as we are concerned, the WRC has made it very clear that the relationship is not tolerated, and that it will not be tolerated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Conway"},{"type":"speech","time":1505998800,"counter":834,"content":"<p>I asked two brief questions, and I would appreciate it if Mr. O'Donnell could answer them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#Q00800","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505998800,"counter":835,"content":"<p>I was going to come back to them.

The SFPA is the independent statutory body responsible for the regulation of the sea fisheries and the seafood production sectors.  It promotes compliance with the EU Common Fisheries Policy, sea fisheries law and food safety law relating to fish and fish products, verifies compliance and, where necessary, enforces it.  As a State agency, we come under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p> <p>  The SFPA's mandate covers all fishing vessels operating within Ireland's 200-mile limit and more than 2,000 Irish-registered fishing vessels wherever they operate.  Our fisheries controls are focused on the landing and subsequent sale of fish in Ireland.  We are dependent on the Irish Naval Service and Air Corps under the terms of an agreed service-level agreement for fishery controls at sea.  As a coastal state, Ireland has fishery protection obligations for the entire Irish EEZ, within which lies some of the richest fishing grounds in the EU.<\/p> <p>  In terms of seafood safety, our role covers the Irish seafood sector as a whole up to, but not including, retail.  It involves inspections of primary food producers such as fishermen and fish farmers and Ireland's 170 seafood processing companies.  Our remit includes the implementation of European hygiene package legislation as well as the inspection and health certification of export consignments going outside the EU.  Under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the SFPA is responsible for audits and inspections of food businesses, including vessels, in the seafood sector to assess compliance with food safety legislation.  Our seafood role also extends to verifying compliance with product labelling regulations, including geographical origin and species declaration.<\/p> <p>  The authority implements the national microbiological monitoring and classification programme for shellfish production areas and, in collaboration with the Marine Institute and molluscan shellfish safety committee, the national marine biotoxin monitoring programme to manage food safety risk of biotoxins and micro-organisms in molluscs farmed or harvested in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The SFPA employs more than 90 people between its headquarters in Clonakilty, County Cork, and its offices in the major ports around the coast: Castletownbere, Dingle, Ros a Mh&iacute;l, Killybegs, Howth and Dunmore East, with 77 warranted sea fishery officers.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the atypical workers scheme, because we are one of the agencies with an ongoing presence on piers and fishing vessels, the SFPA was a signatory in 2015 to the interagency memorandum of understanding, MOU, for the monitoring and enforcement of the terms of employment of non-EEA crewmen in parts of the Irish commercial sea fishing fleet pursuant to the establishment of the atypical worker permission scheme.  Arising from the MOU, a risk profiling and inspection group was established, and the SFPA has continued to participate with that group actively.  Our resultant role is one of information sharing with the group.  In practical terms, this might involve providing information on instances that may arise in the course of our normal inspections to verify compliance with fishery obligations.  For example, we might observe indications of labour law breaches or receive information to that effect.  In such instances, we have agreed to inform other members of the risk profiling group.  Furthermore, if there is a vessel of interest identified by that group, the SFPA has agreed to provide data that are available to us for fishery control purposes.  This could include vessel position or pre-notification of landing in order to ensure effective risk-based targeting by the relevant regulator.  The SFPA does not carry out inspections to examine compliance with the terms of the atypical workers scheme specifically.<\/p> <p>  We would like to make the committee aware of a particular initiative undertaken by the SFPA.  Following a survey of the fishing industry that indicated a preference for more direct and personal communication, we set up a series of information events covering all of the major fishing regions and invited all local members of the sea fishing and seafood industry.  In order to create a on-stop-shop for industry, we invited all relevant State agencies to attend.  Some of the participants at these information sessions included the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, Naval Service, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Revenue, Customs and Excise, and Inland Fisheries Ireland as well as other relevant State agencies.  Fishermen, therefore, had an opportunity to discuss any issue or concern directly with the WRC and other marine regulatory agencies at these sessions.<\/p> <p>  One particular aspect of overlap between our work in fishery protection and the matter of concern at this meeting is the provision in specific sea fishing licences for Irish vessels that over 50% of the crew must be EU citizens.  As this is included in the fishing licence, it is one of the checks that falls within fishery control verifications but is more amenable to verification at sea.<\/p> <p>  Our legal mandate and allocated Exchequer funding are for the primary purpose of implementing fishery and food safety law and we have neither a mandate nor legal authority to verify compliance with labour law, including the atypical workers scheme.  We do, however, have an ongoing regulatory presence on fishing vessels landing at Irish ports and we have proactively engaged with aligned State agencies to maximise our contribution to the State's role in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Susan Steele"},{"type":"speech","time":1505998800,"counter":861,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Steele.

I am an official in the Department of Defence and am speaking on behalf of my Department and the Naval Service.<\/p><p>I am here today to present a picture of the work of the Naval Service in the context of non-EEA crew in the Irish fishing fleet under the atypical worker permission scheme and related matters.  In order to provide a clear picture, I would like to give some details relating to the role of the Defence Forces and in particular the Naval Service.<br\/><br\/>The Naval Service is the State's principal sea-going agency.  Its primary day-to-day tasking is to provide a fishery protection service, in accordance with national legislation and the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.<br\/><br\/>The Naval Service is empowered to board and inspect all fishing vessels and their catch in the Irish exclusive economic zone, EEZ, and, when necessary, to detain vessels formally and direct them to port for arrest by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The power to do this derives from the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  The Naval Service flotilla consists of eight ships, each of which operates an average of 185 days on patrol, termed &quot;on sailing order&quot;, per year, that is, days away from the naval base.  These days are divided into what are termed &quot;patrols&quot;.  Each patrol is on average 26 consecutive days where the ships patrol up to the 200 nautical mile limit of the State, and at times beyond this limit when ships are engaged in other fisheries or maritime defence and security operations.  The total area patrolled is approximately 1 million km<sup>2<\/sup>.  During these 26 day patrols, the ships will only come close to land due to severe weather, to rest the crew when there is fatigue or to take on provisions.<br\/><br\/>The Naval Service is empowered to board and inspect all fishing vessels and their catch.  During an onboard inspection the Naval Service will collect information relating to licences, the vessel, crew and gear among other things.  A copy of the inspection report completed by the Naval Service is provided to the master of the fishing vessel on completion of the inspection.<br\/><br\/>Naval Service boarding officers undertake this work as authorised sea fisheries protection officers in accordance with the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  Section 18 of this Act, among other powers, authorises sea fisheries protection officers to board fishing vessels and gather crew details.  The gathering of crew details is routine on Irish registered fishing vessels to ensure compliance with fishing licences which requires at least 50% of crews on Irish fishing vessels to be nationals of any of the member states of the European Union.<br\/><br\/>The Naval Service also acts as the official agency with responsibility for the operation of Ireland's Fisheries Monitoring Centre, FMC.  The FMC is located at the naval base, Haulbowline, Cork.  This fisheries monitoring responsibility is carried out as part of a service level agreement between the Department of Defence, the Naval Service and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA.  The FMC carries out monitoring and surveillance of all vessels equipped with a vessel monitoring system, VMS, that are operating in the Irish EEZ and also of all Irish vessels operating in any jurisdiction.  Monitoring and surveillance includes the entry and exit by all fishing vessels in the Irish EEZ.<br\/><br\/>The Naval Service, through its patrols, also undertakes a variety of functions in the maritime domain in accordance with its role in contributing to maritime security.  This includes the provision of support to other Departments and agencies such the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners.  With regard to the issue that brings us here today, in late 2015 a Government task force chaired by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine published a report with recommendations on a new scheme to address the employment of non-EEA workers in the Irish fishing fleet.  The objective of the scheme is to minimise the potential for the abuse of migrant workers by unscrupulous employers and to provide a mechanism to assist those currently in Ireland who are in difficult situations to enter a new employment relationship.<br\/><br\/>On foot of a recommendation of the task force that the role of the relevant key enforcement bodies be underpinned by an interagency memorandum of understanding, MoU, the Department of Defence, Naval Service, signed up to the &quot;Memorandum of Understanding for the monitoring and enforcement of the terms of the Employment of non-EEA crew in parts of the Irish Commercial Sea Fishing Fleet pursuant to the establishment of the Atypical Work Permit scheme&quot;.  The purpose of the MoU is to provide for further coordination and cooperation between the parties to ensure the effective and efficient enforcement of statutory requirements relating to employment of non-EEA nationals on Irish-registered fishing vessels on the EU fishing vessel register and, in particular, to prevent the trafficking and exploitation of non-EEA workers on such vessels.  It is also to further facilitate effective communication and exchange of relevant information in regard to the operations I have described above, avoid any unnecessary duplication of effort, support a coherent and transparent cross-Government approach, maximise synergies from the actions of all signatories and promote and support compliance.  Within this MoU, it was codified that the roles and responsibilities of the Naval Service are:<\/p><blockquote>physical inspection of active fishing vessels at sea...in line with risk assessments undertaken to best target those vessels which, through their actions and indications via electronic monitoring of their vessel activities, might be consistent with a risk of noncompliance with the rules in force in relation to their fishing area, target species or any other relevant European Union or national requirement.  The inspections are required to physically check and record all findings in line with the specific detail as outlined in the EU Inspection Report as directed in Annex XXVII of EU Regulation 404\/2011...<\/blockquote><p>It is important to note that, as detailed earlier, the Naval Service already routinely collects significant amounts of information, including crew information, as part of its sea-fisheries protection role.  Following the implementation of the MoU, the Naval Service provides details of Non-EEA crews it encounters on Irish fishing vessels during the course of its boarding operations at sea to the SFPA.  Information relating to non-EEA crew on Irish fishing vessels is a subset of the information that is already gathered.  This information is forwarded to the FMC in the naval base where it is collated before being sent to the SFPA.  Naval Service involvement in the process stops once the non-EEA crew information is sent to the SFPA.  However, I understand that the SFPA removes details from the information collected that could be considered commercially sensitive and this information is then sent onto the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.<br\/><br\/>It is also appropriate to note that where a Naval Service boarding officer encounters a non-EEA crew member when on board an Irish fishing vessel, they now also request sight of the letter of approval granting the crew member authority to work on the vessel under the atypical work permit scheme.  If this letter is not available on board, this is noted.  The Naval Service has no statutory powers with regard to the enforcement of the atypical work permit scheme.  The role of the Naval Service in relation to the enforcement of the scheme is to make available routine information relating to non-EEA crew collected during the course of their fisheries inspections.<br\/><br\/>In terms of this specific MoU and inter-agency cooperation, the Naval Service regularly communicates and works with both the WRC and the SFPA.  This cooperation and communication facilitates the work of the WRC in locating Irish fishing vessels at sea which have availed of the scheme in order for the WRC to board vessels once they come ashore to land catch in order to ensure compliance with the scheme.  The information in this regard, provided by the FMC, is limited to a vessel's position at sea and the likely time and place of landing ashore.  The Naval Service is also a member of the risk profiling and inspection group chaired by the WRC, to progress the enforcement of the scheme.<br\/><br\/>Before concluding, I would like to provide the committee with some statistics relating to the work undertaken by the Naval Service in this area.  During 2017, to end August, the Naval Service conducted approximately 760 patrol days relating to sea fisheries protection.  The number of boardings at sea in that period was over 1,000.  Specifically focusing on non-EEA statistics, during the period 1 January 2016 to 8 September 2017, the Naval Service boarded and inspected 63 Irish registered fishing vessels over 15m in length relevant to the issue we are discussing.  The number of non-EEA crew members on board totalled 134.  Of these 134 non EEA crew members, 39 had the required letter of approval and 95 did not.  In line with the MoU, details relating to these non-EEA crew members were forwarded to the SFPA for onward transmission to the WRC.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Defence and the Naval Service will continue to cooperate in the whole of Government approach to ensuring compliance with State and international laws.  The Naval Service takes this work very seriously.  The Naval Service vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on fishery patrol.<\/p><p>On occasion, they may board other vessels for security reasons, but for operational and security reasons it would not be appropriate to disclose precise details of those boardings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Margaret Stanley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505998800,"counter":865,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me here today.  The issues which gave rise to the development of the atypical worker permit scheme, which is essentially concerned with the employment circumstances of fishers who may not enjoy the benefits enjoyed by their EU or EEA equivalents, deserve our attention.  From my particular perspective, enhancing the safety of all seafarers, including fishers, operating in Irish waters, whatever their nationality, is a key aim of the Marine Survey Office.  It is for this reason that I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the discussion here today.<\/p> <p>  In reviewing the transcript of the previous hearing it is clear that there may be some issues which need clarification in terms of who does what and who is responsible for what within the overall machinery of the State.  This is understandable given the complexity of the issues and the regulatory framework in which we operate.  While I can obviously only answer for the work and role of the Marine Survey Office, I believe the atypical scheme represents a genuine attempt to focus the efforts of the relevant State agencies to address the issues which had been identified, working within the overall legal and statutory powers that the respective agencies can exercise.<\/p> <p>  To begin, I would like to set out my role, as chief surveyor of the Marine Survey Office, MSO, in regulating maritime safety.  I will explain the work and role of the Marine Survey Office and outline the manner in which the safety regulation of fishing vessels is undertaken by the Marine Survey Office.  My aim is to demonstrate the very direct and positive impact of this work for the fishing sector generally and for those working in the sector.<\/p> <p>  First and foremost, the MSO is the safety regulator for maritime transport in Ireland.  We regulate all vessel types in Ireland at sea and on inland lakes and rivers, regardless of whether they operate under the Irish flag.  We also regulate all Irish flagged ships wherever they are in the world.  Our primary focus in exercising this role is to ensure safe travel at sea.  This means ensuring the safety of the vessel itself, from design stage, to launch and to periodic checks, and ensuring seafarers operating those vessels have the right qualifications and training, accredited by suitably certified training institutions, to operate them safely.  We are very proud of the fact that Ireland has maintained an enviable safety record internationally, as evidenced by our white list status within the structures of both the International Maritime Organization and the Paris Memorandum of Understanding. This white list status is vital for Ireland&rsquo;s maritime sector.  Without it, our ships would face challenges as they ply their trade and our seafarers would face difficulties in attaining and retaining employment.<\/p> <p>  The maritime transport sector is among the most highly regulated in the world.  The International Maritime Organization sets that regulatory framework and it is our job to ensure Ireland complies.  This compliance is assessed vigorously and regularly at an international level by the International Maritime Organization and at a European level by the European Maritime Safety Agency, EMSA, on behalf of the European Commission.  We cannot afford to be complacent about this and we do our best to guard our white list and other similar statuses.  Our ships and our seafarers depend on it.<\/p> <p>  The MSO carries out a very wide range of statutory functions in relation to maritime transport.  This includes the statutory survey and certification of all domestic passenger ships and boats operating in the State.  The MSO carries out port State control inspections on all international passenger ships including the ro-ro passenger ships operating to the United Kingdom and France.  In addition, the MSO surveys all Irish merchant ships and carries out port State control inspections of foreign flagged merchant ships calling to Irish ports.  The MSO approves and regulates the port security arrangements in all Irish ports and the port reception facilities for ship generated waste.  The MSO is tasked with regulating the prevention of ship source pollution, including air emissions from ships and other discharges.  The MSO also oversees maritime education and training in Ireland at all of our maritime colleges.  With our team of marine surveyors, based in three offices in Dublin, Cork and Ballyshannon, we work constructively with the maritime transport sector and the various educational and training institutions in Ireland to ensure we maintain and safeguard maritime transport for those working in the sector and those who rely on it to transport people and goods.  How does our work impact on the fishermen in question here?<\/p> <p>  There are some 2,020 Irish fishing vessels, every one of which must hold a sea fishing boat licence.  These licences are issued by the sea fish licensing authority.  Such a licence is required to engage in commercial fishing.  The role of the MSO in relation to these vessels, as for all vessels, is to oversee safety regulation.  For the purposes of regulation of safety, the Irish fishing fleet is divided into three categories based on length: there are 75 vessels more than 24 m in length, 130 vessels between 15 and 24 m, and approximately 1,815 vessels less than 15 m.  As the safety needs of the vessels in each of these three categories are different, the MSO regulates each category differently.  Essentially, each fishing vessel must hold a safety certificate issued by or under the authority of the MSO.  These safety certificates are issued following an initial survey for a period that varies depending on the size of the vessel, essentially four years.  Vessels must undergo some form of intermediate survey, depending on their length, and at the expiry of the certificate, each vessel must undergo another survey for the issue of a new safety certificate, and the cycle repeats.<\/p> <p>  The safety regulation for fishing vessels is very comprehensive and covers the design and construction of the vessel, including the materials of construction, the strength of the vessel and the stability and watertight integrity of the vessel.  The regulations also cover the mechanical and electrical systems, including the machinery, and all systems on board.  The regulations also cover lifesaving and firefighting requirements.  The regulations require that all aspects of the fishing vessel are designed and built under the supervision of the MSO.  A survey can extend from several months and longer for a new construction to several days for a renewal survey.  The application for the survey is made by the vessel owner who pays for the survey.  The successful conclusion of a survey results in a certificate or the endorsement of an existing certificate.  The MSO also regulates the training and competency of the crew and issues the crew with certificates of competency.<\/p> <p>  In line with other similar jurisdictions, the MSO has its own core group of surveyors who survey approximately 10% of the Irish fleet directly.  We delegate the remainder of our survey work to private sector organisations approved by us and acting on our behalf.  For the larger fishing vessels in the 15 to 24 m category and the over 24 m category, these organisations are known as classification societies.  They perform this role for us.  A panel of private surveyors, established by the MSO, carries out surveys for vessels less than 15 m in length.<\/p> <p>  The committee may be interested to know how fishing vessel safety regulation has developed in Ireland.  The main source of regulation for many years was the 1967 rules which dealt with lifesaving and firefighting requirements.  The first major development in recent years was the adoption of EU Directive 97\/70, which made the International Maritime Organization&rsquo;s Torremolinos Protocol applicable in the EU.  This was transposed into Irish law.  This directive and protocol requires that all fishing vessels greater than 24 m meet the requirements of the protocol and that they are subject to a survey and issued with safety certificates.  The Torremolinos Protocol has recently been amended by means of the Cape Town Agreement, although this has not yet entered into force internationally.<\/p> <p>  The next major development was the implementation of the fishing vessel code of practice for the design, construction, equipment and operation of small fishing vessels of less than 15 m in length.  This code of practice was issued in 2004 and has been updated on two occasions.  All fishing vessels in this category have been regulated by this code since that date.  Regulation of the remaining category of the fleet &ndash; vessels between 15 m and 24 m in length &ndash; began in 2007 and, since then, there has been a progressive implementation of safety standards for such vessels.  The vessels in this category have been fully regulated since 2011.<\/p> <p>  Since the introduction of these safety regimes, the safety record of the sector has been progressively improving.  While it is very important to avoid complacency, it is the case that there has been a positive trend over time and we will continue to work with the industry to ensure this trend continues.  The focus of the MSO is, and must be, on safety.<\/p><p>Our aim is to work with the fishing industry to enhance the safety of fishing vessels in the interests of people of all nationalities who work on them.  The improvements in safety in recent years have been achieved through co-operation with the fishing sector.  Our earnest hope is that this co-operation will continue so that the improvements which have been achieved can be built on in the future.  While the MSO has no role in worker permissions, it plays an important role in the safety regulation of fishing vessels.  Success in this important area of safety depends on the co-operation of the fishing sector.  Our aim is to continue to work with the sector to improve the safety of fishing vessels and those who work on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Hogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505998800,"counter":867,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

My point is that when the ITF wrote to Mr. Hogan to ask him to ask him for legitimate information, he replied by sending a letter that I can only describe as a &quot;PFO&quot; letter in which he basically said that the ITF should ask the skipper for the information in question.

I am sorry that there may have been a misunderstanding at the meeting.  I will explain the issue with the reports.  I do not know if anybody has seen the reports.  They contain personal information in the form of photographs of passports, identification cards and atypical worker permit permissions.  My point was that the MSO does not have a role in the enforcement of worker permits.  We have a problem with receiving personal information.  The information was sent over the Internet on email web addresses.  I am a civil servant.  Data protection is the first thing I think about when I receive such information.  We have a problem when we receive very personal information that is not relevant to our work.  We do not know what to do.  I was concerned that I needed to shred the documents in this case in the interests of confidentiality.  Perhaps that was misinterpreted as putting them in the bin.  We have procedures.  I will suggest why the misunderstanding could have occurred.  I raised a concern about data protection issues.  Obviously, the last thing I would do is put the documents in question in the bin.

We are discussing non-EEA workers in the Irish fishing fleet with atypical worker permissions.  The vessel was a UK-flagged ship, so it could not have been part of the Irish atypical scheme.  It was outside the scheme to begin with.  While the case that was presented was very concerning in some ways, it is not relevant to the discussion we are having about the atypical worker scheme.  It certainly merits discussion and concern, but it is not encompassed by the atypical scheme, so I will move on to the next issue about that case.  I had not intended to raise it because of certain issues.  As the case has been raised, I would like to read from an email I received from the ITF.  It was addressed to a Garda superintendent and me, and was also copied to many other people.  It reads:<\/p><blockquote>I attach a statement from Mr. ------ which gives details of his unearthly experience on board the fishing vessel [I will leave the name out].  As I understand it from the blanket of silence from both the Irish MSO department and the Garda&iacute;, no charges have yet been put to anyone connected with this horrible act.  Equally disturbing is the fact that the area of the vessel where ------ fell and consequently injured himself has not been the subject of a marine survey by either the UK or Irish authorities to determine if the vessel's working environment was fit for purpose.  Further to this neglect of responsibilities on both flag states, and despite the fact that Mr. ------ made a formal complaint to the Garda&iacute; in Anglesea Street on the matter on the 12th of May 2017, five days ago, the matter is not receiving the attention such a serious charge clearly deserves.<\/blockquote> <p>It goes on.  I will not read the whole thing out.  I received that on 17 May last.  I wrote back to everybody as follows:<\/p><blockquote>Dear all,<br \/><br \/>I refer to the e-mail below and wish to advise that the MSO did carry out a part state control inspection and a flag state inspection of the vessels on the 13th of May.  [We had already acted, even though we received an e-mail saying we had not.]  I wish to advise that the name of the vessel for the United Kingdom vessel is incorrect and [I gave the correct name].<\/blockquote> <p>Then I got an email from the ITF, as follows:<\/p><blockquote>Hi Brian,<br \/><br \/>That is an excellent bit of information [in relation to us carrying out the inspections] and many thanks for the useful correction also [in relation to the name of the vessel].<\/blockquote> <p>The MSO has been very active regarding that vessel, bearing in mind that we work under international protocols and we respect the international conventions under which we operate.  The vessel is registered in the United Kingdom.  As I understand it, the incident happened 140 miles off our coast.  We cannot be responsible for everything that happens outside our 12-mile jurisdiction.  The protocol we follow is that we refer any such query relating to foreign-flag ships to the owner and to the flag state.  That is the correct protocol.  If somebody wants to get information on a vessel in a case like that, he or she needs to contact the relevant flag state.  We cannot give it.  I remind the committee that this is confidential information.  There is an owner involved here.  Regardless of the merits of the case, we are bound to comply with the normal procedures and ways of working.  As a maritime administration, we have to do that and comply with international conventions and ways of working.<br\/><br\/>The Senator's third question relates to logbooks.  I would like to speak about the requirements.  The word &quot;logbook&quot; is an all-encompassing one.  There is no such thing as an actual logbook, even though the term &quot;logbook&quot; might be used.  It means many things.  Fisheries vessels also carry fisheries logbooks.  We need to be careful to know what logbook we are talking about.<\/p><p>The requirement to carry a logbook on a fishing vessel dates back to the 1894 Merchant Shipping Act, a very long time ago.  The fishing industry has of course gone through many iterations throughout its history.  The Merchant Shipping Act was part of previous UK legislation.  Parts of it are still in place in this country while other parts are not.  It is a very complicated Act.  To return to the issue of logbooks, the logbook itself fell into abeyance for many years.  It was a very unwieldy document.  In Victorian times it was the equivalent of A2 or A3 in size, although they did not have A3 back then.  The language used is also very Victorian and out of date.  This language is set, however, in the 1894 Merchant Shipping Act and we have to be very careful before we change any of it.<\/p><p> What, then, did the Marine Survey Office do?  I have explained how, together with the industry, we have brought together a new framework for the fishing industry in Ireland.  This goes back a long time and has taken many years to develop.  As part of the introduction of this framework, and after the last set of fishing vessels, the 15 ft to 24 m vessels, came in in 2011, both ourselves and the fishing industry came to see it as necessary that we would help them manage safety on board their ships.  It was decided then that it would be a good idea to try to revive the logbook.  This was for safety purposes only.  We worked with the industry and gave it many assurances that if we developed a new logbook it would be for safety only and we would not use it for other purposes.  We essentially incorporated four things into this new version of the logbook.  The first of these is the crew agreement.  I do not wish to go on for too long about this but it is very complicated.  I am delighted that the committee asked us in today because we would like to explain to the members the complexity of the fishing industry.  I would like say something about the complexity of ships, in particular.   Everybody always asks why we cannot just have one agency looking after the marine.  We cannot, just as we cannot have one agency looking after the land.  Everything that happens on land also happens on a ship.  Every Government Department which acts on the land also acts on a ship.  Ships are not simple things, they are in fact very complicated, and fishing vessels are a form of ship.<\/p><p> I say that because it is very important that the atypical working scheme is signed by the fishing vessel licenceholder.  That is not the same thing as the vessel.  Mr. Conway from the IFPO made this very point earlier, that there is a shore-based component to this.  This includes the employment records and, indeed, all the other records.  Fishing is actually a shore-based activity that just happens to use fishing vessels to catch fish.  The business, however, is a shore-based business, a food business.  This is relevant because there are essentially two contracts of employment here.  One has to be lodged with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and concerns the atypical scheme.  The MSO has no involvement with that contract whatsoever.  Also on board each vessel, however, is a document called a crew agreement.  The crew agreement is included in the logbook and is an agreement between a seafarer and the master with regard to the conduct on board the ship.  The crew agreement is not the employment contract, however, and is very different.  We incorporated this into the logbook, although formally it is a separate document.<\/p><p> We also incorporated the list of crew.  This is not a logbook requirement and is a separate matter, but we put it into the logbook to make life easier both for the fisherman and for ourselves.  The third thing we included in the logbook was the actual logbook itself.  Essentially, the logbook is statement stating: \"We left, we went out to sea, we came back\".  It is a log.  The fourth element we included was the safety management aspects of the fishing vessel, namely, the number of officers; the drills; the musters; and the safety issues.  This, I think, was a good innovation.  In total, then, there are four things in the logbook.  It was introduced to help the industry from a safety perspective and we gave it an assurance to that effect.  I am now concerned that assurances we gave for helping safety may now be used for other purposes.<\/p><p> To go back to the return issue, which is an interesting one.  The question, however, needs to be asked very carefully.  What exactly is the question?  Looking at the fishing sector from an MSO perspective, we divide the fishing fleet into three: over 24 m; 15 m to 24 m; and less than 15 m.  The regulator for the fishing industry is not the MSO but rather the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We have no involvement in the fishing industry, we only care about the ship itself.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regulates the fishing industry and it is completely different from us.  It breaks the industry up into segments called aquaculture; beamer; pelagic; polyvale and general; and specific.  These segments mean nothing to us.  This is very important in order to understand how the logbook works.  The logbooks themselves are required to be returned by the vessel to the MSO every six months.  This applies to active fishing vessels only.  The atypical agreement applies to fishing vessels over 15 m in the beamer, polyvale and general, and specific categories.  If I were to go to look at a fishing vessel, I would not know which sector it was operating in.  This is not relevant to our work.  <\/p><p> To go back to the question about the logbook then, one needs to be more specific about which sector is involved.  We cannot provide that information.  Furthermore, the MSO never knows whether a fishing vessel is actually operating or not.  We certify the vessels, but a fisherman could choose to tie his vessel up and not operate it.  We have no involvement in this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#V01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Hogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505998800,"counter":881,"content":"<p>Mr. Hogan, I would like to try to move things on if I can because I think we are getting bogged down in detail.

Does the Marine Survey Office, MSO, have a problem sharing information with other State agencies?  It seems to me from my experience that it does.  What Mr. Hogan neglected to tell us in his contribution is that, apart from general issues to do with safety at sea and on vessels, the organisation is responsible for the monitoring, regulation and enforcement of working time directives at sea, rest periods and so on.  In the course of his work and that of his inspectors and others engaged on behalf of the MSO, he would encounter information from organisations like the Naval Service, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and others that would be relevant to the operation of the scheme.<\/p> <p>  From the get-go, the MSO resisted membership of the implementation group.  It essentially refused to sign the original memorandum of understanding.  It appears to have given a commitment some time ago to the industry that, when revising the log books, it would not share any information whatever with any other agency, even if it was relevant to the enforcement of important legislation.  The MSO does not only have responsibility for marine safety.  Its parent Department's website describes the functions of the MSO very clearly, including \"the living and working conditions of all ships and crews\".  The MSO has a wider responsibility than Mr. Hogan indicated in his contribution.  For the life of me I cannot understand why it resisted signing the original memorandum of understanding.  Organisations like the SFPA and others that might have a more tangential relationship to employment rights at sea were quite happy to sign it and work with other agencies in risk-profiling potential vessel owners who might be at risk of non-compliance.  All the agencies should be facilitated in doing their jobs effectively and implementing the scheme the Government asked them to implement.<\/p> <p>  I cannot understand why the MSO appears to refuse to share relevant information.  It is almost as though it were a policy position, although I do not know who could have adopted it.  Perhaps it was the MSO itself.  It was clear in conversations I have had with a previous Minister that the Department did not want this to be the case.  I would be very interested to hear Mr. Hogan's position on sharing information with colleague agencies and whether he is involved in the risk profiling group operated by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  What type of information does the MSO share?  Does it share information that would be extremely useful to other agencies and Government Departments in terms of the implementation and enforcement of this scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#X00100","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505998800,"counter":891,"content":"<p>The MSO is very active in the task force.

When they have carried out checks on these vessels, have they ever removed a non-EEA crew member because he was ill or badly treated, or because he looked for help or signalled that there was something amiss?  I am trying to get down to the crux of it.  Not having the documentation is one thing.

It was relayed from the captain of the <i>L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats<\/i>to the skipper of the ship via the boarding officer that if the skipper felt the injuries claimed by the crew member merited it, he should either proceed ashore and disembark the individual or consider requesting a helicopter medical evacuation.

I am joined by Mr. Padraig Dooley who is the head of our inspection service and he will be able to answer questions in greater detail.<\/p> <p>  The WRC plays the same role in inspecting the 176 whitefish vessels more than 15 m in length as it does for places of employment generally with two exceptions.  First, authorised officers of the Department of Tourism, Transport and Sport, that is, marine surveyors, have responsibility for enforcing compliance with rest period and maximum working hours requirements in the fishing and merchant shipping sectors, not the WRC.  Second, Irish employment law does not apply to persons classed as \"share fishers\" for Revenue purposes, as they are deemed to be self- employed.  Delivering on our responsibilities, which we take seriously, under the MOU, which we were heavily involved in drafting and which we were keen to sign up, was a significant challenge for us because we were not used to inspecting fishing vessels.<\/p> <p>  We have put significant resources into inspections and we estimate that since February 2016, we have deployed more than 1,800 WRC inspector hours to inspecting 170 workplaces, which equates to more than 100 hours per vessel.  Our inspections cover surveillance, inspections on sea and follow-up compliance checks, and repeated correspondence with the employers, and, ultimately, if we cannot secure compliance, which is our aim across all places of employment, we follow up with prosecutions.  A number of prosecutions have been commenced by the commission in this area.  At this stage, we have inspected 96% of the relevant vessels.  This is not easy because these involve a moving workplace.  I understand that we cannot inspect the remaining 4% because they are fishing tuna somewhere off the Spanish coast but we intend to get to them when they return to our shores.<\/p> <p>  We co-operate strongly with the other stakeholders under the MOU.  We share and receive substantial volumes of information.  This is an extension of our work of sharing information with all other investigative agencies.  For example, on land, we share information with the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue.  I heard the WRC mentioned frequently in the context of people passing information during the earlier exchanges.  We are at the end of the pipe for much of the information sharing.  We have engaged extensively with stakeholders, including the ITF, Migrant Rights Centre and IFPO.  Mention was made earlier of a difficulty involving inspection of log books late last year and early this year but we have reached a satisfactory compromise, which allows us access to the information we need on board the vessels.<\/p> <p>  It is clear that fishing vessels are difficult places to work.  This is clear internationally.  The ILO recently produced a report, which is being discussed in Geneva, in which the difficulties regulatory authorities experience in dealing with working conditions on board fishing vessels are clearly laid out.  It shows that many times regulations are passed but the follow-up inspections are not perhaps as evident.<\/p><p> I hope the committee will find from the information we have provided it that the WRC, at least, has performed its responsibility under the memorandum of understanding and has followed up with the necessary inspections to the best of our ability. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#Y01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505998800,"counter":912,"content":"<p>I will try to touch on some key observations, as the WRC did, and will take our statement as read.<\/p> <p>  Established in 1989, the Health and Safety Authority is the national statutory body with responsibility for enforcing occupational safety and health law, promoting and encouraging accident prevention, and providing information, advice and promoting education on safety and health for all companies, organisations and individuals.  We advise the Minister on the making of legislation and regulations in this area and represent Irish interests at EU committees dealing with proposed directives and regulations.<\/p> <p>  In 2014 the authority took responsibility for the Irish National Accreditation board which is there to promote and foster best practice in business.  The authority has a very broad scope.  Anywhere in the economy that work happens, we have an involvement.  Everything from agriculture, construction, diving, docks, forestry, education, fishing, health care, manufacturing, mines and quarries, public sector, transport and storage, chemical manufacturing, import and formulation, and control of major accident hazards.  We are also the agency responsible for accompanying UN international chemical weapons inspectors.  Our remit is extremely broad.<\/p> <p>  Like other public sector organisations, the authority has experienced a reduction of available resource since 2008.  Notwithstanding that the authority&rsquo;s approach is a risk-based model where we identify those areas where we have a legal mandate, where we carry risk profiling where the need is greatest and where our interventions can have the maximum impact.  That is the model we have evolved.<\/p> <p>  The authority believes it is critically important that we work collaboratively with other organisations, and the working group on the task force of fishing is a case in point.  We are a regulator and inspectorate and our regulatory remit touches and overlaps with other organisations.  Our philosophy is that we engage with them.  We have more than 25 service level agreements and memorandums of understanding, and are fundamentally a creature of collaboration.  We feel that by sharing information and experience, we individually and collectively can deliver a better result for the workers of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Since the establishment of the authority in 1989 the overall workplace fatality rate has been driven down from 4.9 per 100,000 workers in employment 1990 to just over 2 fatalities per 100,000 workers today.  Ireland can take some level of satisfaction that we have achieved a reduction in fatalities.  Our approach is to create a culture of safety which is how we believe we can achieve the best sustained improvement.  A single entity cannot deliver everything.  It requires a sustained, collaborative effort among all in the marine sector to achieve the improvement in the sector.<\/p> <p>  The Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that workplace injuries and fatalities are minimised through the work of our inspectorate and our advice, information and guidance.  We also provide tools to all sectors of industry to make it easier for them.<\/p> <p>  On the marine sector and fishing, fishing vessels that come within the legislation enforced by the authority since the Safety Health and Welfare Work Act 1989.  Under the Safety Health and Welfare Work Act 2005 a vessel is defined as a place of work and falls clearly in the scope of that legislation.  The 2005 Act also interprets share fisherman as an employee of the owner or the skipper of a fishing vessel.  Therefore, if they are a share worker, the duty of care to their workplace safety and health is extended fully to them.<\/p> <p>  My submission to the committee includes some information on awareness raising which I will take as read but I will give a sense of the partnership working.  As stated earlier the authority has long recognised the need and values of a partnership approach to bringing about change.  This approach relies on the commitment of the regulator together with stakeholders working to a common aim and with an agreed set of objectives to bring about improvements in the workplace.  One key example of this from the authority&rsquo;s perspective is the construction safety partnership advisory committee, where, through working collaboratively with all players, namely, the regulators, industry players, employers, the employee groups, we have achieved a common approach to drive down accident rates.  In addition, as a regulator, the authority has acknowledged the potential overlap of regulatory bodies and their engagement with different sectors.  The Health and Safety Authority therefore was a committed participant in the joint ministerial task force on fishing which we felt was a very progressive development, and is a signatory to the memorandum of understanding.  What that means on the ground is that if one of our inspectors goes into a workplace and sees something which is not directly within our mandate or remit, we have a one-on-one relationship and the inspector can say that he or she is not competent to deal with the matter but knows someone who is.  It is a very pragmatic, sensible working arrangement on the ground.<\/p> <p>  The HSA&rsquo;s programme for work in 2017 has identified 50 specific fishing inspections.  The focus of these inspections was on the management of health and safety of all crew on the vessel with particular reference to the presence of safety statements and risk assessments.  These are the mandatory requirements under the 2005 Act.  It is essentially a safety management system.  To assist in that, we have prepared guidance, which is in the awareness raising, that helps make it easy for the skipper to discharge.  This was distributed widely.<\/p> <p>  The 2017 inspection programme has to date resulted in 46 inspections, or 92% of programme.  Based on these inspections 52% of vessels inspected had a safety statement and risk assessment in place.  That does not sound terribly high but it is something of an improving trend.<\/p> <p>  The 2005 Act is applicable irrespective of vessel size and while no specific focus on vessel size was applied in the current programme, just over 60% of the vessels inspected were in excess of 15 m, so they would have been in the scope of the EEA programme.  Inspections have taken place in different locations around the country including Howth, Dunmore East, Kilmore Quay, Cahirciveen and Castletownbere.<\/p> <p>  A number of issues were identified.  Our approach is to identify and address these with the duty holder, in this case, the skipper or the owner and if he or she is willing to voluntarily agree compliance then we use that approach before we implement the regulatory legal enforcement instruments.  The issues identified included the absence on a safety statement, the risk assessment, training, understanding of English by non-Irish national crew members, and emergency plans.  During that programme it was interesting to note that the nationalities identified included Lithuanian, Polish, Egyptian, Czech Republic, Rumanian, Ukrainian, Latvian, Philippine and Indonesian, which I do not believe is an exhaustive list, but it includes both EEA and non-EEA members, the latter being Egyptian, Ukrainian, Philippine and Indonesian.<\/p> <p>  The presence of personal flotation devices was observed on all inspections.  That is positive from our perspective.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the vessels where a health and safety management system was absent or inadequate enforcement action was taken by inspectors in the form of written advice or issuing of formal enforcement notices.  Some 60% of the vessels has such enforcement actions taken.<\/p> <p>  We found there was a broad awareness among skippers of the role of the Health and Safety Authority.  However, there was some confusion flagged to our inspectors in relation to the respective roles of the HSA and the Marine Survey Office.  We would stress that the role of the authority is around worker safety and workplace safety practices, as in identification and risk assessment or, in other words, work practices rather than the architecture or construction of the vessel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin O'Halloran"},{"type":"speech","time":1505998800,"counter":913,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Halloran.

The MSO, of course, is responsible for health and safety at sea, to put it broadly, and for the safety of vessels, whereas the Health and Safety Authority is responsible for the workplace matters it defined earlier.  How does the Health and Safety Authority resolve with the MSO those issues when they arise?

When the new scheme came in and the WRC made an issue of visits to vessels to inform the owners and the employers of the new scheme, did it attempt in any way to talk to the workers, to inform them of their rights or to communicate those rights to them?  I suppose it is the same question in a roundabout way.  Had the WRC considered that this scheme covers workers as well as employers and whether the WRC could inform the workers of what they are entitled to?  Locating an Arabic translator in this country does not involve rocket science.  One could pick one up anywhere.  I do not mean that in a derogatory way but there are plenty of good people with strong linguistic skills who can speak both Arabic and English very well.  It is a matter of reaching out to inform these workers of their rights.  I would like the witnesses to expand a little on what they may have done, even if they could not speak to the workers directly, to give them some information about their rights.  Have the witnesses' organisations, particularly the WRC, made contact with any of the fishers who suffer exploitation?  Have they ever had contact with them, sat down in front of them, even through an interpreter, met them, seen them as real people and discussed their issues directly with them?<\/p> <p>  What I cannot get over - it struck me during the previous session as well - is the disparity between the evidence and the reports of the ITF versus the evidence from the industry and those before us.  The ITF seems to have been able to illustrate to us dozens of incidents of exploitation but no one else, including the industry and those present, seems to be able to match that.  Can the witnesses explain this disparity?  Is someone telling porkies or dreaming this up?  What is the problem?  Does the WRC have a sufficient number of inspectors to carry out its work in general?  The answer to that question might shed light on the situation.  Famously, someone once said that the Labour Relations Commission had fewer inspectors than there were dog inspectors in the country.  If the position has changed, has it changed sufficiently to allow the WRC to do its job properly in respect of workers' rights as well as employers' obligations?  How many inspectors does the WRC have and is the number sufficient to cover what is required?<\/p> <p>  Have the witnesses have ever found actual employment breaches and, if so - leaving aside what is in the documentation - how many?  I understand that logbooks and documentation are a confusing part of the fishing industry and often do not match up to what one would find in an office, on a factory floor or whatever.  That should not be the case but it is.

I did not go through what we do on an inspection because I curtailed my opening statement.  We interview the people on board.  While I take the Deputy's point on language difficulties, as Mr. Dooley stated, language has not been significantly restrictive on our activities.  Many employment rights follow through from decent paperwork, and if someone cannot show this, for example, that payslips are being issued, he or she cannot show that the minimum wage is being paid or that a host of other things are being done.  It is a very important part of the process that we establish and ensure employees get what they require and employers give this to them.  That is across a range of employments.  Our investigations involve a substantial process.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the number of inspectors.  I have 53 labour inspectors or whole-time equivalents on the books at the moment, with the figure rising to 57 if one includes Mr. Dooley and his managers.  There is probably not a public service manager who would say he or she has sufficient staff or resources.  We have had to cut our cloth in recent years in the context of the moratorium on public sector recruitment and so forth in terms of the number of people we have available to do the work.  That being said, we carry out more than 5,000 inspections per annum and do substantial compliance and follow-up.<\/p> <p>  As I stated, fulfilling our obligations under the memorandum of understanding has been an incredibly resource intensive activity for the Workplace Relations Commission.  We are talking about 170 workplaces which we have spent a large amount of our time inspecting.  That level of intensity, which we have sustained for two years, is not feasible in the longer term based on our current resources.  We will not stop inspecting fisheries vessels - that would be wrong - but we will not be able to maintain an inspection rate of 50% of the relevant fleet.  It should be said, however, that as we return for the second inspection, we see more compliance.  We narrow down and risk profile cases to go back to workplaces about which we have concerns.  That exercise takes place on land and at sea.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the discrepancy on figures, there is no baseline survey of how many non-EEA workers are working in the Irish fishing fleet.  An estimate done by the International Transport Workers Federation indicated there were roughly 1,500 non-EEA workers in the fleet.  Last year, the European Commission estimated, based on figures from the Central Statistics Office, that there were 1,500 non-local workers in the entire fishing fleet.  This figure covers every nationality other than Irish and would, therefore, include a substantial number of people from within the EEA.  The Commission's estimate was based on what it said were the best available official data, namely, CSO figures.  It had to extrapolate from a NACE code, which covered agriculture, forestry and fisheries.  The task force estimated, based on Marine Survey Office inspection data, that there were roughly 500 non-EEA workers at that time.  As members will be aware, slightly more than 200 employment permits have been applied for and issued.  The figures are very different.  In the course of our inspections, we found 29 non-EEA workers without employment permits or other rights to work.  These cases have been corrected or the individuals were informed at the time that they did not have a right to work in the State, absent the necessary consents.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Dooley will address the issues of meetings and briefings for employees during the information period in early 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#CC00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1505998800,"counter":970,"content":"<p>I also asked a question on language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017092100002#CC00600","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505998800,"counter":971,"content":"<p>On language, our website contains all basic employment rights literature in multiple languages.<\/p> <p>  The original educational visits were part of the inspection programme and were aimed primarily at trawler owners to bring them up to speed as to what was required and what we expected of them.

That is a matter of serious concern when, by her own admission, a minimum of 300 undocumented workers are operating in the industry.
