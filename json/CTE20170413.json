We are joined today by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Malachy Quinn, senior auditor.  We have received no apologies at this stage.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of last week's meetings on 6 April.  Are the minutes of last week's meeting agreed?  Agreed.  With regard to matters arising from the minutes, if members want to raise items under correspondence that they feel might be relevant to last week's meeting, we can do that.  We will come to correspondence in a moment.  We will move on to the next item on the agenda, item No. 3.  <\/p> <p>  We will deal with some of last week's meeting first.  We have some correspondence arising from last week's meetings but we will deal with it under matters arising.  We are all fully aware we had a meeting with a number of institutions from the third level sector and we are waiting for information back from most of them at this stage.  From UCC we are waiting on a number of things including its policy on intellectual property rights, the management of conflicts of interest, a note on the IMI transfer, retired staff on contract and financial assistance to students.  From the University of Limerick, we are waiting on items such as a note paid to the Revenue on sabbatical figures, details on non-Irish students, a note on the Mazars review and a note on the number of complaints leading to internal and external reports or settlement.  That follows on from the issue of whistleblowers.  We have received a response to our correspondence from Dundalk IT which is in our correspondence list this morning.  From Waterford Institute of Technology we are waiting for further information on the campus company FeedHenry.  We are awaiting details on staffing such as gender breakdown and details of full-time and part-time staff, further information on the library subscription service as well as implications of the delay to the Grangegorman development.  From NUIG among the things we are waiting for is information on procurement, gender and staffing, casualisation of staff contracts, and university shares as they relate to intellectual property.  We are also waiting for information from the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills on these matters.  <\/p> <p>  There are a lot of issues arising from our meetings in the last couple of weeks with the third level institutions.  We will give a little bit of time for the information to come back which hopefully will be over the next week.  When we are here again, we will have hopefully received responses to all the matters that we have raised with them at their meeting.  We will need to consider what action to take at that point.  Does anybody have any comment? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Deputy Cullinane and I have submitted to the Chairman a fairly comprehensive list of questions and issues that we believe need to be answered by the HEA but also by the Department of Education and Skills.

One of the issues we raised last week is the area of intellectual property and its commercialisation and the processes, procedures, oversight, conflicts of interest, the money in terms of revenues generated and who got what proportionately.  We proposed a special investigation and it is still my view that we need it.  We need to get under the bonnet of this.  One of the difficulties we have is that the Comptroller has the discretion and authority to audit the institutions but there is the issue of all of these spin-out companies.  We need to know what happens thereafter because the innovation in the first instance is incubated and financed by lots of public money.  As it is such an important sector in terms of job creation, it is really important that we get on top of that.  We had made a proposal.  Mr. McCarthy was not here last week but we made a proposal on a special report or some similar mechanism to explore that area.  I would be interested to hear what he has to say on that.<\/p> <p>  I have a third issue but I am happy to come back in on it.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#B00700","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>This issue was mentioned at the last meeting.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is familiar with the issue.  I think there is agreement on the committee.  A remark was made by Waterford IT on the return on investment for the State.  What will have to be established by somebody is what was the investment by the State.  It is a meaningless comment to make to us.  It is gratuitous to tell us about the return on investment when nobody has an idea what the actual investment was by way of the incubation unit, staff resources, facilities and equipment provided by the taxpayer in Waterford, direct grants from the HEA, grants, which we are aware of, probably from Enterprise Ireland, possibly training grants from European taxpayers and possibly a whole lot more.  We are in a position where we have no concept of what the State investment was for the relative shareholding it got at the end of the day.  We ultimately have to get to the bottom to know the State's investment.  The suggestion is that it is a broad issue in all of the colleges but the FeedHenry company is the one that has come to light.  We cannot direct the Comptroller and Auditor General to do a report but we can ask him to consider it.  He might consider it or give us his observations on it.  At this stage, we cannot pin him down for a definite answer.  One way or the other, the Committee of Public Accounts will not move away from this topic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#B00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>On FeedHenry specifically, the financial statements we are currently auditing of Waterford IT are the 2014-2015 year of account.  The FeedHenry disposal was in that period.  Therefore, we are examining the transaction as it relates to the financial statements currently.  The issues the Chairman has raised are perfectly valid.  I will have to consider whether it would be appropriate to do a special report.  It would have to be a value-for-money report on the disposal of FeedHenry.  For me, the issues that would arise if I decide to do that would be exactly what the Chairman has said, to look at it over time and to ask where it came from, how did it get to be intellectual property and how were the shares attributed and on what basis; that is the decision-making process around that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#B00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The Comptroller and Auditor General will need to treble his staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#B01000","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>He will need more staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#B01100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>That is obviously an issue.

A narrative has been spun by some since and questions have been asked about the commercialising of intellectual property.  It has been suggested that, as a committee, we do not really understand how all of this works.  There was a misunderstanding of the questions being put.  I can only speak for myself but I imagine for most member also.  The committee will agree that we made it very clear that spin-outs and the commercialising of intellectual property were good.  Taking advantage of research from institutes in creating jobs and companies, given the value such companies can have, not just for an institute but also for a wider catchment area is all good.  That is not in question.  Researchers and academics commercialising intellectual property is fine.<\/p><p>None of that was in doubt or was questioned.  What was being examined was at the point where a private company establishes contact with an institute to transfer the ownership or licence of its IP how the institute is protected, how conflicts of interest managed and all of the questions and issues raised by others.  All of that is fair and it is within our remit.<\/p><p> Following the meeting last week one of the witnesses to whom I put questions suggested he would rather resign than continue with that line of questioning because he felt it was damaging the institute.  That was followed up by a press statement from a Minister of State in the Department of Education and Skills inferring something similar and suggesting that the questions that were being put would have a destabilising effect on the institution and its joint application with the Carlow Institute of Technology to become a technological university.  There was also an inference from a number of parties that somehow the line of questioning of the witness in question from the Committee of Public Accounts and me was an attempt to damage the institute.  There was also a view that I was inferring that a crime had been committed by the president of the institute.  To be fair to you, Chairman, I wish to make it very clear that at every stage and every single hearing I stressed that I personally was not alleging any wrongdoing.  I make no apology for putting questions on process and procedures.  That is what we are here to do.  We have to put robust questions, as other members did of institutes in their constituencies as well.  It is not done to damage them but to strengthen them.  What we are here to do is to strengthen processes.  We cannot allow a situation where individuals try to pick off members of the PAC and we have seen that approach from other Ministers as well.  It is not good for the PAC and we must protect ourselves.<\/p><p> I have received a number of protected disclosures from people who worked in WIT as researchers and I have not put any of the allegations made into the public domain.  What I have done is given a synopsis of them to the Comptroller and Auditor General this morning.  I will also meet with the head of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to give him a similar synopsis.  That is following due process and doing what is appropriate.  The HEA is doing an external review of what was an internal examination of the management of conflicts of interest in WIT.

Even at that point in time, it will be over a year after their financial statements.  That is reasonable.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General and committee are in the same space on this.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might wish to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#E03000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":104,"content":"<p>We have been working very hard.

For instance, already the Trinity College accounts for 2015-2016 have been certified so that within six months the whole process is completed.

The white panel in the graphic is 12 months after the period of account and one can see that some of the financial statements do not come to us within 12 months.  One can also see the whole process, from us receiving the accounts to the accounts being signed off.  In relation to Trinity, it is done in a three-month period, and as I said, we have made progress even relative to that.

The analysis draws attention to the percentage of cases struck out because a summons was not served.  Nearly half of all cases are struck out for this reason and only about 25% of cases result in a conviction.  The last committee was informed in June 2015 that a criminal justice fixed charge working group was examining this matter and that at the time a number of recommendations from the Garda Inspectorate were to be followed up.  It is timely that we write to the Department of Justice and Equality for an update and observations on the analysis provided by PARC Road Safety Group.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will keep Deputy Broughan informed.  He has been working on this for some time with the group concerned.<\/p> <p>  No. 408C is correspondence dated 5 April 2017 from the chief executive of Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim Education and Training Board.  We have covered that as it is about the timeliness of the accounts.  We will note it.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 413C(i) and (ii) is correspondence dated 7 April 2017 from the Console liquidator company Friel Stafford regarding the situation for staff employed by Console which is now in liquidation.  We also have related correspondence, which is the next item No. 424C, from the Secretary General at the Department of Health.  It is on the same topic.  The letter from the liquidator contains facts and information about staff who worked for Console or people who were engaged by Console who have not been paid for their work.  We asked that the staff be paid.  We already had a letter from the HSE saying it was not its problem and that it had no legal obligation.  The letter from the liquidator states that there were 70 individuals who were referred to as staff, but 12 of them were direct employees and have been dealt with by the normal unpaid wages and redundancy payments of the Department of Social Protection.  Two did not submit applications, ten did submit applications, nine have been paid and one is getting their forms in now.  The 12 direct employees, therefore, are being dealt with by the State mechanism for their unpaid wages and entitlements.<\/p> <p>  The issue concerns the other 58.  These individuals were not direct employees of Console but were operating on a contract basis and submitted invoices.  They are listed by the liquidator as unsecured creditors.  We know that means they will get nothing at the end.  They might get a penny in the pound, as it were.<\/p><p>He gives us a detailed breakdown.  He met the 58 contractors and the 12 direct employees.  The 12 people have been dealt with.  He said most of the 58 contractors were offered employment and had taken it up.  They are now working with Pieta House.  He is also saying all he can do legally is treat them as unsecured creditors.  The letter from the Department is on the same topic.  We had the letter from the HSE previously.  It notes that contracts were offered to 52 people and that 47 took up contracts with Pieta House.  It notes that the Department hopes the outcome of the liquidation process will provide recompense.  That is wishful thinking.  It also notes that the Department considered the matter under the appropriation account.  It is sympathetic, but it can do nothing about it.<\/p><p> We cannot let this go.  We had representatives of Console before the committee.  We had the internal audit report carried out by the HSE before the committee last autumn.  The committee showed grave concern about the staff and the service they provided.  If we were to walk away from them at this stage, we would be shallow people.  That is all I have to say.  I do not know who has the legal entitlement to pay them.  Everybody says they do not have it.  The liquidator refers to unsecured creditors; the HSE states the matter is nothing to do with it, while the Department states it is sympathetic but can do nothing.<\/p><p> I propose that, in the first instance, we go back to the HSE.  I am putting some of the responsibility on it because it was aware of issues in Console for a long time.  It took an excessive and inordinate amount of time to produce its internal audit report.  It went down to check every bunch of flowers delivered and purchased on credit cards, knowing that the organisation carrying out the internal audit was a basket case and that there would be problems down the line.  Had it moved earlier to deal with the Console issue, the people in question would not be waiting for the money now.  It is going to quote legal matters and there is also the question of whether we should talk to Pieta House.  On that basis, the HSE is a contributory factor in the people concerned being left without money at the end of this process because it was negligent in doing its job of looking after the taxpayers' money it had given to Console.  I do not know what legal mechanism we can use.  Perhaps I am wrong to suggest it, but it has to use its imagination.  It gives grants to all sorts of people for all sorts of thing.  There is a legitimate case and it has to think outside the box in which it has been thinking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#F02300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Have the people involved received some payment?

There were three key elements to the response: a commission of inquiry to establish what occurred in the institutions; a redress scheme administered by the residential institution redress board to compensate former residents of the institutions for abuse they suffered; and a range of practical and social supports provided to former residents and their family members.<\/p><p>The structures put in place to account for the costs were varied and complex, with the result that it requires considerable effort to piece together the overall expenditure in any one year.  Because the work of the commission of inquiry and the redress board was almost complete at the end of 2015, I felt it would be useful, in parallel with the audits of the various 2015 annual financial statements, to compile an overview of the aggregate costs as at the end of 2015.  The report also provides information on the contributions towards the costs received from the religious institutions and seeks to identify lessons learned that may potentially assist in the event that it is decided in the future to establish further redress schemes.  We estimate that the final overall cost of investigating and responding to the abuse in the institutions will be of the order of &euro;1.5 billion.  By far the largest element, accounting for 82%, relates to the redress scheme.  The next largest element, at 12%, relates to the various supports provided for the former residents and their families.  The costs associated with the commission of inquiry which substantially completed its work in 2009 account for 5% of the total.  Awards and costs related to legal cases pursued by former residents through the courts instead of under the redress scheme make up the remaining 1%.  The religious congregations were indemnified against costs arising in such cases under a formal legal agreement they entered into with the Department of Education and Science in 2002.<\/p><p> The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was established in 2000 and the Department initially expected it to operate for two years at a forecasted cost of around &euro;2.5 million.  In the event, the final report of the commission which is often referred to as the Ryan report was published in May 2009 and the work of the commission cost an estimated &euro;82 million.  The redress scheme which was established in 2002 accounts for the largest element of the cost, at an estimated &euro;1.25 billion.  The original forecasted cost of the scheme was &euro;250 million.  My predecessor reported on deficiencies in the methods used by the Department in arriving at that estimate.  By the end of 2015, the redress board had made awards totalling &euro;970 million to 15,579 claimants, an average award of &euro;62,250.  Some 85% of the awards were at or below a level of &euro;100,000 per person.  The highest individual award made was &euro;300,000.  By 31 December 2015, the redress board had approved legal cost payments of &euro;193 million to 991 legal firms in respect of 15,345 applications.  A total of 17 legal firms were paid between &euro;1 million and &euro;5 million each, while seven were paid amounts between &euro;5 million and &euro;19 million each.<\/p><p> Outside of the redress scheme, a range of other supports were put in place by State bodies andthe religious congregations to assist the former residents of the institutions.  The overall spend on health, housing, educational and counselling services is estimated at &euro;176 million.  Since late 2013, the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board, better known as Caranua, has been providing support services for survivors paid for from cash contributed voluntarily by the religious congregations following the publication of the Ryan report in 2009.  Government policy was to pursue the sharing of the cost of redress on a 50:50 basis between the State and the 18 religious congregations.  The indemnity agreement signed in 2002 committed the congregations to contributing to the costs by transferring property, cash and other resources, totalling &euro;128 million.  Relative to the Department's then forecasted expenditure figure of &euro;250 million, this would have represented an approximate share of 50:50, but the congregations' legal commitment was capped under the terms of the agreement.  In the event, property assets comprehended by the indemnity agreement, valued at around &euro;21 million, still remained to be transferred to the State at the end of 2015.  Following publication of the Ryan report in 2009, the congregations offered additional cash and property, valued at &euro;353 million, but this was not legally enforceable.  The combined offer was revised down to &euro;226 million in September 2015.  Six years after the publication of the Ryan report, only &euro;85 million, or 38% of the remaining offer of &euro;226 million, had been received by the State.<\/p><p> To date, the congregations' combined commitments and offers represent the equivalent of about 23% of the overall expenditure in responding to child abuse in the institutions.  Contributions actually received from the congregations up to the end of 2015 represented about 13% of the cost.  Some further assets and cash were received during 2016 and the Accounting Officer will be able to brief the committee on the current position. <\/p><p> My report includes a number of process recommendations which have been accepted by the Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They include a recommendation that the Department should ensure a formal evaluation is carried out of the redress scheme so as to learn lessons for the future and assess the effectiveness of the supports provided for former residents and their dependants.  I am glad to note the agreement of the two Accounting Officers to these recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

Indirect legal costs of &euro;2 million were incurred by the Department as a respondent to the inquiry. \r\n\r\nThe report identifies other expenditure under the redress umbrella, including the funding of &euro;12.7 million provided to the now dissolved Education Finance Board, a maximum of &euro;110 million that has been allocated to Caranua, &euro;10 million in support for counselling, and &euro;42 million in funding provided by the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health and the HSE for survivor support groups and family tracing.\r\n\r\nTurning to the issue of contributions from the religious congregations that managed institutions, there are two separate rounds of such contributions - the 2002 indemnity agreement and the 2009 voluntary offers.  The 2002 indemnity agreement between the State and the 18 participating religious congregations that managed the institutions provided for a collective contribution by the congregations of &euro;128 million in cash, counselling services and property.  This committee has previously examined a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the agreement and published its own detailed report on the matter.  \r\n\r\nThe cash contributions of &euro;54.42 million under the agreement have been received, while information has been provided to the Department that confirms that counselling services in excess of the &euro;10 million provided for in the agreement have been funded directly by the contributing congregations. \r\n\r\nWith regard to property, the Department agreed in principle that a total of 64 properties would be accepted under the agreement subject to good and marketable title and agreed valuations.  This number was reduced to 61 when the Department accepted and received a cash sum in lieu of three properties where good and marketable title could not be established.  A total of 50 properties have been fully transferred.  These properties are valued at &euro;48.47 million in total.  When combined with the cash and counselling contributions referred to above, a total of &euro;112.9 million, representing 88% of the amount provided for in the agreement, has been received.  Work to complete the outstanding property transfers is actively progressing.  In most of the remaining cases the transfer process is at a very advanced stage.  Most of the properties are already in use by the intended recipients. \r\n\r\nIn response to calls by Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for further substantial contributions towards the costs of redress made in the aftermath of the publication of Ryan report, many of the congregations that were party to the 2002 indemnity agreement made offers which, in total, were valued at &euro;352.6 million.  These offers are voluntary and do not form part of any agreement. \r\n\r\nOne significant element of the most recent offer, relating to playing fields and associated lands, valued at &euro;127 million, was withdrawn by the Christian Brothers.  When this is combined with some changes in the valuation of properties previously offered, the exclusion of certain property offers and other offers not being reckoned as contributions, the total value of the voluntary offers currently in place stands at &euro;193 million, of which contributions of cash and property amounting to some &euro;97 million, or 51%, have been realised.  The value of the additional property that I mentioned earlier is not included in this amount as a valuation as of the date of transfer has yet to be provided.  The remaining cash offered is expected to be fully contributed or appropriately reckoned by 2018.  A number of property transfers have been fully completed and the remaining transfers are progressing. \r\n\r\nWhen the contributions provided for in the 2002 indemnity agreement are combined with the subsequent voluntary offers, the maximum total contribution that is expected to be realised stands at &euro;321 million, of which amount &euro;210 million, or 66%, has been received.  It has been the position of successive Governments that the religious congregations should commit to making further substantial contributions towards the cost of abuse.  Having regard to the work of the independent panel's report, the Government adopted a position that the congregations had the resources to bring their contribution over time to 50% of the then estimated costs.  Based on a maximum total contribution of &euro;321 million, there is a shortfall of some &euro;429 million in advance of achieving a 50% share.  The congregations have never accepted the 50% principle and have refused further requests to augment their contributions. \r\n\r\nThe recommendations set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report have been accepted and the Department will be progressing them.  Recommendation 1.4, which recommends that the Department actively pursues the outstanding balance agreed under the indemnity agreement, is particularly important.  I can assure the committee that the Department is actively engaging with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office, whichliaises with solicitors for the congregations and the HSE, in order to bring this about. \r\n\r\nCaranua was established under the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012 to utilise up to &euro;110 million in contributions offered in the aftermath of the publication of the Ryan report to help meet the needs of former residents.  While Caranua is a body under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills, it is independent and operates under its own board. \r\n\r\nThe Department has provided support to Caranua since its establishment and exercises an oversight role applicable to statutory bodies with a view to ensuring that the organisation operates in an efficient and effective manner and in accordance with the legislation and the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.  The Department is in regular contact with Caranua to discuss progress and performance and related governance issues.  Caranua's annual reports and financial statements for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 have been presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is understood that the draft 2016 accounts are currently in preparation. \r\n\r\nThe Statement on Internal Financial Control that formed part of Caranua&rsquo;s accounts for both 2014 and 2015, and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s certificate to both sets of accounts, identified a number of potential weaknesses in Caranua&rsquo;s payments processes.  An explanation was sought from Caranua in regard to these matters and a report was recently received.  The report notes the context under which the control weaknesses emerged.  These related primarily to the fact that Caranua was in a start-up situation and that it took time to have appropriate staffing resources, systems and procedures in place.  In addition, in striving to meet the needs and expectations of applicants in a compassionate and person-centred manner, Caranua is challenged to meet sometimes very stringent control requirements.  The Caranua report also sets out the response to the various issues raised and notes the measures taken to address the weaknesses identified, which it regards as being legacy issues.  The report also notes the position in regard to the recommendations set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s management letter for 2014 and 2015.  The Department has noted the responses of Caranua and the measures being taken to address the potential weaknesses and risks that have been identified.  It will continue to work with Caranua to ensure that an appropriate control framework is in place. \r\n\r\nI thank the members for the opportunity to address the committee.

I hope the witnesses have read the conclusions and I hope Caranua has read them.  There are 43 conclusions and recommendations.  The report is enormous.  I am going to ask if the Department has changed its attitude.  From the 2002 indemnity, there is still money outstanding 14 years later.

They must ask themselves how they came to tolerate breaches of their own rules and, when sexual and physical abuse was discovered, how they responded to it, and to those who perpetrated it.  They must examine their attitude to neglect and emotional abuse and, more generally, how the interests of the institutions and the Congregations came to be placed ahead of those of the children who were in their care.<\/blockquote> <p>It is very important to place this in context.

I am not personally accountable for that to this committee, however, I do see what the Deputy is saying in terms of the joined-up nature of the impact and the role of the State in relation to all of these.  In each case the State engaged with the people who had been in the various places.  For example, in the Magdalen laundries there was the McAleese report which was followed by Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendations.  The State worked that through.  On the commission on mother and baby homes, we are all finding the horrific nature of what went on very difficult to see as we learn about it on the news and in official meetings.  That is why the Government has established a commission.  I would not say that the State is avoiding dealing with these, but I would say that it is not my responsibility to talk about the role of the State here in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#N04600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":335,"content":"<p>It is Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;'s role to talk about the Department of Education and Skills.

The board's financial statements before the committee in this session are for the financial years 2014 and 2015.  Caranua is responsible under 2012 Act for managing and disbursing funds donated by religious congregations to support the needs of former residents of residential institutions.  No Exchequer sourced funds are involved.  The Act provides for the donated funds to be used to pay grants to former residents for certain approved services, that is, housing support services, health and well-being services and education, learning and development services.    <\/p> <p>  Following the publication of the Ryan report in 2009, the religious congregations offered cash contributions that totalled a combined &euro;110 million, in addition to cash contributions committed to and paid over under the terms of the 2002 indemnity agreement.  By the end of December 2015, &euro;85 million of the total of &euro;110 million had been received into the special fund and some interest had also been earned on the balances held.  <\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of Caranua's financial statements for 2014 and 2015.  However, for both years, the audit report draws attention to the statement on internal financial control which discloses weaknesses in the board's controls over grant payments.  The concern was that these weaknesses created a risk that grant expenditure might not have been used for the proposes intended in at least some cases.  For example, for 2015, Caranua could not provide evidence that price quotations had been obtained in advance in about one third of a sample of grant applications examined in the audit.  Claimants for housing related support grants had provided proof of property tenancy or ownership in only one third of a sample of cases examined in the audit and required follow up by Caranua such as the collection of receipts for grant funded work or purchases which had been completed for only around 15% of the grants paid.  The statement on internal financial control sets out the steps being taken by the board to resolve the control weaknesses identified.  The adequacy of the controls will be examined again in the audit of the 2016 financial statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#X00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":704,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Higgins of Caranua to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#X00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend to review with them our financial statements for 2014 and 2015 and giving me the opportunity to make a short opening statement.  By way of context, I will give a brief overview of Caranua, its aims and application process.  Caranua was established, as the Chairman said, under 2012 legislation to manage a fund of &euro;110 million to support the needs of survivors of institutional abuse, people who had been placed in the care of State as children and experienced neglect and abuse in these institutions which had been managed by religious congregations on behalf of the State.  The damaging effects of this experience are lifelong and while most survivors have led fulfilling lives, the lives of many others have been limited in multiple ways because of what they endured as children.<\/p> <p>  In setting out to design a service for survivors we aimed to base it on their expressed needs and preferences and what was known about the effects of adverse childhood experiences and how they could be addressed.  This approach was helped by our having four survivors on the board.  We also consulted about 200 individuals in Ireland and England during 2013.  It was clear that the majority of survivors were ageing and that very many of them were disadvantaged educationally and in other ways and would find it difficult to engage with a service that was in any way bureaucratic or rigid.  It was with these survivors in mind that we designed our application process on the principle that if it worked for the most vulnerable, it would work for everyone.  Our central aim was, and is, to put survivors at the heart of everything we did.  Our application process is values-based, needs-led and person-centred.<\/p><p>It is broken into different stages.  When an applicant is ready to apply for services, he or she is appointed a dedicated adviser to provide support, advice and information in making an application to Caranua and, as necessary, make referrals to and-or advocate with other organisations for other services.  We try to ensure there are no barriers for someone in applying to us and we pay particular attention to ensuring our application and other information materials are accessible.  All are in plain English.  We have easy-to-read versions and short films on our website.  We organise a number of outreach events every year at which applicants and potential applicants can come to meet advisers and other staff face to face.  We hold a monthly clinic with interpreting services in Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#X00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Higgins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":707,"content":"<p>This is not the same as the written statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#Y00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":708,"content":"<p>It is not substantially different.

These staff were carefully selected for their skills, experience and attitudes.  They are professionally qualified and experienced in the areas related to their responsibilities.  The work of Caranua is complex and an intensive induction programme, with ongoing skills development and opportunities for internal supervision and external support, is available for all staff.<\/p> <p>  We work hard to deliver a good service, but we do not get it right all of the time.  The comments made by the Comptroller and Auditor General are completely warranted.  Our systems were imperfect.  We accept the recommendations made and are in the process of implementing them, as reported in our briefing document.  <\/p> <p>  We faced a number of significant challenges in achieving good practice standards and controls.  For very good reasons, we got started quickly and organisation processes and systems have been retrofitted over time.  We are trying to balance the requirements of care and compliance.  In considering how best to do this we have concluded that having a range of direct contracts with preferred suppliers, whereby Caranua will contract directly with them for specified services, is the best way forward.  All financial transactions are between us and the supplier and there is no need for applicants to get quotes and obtain receipts.  Since the beginning of the year, we have in place a contract with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, for example, whereby it will do the work it does in terms of energy efficiency for applicants who apply to us in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Caranua is, by definition, a limited fund.

In the interim we will continue to deliver services to survivors and work to support other community-based and specialist services to recognise and respond effectively to the needs of survivors in order that they can be cared for beyond the life of Caranua at home and not in institutions.

What we are planning to do over the coming years is to work more closely with mainstream service providers and specialist services to ensure that there is an awareness of early childhood trauma and the effects that has for the rest of people's lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#Z00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Higgins"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":735,"content":"<p>Does Ms Higgins accept that she said: \"You can't control people's experience of what we do for them\", some clients \"will never be happy\" and grievances \"suit such a narrative\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#Z00500","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":736,"content":"<p>I think Deputy Madigan is referring to an article from <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#Z00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Higgins"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":737,"content":"<p>I am just asking Ms Higgins if she made those comments about the claimants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#Z00700","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":738,"content":"<p>Not exactly.

It is the background to what we are discussing now, as it is to the redress board, which we discussed this morning.  This is important for survivors because sometimes a blaming attitude comes across from institutions generally.  During our earlier session, I read into the record some of the conclusions of that report, including that the deferential and submissive attitude of the Department of Education and Skills towards the congregations compromised its ability to carry out its statutory duty and so on.  I do not believe that applies only to the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the congregations, one of the many recommendations is that they examine how their ideals became debased by systemic abuse, how they came to tolerate breaches of their own rules, and when sexual and physical abuse was discovered, how they responded to it and those who perpetrated it.  It is important to reiterate that the congregations were specifically asked to examine their attitude to neglect and emotional abuse and, more generally, how the interests of the institutions and the congregations came to be placed ahead of those of the children who were in their care.  Leaving aside the specifics of that recommendation, there is always a danger that an institution will become more important, particularly so in the case of Caranua.<\/p><p>It is a big challenge to ensure the institution does not become more important than what it was set up to do.

Our statistics show that since we started that in 2015, we have had 154 complaints.  Our mechanism has three stages - one is where it gets sorted out where the complaint arose; two is where a manager is involved; and three is where it goes to internal investigation.  We have had five internal investigations.  Relative to the number of transactions and activities that occur within the organisation, there are few complaints.  That is not to say there might be people who are dissatisfied but if they do not come to us, we will not get to hear about it and we are then unable to do anything about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#SS01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Higgins"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":1160,"content":"<p>This is back to consultation.

On page 6 of the briefing note that Ms Higgins provided, there is table 1 and I ask if it could be put up on screen.  I want to raise an issue that is important in terms of doing a look back exercise which, unfortunately for us, is all that we can do.  It has been acknowledged that the level of the service for survivors was poor and appalling in the past and, for them, this adds insult to injury.  We need to make sure that mistakes are not made in the future in terms of any organisation.  There is a pattern here when we see what is revealed by a look back exercise.  From table 1 we can see that the audited accounts for 2014 show that the cost of salaries and wages was &euro;791,000, that figure increased to &euro;1.3 million in 2015 and to &euro;1.492 million in 2016 and it is now at its highest in 2016.  When we note the volume of work which is set out underneath, it shows there was much more activity going on in 2015 than there was in 2016.  At a time when the number of people applying for the service, the number of applications to be  processed, the number of telephone calls received and so on are reducing, staffing costs have increased.  It strikes me that we have gone the wrong away around on this.  At a time when staff were needed, we did not have them and now when the service is starting to be scaled down, the cost of staff salaries is at its highest.  Can Ms Higgins see that problem in the first instance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#TT02500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":1240,"content":"<p>We had a backlog in the beginning and we are only getting to the point now of getting on top of that.

I am not necessarily blaming Ms Higgins for this, it goes back to points that were made earlier.  I suggest that again this is another botched job.  We do things backwards.

I do not wish to interfere with any board decision, but I would like to see decisions based on some evidence that a fund is in trouble, which it is not, and a justification for a change in policy on a number of occasions, I believe, retrospectively.  However, I take Ms Higgins' word that it was not retrospective and that it did not happen, but there were different changes of policy over a number of years.  How is that communicated to the applicants who believe their needs have not been met, despite having received a payment or two or more?  There was no policy in the beginning.  Applicants came forward and their needs were met in respect of the initial application.  They then came forward with others.  At some stage, Caranua's policy changed and officials decided that they were in trouble and would limit the money, notwithstanding the fact that the number of applicants was reducing and there was &euro;50 million in a fund, presumably plus interest as a result of investments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#YY01800","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":1572,"content":"<p>We do not want to end up with a surplus.

The winning design followed a protracted international competition but the memorial committee considered that only one of the designs submitted was suitable to be built.  There was no need for a second round and no other design was even ranked in second place.
