We are joined today by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Malachy Quinn, senior auditor.  We have received no apologies at this stage.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of last week's meetings on 6 April.  Are the minutes of last week's meeting agreed?  Agreed.  With regard to matters arising from the minutes, if members want to raise items under correspondence that they feel might be relevant to last week's meeting, we can do that.  We will come to correspondence in a moment.  We will move on to the next item on the agenda, item No. 3.  <\/p> <p>  We will deal with some of last week's meeting first.  We have some correspondence arising from last week's meetings but we will deal with it under matters arising.  We are all fully aware we had a meeting with a number of institutions from the third level sector and we are waiting for information back from most of them at this stage.  From UCC we are waiting on a number of things including its policy on intellectual property rights, the management of conflicts of interest, a note on the IMI transfer, retired staff on contract and financial assistance to students.  From the University of Limerick, we are waiting on items such as a note paid to the Revenue on sabbatical figures, details on non-Irish students, a note on the Mazars review and a note on the number of complaints leading to internal and external reports or settlement.  That follows on from the issue of whistleblowers.  We have received a response to our correspondence from Dundalk IT which is in our correspondence list this morning.  From Waterford Institute of Technology we are waiting for further information on the campus company FeedHenry.  We are awaiting details on staffing such as gender breakdown and details of full-time and part-time staff, further information on the library subscription service as well as implications of the delay to the Grangegorman development.  From NUIG among the things we are waiting for is information on procurement, gender and staffing, casualisation of staff contracts, and university shares as they relate to intellectual property.  We are also waiting for information from the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills on these matters.  <\/p> <p>  There are a lot of issues arising from our meetings in the last couple of weeks with the third level institutions.  We will give a little bit of time for the information to come back which hopefully will be over the next week.  When we are here again, we will have hopefully received responses to all the matters that we have raised with them at their meeting.  We will need to consider what action to take at that point.  Does anybody have any comment? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Deputy Cullinane and I have submitted to the Chairman a fairly comprehensive list of questions and issues that we believe need to be answered by the HEA but also by the Department of Education and Skills.

One of the issues we raised last week is the area of intellectual property and its commercialisation and the processes, procedures, oversight, conflicts of interest, the money in terms of revenues generated and who got what proportionately.  We proposed a special investigation and it is still my view that we need it.  We need to get under the bonnet of this.  One of the difficulties we have is that the Comptroller has the discretion and authority to audit the institutions but there is the issue of all of these spin-out companies.  We need to know what happens thereafter because the innovation in the first instance is incubated and financed by lots of public money.  As it is such an important sector in terms of job creation, it is really important that we get on top of that.  We had made a proposal.  Mr. McCarthy was not here last week but we made a proposal on a special report or some similar mechanism to explore that area.  I would be interested to hear what he has to say on that.<\/p> <p>  I have a third issue but I am happy to come back in on it.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#B00700","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>This issue was mentioned at the last meeting.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is familiar with the issue.  I think there is agreement on the committee.  A remark was made by Waterford IT on the return on investment for the State.  What will have to be established by somebody is what was the investment by the State.  It is a meaningless comment to make to us.  It is gratuitous to tell us about the return on investment when nobody has an idea what the actual investment was by way of the incubation unit, staff resources, facilities and equipment provided by the taxpayer in Waterford, direct grants from the HEA, grants, which we are aware of, probably from Enterprise Ireland, possibly training grants from European taxpayers and possibly a whole lot more.  We are in a position where we have no concept of what the State investment was for the relative shareholding it got at the end of the day.  We ultimately have to get to the bottom to know the State's investment.  The suggestion is that it is a broad issue in all of the colleges but the FeedHenry company is the one that has come to light.  We cannot direct the Comptroller and Auditor General to do a report but we can ask him to consider it.  He might consider it or give us his observations on it.  At this stage, we cannot pin him down for a definite answer.  One way or the other, the Committee of Public Accounts will not move away from this topic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#B00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>On FeedHenry specifically, the financial statements we are currently auditing of Waterford IT are the 2014-2015 year of account.  The FeedHenry disposal was in that period.  Therefore, we are examining the transaction as it relates to the financial statements currently.  The issues the Chairman has raised are perfectly valid.  I will have to consider whether it would be appropriate to do a special report.  It would have to be a value-for-money report on the disposal of FeedHenry.  For me, the issues that would arise if I decide to do that would be exactly what the Chairman has said, to look at it over time and to ask where it came from, how did it get to be intellectual property and how were the shares attributed and on what basis; that is the decision-making process around that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#B00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The Comptroller and Auditor General will need to treble his staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#B01000","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>He will need more staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#B01100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>That is obviously an issue.

A narrative has been spun by some since and questions have been asked about the commercialising of intellectual property.  It has been suggested that, as a committee, we do not really understand how all of this works.  There was a misunderstanding of the questions being put.  I can only speak for myself but I imagine for most member also.  The committee will agree that we made it very clear that spin-outs and the commercialising of intellectual property were good.  Taking advantage of research from institutes in creating jobs and companies, given the value such companies can have, not just for an institute but also for a wider catchment area is all good.  That is not in question.  Researchers and academics commercialising intellectual property is fine.<\/p><p>None of that was in doubt or was questioned.  What was being examined was at the point where a private company establishes contact with an institute to transfer the ownership or licence of its IP how the institute is protected, how conflicts of interest managed and all of the questions and issues raised by others.  All of that is fair and it is within our remit.<\/p><p> Following the meeting last week one of the witnesses to whom I put questions suggested he would rather resign than continue with that line of questioning because he felt it was damaging the institute.  That was followed up by a press statement from a Minister of State in the Department of Education and Skills inferring something similar and suggesting that the questions that were being put would have a destabilising effect on the institution and its joint application with the Carlow Institute of Technology to become a technological university.  There was also an inference from a number of parties that somehow the line of questioning of the witness in question from the Committee of Public Accounts and me was an attempt to damage the institute.  There was also a view that I was inferring that a crime had been committed by the president of the institute.  To be fair to you, Chairman, I wish to make it very clear that at every stage and every single hearing I stressed that I personally was not alleging any wrongdoing.  I make no apology for putting questions on process and procedures.  That is what we are here to do.  We have to put robust questions, as other members did of institutes in their constituencies as well.  It is not done to damage them but to strengthen them.  What we are here to do is to strengthen processes.  We cannot allow a situation where individuals try to pick off members of the PAC and we have seen that approach from other Ministers as well.  It is not good for the PAC and we must protect ourselves.<\/p><p> I have received a number of protected disclosures from people who worked in WIT as researchers and I have not put any of the allegations made into the public domain.  What I have done is given a synopsis of them to the Comptroller and Auditor General this morning.  I will also meet with the head of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to give him a similar synopsis.  That is following due process and doing what is appropriate.  The HEA is doing an external review of what was an internal examination of the management of conflicts of interest in WIT.

Even at that point in time, it will be over a year after their financial statements.  That is reasonable.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General and committee are in the same space on this.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might wish to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#E03000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":104,"content":"<p>We have been working very hard.

For instance, already the Trinity College accounts for 2015-2016 have been certified so that within six months the whole process is completed.

The white panel in the graphic is 12 months after the period of account and one can see that some of the financial statements do not come to us within 12 months.  One can also see the whole process, from us receiving the accounts to the accounts being signed off.  In relation to Trinity, it is done in a three-month period, and as I said, we have made progress even relative to that.

The analysis draws attention to the percentage of cases struck out because a summons was not served.  Nearly half of all cases are struck out for this reason and only about 25% of cases result in a conviction.  The last committee was informed in June 2015 that a criminal justice fixed charge working group was examining this matter and that at the time a number of recommendations from the Garda Inspectorate were to be followed up.  It is timely that we write to the Department of Justice and Equality for an update and observations on the analysis provided by PARC Road Safety Group.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will keep Deputy Broughan informed.  He has been working on this for some time with the group concerned.<\/p> <p>  No. 408C is correspondence dated 5 April 2017 from the chief executive of Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim Education and Training Board.  We have covered that as it is about the timeliness of the accounts.  We will note it.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 413C(i) and (ii) is correspondence dated 7 April 2017 from the Console liquidator company Friel Stafford regarding the situation for staff employed by Console which is now in liquidation.  We also have related correspondence, which is the next item No. 424C, from the Secretary General at the Department of Health.  It is on the same topic.  The letter from the liquidator contains facts and information about staff who worked for Console or people who were engaged by Console who have not been paid for their work.  We asked that the staff be paid.  We already had a letter from the HSE saying it was not its problem and that it had no legal obligation.  The letter from the liquidator states that there were 70 individuals who were referred to as staff, but 12 of them were direct employees and have been dealt with by the normal unpaid wages and redundancy payments of the Department of Social Protection.  Two did not submit applications, ten did submit applications, nine have been paid and one is getting their forms in now.  The 12 direct employees, therefore, are being dealt with by the State mechanism for their unpaid wages and entitlements.<\/p> <p>  The issue concerns the other 58.  These individuals were not direct employees of Console but were operating on a contract basis and submitted invoices.  They are listed by the liquidator as unsecured creditors.  We know that means they will get nothing at the end.  They might get a penny in the pound, as it were.<\/p><p>He gives us a detailed breakdown.  He met the 58 contractors and the 12 direct employees.  The 12 people have been dealt with.  He said most of the 58 contractors were offered employment and had taken it up.  They are now working with Pieta House.  He is also saying all he can do legally is treat them as unsecured creditors.  The letter from the Department is on the same topic.  We had the letter from the HSE previously.  It notes that contracts were offered to 52 people and that 47 took up contracts with Pieta House.  It notes that the Department hopes the outcome of the liquidation process will provide recompense.  That is wishful thinking.  It also notes that the Department considered the matter under the appropriation account.  It is sympathetic, but it can do nothing about it.<\/p><p> We cannot let this go.  We had representatives of Console before the committee.  We had the internal audit report carried out by the HSE before the committee last autumn.  The committee showed grave concern about the staff and the service they provided.  If we were to walk away from them at this stage, we would be shallow people.  That is all I have to say.  I do not know who has the legal entitlement to pay them.  Everybody says they do not have it.  The liquidator refers to unsecured creditors; the HSE states the matter is nothing to do with it, while the Department states it is sympathetic but can do nothing.<\/p><p> I propose that, in the first instance, we go back to the HSE.  I am putting some of the responsibility on it because it was aware of issues in Console for a long time.  It took an excessive and inordinate amount of time to produce its internal audit report.  It went down to check every bunch of flowers delivered and purchased on credit cards, knowing that the organisation carrying out the internal audit was a basket case and that there would be problems down the line.  Had it moved earlier to deal with the Console issue, the people in question would not be waiting for the money now.  It is going to quote legal matters and there is also the question of whether we should talk to Pieta House.  On that basis, the HSE is a contributory factor in the people concerned being left without money at the end of this process because it was negligent in doing its job of looking after the taxpayers' money it had given to Console.  I do not know what legal mechanism we can use.  Perhaps I am wrong to suggest it, but it has to use its imagination.  It gives grants to all sorts of people for all sorts of thing.  There is a legitimate case and it has to think outside the box in which it has been thinking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#F02300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Have the people involved received some payment?

There were three key elements to the response: a commission of inquiry to establish what occurred in the institutions; a redress scheme administered by the residential institution redress board to compensate former residents of the institutions for abuse they suffered; and a range of practical and social supports provided to former residents and their family members.<\/p><p>The structures put in place to account for the costs were varied and complex, with the result that it requires considerable effort to piece together the overall expenditure in any one year.  Because the work of the commission of inquiry and the redress board was almost complete at the end of 2015, I felt it would be useful, in parallel with the audits of the various 2015 annual financial statements, to compile an overview of the aggregate costs as at the end of 2015.  The report also provides information on the contributions towards the costs received from the religious institutions and seeks to identify lessons learned that may potentially assist in the event that it is decided in the future to establish further redress schemes.  We estimate that the final overall cost of investigating and responding to the abuse in the institutions will be of the order of &euro;1.5 billion.  By far the largest element, accounting for 82%, relates to the redress scheme.  The next largest element, at 12%, relates to the various supports provided for the former residents and their families.  The costs associated with the commission of inquiry which substantially completed its work in 2009 account for 5% of the total.  Awards and costs related to legal cases pursued by former residents through the courts instead of under the redress scheme make up the remaining 1%.  The religious congregations were indemnified against costs arising in such cases under a formal legal agreement they entered into with the Department of Education and Science in 2002.<\/p><p> The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was established in 2000 and the Department initially expected it to operate for two years at a forecasted cost of around &euro;2.5 million.  In the event, the final report of the commission which is often referred to as the Ryan report was published in May 2009 and the work of the commission cost an estimated &euro;82 million.  The redress scheme which was established in 2002 accounts for the largest element of the cost, at an estimated &euro;1.25 billion.  The original forecasted cost of the scheme was &euro;250 million.  My predecessor reported on deficiencies in the methods used by the Department in arriving at that estimate.  By the end of 2015, the redress board had made awards totalling &euro;970 million to 15,579 claimants, an average award of &euro;62,250.  Some 85% of the awards were at or below a level of &euro;100,000 per person.  The highest individual award made was &euro;300,000.  By 31 December 2015, the redress board had approved legal cost payments of &euro;193 million to 991 legal firms in respect of 15,345 applications.  A total of 17 legal firms were paid between &euro;1 million and &euro;5 million each, while seven were paid amounts between &euro;5 million and &euro;19 million each.<\/p><p> Outside of the redress scheme, a range of other supports were put in place by State bodies andthe religious congregations to assist the former residents of the institutions.  The overall spend on health, housing, educational and counselling services is estimated at &euro;176 million.  Since late 2013, the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board, better known as Caranua, has been providing support services for survivors paid for from cash contributed voluntarily by the religious congregations following the publication of the Ryan report in 2009.  Government policy was to pursue the sharing of the cost of redress on a 50:50 basis between the State and the 18 religious congregations.  The indemnity agreement signed in 2002 committed the congregations to contributing to the costs by transferring property, cash and other resources, totalling &euro;128 million.  Relative to the Department's then forecasted expenditure figure of &euro;250 million, this would have represented an approximate share of 50:50, but the congregations' legal commitment was capped under the terms of the agreement.  In the event, property assets comprehended by the indemnity agreement, valued at around &euro;21 million, still remained to be transferred to the State at the end of 2015.  Following publication of the Ryan report in 2009, the congregations offered additional cash and property, valued at &euro;353 million, but this was not legally enforceable.  The combined offer was revised down to &euro;226 million in September 2015.  Six years after the publication of the Ryan report, only &euro;85 million, or 38% of the remaining offer of &euro;226 million, had been received by the State.<\/p><p> To date, the congregations' combined commitments and offers represent the equivalent of about 23% of the overall expenditure in responding to child abuse in the institutions.  Contributions actually received from the congregations up to the end of 2015 represented about 13% of the cost.  Some further assets and cash were received during 2016 and the Accounting Officer will be able to brief the committee on the current position. <\/p><p> My report includes a number of process recommendations which have been accepted by the Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They include a recommendation that the Department should ensure a formal evaluation is carried out of the redress scheme so as to learn lessons for the future and assess the effectiveness of the supports provided for former residents and their dependants.  I am glad to note the agreement of the two Accounting Officers to these recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

Indirect legal costs of &euro;2 million were incurred by the Department as a respondent to the inquiry. \r\n\r\nThe report identifies other expenditure under the redress umbrella, including the funding of &euro;12.7 million provided to the now dissolved Education Finance Board, a maximum of &euro;110 million that has been allocated to Caranua, &euro;10 million in support for counselling, and &euro;42 million in funding provided by the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health and the HSE for survivor support groups and family tracing.\r\n\r\nTurning to the issue of contributions from the religious congregations that managed institutions, there are two separate rounds of such contributions - the 2002 indemnity agreement and the 2009 voluntary offers.  The 2002 indemnity agreement between the State and the 18 participating religious congregations that managed the institutions provided for a collective contribution by the congregations of &euro;128 million in cash, counselling services and property.  This committee has previously examined a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the agreement and published its own detailed report on the matter.  \r\n\r\nThe cash contributions of &euro;54.42 million under the agreement have been received, while information has been provided to the Department that confirms that counselling services in excess of the &euro;10 million provided for in the agreement have been funded directly by the contributing congregations. \r\n\r\nWith regard to property, the Department agreed in principle that a total of 64 properties would be accepted under the agreement subject to good and marketable title and agreed valuations.  This number was reduced to 61 when the Department accepted and received a cash sum in lieu of three properties where good and marketable title could not be established.  A total of 50 properties have been fully transferred.  These properties are valued at &euro;48.47 million in total.  When combined with the cash and counselling contributions referred to above, a total of &euro;112.9 million, representing 88% of the amount provided for in the agreement, has been received.  Work to complete the outstanding property transfers is actively progressing.  In most of the remaining cases the transfer process is at a very advanced stage.  Most of the properties are already in use by the intended recipients. \r\n\r\nIn response to calls by Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for further substantial contributions towards the costs of redress made in the aftermath of the publication of Ryan report, many of the congregations that were party to the 2002 indemnity agreement made offers which, in total, were valued at &euro;352.6 million.  These offers are voluntary and do not form part of any agreement. \r\n\r\nOne significant element of the most recent offer, relating to playing fields and associated lands, valued at &euro;127 million, was withdrawn by the Christian Brothers.  When this is combined with some changes in the valuation of properties previously offered, the exclusion of certain property offers and other offers not being reckoned as contributions, the total value of the voluntary offers currently in place stands at &euro;193 million, of which contributions of cash and property amounting to some &euro;97 million, or 51%, have been realised.  The value of the additional property that I mentioned earlier is not included in this amount as a valuation as of the date of transfer has yet to be provided.  The remaining cash offered is expected to be fully contributed or appropriately reckoned by 2018.  A number of property transfers have been fully completed and the remaining transfers are progressing. \r\n\r\nWhen the contributions provided for in the 2002 indemnity agreement are combined with the subsequent voluntary offers, the maximum total contribution that is expected to be realised stands at &euro;321 million, of which amount &euro;210 million, or 66%, has been received.  It has been the position of successive Governments that the religious congregations should commit to making further substantial contributions towards the cost of abuse.  Having regard to the work of the independent panel's report, the Government adopted a position that the congregations had the resources to bring their contribution over time to 50% of the then estimated costs.  Based on a maximum total contribution of &euro;321 million, there is a shortfall of some &euro;429 million in advance of achieving a 50% share.  The congregations have never accepted the 50% principle and have refused further requests to augment their contributions. \r\n\r\nThe recommendations set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report have been accepted and the Department will be progressing them.  Recommendation 1.4, which recommends that the Department actively pursues the outstanding balance agreed under the indemnity agreement, is particularly important.  I can assure the committee that the Department is actively engaging with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office, whichliaises with solicitors for the congregations and the HSE, in order to bring this about. \r\n\r\nCaranua was established under the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012 to utilise up to &euro;110 million in contributions offered in the aftermath of the publication of the Ryan report to help meet the needs of former residents.  While Caranua is a body under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills, it is independent and operates under its own board. \r\n\r\nThe Department has provided support to Caranua since its establishment and exercises an oversight role applicable to statutory bodies with a view to ensuring that the organisation operates in an efficient and effective manner and in accordance with the legislation and the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.  The Department is in regular contact with Caranua to discuss progress and performance and related governance issues.  Caranua's annual reports and financial statements for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 have been presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is understood that the draft 2016 accounts are currently in preparation. \r\n\r\nThe Statement on Internal Financial Control that formed part of Caranua&rsquo;s accounts for both 2014 and 2015, and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s certificate to both sets of accounts, identified a number of potential weaknesses in Caranua&rsquo;s payments processes.  An explanation was sought from Caranua in regard to these matters and a report was recently received.  The report notes the context under which the control weaknesses emerged.  These related primarily to the fact that Caranua was in a start-up situation and that it took time to have appropriate staffing resources, systems and procedures in place.  In addition, in striving to meet the needs and expectations of applicants in a compassionate and person-centred manner, Caranua is challenged to meet sometimes very stringent control requirements.  The Caranua report also sets out the response to the various issues raised and notes the measures taken to address the weaknesses identified, which it regards as being legacy issues.  The report also notes the position in regard to the recommendations set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s management letter for 2014 and 2015.  The Department has noted the responses of Caranua and the measures being taken to address the potential weaknesses and risks that have been identified.  It will continue to work with Caranua to ensure that an appropriate control framework is in place. \r\n\r\nI thank the members for the opportunity to address the committee.

I hope the witnesses have read the conclusions and I hope Caranua has read them.  There are 43 conclusions and recommendations.  The report is enormous.  I am going to ask if the Department has changed its attitude.  From the 2002 indemnity, there is still money outstanding 14 years later.

They must ask themselves how they came to tolerate breaches of their own rules and, when sexual and physical abuse was discovered, how they responded to it, and to those who perpetrated it.  They must examine their attitude to neglect and emotional abuse and, more generally, how the interests of the institutions and the Congregations came to be placed ahead of those of the children who were in their care.<\/blockquote> <p>It is very important to place this in context.

I am not personally accountable for that to this committee, however, I do see what the Deputy is saying in terms of the joined-up nature of the impact and the role of the State in relation to all of these.  In each case the State engaged with the people who had been in the various places.  For example, in the Magdalen laundries there was the McAleese report which was followed by Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendations.  The State worked that through.  On the commission on mother and baby homes, we are all finding the horrific nature of what went on very difficult to see as we learn about it on the news and in official meetings.  That is why the Government has established a commission.  I would not say that the State is avoiding dealing with these, but I would say that it is not my responsibility to talk about the role of the State here in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#N04600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":335,"content":"<p>It is Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;'s role to talk about the Department of Education and Skills.

The board's financial statements before the committee in this session are for the financial years 2014 and 2015.  Caranua is responsible under 2012 Act for managing and disbursing funds donated by religious congregations to support the needs of former residents of residential institutions.  No Exchequer sourced funds are involved.  The Act provides for the donated funds to be used to pay grants to former residents for certain approved services, that is, housing support services, health and well-being services and education, learning and development services.    <\/p> <p>  Following the publication of the Ryan report in 2009, the religious congregations offered cash contributions that totalled a combined &euro;110 million, in addition to cash contributions committed to and paid over under the terms of the 2002 indemnity agreement.  By the end of December 2015, &euro;85 million of the total of &euro;110 million had been received into the special fund and some interest had also been earned on the balances held.  <\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of Caranua's financial statements for 2014 and 2015.  However, for both years, the audit report draws attention to the statement on internal financial control which discloses weaknesses in the board's controls over grant payments.  The concern was that these weaknesses created a risk that grant expenditure might not have been used for the proposes intended in at least some cases.  For example, for 2015, Caranua could not provide evidence that price quotations had been obtained in advance in about one third of a sample of grant applications examined in the audit.  Claimants for housing related support grants had provided proof of property tenancy or ownership in only one third of a sample of cases examined in the audit and required follow up by Caranua such as the collection of receipts for grant funded work or purchases which had been completed for only around 15% of the grants paid.  The statement on internal financial control sets out the steps being taken by the board to resolve the control weaknesses identified.  The adequacy of the controls will be examined again in the audit of the 2016 financial statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#X00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":704,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Higgins of Caranua to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#X00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend to review with them our financial statements for 2014 and 2015 and giving me the opportunity to make a short opening statement.  By way of context, I will give a brief overview of Caranua, its aims and application process.  Caranua was established, as the Chairman said, under 2012 legislation to manage a fund of &euro;110 million to support the needs of survivors of institutional abuse, people who had been placed in the care of State as children and experienced neglect and abuse in these institutions which had been managed by religious congregations on behalf of the State.  The damaging effects of this experience are lifelong and while most survivors have led fulfilling lives, the lives of many others have been limited in multiple ways because of what they endured as children.<\/p> <p>  In setting out to design a service for survivors we aimed to base it on their expressed needs and preferences and what was known about the effects of adverse childhood experiences and how they could be addressed.  This approach was helped by our having four survivors on the board.  We also consulted about 200 individuals in Ireland and England during 2013.  It was clear that the majority of survivors were ageing and that very many of them were disadvantaged educationally and in other ways and would find it difficult to engage with a service that was in any way bureaucratic or rigid.  It was with these survivors in mind that we designed our application process on the principle that if it worked for the most vulnerable, it would work for everyone.  Our central aim was, and is, to put survivors at the heart of everything we did.  Our application process is values-based, needs-led and person-centred.<\/p><p>It is broken into different stages.  When an applicant is ready to apply for services, he or she is appointed a dedicated adviser to provide support, advice and information in making an application to Caranua and, as necessary, make referrals to and-or advocate with other organisations for other services.  We try to ensure there are no barriers for someone in applying to us and we pay particular attention to ensuring our application and other information materials are accessible.  All are in plain English.  We have easy-to-read versions and short films on our website.  We organise a number of outreach events every year at which applicants and potential applicants can come to meet advisers and other staff face to face.  We hold a monthly clinic with interpreting services in Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#X00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Higgins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":707,"content":"<p>This is not the same as the written statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#Y00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":708,"content":"<p>It is not substantially different.

These staff were carefully selected for their skills, experience and attitudes.  They are professionally qualified and experienced in the areas related to their responsibilities.  The work of Caranua is complex and an intensive induction programme, with ongoing skills development and opportunities for internal supervision and external support, is available for all staff.<\/p> <p>  We work hard to deliver a good service, but we do not get it right all of the time.  The comments made by the Comptroller and Auditor General are completely warranted.  Our systems were imperfect.  We accept the recommendations made and are in the process of implementing them, as reported in our briefing document.  <\/p> <p>  We faced a number of significant challenges in achieving good practice standards and controls.  For very good reasons, we got started quickly and organisation processes and systems have been retrofitted over time.  We are trying to balance the requirements of care and compliance.  In considering how best to do this we have concluded that having a range of direct contracts with preferred suppliers, whereby Caranua will contract directly with them for specified services, is the best way forward.  All financial transactions are between us and the supplier and there is no need for applicants to get quotes and obtain receipts.  Since the beginning of the year, we have in place a contract with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, for example, whereby it will do the work it does in terms of energy efficiency for applicants who apply to us in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Caranua is, by definition, a limited fund.

In the interim we will continue to deliver services to survivors and work to support other community-based and specialist services to recognise and respond effectively to the needs of survivors in order that they can be cared for beyond the life of Caranua at home and not in institutions.

What we are planning to do over the coming years is to work more closely with mainstream service providers and specialist services to ensure that there is an awareness of early childhood trauma and the effects that has for the rest of people's lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#Z00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Higgins"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":735,"content":"<p>Does Ms Higgins accept that she said: \"You can't control people's experience of what we do for them\", some clients \"will never be happy\" and grievances \"suit such a narrative\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#Z00500","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":736,"content":"<p>I think Deputy Madigan is referring to an article from <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#Z00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Higgins"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":737,"content":"<p>I am just asking Ms Higgins if she made those comments about the claimants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#Z00700","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":738,"content":"<p>Not exactly.

It is the background to what we are discussing now, as it is to the redress board, which we discussed this morning.  This is important for survivors because sometimes a blaming attitude comes across from institutions generally.  During our earlier session, I read into the record some of the conclusions of that report, including that the deferential and submissive attitude of the Department of Education and Skills towards the congregations compromised its ability to carry out its statutory duty and so on.  I do not believe that applies only to the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the congregations, one of the many recommendations is that they examine how their ideals became debased by systemic abuse, how they came to tolerate breaches of their own rules, and when sexual and physical abuse was discovered, how they responded to it and those who perpetrated it.  It is important to reiterate that the congregations were specifically asked to examine their attitude to neglect and emotional abuse and, more generally, how the interests of the institutions and the congregations came to be placed ahead of those of the children who were in their care.  Leaving aside the specifics of that recommendation, there is always a danger that an institution will become more important, particularly so in the case of Caranua.<\/p><p>It is a big challenge to ensure the institution does not become more important than what it was set up to do.

Our statistics show that since we started that in 2015, we have had 154 complaints.  Our mechanism has three stages - one is where it gets sorted out where the complaint arose; two is where a manager is involved; and three is where it goes to internal investigation.  We have had five internal investigations.  Relative to the number of transactions and activities that occur within the organisation, there are few complaints.  That is not to say there might be people who are dissatisfied but if they do not come to us, we will not get to hear about it and we are then unable to do anything about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#SS01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Higgins"},{"type":"speech","time":1492070400,"counter":1160,"content":"<p>This is back to consultation.

On page 6 of the briefing note that Ms Higgins provided, there is table 1 and I ask if it could be put up on screen.  I want to raise an issue that is important in terms of doing a look back exercise which, unfortunately for us, is all that we can do.  It has been acknowledged that the level of the service for survivors was poor and appalling in the past and, for them, this adds insult to injury.  We need to make sure that mistakes are not made in the future in terms of any organisation.  There is a pattern here when we see what is revealed by a look back exercise.  From table 1 we can see that the audited accounts for 2014 show that the cost of salaries and wages was &euro;791,000, that figure increased to &euro;1.3 million in 2015 and to &euro;1.492 million in 2016 and it is now at its highest in 2016.  When we note the volume of work which is set out underneath, it shows there was much more activity going on in 2015 than there was in 2016.  At a time when the number of people applying for the service, the number of applications to be  processed, the number of telephone calls received and so on are reducing, staffing costs have increased.  It strikes me that we have gone the wrong away around on this.  At a time when staff were needed, we did not have them and now when the service is starting to be scaled down, the cost of staff salaries is at its highest.  Can Ms Higgins see that problem in the first instance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#TT02500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":1240,"content":"<p>We had a backlog in the beginning and we are only getting to the point now of getting on top of that.

I am not necessarily blaming Ms Higgins for this, it goes back to points that were made earlier.  I suggest that again this is another botched job.  We do things backwards.

I do not wish to interfere with any board decision, but I would like to see decisions based on some evidence that a fund is in trouble, which it is not, and a justification for a change in policy on a number of occasions, I believe, retrospectively.  However, I take Ms Higgins' word that it was not retrospective and that it did not happen, but there were different changes of policy over a number of years.  How is that communicated to the applicants who believe their needs have not been met, despite having received a payment or two or more?  There was no policy in the beginning.  Applicants came forward and their needs were met in respect of the initial application.  They then came forward with others.  At some stage, Caranua's policy changed and officials decided that they were in trouble and would limit the money, notwithstanding the fact that the number of applicants was reducing and there was &euro;50 million in a fund, presumably plus interest as a result of investments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017041300002#YY01800","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492070400,"counter":1572,"content":"<p>We do not want to end up with a surplus.

The winning design followed a protracted international competition but the memorial committee considered that only one of the designs submitted was suitable to be built.  There was no need for a second round and no other design was even ranked in second place.

The stability programme sets out the Governments macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts for Ireland and is the first update of the Government's projections since budget 2017 was introduced in October of last year.  The stability programme is presented in draft form - I am, as usual, willing to take on board constructive suggestions from Deputies.  The final version will be submitted to Brussels later this month.  The macroeconomic forecasts underpinning the stability programme have been endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.<\/p> <p>  Turning first to the economic situation, I am greatly encouraged by the latest data showing that the economy grew by 5.2% last year with strong contributions from consumption and, in particular, investment spending.  The Department of Finance has increased its GDP growth forecast this year to 4.3%, reflecting the stronger economic momentum in the second half of last year.  For next year, GDP growth of 3.7% is forecast.  From 2019 onwards, with positive contributions from both exports and domestic demand, the economy has the capacity to grow by approximately 3% per annum.<\/p> <p>  The economic recovery is most clearly evident in the labour market, with employment growth of 2.9% recorded last year.  The latter represents the addition of 56,000 jobs.  As a result, there are now more than 2 million people at work for the first time since 2008.  My Department is forecasting a continuation of robust employment growth over the forecast horizon and, on this basis, by the end of the decade there will be more people at work in Ireland than ever before.  Accordingly, unemployment is set to fall to approximately 5.5% by 2019 down from a peak of over 15% in 2012.<\/p> <p>  Turning to 2017 and beyond, the latest Exchequer returns demonstrate that the Government continues to deliver on its commitments.  While tax revenues were slightly below expectation, it still remains too early to discern any firm trends.  However, it is important to point out that annual growth has been reasonably strong with tax receipts 3.2% higher compared to the same period in 2016.  The performance of VAT has been very encouraging with receipts up over 17% or &euro;673 million in annual terms.<\/p> <p>  On expenditure, it is reassuring that spending is being managed by Departments within their allocations, with overall expenditure on delivering public services below profile.  Capital investment on infrastructure is slightly ahead of profile and well up on last year, reflecting increased expenditure on the housing programme.<\/p> <p>  The general Government deficit of 0.4% of GDP projected for this year is unchanged from budget 2017.  In addition, it is important to point out that our primary fiscal policy objective is to achieve a balanced budget in structural terms.  This is now within sight.  Taking account of the current trajectory and assumptions set out in the stability programme update, I am pleased to reiterate that we will achieve this medium-term objective of a balanced budget in structural terms in 2018.<\/p> <p>  Our second priority in fiscal policy is to reduce the level of public indebtedness and we are making significant progress in this respect.  Our general Government debt-to-GDP ratio peaked at over 120% in 2012.  This declined to 75.4% for 2016 and 72.9% for 2017.  As a result, Ireland is on track to achieve a debt-to-GDP ratio of 60% early in the next decade.  Colleagues are aware that 60% is the target set under the European fiscal rules for debt-to-GDP ratios.<\/p> <p>  Despite the strong momentum, a continuation of robust growth cannot be taken for granted as there are a number of significant risks on the horizon that could potentially derail the recovery.  Principal among these are the potential fallout from the UK's exit from the European Union and uncertainty associated with the policy stance in the US.  The best way of dealing with these risks is through prudent management of the public finances and competitiveness oriented policies.  This approach helped create the recovery and it will help ensure sustainable growth in the years to come.  This is what the Government will continue to do.  I thank the Chairman and colleagues for their kind attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#G00300","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1650,"content":"<p>Deputies Calleary, Barrett and Burton have questions for the Minister.

The fiscal space is &euro;1.2 billion but there has been a strong carryover effect from the budgetary decisions of last October.  These amount to approximately &euro;500 million on the expenditure side and in the region of &euro;175 million to &euro;180 million on the tax side.  When we put the two together, that reduces the fiscal space to somewhere around &euro;500 million to &euro;550 million.  It is very narrow.  Built into the expenditure side in the carryover is money for employing extra teachers, nurses and so on.  One would need to see for what the money is allocated to see what level of activity is already built in for 2018.  We will recalculate the fiscal space around mid-June.  I would be hoping we will recalculate it somewhat in an upward direction but I would expect it to be reasonably modest.  In normal circumstances, a growing economy with a growth rate moving from 3.5% on budget day to 4.3%, which is the latest forecast from the chief economist and his team, should generate a certain buoyancy in taxation for 2017 and 2018.<\/p><p>That said, it does not, in itself, make a big difference in the context of the fiscal space.  We can increase the fiscal space by bringing in new tax measures or by increasing existing taxes.  However, that is a discussion we would have to have in a different space.  If we were to go down that road, we would have to be very conscious of our obligations under the confidence-and-supply arrangement and ensure that Fianna F&aacute;il was taken into confidence and that we reached an agreement before we would go that way.  I would be reluctant to raise any taxes but to give Deputy Calleary the full picture, the fiscal space can be increased by additional taxes.  It is narrow and tight but what it really means is that when everything else is paid for, that is already committed, there is about &euro;550 million or so at present.  We will recalibrate that in June and we will have a better idea then but I would not expect a dramatic change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#G00600","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1654,"content":"<p>We had an interaction here last week with Mr. McCarthy and his team on the very strong employment figures.

We reduced the take from USC in the budget and perhaps that had an additional impact beyond forecast, but I do not think so.  PAYE was up by 6% year on year and PRSI was up 7%.  There is a quirk in the USC and I have asked the Revenue to have a look at it.  Deputy Calleary will remember that there was an argument that people were reluctant to go back to work in low-paid jobs because they would lose ancillary benefits.  One of the ancillary benefits they were afraid of losing was the medical card.  Some years ago, a change was made to the effect that if somebody had a medical card &ndash; personal or family - and went back to work, he or she could hold on to it for a period of three years.  Many people going back to work, while they would be paying PRSI and income tax, would not be paying USC.  That is one possible explanation.  As well as that we are not absolutely sure how the HSE has been administering the system.  The HSE may have been a little more generous than the policy parameters anticipated.  Revenue is having a look and I will keep the Deputy informed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#H00300","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1656,"content":"<p>The Minister said yesterday at the Central Bank that the eurozone Finance Ministers want to support \"productivity enhancing public investment\" to use his phrase.

What is the Minister doing at European level to follow up and what is the Government doing to allow flexibility around capital expenditure?  Is the Minister considering relaxing the fiscal rules?

That position was set out by the then Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in 2015 when he announced the capital budget.  When one takes commercial State bodies and everything else into account, that amounts to &euro;42 billion over the period to 2021.  Since then, further revenue streams have come up with the growing economy.  There is a review of the capital programme being carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and that will involve the Minister prioritising the expenditure of a further &euro;2.7 billion.  That additionality will be there and I assume the Minister will announce the distribution of that on budget day, but he has already invited submissions on the prioritisation of projects and I know he has consulted with the committee and taken its views into account.<\/p> <p>  In addition to that, we continue to work with PPPs, which will be off-balance sheet.  Andrew McDowell, whom committee members know as a previous adviser to the Taoiseach, is now vice president of the European Investment Bank, EIB, and he is working closely with us since the bank opened its Dublin office.  We are looking at the possibility of getting cheap EIB money constructed in such a fashion that the costs will go off-balance sheet for key projects.  To date, the position is that if a project can be shown to generate an income flow which is sufficient to service the borrowing, arguably, the European central statistics office, EUROSTAT, would allow it to go off-balance sheet.  If we were to build a metro for Dublin, for example, one would have to do a cost analysis on it and match it against the fare structure and see if the fare structure was sufficient to cover the construction costs over a 20 or 25-year period.  That is one area of exploration.  Let us consider what would happen if we were to complete the roads programme.  One of the big projects that remains is the Cork to Limerick one.  The cost currently pencilled in for this is approximately &euro;800 million, which is way beyond what is affordable even in the reassessment of the new capital programme.  It might be possible to do the road if one were willing to apply tolls to it.  The same would apply to the north-west project from Cavan to Derry, which is a North-South project.  In light of Brexit, it would be important to see what contribution the British Government would make.  The Deputy will accept there would be a big negotiation involved but if the Republic's portion of it were subject to tolling of some sort one could see how that might work.<\/p> <p>  One could probably do something on social housing as well but the rent flow on social housing, because of the rent structure, would be insufficient to service the investment.  A model was developed in France which is now applicable whereby 40% of the construction has to be for private housing.  Whether that is rented to generate a revenue flow or involves the sale of the asset to generate revenue over a period, by doing it that way the French have got the concept across the line with EUROSTAT.  There is a way of engineering such projects also.  We are at the early stages of discussion and we hope at European level to expand the capital programme along the lines Deputy Calleary seems to suggest.<\/p> <p>  There is some movement already on a loosening of the fiscal rules for investment purposes but the flexibility that has been introduced so far has not benefited us.  We continue at all opportunities at the relevant European meetings, especially Eurogroup and ECOFIN, to stress that an economy like Ireland's which is coming out of a deep recession - and out of a programme - during which there was very low investment in capital needs to beef up capital investment to grow the economy further.  While there have been some changes as to the flexibility of the fiscal rules that are applicable for investment, countries such as Italy have benefited strongly from that.  However, for reasons I need not get into, what such countries have done does not match Ireland's circumstances and we have not got a benefit from it yet but we are still knocking on that door and pushing hard and we will see where it goes.<\/p> <p>  We are in favour of the fiscal rules, which we think have helped quite a lot in the context of the strong economy we now have.<\/p><p>We are still running a deficit and as long as one runs a deficit, one obviously increases one's indebtedness.  In 2018, when we balance the budget in structural terms, we will run a surplus.  From then on there will be extra resources and there will be a different calculation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#H00500","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1659,"content":"<p>I will begin by congratulating the Minister.  When one reads the figures, one can see what has been achieved over the past six years.  One can see there has been an incredible turnaround.  Very often we have got into the habit of being negative about things that have not been done as distinct from the things that have been done.  I do not mean this in a pl&aacute;m&aacute;sing way but it is an absolute miracle to be where we are today and everybody should be congratulated - the officials, the Ministers and the public who put up with the hard times.  When I wake up in the morning I open my newspaper and, by and large, I expect to read bad news because people are afraid to say that there is good news.  There are 2 million people at work now.  Young people can go into third level education and are fit to travel the world and get jobs.  We have a tremendous amount to be pleased with.  Like the Minister, I have been around this House a long time.  Since 1981 we have gone through various periods and it is time that we considered the positive side.<\/p> <p>  Having said all of that, the one thing that concerns me is we still have a total imbalance in terms of house prices.  Young people are being driven to insanity if they can manage to get a loan to buy a house these days.  Deputy Boyd Barrett and I live in an area where house prices are crazy because three-bedroom houses fetch between &euro;450,000 and &euro;500,000.  No young couple can get a loan to match that amount or afford the loan repayments.  This is a small island and we must consider houses prices in the overall picture.  If I am stupid enough to get into my car and drive in here at 8.30 a.m., the journey will take me between three quarters of an hour and one hour.  If we had proper public transport and infrastructure I could travel to Drogheda or Dundalk in the same period.  I use the DART a fair bit and in Pearse Station at 5 p.m., platform 1, which is opposite to the platform I use, is jammed with people.  They actually are pushing one other to get to the front of the queue.  The trains leaving that platform go to Maynooth, Drogheda, Dundalk etc. and the people travelling are all youngish.  Commuting makes sense to people.  If one can travel from A to B in a certain amount of time and have a decent quality of life, is it not better than having a huge mortgage wrapped around one's neck for 25 or 30 years?  These are the sorts of human things that must be considered.  I suggest it is time, with low interest rates and the borrowing that could happen, for infrastructure to be provided that allows people to travel from A to B in the shortest period.  I believe the public will react.  Why would one take on a mortgage for a three-bedroom semi-detached house or a terraced house for &euro;450,000 if one could get a house for &euro;250,000 if one was prepared to travel for three quarters of an hour to an hour on public transport?  Availing of the latter would make a hell of a difference in one's quality of life.  This island is so small now because one can travel on the motorway from Dublin and reach Galway in two hours.  We need to match that option with public transport.<\/p> <p>  While the figures that have been outlined are grand, it makes sense to me - as anyone who has spent time in the business sector will know - that when interest rates are low, it is time to invest in things that are productive, create wealth and reduce burdens both on the State and individuals.  I suggest we consider various areas in towns and regions located within an hour of Dublin and draft an overall plan for infrastructure?  We may have to borrow money to fund the infrastructure needed to get people out of the rat race.  I am sure that lots of people who live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire find commuting to work is a rat race.  It is an absolute rat race for young couples to have a huge mortgage wrapped around their necks for 25 or 35 years.  The committee should draw up a plan with the Minister or whoever is in government that recommends ways to improve quality of life and provide the appropriate infrastructure.  We must encourage people to move away from overcrowded areas.  I am sure Deputy Boyd Barrett will confirm what I have said.  It does not make sense to pay &euro;400,000 for a two-bedroom apartment and to then spend an hour sitting in a traffic jam to reach the town centre.  The committee must consider ways to shift people into areas where they can get a decent home for a decent price.  We have done a fair deal in terms of infrastructure and roads but in terms of public transport and other means of getting from A to B, the committee should undertake a project that will show where people can get a decent place to live if they are prepared to spend between 30 minutes to an hour travelling.  People are already commuting great distances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#J00200","speaker":"1219"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1660,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Barrett for the compliments he paid to the officials in the Department of Finance and, indeed, everyone who has been involved in the recovery.  Colleagues know the Government has prioritised recovering the house building market in order that there is a supply of houses and apartments right through the country but also in the Dublin area, which again might be sufficient.  We have come through a period - starting nearly ten years ago in 2008 - in which activity was reduced initially and then stopped.  There was a period in the middle of the recession where no house was built except the occasional once-off house in rural Ireland.  There is a supply shortage.<\/p> <p>  Due to some abuses in the industry in the past, the dearth of activity was paralleled by a strengthening of the regulatory regime for house building and apartment building.  When I meet representatives of builders and planners I ask them why have no apartments been built between the canals in Dublin but I have been told that the price of land is too high.  The price of land in building is really the unit cost of the land.  Were the local authority to allow another five or six storeys, the unit cost would go down.  If the same patch of land sustained another five storeys with four apartments then there would be another 20 apartments and the price of land would not be too dear.  There is a combination of factors.<\/p><p>I am not in favour of bad planning or anything like that but every city in the world allows people to live in apartments in its central area, especially young single people.  While it does not have to be Manhattan, neither does it have to be as low rise and confining as it is in Dublin at present.  That is only one aspect of the recovery.  There is a very big Rebuilding Ireland programme that the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is driving forward and I do not need to enumerate all the initiatives that are being taken.  Progress is being made both on social housing and private housing.  Ultimately, only supply will moderate prices.<\/p><p> The Deputy's contribution on fast, easily accessible public transport is very important.  That is the key to a lot of it.  Not everyone is going to live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire or on the coast.  If people are to live in the counties around Dublin, and the city is the major workplace, it is essential that there is fast, affordable public transport to allow people to commute.  It has to be done in a way that it will not take them all morning and all evening, because people need to get home to their families.<\/p><p> The national planning framework is being worked on under the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  To give some context for that, the census figures have been emerging in recent weeks and they were published in a county-by-county basis today.  The population of the Republic is 4.76 million but the projection is that by 2040, which is not that far away, there will be another million people on our part of the island.  People can imagine what another one million people would do to magnify the problems which Deputy Barrett just illustrated.  The national planning framework is an essential piece of work as an attempt to take some pressure off the Dublin area and for other centres to be made more growth-friendly and more living-friendly so that there will be better population distribution.  There is no doubt that for our younger colleagues in the Parliament, these are the issues with which they will wrestle over the next 20 years.  It is about how to develop an economy that has an acceptable standard of living and that regardless of what wealth is created, the good of it is not taken away by the pressure of living in the modern economy.  Part of it is having work but another is how someone gets from where he or she lives to where he or she works.  Will everyone be on the east coast?  Looking at some of the policies of the Dublin local authorities, if it continues on the low-rise model, the city will stretch as far as Athlone when another million people come in on top of what is there already.  There are huge issues.  Maybe this committee could have a session on the national planning framework, if it is not outside its remit.  It is extraordinarily relevant to everything that we talk about on the budgetary side and the issues that Deputy Barrett raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#J00300","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1662,"content":"<p>The Minister and the officials are very welcome.  On the calculation of headroom that will be available by the end of the year, the forecast and the Minister's statement are upbeat about there being extra space at the end of the year.  Will the Minister clarify what that is likely to be used for?  Will it be for wage increases in terms of the current negotiations with the public sector?  Will the Minister also clarify where the additional funding to replace the loss of income from Irish Water will come from?  Does he expect it will come out of the headroom mentioned in his presentation?  We discussed the disappointing income tax returns for the first quarter with the officials previously.  We still do not have an explanation for it.  Nonetheless, based on the Minister's statement today, it is likely that there will be additional space by the end of the year at budget time.  I do not think anyone who has been a member of the committee would like a repeat of what happened at last year's budget where practically on the morning of the budget, the officials told us that it was all nailed down.  I think there was general laughter around the room because most people who were following what we were being told did not anticipate that.  We are a budgetary oversight committee.  In other parliaments there is an obligation to indicate to their equivalent committees when the figures change.  Will the Minister tell the committee what the likely headroom will be this year?  What has been pencilled in for areas such as public sector pay and Irish Water?  I saw various estimates around &euro;250 million per annum for that.  Will that come out of the headroom and will it feature thereafter as a general expenditure amount in the Government accounts?<\/p> <p>  There is a reference to Brexit in the document.  It seems strange that the document has no demands.  There is a graph produced in the joint Department of Finance-ESRI study.  What demands, if any, is the Government or Department of Finance putting forward to allow Ireland some leeway and room to manoeuvre in the context of the difficulties that the report indicates Ireland is likely to experience as a consequence of Brexit?  To date, a number of proposals have emerged.  One is to allow increases in capital expenditure outside the deficit procedures of the EU, whereby capital expenditure for agreed projects of the kind the Minister just outlined would not be included in the deficit.  For instance, in the case of firms that are expected to lose as a consequence of Brexit, the EU globalisation fund's approach would be adapted to allow Ireland extra leeway to support these firms.  The mushroom industry in Monaghan is a well-known example of this, a lot of which came down to currency changes.  It would be interesting to hear the Minister's thoughts.<\/p> <p>  The Minister heavily referenced public private partnerships, PPPs, in relation to the European Investment Bank.  This may be something that we as a committee return to, but the cost of PPPs in Ireland has been exceptionally high.  We have projects like court projects.  If not today, then at a later date, will the officials talk to this committee about whether it is possible to get value for money PPPs, those being PPPs at a reasonable rate, or is it inherent in the PPP structure that they are so expensive to undertake that, like the project for the criminal courts, the annual rental cost is very high compared with the NTMA being able to borrow at very attractive terms, as the Minster noted?  I would appreciate some guidance for committee members.  We are not far from the budget.<\/p><p>I am sure planning for it is under way.  Last year, we spent a number of months hearing the sc&eacute;al of various people on the budget, but because of the tradition of budgets in this country, we got very little information.  On the day, a lot more was made available.  We know from the Minister's statement today that he anticipates the same happening this year.  Perhaps he would indicate on what he proposes to spend any headroom that arises.  I am sure the Minister has done the preliminary figures on the budget.  What fiscal space is he contemplating?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#K00200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1664,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising a number of interesting issues.  On the headroom available, there is nothing in my speech that is optimistic about headroom at the end of the year.  What everybody needs to remember is that the amount of money available will be the excess of the tax flow over expenditure when the deficit of 0.9% of GDP is taken into account.  We are behind the curve in that regard after the first three months but we think we will make up ground as the year goes by.  I would not envisage, as happened in previous years, that tax revenue will drive ahead such that there will be a lot of additional funds available for spending at the back end of the year to settle outstanding liabilities.  I do not think it will go that way this year.  I hope we will at least break even but I do not envisage a surplus on the tax flow side.  The amount of money available is different from the amount that one can legally spend under the fiscal rules.  In jumping from one to the other, one can get confused.  As I said, we are a little behind in the first quarter in terms of the flow of taxation.  As a consequence, there is a shortfall in terms of bringing the budget in as designed last October, but we hope that will correct as the year goes by.<\/p> <p>  On the fiscal space, on budget day we said that the space for next year would be &euro;1.2 billion.  We are planning against that, but as I said, there is already a carry-over of approximately &euro;650 million, leaving &euro;550 million as of today in terms of new distributions of funds.  There is no headroom either on the tax flow side or in terms of fiscal space.   I hope that the growing economy will generate more taxes.  A portion of the shortfall is attributable to corporation tax not coming in evenly on monthly profiles.  The bulk of that tax comes in in May-June and again in November.  We hope it will come in again.  There was an adjustment on corporation tax in 2015 which Revenue now says arose from the extra profitability of the corporate side, which drove the taxes.  The difference between 2015 and 2016 was approximately 7% such that there was not a dramatic change in tax flow.  Corporation tax accounts for approximately 15% of all taxes.  VAT and income tax drive the tax base.  We presume corporation tax will come in right as the year goes by but we do not envisage any dramatic shifts on it one way or the other.  As I said, there is very little headroom on the tax flows and the fiscal space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#L00200","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1665,"content":"<p>The Minister mentioned in his speech that the GDP growth forecast has been increased to 4.3%, which is very good news, yet he is saying now that there will be no benefit arising from that.

On the question regarding the varying forecasts made last year about fiscal space up to the Friday night prior to the budget, what I am saying is that we are not adjusting the fiscal space arising from the new information because we have not got an awful lot to contribute yet with certainty.  The first readjustment of the forecast on fiscal space will be made around mid-June in the context of the summer economic statement.  I hope that a faster growing economy than anticipated will feed into an increase in fiscal space but the growing economy is only one element of the many moving parts that make up fiscal space.  All I can say is that the adjustment will probably be positive but it will not be dramatic.  I can say that with a reasonable amount of certainty at this point.  In terms of planning to spend, it will be plus but it will be marginal.  There are others issues involved.<\/p> <p>  There are other bills that have accrued since the start of this year and the announcement of the budget.  The Deputy will recall that to ensure we had industrial peace in the country the payment date for the tranche of the Lansdowne Road agreement which was due next September was brought forward to 1 April this year at a cost of &euro;120 million, which was not included in the budgetary figures.

For the first time in my memory, after three months the Department of Health is on line in terms of budget.  That has not happened over the previous six budgets.  In terms of the Exchequer figures published last week, spend across Departments is running at 0.9% below on the current side and is slightly up on the capital side because of the additional spend on housing.  As late as yesterday the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, told me that he will not need additional provision to meet that &euro;120 million.  That is good news.  On the other hand, no provision was made for Irish Water and the abolition of water charges.  I do not know yet where the bill in respect of the refund of water charges, as recommended by the committee, is going to land in the context of legislation.  In setting out the Estimates for Irish Water we agreed a budget with it and built it into the expenditure figures going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#L00600","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1669,"content":"<p>Is the Minister saying it is there already?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#L00700","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1670,"content":"<p>No, I am saying that the provision for Irish Water as an institution is already in place but it has to be matched.  If water charges are abolished, there will be no funding stream for Irish Water.  The intake in terms of water charges was estimated to be &euro;240 million and expenditure in terms of the conservation grant amounted to approximately &euro;100 million.  These figures were factored into the multi-annual Estimates, but intake in terms of the charges pencilled in as the revenue flow from Irish Water was not realised.  The intake to date for this year is approximately &euro;40 million.  As I said, there are many moving parts around money flow.  This income stream was expected to result in a one-off &euro;59 million in fiscal space for 2017.  As such, there will be a reduction in fiscal space of &euro;59 million.  In other words, to keep within the fiscal space figures and the figure agreed at budget time, provision will have to be made for &euro;59 million for Irish Water, which we had not allowed for.  The figure for 2018 and 2019 is zero.  It is complicated.  In the context of a budget of &euro;60 billion, this is not a huge amount and it can be accommodated.<\/p><p>It is the politics of Irish Water rather than the revenue from Irish Water that seemed to be the issue.  It will go on the balance sheet.  Water has to be paid for, as does the treatment and delivery of water.  Now the decision is that it is going to be paid for out of general taxation rather than through specific charges.  There will be a possibility of charges for excessive use, as I understand from where we sit at present.  We will not have the full picture until we see the legislation coming through.  What I have described for the committee is the position on Irish Water, but I am including it only to show that if it is not allowed for in the budget, it eats into any additional resources that may come.  It does have a consequence for fiscal space also.  As members know, &euro;59 million is not dramatic in a budget of the size we are talking about.<\/p><p> I will do my best not to have any surprises.  It is part of the agreement between our parties, the supply and confidence agreement, that there be no surprises and that we do not surprise each other.  There are moving parts in the calculation of fiscal space that keep moving right up to the publication of the White Paper on the Friday night before the budget.  We are still adjusting until the early afternoon on the Thursday.  Sometimes they are chunky adjustments.  I am not going to hide anything from members but I want them to realise I can given them the information only when I have it.  Rather than giving them a false start, we are not recalculating the fiscal space now as we did last year.  We will not recalculate until June, at which time I hope we will be closer to the outturn than we would be if we had a shot at it now.<\/p><p> On the question on Brexit, making an allowance for Brexit will depend on what will happen and the solution.  If there is no deal and no free trade agreement between the UK and the EU, and if WTO rules apply and there are tariffs, there will be a 60% tariff on prime steak.  One can see what that does to the top end of the beef market.  A woman in Manchester can already buy two and a half chickens for the price of a sirloin steak.  One can see the divergence in behaviour that would occur, especially when the devaluation of sterling is driving up consumer prices in the British supermarkets by perhaps 4% or 5%.  It will depend on where it lands.  I hope, and it is our negotiating position, that there will be a free trade agreement between the UK and Ireland resulting in no tariffs, such that we would not have the problems.<\/p><p> Some measures are being taken already.  One will be aware that a combination of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, ourselves and the European Union has been able to deliver &euro;150 million of capital to the farming community at 2.95%.  That was to protect the suppliers into the food market from the first hit of Brexit.  We do not know where it is going to land, however.  It will not be possible to measure the consequences of Brexit until we are further down the road.  Based on what the Department of Finance has done with the ESRI, as referred to, there will be a knock of about 4.5%, but that will be at the end of ten years.  If a budget is moving at 3% or 3.5% for the decade, amounting to GDP growth of 35%, and it is compounded, because it would be growth on growth, one would not be far from 40%.  The calculation is 4.5% off that rather than 4.5% in any given year.  It would be front-loaded.  Most of the hit would be in the first five years of the decade rather than the second five, but it is not as dramatic as some of the headlines would suggest.  Certainly, it would act as a brake on our growth rates and hold us back.<\/p><p> How does one deal with that?  One does so by managing the public finances better and continuing to make the economy more competitive rather than by having any specific sectoral intervention, although sectoral interventions might be necessary also.  We are considering a measure in the Department, along the lines of the cheap money we made available to the farming community, that would protect SMEs in our vulnerable export sector.  This, however, has state aid implications, so we have had to send the heads of what we are talking about to the competition authority in Brussels for state aid clearance.  We are planning that piece.  We can obtain more information on that for the committee if necessary.<\/p><p> Beyond that, we are pressing everybody and doing everything we can.  The members know the issues.  They know of the North-South issue, the freedom of movement issues, the possibility of tariffs, the common labour market between ourselves and the UK and the trade implications.  Trade worth &euro;1.2 billion crosses the Irish Sea every week in both directions, supporting 400,000 jobs, with 200,000 in each jurisdiction.  This is what would be at risk if we got a really hard Brexit but we hope we can negotiate with the European negotiators to get a deal.  Of course, our priorities are all the issues affecting the island, both the North and South.  In addition, we are unashamedly in favour of the UK getting a free trade agreement with the European Union.  If it does so, we will not have tariffs and disruption to our trade.  The nearer we can get to that position, the better it is for Ireland.  That is where we are but it is going to be a long story.  One will notice there has been movement on both sides towards transitional arrangements.  These are absolutely necessary but they also lengthen the timeframe.  With a negotiation process that takes three to four years and another period of transition before any new regime comes into play, one could be looking at a decade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#L00800","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1672,"content":"<p>Could the Minister comment on the PPP costs by comparison with very cheap money available to the NTMA?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#M00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1673,"content":"<p>The big advantage of PPP is that, while one cannot ignore costs, one can get the funding off the balance sheet.

We would not have to go up too far to get it for 15 or 20 years.  In comparing the public capital programme to PPPs, it should be noted that it could probably be funded out of a public capital programme as cheaply as a PPP but the advantage of the PPP is associated with the second issue, that is, what one is allowed to spend.  If it is spent on PPP, it is not coming out of the fiscal space.  The Deputy is right about low interest rates.  The price is not so much the issue as being off-balance sheet.

I thank the Minister for his presentation.  I very much welcome the fact our economy is growing and that the jobs market is strengthening, but from my perspective, I am thinking about younger people.  When there is a narrative that the country is recovering, that things are going very well and that the number of jobs is increasing, the Parliament, which may not be as representative of those in their 30s and 40s as it should be, must recognise that there is growing depression, anxiety and fatigue among people of that generation.<\/p><p>They are unable to buy a first home or get permanent jobs, must deal with pension issues and, as Deputy Barrett pointed out, spend hours in their cars or on public transport on long commutes.  We have done little in recent years to address that age group's ongoing concerns.  I point to the help-to-buy scheme specifically.  I understand the incentive behind it, but the Minister is probably aware it has been termed the \"help the developer\" scheme, given that it has driven up prices for younger people and first-time buyers.  I am eager to see future budgets doing something to assist people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who are trying to get a foot up in life, start families and jobs and get homes, which is becoming an impossibility for many.<\/p><p> I welcome that the Minister touched upon the national planning framework.  I support the drive to ease the pressure in the greater Dublin area.  With that in mind, there needs to be a focus on investment and development in the north west.  Speaking as someone from the Mayo constituency, we consistently have been left behind in terms of infrastructural development.  I do not begrudge any county development works but there is extra infrastructure development in Dublin, Cork and Galway in the form of the Luas and various public transport systems, even though the basics have not even been provided in the north west.  There is no motorway or dual carriageway out of Mayo or proper links to Sligo, Galway or Dublin.  Without basic infrastructure in place, it will be difficult to compete for investment and generate the jobs that will allow people to remain in the area.<\/p><p> Deputy Barrett hit the nail on the head where work-life balance was concerned.  The public service could examine allowing people to work from home properly for a day or two per week in an attempt to ease the pressure on commuter services and the necessity of sitting in a car for two hours each way every day.  The public sector should lead the way on this matter.<\/p><p> Regarding the GDP growth projections, are there plans to increase spending on the Defence Forces?  Last year, we spent 0.55% of GDP on defence whereas the European average, including neutral countries, was 1.2%.  We will be dealing with Brexit and other issues and are an island nation.  I am not suggesting that major threats are posed to our State but by any standard of a functioning democracy with a jurisdiction to protect, including its waters, we have a low defence spending.  I would like to see it increased, given that the economy is growing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#M00600","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1678,"content":"<p>There is no doubt at all that, in times of recession, people who are looking for their first jobs and homes and trying to establish themselves in life and society have it more difficult than those who are established and have homes, families, jobs, pension provisions, etc.  That is a given and is borne out by all of the evidence.  The best thing a government can do for a younger generation is to ensure that there are jobs.  That was our approach - the priority was to create jobs.  We have been successful in that.  When I entered office in 2011, the rate of unemployment was in excess of 15% and among young people, it was much higher.  As of last week, the rate is now 6.4%.  The ESRI projects that it will be 5.7% by the end of this year, although we believe that we will be in the mid-5% range in 2019.  As committee members know, the difference of returning to work, even for average pay of &euro;700 or &euro;800 per week, to a family that was jobless during the recession is dramatic.  That is the best thing that we can do.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, we prioritised education after that.  A great deal of money was invested in higher education, including third level.  Participation rates are very high now.  They increased rather than decreased during the recession.  Education directly targets young people.  Our young people are probably the best educated young people in Europe and are as good as anywhere else.  This is important.  I agree with Deputy Chambers's general analysis, in that delivering for the rising generation must be a priority in any social and economic development plan.<\/p> <p>  I take issue with her and various other commentaries to the effect that the help-to-buy scheme has increased the price of houses.  That claim does not stand up to any economic analysis.  In the three months of this year so far, approximately 1,000 people have received money under the scheme.  The cost is approximately &euro;10 million.  That amount of extra spending in the housing market could not possibly affect prices.  It is too small a quantum.  Prices are increasing but not on account of the help-to-buy scheme as the input is far too small.  The scheme is working.  It was designed to help young couples get a deposit for a house.  It contributes close to half of what was required for a house deposit last year.  Combined with the Central Bank's adjustment to the prudential rules, this has stimulated the starter home market again.  Starter homes are being built and young couples are buying them.  However, there is no circumstance in which an injection of &euro;10 million into the housing market could drive up prices.  It is not possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#N00200","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1679,"content":"<p>Could the Minister repeat that point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#N00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1680,"content":"<p>An injection of &euro;10 million into the housing market since Christmas could not possibly have driven up prices.

That is manifest in the housing crisis, the water infrastructure crisis, investment in health, education and a whole number of other areas which could really do with significant investment.  The lack of that investment in the housing area has produced the \"supply problem\", as it is referred to, because we did not invest, do not have a stock and prices are up.  I would like to point out that the reason that we did not have that investment was because of the fiscal straitjacket.  Those were rules which were imposed which we agreed to.  Even now, we are still grappling with that.  There is now a consensus emerging that we should question the fiscal straitjacket, at least with regard to capital investment.  Is it not the case that we are paying - whatever about the debates on current spending - a bitter price for the fiscal straitjacket imposed by the troika and agreed to by both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il before it?  It produced dangerous imbalances in the economy, never mind the human suffering in the area of housing and the health service from the collapse in investment in those areas.<\/p> <p>  Is it not time to admit that the EU fiscal rules, at least on capital investment and expenditure, were wrong?  They were short-sighted rules and did not understand that counter-cyclical investment and expenditure are needed, and one does not even have to be a Marxist to think that.  It is a matter I have heard the Minister talk about more recently, but there was none of that when we needed it most and we are paying a very bitter price for it.  I am interested to hear the Minister's comments on that.  It is not just a past tense thing, because for those years, we paid out &euro;8 billion in interest on an odious debt that was imposed on us, which is broadly comparable to the collapse of capital investment.  That was the capital investment fund, but it was going out.  It is still going out.  Next year, &euro;6 billion will go out in interest, there will be about &euro;6 billion in the two years after that, and it goes on for quite some time.  That is money that could be going into the capital investment deficit and the infrastructure deficit.  We all acknowledge that is the case but Europe is imposing a straitjacket and we are agreeing to that straitjacket.  Even now, despite the apparent consensus on the problem that this presents for us, I do not really sense any fight with Europe about this.  Maybe the Minister could tell me differently, that we are fighting the good fight in Europe to change these crazy rules which are starving us of the housing investment, infrastructure investment and so on that we need.<\/p> <p>  Housing has been mentioned on a number of occasions.  The Minister said it is a matter of supply.  I agree and just gave my analysis of why we have a supply problem.  Is it just a matter of supply, or is it also the type of supply?  That is to say the balance of public, not for profit housing compared to an overwhelmingly privately controlled property market and development land.  Would the Minister not agree that that balance is all wrong?  Whereas housing output in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s would have been from the State directly providing a much higher proportion, 30% to 40% at times, now it is down to abysmally low levels of direct output by the State of not-for-profit housing, whereas the vast bulk of housing output now is from the private sector.  That creates the imbalance and problems of unaffordable prices.  Unless we increase the supply of not-for-profit, directly-provided State housing, that balance will never be corrected.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  There is a section in the stability programme about NAMA where the Minister says that its debt and bonds are to be redeemed by the end of 2017.  Had the Minister not accelerated the redemption of those bonds and used the money for investment in infrastructure and housing, we might have had more for that.  I think it was a mistake for the Minister to accelerate that process to the extent that he did.  I ask him to talk about what will happen after the redemption.  Presumably we are into the black in NAMA in financial terms, once we have redeemed the debt.  Do we know exactly what assets are left, what they are worth, what they could be used for and how much profit is projected?  We need more detail on all of this.  How much of the profit generated by NAMA will go to private bodies?  NAMA is often referred to as a public body but, of course, it is not a public body.  It is 51% privately owned.  We do not even know who some of the private owners are, incredibly.  They are undisclosed investors.  How much of the profit of NAMA will go to the 51% that is privately owned?<\/p> <p>  On the revenue side, does the Minister find it concerning or think it is an issue for us to consider from a budgetary point of view that, while profits have gone up pretty consistently for the last number of years - the witnesses could tell us what the latest available figures are but I think pre-tax profits were about &euro;95 billion-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#O00900","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1705,"content":"<p>Is that on the corporation side?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#O01000","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1706,"content":"<p>Pre-tax corporate profits are about &euro;95 billion.

The productivity of the Irish worker is off the Richter scale, in fantasy land, something which is connected with transfer pricing and the behaviour of multinationals, particularly in the area of IP.  Does the Minister not think that our failure to react increases our vulnerability and that we are too dependent on this?  We are even talking about courting more banks and financial institutions into the IFSC when we should be diversifying the economy into areas that would be less vulnerable to external shocks.  If we wanted to do that, the lack of capital and infrastructure investment would be a major problem.  I am thinking of areas such as arts, forestry, universities and energy self-sufficiency, which could insulate us to some extent from the ups and downs of the global market and potential changes to multinational behaviour but we are doing very little in those areas.

In 2004 or 2005 the Minister for the Environment decided that, in allocating housing budgets, local authorities would be allowed to go into the market and buy private houses rather than construct social housing, and this certainly reduced the supply.  The argument at the time, which I understood, was that by building large social housing estates one risked developing ghettos whereas, if the budget was used to buy in private housing estates, there would be a much better social mix and thus a much more sustainable housing model.  However, local authorities not only stopped building houses, they took out their capacity to build houses by winding down their construction sections.  While the housing agencies can now build houses many local authorities do not have sections dedicated to the construction of social housing, as they had when I was a member of a local authority, with design people and engineers who could deliver it.  That is one argument but not the only one and there was a very strong social reason for going the other way.  There are now very big housing budgets and we prioritised this at the start of this Government.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and local authorities have &euro;5.5 billion over the next six years for social housing and, by any standards, that is a very strong investment.<\/p> <p>  NAMA has a social obligation and is committed to building and providing 20,000 units, houses and apartments.  It has already delivered between 4,000 and 5,000 and is continuing its work.  NAMA was financed with primary bonds and secondary bonds.  The primary bonds, worth &euro;30 billion, are due to be fully paid in 2017 and the secondary bonds run out to 2020.  The advice given to NAMA, which it has passed on to me, is that it would not be good financing to repay them any sooner and the cheapest way to pay them off would be to let them go until 2020 and settle them then.  It has the wherewithal to settle the subordinate bonds and it estimates a profit of &euro;2.5 billion at present, while its residual assets are somewhere north of &euro;4 billion.  Over the next year and a half to two years I would expect the &euro;2.5 billion, in a thriving property market, to go up further and this will be money largely for the Exchequer.  There may be a small amount, perhaps &euro;10 million, to settle the structures put in place at the beginning of the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#P01800","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1725,"content":"<p>That would be for private investors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#P01900","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1726,"content":"<p>Private investors were a requirement of Brussels and included banks and various other people.

When that matures, the Minister for Finance will need to look at whether or not to take the money into the Exchequer.  Our European friends, however, will probably insist that it is taken off our debt.<\/p><p>Alternatively, it might be left within a NAMA structure whereby NAMA could spend on extra housing or social infrastructure.  There is a way of modelling whereby we might be able to use that.  NAMA is off balance sheet, as the Deputy knows.  There is a gap up to 2020 in which it might be possible to do clever financial engineering so that we could dedicate some of the NAMA profits to some investment purpose which, for a while anyway, would remain off balance sheet.  I have no plan in that direction.  I am just pointing out that there are options that should be considered by whoever is around in a couple of years' time.<\/p><p> The Deputy referred to corporation tax.  Going back to 2013 and 2014, the Deputy will find that it was short of &euro;4 billion.  In last year's figures and this year's estimate it is about &euro;7.5 billion.  Taking &euro;7.5 billion in revenue on &euro;90 billion pre-tax profits, if the Deputy's figure for that is correct, it comes in somewhere about 8.6% or 8.7% rather than the 6% he referenced.

On foot of the Minister's intervention, we argued that it was unfair to Ireland because the backward-looking application was taking into account the very bad years, when growth was minus 5% or minus 6%.

Since I returned to the meeting in the past 30 minutes or so, there has been a heavy emphasis on nostalgic events and recalling of events.<\/p> <p>  I have three questions that will not take up too much time.  I thank the Minister and his officials for their attendance.  Memories and events of the past have been mentioned.  Who can forget them?  One of the criticisms of the Fianna F&aacute;il Administration in the run up to the crisis, and the same criticism was made in the period immediately after the crash, was that the Government did not heed various advices that had been issued or the wisdom of august bodies.  We delved to see what the advices were.<\/p><p>The only person offering advice on events leading up to the crash was a little known economist at the time in University College Dublin, UCD, but all the major bodies such as the Central Bank and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, were predicting soft landings etc.  That is why I raise this question.  I do not have the Minister's grasp of economics.  I am a psychotherapist so I bow to the Minister's superior knowledge but I do have a good memory and a good emotional memory for the events.  We do not seem to have similar conditions for a property bubble in that people are not borrowing to the same extent.  I accept that but interest rates are at a record low and that cannot last forever so people are borrowing at a very low rate.<br\/><br\/>For the first time in approximately 20 years I went to look at a show house - I have had no reason to look at one - in my constituency, Rathfarnham.  It is a three or four bedroom end of terrace in Ballyboden, Dublin 16, a good middle class area and the starter price is &euro;560,000.  That is a peak of the boom price, as I remember them.  I know the situation is different now.  I heard what the Minister said about the help-to-buy scheme but I am conflicted because there is significant opinion that differs with what the Minister said about the help-to-buy scheme fuelling prices.  They may not be big players in the commentary space, such as <i>DAFT.ie<\/i>and <i>myhome.ie<\/i>, which have said the help-to-buy scheme has contributed to inflation in house prices but the Governor of the Central Bank has also said it.  The Minister disagrees with him but he is a significant player in terms of offering economic advice.  He has said he does not think there can be any doubt that if one has additional capacity to enter the system there will be impact effect, even though it applies only to new builds.  He says it will drive up prices.  Could the Minister comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#R03100","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1771,"content":"<p>We would have great respect for the Central Bank but my own opinion is that the change in the prudential rules has had more of an effect on prices than the help-to-buy scheme.  I did, however, say that the connection between supply and demand is price.  If there is a shortage of supply and there is excess demand it will have an effect on price.  I would concede to the Deputy that the announcement of the help-to-buy scheme probably had a psychological effect which might have influenced prices.  Inputting in the first three months of the year an extra &euro;10 million into the market does not seem to me to affect price very much.  That is not the way it works.  There are differences of opinion and in this respect I think my opinion is as good as any other opinion that is around at present because there are all sorts of opinions.  That is not to say the Deputy's opinion is not good either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#S00200","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1772,"content":"<p>I am not offering an opinion because when it comes to economics I am just-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#S00300","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1773,"content":"<p>Sometimes I think a psychotherapist has a better insight than an economist into Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#S00400","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1774,"content":"<p>The Minister is an old charmer but I have to say this is not just any opinion.

If there is one lesson I have learned coming out of the crash, and I think the nation has learnt it because it is the lesson we were asked to learn, it is to listen to advice that is being offered.  It is not enough for the Minister to describe the Governor of the Central Bank as eminent and to say that he respects his opinion.  He is the Governor of the Central Bank and he has said the help-to-buy scheme is driving up house prices.  The Minister is conceding a little bit on that but I am not here to argue the point.  As a layman and as a public representative who is concerned for people who have to buy homes, I want to know what steps does the Minister think he could take?  Will the Minister take my word, when I say man to man, psychotherapist to Minister for Finance, that &euro;560,000 for an end of terrace starter home, a fine home - it does not even have an \"A\" energy rating, it has a \"B\" rating, is back to the peak prices?  I know Rathfarnham well.  What could the Minister do perhaps on the supply side to help cool it down a little bit?  I am concerned for the young constituents, as I am sure the Minister is for those in Limerick and other places, that the prices will stretch out of their reach.  This is when interest rates are at rock bottom and I would have a real concern that when they borrow, and borrow large sums that are cheap to repay now and quite cost efficient, within a year or two, when the low interest rates have maxed out at rock bottom rates and start to rise, that will have a significant impact.  As I represent my constituents I ask the Minister to please be conscious of the potential impact the help-to-buy scheme is having on the demand side.

The Deputy put his question as if there was nothing happening on the supply side.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is Deputy Coveney.  He got an enormous budget last year of &euro;5.5 billion and has introduced dozens of supply side initiatives to help the supply of houses.  He is the Minister responsible for housing but I am sure the Deputy is familiar with that.  My job as the Minister for Finance is to provide the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with sufficient funds to fund all these schemes and to see if nuancing of tax arrangements can help the housing situation but my influence on it is marginal.  The main driver of housing policy is the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  It is incorrect to say, and I am sure the Deputy does not believe it, that there are no supply side initiatives taken when he has been introducing supply side initiatives for 12 months.  They are working.  This year he says the supply will go from 12,000 or 13,000 last year to somewhere between 18,000 and 19,000 this year.  He is predicting approximately 23,000 for next year.  The ESRI says what is required is 25,000 a year and he will not be too far off that in 2018 but of course to make up for the years when nothing or very little was built one would need to overshoot for four or five years over the 25,000.  He has taken a series of initiatives.

The price of a site is a factor in Dublin.  It is especially a factor in the cost of apartments, but it is the unit cost of the site which is the issue and the Dublin local authorities should allow another five or six storeys to be built because if one puts another 20 apartments on the same site, by going up, one reduces the unit cost of the site.  It is very simple and yet there is an absolute refusal to do it.  Consequently, there is very little apartment building, if any at all, in the area within the canals in Dublin.  Elevation is one issue and over regulation was an issue but the then Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, changed that dramatically.<\/p><p> All along the quays the regulation said one had to have two parking spaces for cars.  It is the one place in the country where one has every form of public transport from taxis to buses, access to Luas, and the DART is not so far away, yet two parking spaces were required for people whom one would be trying to encourage not to have cars if one was planning properly.

In terms of upcoming infrastructural investment outside of the east coast and the Dublin area in particular, the need for direct access by sea to the Continent rather than through Britain means an expansion in investment is required in the Minister's part of the world, namely Foynes, where he is originally from and a deep sea port potentially in the north west, which I heard spoken about yesterday, in my own area in the south east, Rosslare, for passenger traffic and Waterford Port for freight.  There are knock-on consequences in terms of investment in road infrastructure in particular.  The Minister will be slightly familiar with the Limerick to Waterford road which is no more than a cow track in parts.  I know of no other national primary road that passes through as many towns and villages as that one.  I also draw the Minister's attention to the Limerick to Cork road, which he mentioned, and the Cork to Waterford road, which requires upgrading.  As we face into Brexit, but also in terms of rebalancing some of the economic growth in the country as well, is there not a significant argument for investment in regional infrastructure being more necessary now than ever?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#T01000","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1796,"content":"<p>Yes and those issues are being taken into account in the national spatial plan that is being developed.  The main route to the Continent is not direct ferry services at present, even though there is significant container traffic out of Waterford Port and Rosslare, it is using the UK as the land bridge, as it is called whereby people drive across.  I cannot see how that would not be maintained because if one looks at the situation in Italy where every day thousands of trucks drive through Switzerland in both directions carrying goods and services from Italy to Germany and France and so on and they have an arrangement whereby one seals the truck so that it does not have to be physically examined and there are legal arrangements that apply.  What I found while negotiating in Europe over the years is that if one can find a space in the European legal spectrum one can bolt a new project onto it.  It seems to me that if such traffic can be managed between Italy and across Switzerland and the bigger European countries we can continue to use the land bridge.  If there is a free trade area between the UK and the European Union there is one set of difficulties but if there are tariffs there is a bigger set of difficulties.  If there are tariffs one would need a big expansion in Dublin Port and other ports.  It would probably be prudent to have extra ferry services from the south east as well for direct access to the Continent.<\/p> <p>  I was talking to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, about it and he told me that if it reverted to World Trade Organization regimes they would need about four years to put the investment that would be required into the port of Dover to handle the general customs activity that would be generated.  They are looking at very long timeframes.  It depends on where it lands; if we are into a tariff situation there will be a lot of investment consequences.  If there is free trade the consequences are more limited.  To go back to a previous question, the fright we have got from Brexit should, arguably, be taken on board and we should diversify our markets and make sure we have direct access to the Continent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017041300002#T01100","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1492088400,"counter":1797,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for their attendance.

For those who do not know me, my name is Jonathan Sugarman.  I was the risk manager for UniCredit Bank Ireland, a bank with a roughly &euro;30 billion balance sheet, which was located in the Irish Financial Services Centre in Dublin 1.  I joined the bank in May 2007.  For those unfamiliar with the term risk manager, it is like a policeman who works within a bank on behalf of the banking regulator, which in this case was the Central Bank of Ireland.  Effectively, I was there to look out for the people of Ireland.  My job and that of all risk managers in all banks, regardless of where they are located, is to ensure the regulations regarding how a bank is run are adhered to and upheld.  If they are not, it is my duty not just to my employer but also to the regulator to inform them of any activities which may not be within the limits of the regulations under which the bank operates.  In 2007, the regulations under which I operated in UniCredit Bank Ireland were unambiguous and very clear as were the penalties for any infringement which might occur.  In my case, failure to immediately notify the Central Bank of a breach of these regulations could result in a mandatory fine and-or five years in jail.<\/p> <p>  It is against this backdrop that I wish to talk to the committee today.  I spent the first couple of months at the bank in 2007 familiarising myself with the systems, products and internal control mechanisms.  Having previously worked for two German-owned banks in Dublin, I was well familiar with the risk management practices and the regulations which governed them.  Approximately two months into my tenure at UniCredit, I began to notice anomalies which were irregular but which happened with a frequency that suggested to me that they urgently required further investigation.  Within a very short space of time, it became commonplace for me to have daily meetings with the chief executive officer of the bank to discuss the ever increasing number of breaches of regulation that I was observing.  I was told not to worry, that these were simply IT related glitches and that there was nothing for me to worry about.  I thought this was somewhat unusual as being a risk manager I would personally suffer the full weight of the law if it were proved that I was aware of such breaches of regulations and did not report them to the Central Bank.  Needless to say, as a new employee in a new bank, I went along with the instructions of my CEO for another week or two but there was no effort whatsoever being made to prevent or investigate the real cause of these glitches.  It must be borne in mind that the relevant liquidity regulations came into force on 1 July 2007, which is two months after I started working at UniCredit, and I was only too well aware of the penalties for not complying.<\/p> <p>  I now refer the committee to item 6 which I have provided the committee with, which is the requirements for the management of liquidity risk that were issued by the Financial Regulator, as he was called then in 2006, to be enforced in 2007.  I refer the committee to page 24 on item 6.  It details the penalties applicable for any breach of regulations which took place after 1 July 2007.  I will quote from Irish law.  Section 58 of the Central Bank Act 1971 which refers to offences and punishments as amended by the substitution of section 9 of the Central Bank Act 1989 states that a holder of a banking licence who commits by act of omission a breach of a condition duly imposed and which relates to their licence \"shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable (i) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &pound;1,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both, or (ii) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &pound;50,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or to both\".  Further down the page, one can read, \"if the contravention, breach or failure in respect of which he was convicted is continued after conviction, he shall be guilty of an offence on every day on which the contravention, breach or failure continues after conviction\".  That means that every single breach was a criminal act.  Section 60 of the 1971 Act contains an extension of the offending provisions.  It states \"Where an offence under this Act is committed by a body corporate or by a person purporting to act on behalf of a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons and is proved to have been so committed with the consent or approval of, or to have been facilitated by any wilful neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary, member of any committee of management or other controlling authority of such body or official of such body, such person shall also be guilty of the offence\", which means not only am I guilty but my regulator is equally guilty once I have notified him.<\/p> <p>  There is no dispute of the fact that I reported a 20% liquidity breach to the Central Bank in the late summer of 2007.  I urge the committee to understand the significance of such a breach.  The following explanations should make it relatively easy to understand.  Regulation states that a breach of 1% should send alarm bells ringing and red lights flashing.  The Central Bank must be notified immediately.  In the context of driving a car, this would mean there is a speed limit of 100 km\/hr.  Driving at 101 km\/hr is a breach of law that has to be reported immediately to the authorities.  UniCredit Bank Ireland only bothered to oblige the law and notify the regulator when we were speeding at 120 km\/hr.<\/p><p>The immediate questions that should have been raised by the regulator as soon as I notified it of this breach should have  been, \"How on earth did you get to a 20% liquidity breach?  Were you not aware when you exceeded 5% or 10%?  Where were you when you hit 15%?\"  A breach of 20% implies that the bank came perilously short of liquid assets.  The most liquid asset is cash.  The events at UniCredit in the summer of 2007 occurred against the backdrop of the first bank run that Europe had seen since the Second World War.  The entire branch network of Northern Rock in the United Kingdom had thousands of customers queuing at the door in fear that the bank was unable to return the cash that they had deposited with it.  In the meantime, the management systems at UniCredit Bank Ireland were showing serious shortages of liquidity on a regular basis.  As the members can see from the above section of the banking regulations, it would not only have been me as the risk manager who would have been liable for prosecution but also, the chief executive officer of UniCredit and, more importantly, and I cannot stress this highly enough, any other controlling authority, which in this case was and still is the Central Bank of Ireland.<\/p><p> What I find incredulous is that my life has been utterly destroyed simply because I did the right thing but the people who are jointly liable for the failure to adhere to the regulations, which this House formulated and passed into law, got off scot free.  There were no sanctions whatsoever placed on UniCredit or more importantly, on the Central Bank of Ireland.  I remind the committee that I have been unable to work for over ten years and I am totally unemployable as a result of my upholding the law of the Republic of Ireland.<\/p><p> Had the regulator done its job, it is my contention that the liabilities which were placed on the shoulders of the Irish nation, specifically the blanket guarantee which was given to all the Irish banks, overnight, which was effectively a blank cheque underwritten by every citizen in the State, would not have been necessary.  This happened just a year after I resigned over the same issue of liquidity.  A year after that, the country was saddled with a &euro;64 billion debt incurred by the banks who violated the liquidity regulation, the same regulation that I had tried to warn the regulator about a year previously.<\/p><p> At the heart of this matter is the fact that neither the parent company in Italy nor the Italian central bank knew anything about this breach of regulation until 2010, some three years later, as can be observed in the video clip, provided to the members in item 14, in which Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, recently states this unequivocally.  The Central Bank of Ireland should have notified both of them immediately.  It is now ten years later and Mr. Draghi has said he has never heard of this.  He said that directly to Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, MEP, who is here today.  <\/p><p> The question that  must now be asked is: How is it that the Central Bank was remiss in carrying out its statutory function and nobody has ever been officially sanctioned because of it?  My life was destroyed but the lives of those who work and worked in the Central Bank were not.  The members of the committee must ask why and only they can ask why and get the answers.<\/p><p> In the recent banking inquiry with which this committee, and four members of this committee in particular, are more than familiar, another whistleblower emerged.  The particular investigation in which they were involved was the regulatory stream.  The banking inquiry whistleblower made it very clear to members of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis that they were of the opinion that the Central Bank of Ireland was being deliberately obstructive in regard to the investigation and it was alleged that the Central Bank withheld certain documentation.  This was later corroborated by a former employee of the Central Bank of Ireland.  I am aware that the banking inquiry whistleblower made several attempts to ensure that I would give evidence to the joint committee, but I fail to understand why my attendance was prohibited at that time.  The members of the committee were aware of my case and I fail to understand why it has taken the committee this long to invite me in here today.<\/p><p> There are a number of threads of commonality which run through all the banking systems in this country and one of them is most certainly the delay between matters of potential or actual financial malfeasance being reported and the time it takes for official Ireland to admit that it just may have an Issue that must be dealt with.  The harsh fact of the matter is that official Ireland has absolutely and completely destroyed the lives of every single whistleblower who has come forward regardless of from which organ of the State.  It took Maurice McCabe ten years of battling against the State to finally begin repairing his life because the State made it as hard as possible for him and his family.  The same goes for John Wilson and how he was treated.  I should mention the Mary Boyle case and, more recently, the cover-up of the Grace scandal.  The problem with this country is that official Ireland, those civil and public servants at the very top levels, the ones who have their hands on the levers of power, seem to be completely immune from any form of sanction, while those who do the right thing are vilified and their lives destroyed. <\/p><p> The reason there is such a row about getting people to pay for water, or about people lying on trolleys is that at the end of the day, the banks and their highly paid executives have always got to be paid and it will always be the poor people of Ireland who will suffer the most unless this House finally has the guts to do what is right.  That is  why I am in shock with respect to items I submitted, by 10 o'clock last Monday, for the members of the committee to see that  I had to wait until an hour before the close of business yesterday to be told that I had to redact them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017041300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jonathan Sugarman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492074000,"counter":1808,"content":"<p>If Mr. Sugarman would just deal with the subject matter, it might be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017041300002#J00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492074000,"counter":1809,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017041300002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jonathan Sugarman"},{"type":"speech","time":1492074000,"counter":1810,"content":"<p>The other matter is a matter of procedure for the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017041300002#J00400","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492074000,"counter":1811,"content":"<p>I understand.

I fail to understand why it was decided that a small business was of vital importance to the country but five separate boards of directors had to be maintained and paid for by the taxpayer.  These are banks that had all been run into the ground.  As an economist, my view is that we should have protected depositors up to a certain amount of money.  Given that five banks had collapsed, the State, for the sake of competition, should have taken ownership of two and slowly revived the banking system, much like what was done in Iceland.  However, if one looks at Holland and Belgium, one sees that they did something similar to what was done in Ireland in terms of Fortis Bank and Dexia.  These were merged into existing banks in the Netherlands and Belgium.  Effectively, they collapsed but they just changed their names.

It is the Senator's to be had, so the bank must give it to him.

As can be seen, these regulations were issued in 2006.  This is item No. 6 of what I provided to the committee.  I ask committee members to turn to section 9.4, in which it says that it relates to the implementation of these new regulations.  Although the letter of regulation was issued in June 2006, if members look at the last paragraph at the bottom of page 23, it says that the revised liquidity report will be prepared in parallel with the existing requirements for a six-month period commencing January 2007.  If members look at the last sentence in that paragraph, it is that limits on the level of maturity mismatch - that is bank-talk for liquidity - will take effect on the completion of the six-month parallel run in 2007.  That is to say that both calculations are done in the six-month parallel run.  From 1 July 2007, these new regulations and methods were the only ones that applied.  It is significant that three years later, we saw that the regulator, still called the Financial Regulator, re-issued the same requirements.  It says \"Requirements for the Management of Liquidity Risk\".  This time, it was issued in June 2009.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Chairman to turn to section 9.  It is entitled \"Reporting\".  One can see, if the two sections from these regulations - which were three years apart - are compared, that section 9 is on reporting, reporting obligations etc.  Section 9.1 is \"Licensed Credit Institutions\", section 9.2 is \"Banking Groups\", section 9.3 is \"Branches of EEA and non-EEA Banks\".  I dare the Chairman to find section 9.4, on implementation.  There is no reference in the 2009 legislation to this being law in Ireland in 2007.  Reference will be found, in the preamble, to banking Acts going all the way back to 1942, 1971, 1989 and 2001.  Nowhere in this document will one find a reference to the year 2007.  The simple reason for that is that none of this was upheld.

I am joined by my colleague, Maria Egan, who is a pharmacist in the medicines and controlled drugs unit.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to provide the Department of Health&rsquo;s observations on the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016.<\/p> <p>  By way of background, this Private Members' Bill was published by Deputy Gino Kenny and Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith in July 2016.  Much of the text is similar to that contained in the Cannabis Regulation Bill 2013 published by Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, though there are important differences between the two Bills.  In early November the Minister for Health announced a review of policy on the use of cannabis for medical purposes.  He requested the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, to provide him with expert advice.  On 1 December, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann debated Deputy Kenny's Bill.  During the debate the Minister expressed his concerns about elements of the Bill and noted he was awaiting the HPRA&rsquo;s report on medicinal cannabis.  The Bill passed Second Stage and was referred to the select committee.  The Minister received the HPRA&rsquo;s report on 31 January.  He published the report on 10 February and announced that he will establish a medicinal cannabis access programme for certain medical conditions.  Last month the Minister established an expert reference group which is drafting guidelines to facilitate the prescription, supply and use of cannabis treatments for qualifying patients under the access programme.<\/p> <p>  The regulation of medicinal products and drugs is currently achieved by an array of enactments, including the Misuse of Drugs Acts, the Irish Medicines Board Acts and the Pharmacy Act, all of which aim to ensure medicines that reach the patient are of an acceptably high quality and are safe and effective for use by that patient.  The research, manufacture, marketing, distribution and promotion of medicinal products is regulated by European Union legislation, which has been implemented in Ireland by various regulations and orders.  The misuse of drugs framework already defines systems of control for the production, supply, import, export, record-keeping, research and destruction of controlled substances, including cannabis and its psychoactive extracts.  It also sets out the criminal sanctions that apply for possession, sale, supply or trafficking in controlled substances, including cannabis.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee will be aware that cannabis is currently a schedule 1 controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act and it is the most widely used illegal drug in Ireland.  Cannabis is not an authorised medicine and it has not gone through the normal regulatory procedures for medicines which are designed to protect patients and ensure treatments are supported by good evidence of their effectiveness and safety.  It is important to note that while there is a view that there is a legal impediment to prescribing cannabis, it is not the case.  The Minister for Health may grant a licence for cannabis, containing THC, where the licence application has been endorsed by a consultant.<\/p> <p>   The Department is of the view that the current Bill is not necessary and is not in the public interest as it proposes to establish a parallel regulatory process for cannabis and undermines the regulatory frameworks already in place for controlled drugs, medicines authorisation and the operation and oversight of retail pharmacies.  The Bill proposes to establish two new agencies, one of which, the cannabis regulation authority, will to a large extent duplicate functions already being carried out by other State agencies, in particular the HPRA and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  While the Department does not believe the legislation is appropriate or necessary, should the Oireachtas decide to proceed with the Bill, there are a number of issues which we would like to bring to its attention.  I have already referred to the cannabis regulation authority which is dealt with in Part 2 of the Bill and our concern that it establishes a parallel system of regulation cutting across the functions of existing agencies.<\/p><p>We are also concerned about the reference to the development of a consumer oriented licensing system in section 6(2)(b).  Cannabis is not a normal consumer product; it is a controlled drug.  We must ensure that any system that is established is patient oriented rather than consumer oriented and that it protects patients and the wider public.<\/p><p> There is a reference to fees in respect of the grant of a retail licence in section 27.  Retail licences are confined to pharmacies.  It is noted that retail pharmacies already pay a fee to register with the PSI and it difficult to see the justification for this additional fee on pharmacies to support a system of parallel regulation by the cannabis regulation authority.  There is also a reference to fees for &ldquo;signs relating to a licence&rdquo; in section 27(3).  This is a puzzling reference and suggests that pharmacies could be advertising by way of signage that they are licensed to sell cannabis products.  In our view, unless it is expected that a very large number of licences will be issued, the fee income is unlikely to meet the running costs of the proposed authority.<\/p><p> Part 3 establishes a cannabis research institute.  In the view of the Department, it is not necessary to establish such an institute.  There is already a considerable amount of research into the illegal or recreational use of cannabis.  If a researcher wishes to conduct clinical trials on cannabis, that is already permitted under existing legislation.<\/p><p> We note that one of the functions of the institute is to encourage employers to review drug-free workplace policies, as provided for in section 12(1)(b).  There are good reasons many employers have drug-free policies in place and we are unclear as to why a research institute would encourage them to review these policies.<\/p><p> We also note that it is a function of the institute, in section 12(1), to commission and publish research in the areas of safety, risks and benefits of medicinal and-or recreational use.  We are unclear why the institute would be mandated to commission research into the benefits of recreational cannabis.  There is a further reference to recreational cannabis in section 41.<\/p><p> Section 23(1) deals with disqualifications for holding a licence on conviction of certain offences.  It is noted that trafficking or sale or supply of illegal drugs is not specifically mentioned and that, according to section 23(7), a conviction for possessing cannabis will not disqualify a person from being granted or continuing to hold a licence under this legislation.<\/p><p> The Department notes that in Part 7, it is intended that a doctor will issue a certificate to patients, as provided for in section 32.  In the interests of patient safety, we believe that a prescription is more appropriate and that it should include details that are currently required to be present on prescriptions for controlled drugs.  The Department notes that the HPRA report recommends that for the access programme, patients should be under the care of a consultant and we would support this position.<\/p><p> The Department is particularly concerned about section 42 which removes cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  This means that possession, sale or supply of cannabis would no longer be an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  Cannabis would no longer be a controlled substance with the misuse of drugs framework.  While there are a number of offences created in the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill in sections 8, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 27, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 and 39, I would point out that there are no penalties in terms of fines or imprisonment specified for any of the offences outlined in this Bill.<\/p><p> There are other issues of concern and also technical problems with the Bill, for example, the use of the imperial system rather than the metric system in sections 16, 17 and 33.  However, it would take some time to go through the Bill on a section by section basis.<\/p><p> To conclude, the basic position of the Department is that we do not see this Bill as being necessary or in the public interest.  Cannabis has not gone through the normal regulatory procedures for medicines which are designed to protect patients.  The Bill places the regulation and oversight of medicinal cannabis under a unique and separate legislative and regulatory framework from all other health products.  This Bill attempts to circumvent existing regulatory regimes and establish a parallel system for cannabis.  Given that there is currently insufficient clinical evidence in respect of the efficacy and safety of many cannabis products we should proceed cautiously.  It is the view of the Minister for Health and the Department that at this time, the cannabis access programme is the responsible way to proceed.<\/p><p> I thank the Chair.  We will be happy to address any follow up questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017041300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Lennon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492071000,"counter":2349,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland here today to assist in the ongoing scrutiny of the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016.  I am the registrar and chief officer of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI.  I am joined today by Dr. Cora Nestor, head of pharmacy practice development with the PSI.<br\/><br\/>I will begin by explaining the role of the PSI as the pharmacy regulator.  I will then make some general points on the Minister&rsquo;s recently announced scheme to provide access to cannabis for medical reasons, followed by some specific points on proposed provisions in the Bill.  I will keep my remarks relatively brief and we will, of course, be happy to take questions from the committee.<br\/><br\/>The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland is the statutory regulator of pharmacists and pharmacies in Ireland and is established as a public body under the provisions of the Pharmacy Act 2007.  The PSI&rsquo;s core mission is to work to protect and promote the health, safety and well-being of patients and the public.  The PSI has a range of functions, established under legislation, which together create a regulatory framework intended to ensure the safety of patients and the public as users of pharmacy services.  Our functions include maintaining the registers of pharmacists, pharmaceutical assistants and pharmacies or retail pharmacy businesses, which is the terminology used in the Act.  We also set the requirements for pharmacists&rsquo; education, their continuing professional development and for their standards of professional conduct.<br\/><br\/>As part of our regulatory remit, we inspect retail pharmacy businesses to assess compliance with pharmacy, medicines, including veterinary medicines, and controlled drugs legislation.  We have powers to initiate investigations where we have reason to believe there may be serious non-compliance.  These inspections and investigations may involve co-operation with other relevant public bodies and may also lead to prosecution of persons and businesses who have committed offences under relevant provisions.  In the case of individual pharmacists about whom there is a serious concern, or a complaint made as to their fitness to practice, the PSI can initiate statutory conduct proceedings which, after due process, can lead to sanctions being imposed on individual pharmacists and-or restrictions being placed on their practice.  The PSI is, by law, independent in the exercise of its statutory functions.  For public accountability purposes, the PSI operates under the aegis of the Department of Health.  The PSI is governed by a 21 member council appointed by the Minister for Health.<br\/><br\/>As the committee is aware, on 10 February the Minister published the report, Cannabis for Medical Use &ndash; A Scientific Review, which had been produced at his request by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  I know that the committee has previously heard from the HPRA in respect of the report and its specific recommendations.  As the pharmacy regulator, the PSI does not have any direct role in the scientific review and approvals process for medicines.  However, given the role of the PSI as the regulator of the profession responsible for medicines supply, it is relevant to state that the PSI agrees with the HPRA statement to this committee on 7 March that, &quot;The best outcome for patients is the development of authorised ... cannabis-based medicines where the safety, effectiveness and quality can be assured, and understood by the patient and health care professionals.&quot;<br\/><br\/>In circumstances where cannabis products may be made available to meet specific patient need outside of the normal medicines authorisation process, the PSI agrees with the careful and prudent recommendation of the HPRA report, and the subsequent decision of the Minister, that a controlled access programme be established.  The PSI also agrees that the operation of the programme should involve careful monitoring, including the registration of patients, doctors and pharmacists who are participating in the programme.<br\/><br\/>On the use of cannabis for medical reasons, the PSI also notes the advice provided to the Minister for Health by the Chief Medical Officer, as published by the Department of Health on 6 March 2017.  In that advice, the CMO refers to the central role played by doctors and pharmacists in ensuring the safe and effective use of any drug that is prescribed.  He goes on to say:<\/p><blockquote>In establishing an access programme for medical cannabis, it is therefore critical that the views of these professionals, through their professional bodies, are considered.  Efforts are underway to ensure that the planned access programme reflects those views and that the roles and responsibilities of doctors and pharmacists in prescribing and dispensing cannabis for medical purposes are clarified prior to its establishment.<\/blockquote><p>The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI, as the pharmacy regulator, welcomes and support this engagement process and we are actively involved in the deliberations of the expert reference group which has been established.  The objectives of PSI&rsquo;s involvement are primarily focused on ensuring that the access scheme works for patients who are accessing cannabis for medical use under the scheme and that those patients can have their prescriptions dispensed by pharmacists in a timely, effective and safe way.<\/p><p> There are two specific points that PSI wishes to make on the Bill.  The role of the PSI is primarily to implement pharmacy and medicines law as enacted.  Hence I will leave it to my colleagues from the Department of Health to address in detail the provisions in Deputy Gino Kenny&rsquo;s Bill and what amendments the Department believes may be required, which Mr. Eugene Lennon addressed earlier.  I will make two points which are intended to be helpful to the committee in its consideration of the Bill.<\/p><p> As I mentioned earlier, the PSI operates the regulatory framework for pharmacists and pharmacies as prescribed in the Pharmacy Act 2007 and regulations made thereunder.  The PSI has been operating these provisions for ten years and our experience is that the regulatory framework is robust and works to protect the public.  The PSI believes that the current system of regulation is capable, subject to the views of the expert reference group, of regulating the supply of cannabis for medical use under the controlled access programme.  In so far as the Bill proposes that a parallel retail licensing scheme, including additional statutory inspections, would apply to registered retail pharmacy businesses, the PSI would regard this as an unnecessary duplication of existing provisions which are already well-proven in practice.<\/p><p> A central concern for the PSI is to ensure the public can rely on the professionalism of pharmacists and the quality of regulated pharmacy businesses when seeking to have medicines dispensed on foot of prescriptions from authorised prescribers.  In so far as the Bill proposes a system of medical certificates as being the basis on which supply would be made by a retail pharmacy business, the PSI is strongly of the view that moving away from the current requirements whereby medicine and controlled drugs can only be supplied on foot of an original and valid prescription, signed and dated by the prescriber, would represent a weakening of the overall regulatory control framework and an unnecessary deviation from well-established practice.<\/p><p> I assure the committee that the PSI, as the statutory and independent pharmacy regulator, takes its responsibilities towards public safety seriously and is committed to ensuring pharmacists and pharmacies can be trusted by patients and the public to provide safe and reliable pharmacy services.  The PSI is also committed to the well-being of the public and, in this regard, is playing an appropriate and assistive role in the design and implementation of the Minister&rsquo;s access programme for cannabis for medical use.  Once the access scheme is established, the PSI will ensure pharmacies and pharmacists comply with the provisions of the programme and we will also ensure pharmacists are fully aware of their duties and responsibilities to patients under the terms of the programme.  The PSI believes that the access programme can operate effectively within the current regulatory framework under the Pharmacy Act 2007 and related medicines and controlled drugs legislation.<\/p><p> I hope my opening statement has been helpful.  I thank the committee for its invitation here today and both I and Dr. Cora Nestor are happy to assist further by taking any questions which members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017041300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492071000,"counter":2351,"content":"<p>I will take questions from members of the committee, but I have a quick question of my own for Mr. Lennon.

I am a member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and I have two retail pharmacy businesses registered with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.  I am obviously a pharmacist.<\/p> <p>  I will refer to the access programme before I look at the Bill, and perhaps somebody from the Department could outline this matter very clearly to us.  My understanding is - perhaps I have misinterpreted it - that before any of this conversation started in recent times, with the advent of the Bill, the mechanism has always been there for an Irish-registered medical consultant to apply to the Minister for Health for access to a schedule 1 controlled drug under specific circumstances for a named patient under the consultant's care if the consultant is to dispense and monitor those.  There is and always has been a facility for an Irish-registered medical consultant to apply to the Minister before any access programme starts.  I would like that to be clarified for the committee.<\/p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke brought up the issue of the access programme.  I would like to know where we are and where we are going with that.  Three conditions are specified and my understanding is that it is not just three.  There are three now and there would be a view to including other conditions or indications as more data emerge.<\/p><p>Will the witnesses clarify the position?  The provision is not necessary in light of the fact that people can access this product if they have a proper prescription from the registered consultant.<\/p><p> I have an issue with the Minister for Justice and Equality being listed in the first section as opposed to the Minister for Health.  Is it not the latter who has the overriding power?<\/p><p> I have concerns about referring to the cohort of patients who might require this as \"consumers\".  They are patients.  Regardless of anything else, this is still a Schedule 1 controlled substance.  That is done to guarantee public safety, which Mr. Byrne mentioned was one of our roles.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Reilly referred to research.  It is my understanding that there is no barrier to research in that universities can get special exemptions for it.  We would never get anywhere if we did not have exemptions, particularly as we could not trial a drug.  Will the witnesses clarify the position in that regard?<\/p><p> Offences are listed in section 8, the final line of which reads, \"is guilty of an offence.\"  Perhaps I have missed it and someone from the Department will guide me, but is there a penalty - the word \"penalty\" is sensitive for some of us - for these offences?<\/p><p> As a pharmacist and a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, I have concerns about the functions of the institute listed under section 12(1)(a)(i), which refers to \"medicinal and\/or recreational use\".  It is strange that a Bill with \"Medicinal\" in its Title swings into a recreational format.  The so-called benefits of recreational use are a different conversation to the medicinal framework.<\/p><p> We have a very robust system of assessing the safety risks of medicines.  In my academic days, it used to be referred to - perhaps this is no longer the case - as the Swiss cheese theory.  We do not want the holes to line up and something to slip through that would damage patient health.  This subsection circumvents the rule that all of us in the field have worked hard to get right in order to protect patient safety.  Any shifting of those regulations could leave us with the Swiss cheese effect even though our first job is to do no harm.<\/p><p> The systems regulating the sale and supply of controlled drugs are robust and pharmacists must comply with the regulatory framework.  The public may not know it, but we take controlled drugs seriously.  We cannot have baskets of them lying on the counter.  Every tablet must be accounted for.  If one goes missing, the Garda needs to be called.  The destruction of controlled drugs must be monitored.  Let us say that cannabis is moved from being a Schedule 1 to a Schedule 2 drug.  Speaking in a professional capacity and assuming we can get concentrations and dosages right, the current framework is suitable and this substance could be slapped down on top of it.<\/p><p> I am not being sarcastic, but I do not understand the reference to drug-free workplace policies.  I hope that the consultant performing my operation or the pilot flying my plane is not using cannabis.  There must be a distinction between something that is okay and something that, as a psychoactive substance, will impair judgment.  We must be careful.<\/p><p> As I mentioned last week, it is currently the case that subscription medicines cannot be promoted to the public.  I cannot understand why there would be different rules for any Schedule 1 drug even if it is moving to another Schedule.  Perhaps someone can enlighten me on the situation.<\/p><p> I wish to address the dosing of medicines.  Perhaps Ms Egan will explain something.  Just because something has been around for a long time does not mean that it is all right.  Aspirin comes from the willow - I hope I am correct in that - and people gave children baby aspirin until recently.  That moved to age six and then 16 in my time.  Just because something is a naturally occurring product does not mean that it is okay.  For example, one will find out what happens if one eats enough foxglove.  Codeine used to be given to breastfeeding mothers but that changed in the period between my second and third children being born.  We are constantly building on evidence.  Once a drug is authorised, the yellow card reporting system keeps updating our data with what we learn.  All of this is done in the interest of public safety.<\/p><p> Perhaps one of the pharmacists will outline to the committee that, from a pharmacokinetics point of view, children are not small adults.  Their metabolic processes and how they process drugs are different.  If a child is one quarter my size, I cannot just quarter the dose.  Perhaps someone will articulate the distinct pharmacokinetic difference between a child's metabolism and that of an adult.<\/p><p> Someone might enlighten me as to why there are references to the imperial system of measurement, for example, ounces.  I do not understand why we would measure anything in ounces.  I am very concerned about the lack of detail on dosing and concentration.  As a pharmacist, I would find it difficult to dispense something if I did not know what it contained.<\/p><p> I will add something before I drive everyone completely mad.<\/p><p>My understanding is that if this Bill goes to the D&aacute;il and is voted through, any doctor would be able to prescribe cannabis for any patient, for any condition, anywhere in this country.  That includes children and pregnant women, breast-feeding women and people on multiple medications.  When we dispense we look at dosage, indications, side effects, contra-indications and interactions with other medicines, as well as people with reduced kidney and liver function, whether over time, because of age or because of other diseases.  This is of great concern to me.  When the HPRA authorises something, it rubber-stamps it as being okay.  It is not okay to be ingesting cannabis, either by eating it, smoking it or taking it transdermally while also breast-feeding a neonate, as it is deposited in breast milk.

I confirm that, as Deputy O'Connell said, a system is in place for a licence to be issued for the prescription, possession and importation of cannabis-based treatments that contain THC if that application for a licence is endorsed by a consultant.  As we said, a licence has been issued so a system is in place under current legislation.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is also right that the legislation should refer to the Minister for Health because it concerns controlled drugs and medicinal products.  On the question of penalties, a lot of offences are listed in this Bill and it removes cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act.  However, while there are offences under this Bill, there are no penalties, no terms of imprisonment and no fines for any of those offences so there is no deterrent effect.<\/p> <p>  Ms Egan and our PSI colleagues will say a bit more about protecting children and women but these are issues which the expert reference group will look at.  The expert group will focus initially on cannabis products being made available for the three conditions outlined by the Minister on 10 February but it is essential that it is not closed off from other conditions in the future.  We have to provide guidelines for clinicians and pharmacists and information for patients so that we protect them.  This is an unauthorised and unregulated product so we have to be cautious and prudent in setting up a scheme to make it available to members of the public.

The evidence for the effectiveness of cannabis, which is being discussed in the public domain at the moment, in treating a number of conditions, including curing some serious medical conditions, is anecdotal and such an approach ignores the fact that the scientific data supporting them do not exist.  As a result of these concerns it is very important that the access programme draws on the expertise of medical specialists who are responsible for the management of the qualifying patient groups.<\/p> <p>  The HPRA's report concluded that robust scientific evidence on safety and effectiveness does not support the use of cannabis for clinical indications other than in very limited cases.  Its review concluded that the cannabis access programme that is being established could include access to cannabis-based therapies for the treatment of patients with spasticity associated with MS, resistant to all standard therapies and interventions; intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy despite the use of standard anti-emetic regimes; and severe refractory treatment-resistant epilepsy that has failed to respond to standard anti-convulsant medications.  Under the access programme, patients with a diagnosis of any of these medical conditions will be under the care of a specialist consultant.  We would all agree that the use of cannabis products in patients, especially children, with these very serious medical conditions should only be permitted under the direction and supervision of a specialist doctor.  This is particularly important given that very few cannabis products are authorised as medicines.<\/p><p>As my colleague has already said, they have not gone through the normal regulatory approval process for medicines which are, of course, designed to protect patients and ensure treatments are supported by good evidence of their effectiveness and safety.  Through our work in setting up the cannabis access programme, we are engaging with clinicians, patients and pharmacists who will be central to the work of drawing up guidelines on the safe use of cannabis for those patients who will be prescribed these treatments through the access programme.  A reference group has been established and is being independently chaired by Dr. M&aacute;ir&iacute;n Ryan, the director of health technology assessment at HIQA.  She is also an assistant professor in pharmacoeconomics at Trinity College Dublin.<\/p><p> The aim of the group is to produce operational, clinical and practice guidelines for the access programme for medicinal cannabis in Ireland and to answer many of the operational questions that have been identified to date.  This process is being informed by the HPRA report.  The membership of that group draws on a broad range of representation from areas including oncology, palliative care, anaesthesiology and general practice.  There are two patient representatives on the group.  It includes adult and paediatric neurology, multiple sclerosis, psychiatry, pharmacy practice, the pharmacy regulator, health care ethics, a health technology assessor and the health products regulator and ourselves.  The reference group began its work on 30 March and it is making progress on the drafting of the guidelines.<\/p><p> As well as having regard to the HPRA report, the group will also be guided by other international scientific evidence in developing these operational guidelines and implementing the programme.  The focus of the work is to provide an operational framework as to how the scheme will work into the future.  It needs to address clear questions such as the clinical criteria for patients accessing cannabis for medicinal purposes.  It will include areas such as the use of any of these particular products in specific patient populations such as expectant mothers or whether there would be contra-indications for specific patient populations.<\/p><p> The cannabis access programme will be established but ultimately the decision on the appropriate course of treatment for any patient will be a matter for the clinician treating that patient and the Minister for Health would not have a role at that stage.  Somebody asked how long it will take to finalise the guidelines.  In announcing this programme, the Minister has requested that the group complete its work by the end of June this year so the access programme can be up and running as soon as possible.  This work is well under way but it will take time to generate the answers to these fundamental and very important operational issues that need to be addressed.  There is also the question of legislation that will be required to underpin the programme.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Connell asked about other conditions that were not included in the HPRA report.  Whereas the HPRA report did not conclude that certain other indications should be facilitated through the cannabis access programme, this does not mean patients cannot access such treatments if the consultant deems it appropriate.  My colleague has already explained that the licence application process remains open to a consultant to apply for a named patient if assurance can be provided that the treatment will be monitored and overseen for that patient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017041300002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Egan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492071000,"counter":2367,"content":"<p>To follow up on the comments from the Department of Health officials, the position of the PSI is as set out in our statement.  We very much support the work to develop the access programme and the members of staff of the PSI are involved with that work.  We are very committed to ensuring our contribution to that work is very much focused, as I stated earlier in my statement, on the principle that the access scheme will work for patients accessing cannabis for medical use.  From the point of view of supply being made through registered pharmacies by registered pharmacists, all of that would be on a safe, sustainable and proper footing.  In exercising their professional judgment, pharmacists should do so in circumstances where there is as much clarity as possible in the decisions they make.  A registered pharmacy is not just a shop and it is very important to say it is a particular type of service.  It is governed by very clear regulatory requirements as to how the service operates.  With regard to the dispensary aspect of a pharmacy in particular, it would operate under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist, who is subject to accountability requirements of the PSI and a statutory code of conduct.  Everything the pharmacist does happens within the regulated entity and the pharmacist exercises his or her professional judgment at all times.  The PSI position is that this creates an appropriate scheme of regulation that is focused very clearly on the safety of the public.  The code of conduct goes into these matters in great detail and the PSI's role is to ensure those mechanisms work in practice.<\/p> <p>  In circumstances where we are looking at an access programme that represents a degree of change to existing circumstances, we have no reason to believe that pharmacists in general would not be disposed to following the PSI concept of engaging in and taking part in developments that are about trying to meet patient need in new and different kinds of ways.  At all times this desire would be balanced with the need to maintain public safety.  The balance is not easy or simple and the deliberations of the committee are very much highlighting that complexity.  Our role is to try to be part of that balancing discussion while bringing our expertise and experience to bear on that.<\/p> <p>  In summary, we believe the access programme accords with those kinds of principles and the requirements of public safety.  We are very keen to be involved in ensuring it delivers for patients who come to a pharmacy with a prescription so they can have the prescription dispensed in a safe and effective way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017041300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1492071000,"counter":2368,"content":"<p>Could the witnesses refer to the fact that we are always learning and the yellow card system?

Did that office express any particular views on this Bill as proposed and on the broader issue of the HPRA's recommendations on the access programme or were its views sought?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the European Medicines Agency and its recommendations, does it follow suit that if a medicine is recommended by the European Medicines Agency the Health Products Regulatory Authority is obliged to licence use of the product in this State or does the European Medicines Agency supersede the Health Products Regulatory Authority?

Is the Bill not in public interest because it proposes to establish parallel regulatory authorities or because of concern about health implications?  Perhaps Mr. Lennon would elaborate on that issue.<\/p> <p>  On the access programme, is there sufficient architecture in place in terms of regulation to allow for the dissemination of cannabis for medicinal purposes through the pharmacies or is additional regulation or legislation required to fulfil the HPRA access programme recommendations?  <\/p> <p>  The report states that there is evidence to suggest that this product could be beneficial in the treatment of pain, although some of that evidence is not supported by broad clinical trials.

What specific experience, knowledge or expertise do the Department of Health officials or the PSI representatives have in the area of medicinal cannabis, research in that area or clinical expertise in the specific area of medicinal cannabis products?  My understanding - I am happy to be contradicted - is that they have no such knowledge, expertise or experience.  Also, what specific experience, knowledge or expertise does the HPRA have in the area of medicinal cannabis products because it has cited none in its report and to my knowledge it has none.  Again, I am happy to be contradicted.<\/p> <p>  Why do the Department of Health recommendations run counter to the evidence provided by people who have extensive knowledge and expertise in the area of medicinal cannabis, namely, Professor Mike Barnes, consultant neurologist, professor of neurological rehabilitation and author of the authoritative report on medicinal cannabis for the UK Parliament.  According to Professor Barnes the evidence is strongest for the efficacy of medicinal cannabis in the area of pain whereas the so-called access programme being proposed excludes this cohort.  Professor Mike Barnes and Professor David Finn, who has spent 16 years researching the area of medicinal cannabis, say that this is the area where the evidence is strongest yet this is the area excluded by the access programme.<\/p><p>I would like an explanation for how that could be the case.<\/p><p> Could the witnesses explain what they will do for the 800,000 people in Ireland who suffer from chronic pain, of whom 40% do not get relief from existing authorised pain killers, according to Professor David Finn.  Do the witnesses believe it is acceptable that cohort, a very significant number of people who get no relief from existing authorised pain killers, should continue to be criminalised for using medicinal cannabis products?   If we adopt the witnesses' recommendations, that will be the case.  They will be criminals.  They are currently criminals and they will stay criminals.  Do the witnesses think that is acceptable?<\/p><p> How would the witnesses respond to a survey of GPs in this country which showed that 58.6% of GPs, the people who do not regulate and do not sell medicine but who actually prescribe it and are medical professionals, favour the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal use.  An even higher proportion of GPs with advanced addiction specialist training level 2 agreed or agreed strongly that cannabis should be decriminalised, bringing the percentage to 60%.  Do the Department of Health, the PSI and the HPRA think they know better than GPs, particularly GPs who specialise in the area of addiction?  I put it to them that they do not.  I find it incomprehensible that they are second-guessing them.<\/p><p> Could the witnesses tell us what they have done to look into the five other EU countries, subject to the same EU directives in terms of the regulation of medicines, which have adopted legislation similar to that proposed by Deputy Gino Kenny allowing for wide access to medicinal cannabis based on the prescription of certification of GPs and not requiring consultants?  Could they confirm that consultants have no legal status in Irish law?<\/p><p> Could they tell us how many people die from products that are authorised pain killers or other drugs authorised by the HPRA, specifically benzodiazepines and opiates, every year in Ireland?  That would be useful.  Following that, could they then tell us how many people are known to have died from medicinal cannabis products anywhere, in Ireland or elsewhere?  We have testimony from Professors Mike Barnes and David Finn that the side effects of medicinal cannabis products, and they acknowledge there were some, were moderate.  Is that how they would describe the potential side effects or adverse consequences of the misuse of drugs that are already authorised, particularly opiates and benzodiazepines?  How do they square that circle, or inconsistency, that we already regulate, authorise and sell drugs that are toxic, that kill people and that are regularly misused but that we propose to have a higher level of restriction on a medicinal product which although it may have some side effects, there is no evidence they are anywhere as serious as the effects of drugs already authorised and sold in chemists up and down the country on the basis of a GP's prescription?<\/p><p> Some red-herrings have been thrown into this debate.  Could the Department of Health confirm that we have stated repeatedly in both public and private meetings, in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere, that we are more than willing to amend this Bill in many of the areas on which concern has been raised.  For example, we would be quite happy - in fact, we agree - that the Minister of Health is the Minister who should be referred to.  The reason we referred to the Minister for Justice was because of the current criminalisation.  All we want with this Bill is one that will allow access to people who could medically benefit from cannabis products on the recommendation, or prescription if people want to change it to that, of a medical professional and that it would be regulated.  There would be continuous research in the area on an ongoing basis to establish the efficacy, effects and consequences of medicinal cannabis use.  That is the centrepiece of this Bill.  We are quite willing to consider amendments on everything else which has been raised, whether on penalties or on where in the Schedule it should go, and which are incidental to the central thrust of this Bill which is one to allow medical professionals, not just consultants, but GPs or other medical professionals to be able to prescribe or recommend medical cannabis to any patient who would benefit from it.  That is the core of this Bill.  Does the Department of Health not know that we are happy to accept amendments?  Could it explain why that is problematic?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017041300002#J00500","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492071000,"counter":2377,"content":"<p>I am trying to be objective but when I heard the HPRA report was out, a small part of me wondered if maybe it was progress and that it might be a small step towards what we set out seven or eight months ago and that people who are suffering unnecessarily could gain access to medicinal cannabis.  I thought there could be a small bit of small progress but then I read the HPRA report and what exactly the cannabis access programme is.  The cannabis access programme being approved by the Government is not progress; it is regressive.  It stipulates three conditions but leaves out chronic pain.  This is absolutely bizarre.  The Barnes report, which is a very well respected report, states that chronic pain is the No. 1 issue where medical cannabis can be very effective.  That is across the board.  The three conditions named in the programme are spasticity, intractable epilepsy and the side-effects of chemotherapy.  What drugs will be administered for those treatments?<\/p><p>I understand the drugs that will be administered for those three treatments will be Sativex, Epidiolex and probably one or two other pharmaceutical-grade cannabis-based products.  There is a family in the North of Ireland whose daughter has Dravet syndrome and who have been turned down for Epidiolex.  If the cannabis access programme stipulates that it can be administered only in pharmaceutical-grade products, it is going nowhere.  We set out seven or eight months ago that people should have access to the full plant extract.<\/p><p> There have been two applications for licences.  One was successful while the other was not, which is good for one family and very bad for the other.  The officials say that this is the kind of programme which the Minister can admit.  What do they say to hundreds of people who want to access that licence system?  It is completely unsustainable.  The Minister will have 400 or 500 applications in respect of the system.  I would like the officials to comment on that.  I asked Mike Barnes last week what he thought of our compassionate access scheme for a licence and he said it is completely unworkable.  That is why we want our Bill to go through, to give the many who could benefit from it access to medicinal cannabis on the full plant extract.<\/p><p> As Deputy Boyd Barrett said, there is duplication.  If the HPRA can do what we propose in the Bill for a cannabis regulation authority, so be it.  I do not want duplication or another quango in this country.

I wish Deputy O'Connell was still here to answer too.  She stated that one can overdose on CBD oil but one cannot.

That is immoral.  They should have the choice to go to their GP or consultant to get medicine that may not be recognised by the HPRA.

He believes there is an established system of regulation for medicines and controlled drugs in place already and that we are setting up a parallel system for one substance, cannabis, and undermining the systems that exist for medicines and controlled drugs.  There is also the concern about the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, and I take on board Deputy Boyd Barrett's point that was not the intention.

We reckon we will need at least three in respect of the access programme.<\/p> <p>  Returning to some of the other points that were made, my colleague will deal with the question about the European Medicines Agency, EMA.  Outside of the access programme, it will still be open to people to apply for a licence where their consultant endorses the treatment and feels it appropriate.  If somebody has another condition outside of the three that are in the access programme initially, it is open for a consultant to apply for a licence for treatment with cannabis.  It was suggested that we would be overwhelmed with licence applications.  That will obviously not be the case.  We have not had very many to date.  The access programme itself will not require a licence as that is not how it is being set up.  Patients will be on a register for treatment under it.<\/p> <p>  As reference has been made to the Barnes report, it is worth noting that the Minister initiated his review of policy on medicinal cannabis last November and now we are working on the guidelines for an access programme.  Professor Barnes published his report in the UK well over a year ago and there is no progress there.  There is no access programme or any change in anything.  We are making a lot of progress very quickly in Ireland, partly because the HPRA programme set out how something could work in a practical health care setting.  <\/p> <p>  Reference has been made to other European countries.  The numbers receiving cannabis are not as high as one might think.  Our understanding is that in the Netherlands, a country with a population of 16 million people where there has been access to cannabis for medical purposes for over a decade, we are talking about 2,000 patients in total.  The idea that 40% of 800,000 Irish patients will end up on cannabis is not realistic.  The numbers in other European countries are quite small.  In some of them, the access programmes are only getting going at the moment.  Denmark's population is greater than Ireland's by about 1 million.  They reckon that after four years they might have up to 1,500 people on their access programme.  The HPRA said that there are three countries in Europe with more liberal regimes and about eight countries with access programmes.  Ireland is joining those eight countries.  The majority of EU countries still do not even have an access programme for cannabis.<\/p> <p>  There is a lot of talk about the risk from benzodiazepines and other products.  That does not pertain to the substance of this Bill.  We have set out what we believe are issues around this Bill.  The benzodiazepine question is a different issue not covered by the proposed legislation.  Some of the issues in that regard have to do with the illegal sale of benzos rather than those prescribed by doctors and dispensed by pharmacists.  Yes, benzos cause problems for people and they are misused.  However, if used appropriately, they are of benefit to patients and there is a positive benefit-risk ratio when those products are used appropriately.  That is a different argument from what is proposed here in respect of cannabis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017041300002#M01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Lennon"},{"type":"speech","time":1492071000,"counter":2416,"content":"<p>If I may interrupt for a moment, I am obliged by another commitment to absent myself from the chair for a short time.

That remit covers the regulation of retail pharmacy businesses and of pharmacists as registered professionals.  We do not claim to be experts in areas beyond that remit.  In respect of giving a view that would be helpful to the committee, we are obviously not here to comment on actions by other professionals.  However, the role of pharmacists is not simply to stand in the dispensary and hand over whatever a prescription specifies when it is presented.  Pharmacists are expected and indeed required by the regulatory framework to use their professional skills, competencies and specialist knowledge about medicines to ensure that a patient only receives medicine that is going to be safe and efficacious in respect of his or her specific needs.  Our code of practice is a statutory code of conduct against which pharmacists are held accountable to the highest level.  It states that there may be circumstances in which the judgment of the pharmacist might conflict with the stated requirements of the patient.  That is the exercise of professional judgment.<\/p><p>These are not simple matters.  Our system of control for medicines to ensure the safety of patients and the public does involve various checks and balances.<\/p><p> Deputy Boyd Barrett made a point about GPs issuing prescriptions.  I do not have a view on the manner in which GPs issue prescriptions.  That is entirely a matter for GPs.  Our system does not work in such a way that a prescription leads to the supply of specified medicines.  The pharmacist plays an important role and exercises his or her judgment on what is or is not dispensed in terms of a prescription.  Pharmacists commonly engage with GPs and other medical professions on what is specified on prescriptions and whether it is intended and efficacious for the patient.  There can be a lot of dialogue between the relevant professions.  It is not simply a case of prescription equals supply.  That is not the way the system works.<\/p><p> We are all very concerned about the well-being of people who find themselves in circumstances where they need access to medicines.  They may have conditions that are quite intractable and resistant to conventional forms of treatment.  I hope I noted Deputy Boyd Barrett's words correctly that he uttered in the heat of the moment.  It is important to note the following.  It is not the case that we, as an Irish society, sell drugs that kill people.  That is not what happens.  No pharmacy knowingly sells drugs that can kill people.  Medicines have inherent risks.  Many medicines are toxic and have toxic effects, as we all know.  It is important that the Deputy's statement does not simply sit on the record.  He possibly did not intend to make the suggestion.  In practice, we all seek to minimise and balance the risks of medicines of all kinds with the potential benefits.  As the committee reported in its report on medicinal cannabinoids that it published last January, there are risks and potential benefits.  The report called for careful cognisance of the attendant risks and made the following recommendation.  The foreword stated: \"It is the Committee&rsquo;s view that Ireland should pursue a balanced course of action in considering the merits of authorising the use of medicinal cannabinoids\".  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, as the regulator of pharmacies, supports that position because we feel it is in the public's interest.  The foreword contained a public interest statement.  My colleague, Dr. Nestor, will make a few helpful points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017041300002#M01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492071000,"counter":2423,"content":"<p>As mentioned previously, the qualification for pharmacists is laid down in statute under EU legislation.

I do not doubt that the organisations employs experts in their fields.  I want to know who we have taken advice from.  Are they experts who know nothing or a lot about cannabis?  I suggest to Mr. Lennon that we would be better off taking advice from experts who know something or a lot about cannabis.  I wish to advise the committee that I shall formally write to the clerk of the committee requesting that the committee arranges an engagement with Professor Mike Barnes.  It is the least that we can do if we want to have a comprehensive view of this matter.  I say to Mr. Lennon that the fact the British political system has not responded to the recommendations made by Professor Barnes is irrelevant.  Will our attitude to medicinal cannabis be informed by somebody as expert and knowledgeable as Professor Barnes or by people who have no knowledge whatsoever about cannabis?  Professor David Finn is professor of pharmacology and has studied cannabis for 16 years.  He explained in great detail how there was strong evidence at every level to support the efficacy of cannabis-based products to relieve pain, as did Professor Barnes.<\/p> <p>  Professor Finn told this committee that there was a significant unmet need.  I asked the witnesses what they would do to solve the unmet need.  Mr. Lennon told me how many or how few thousand people availed of access programme in other countries but he did not answer my question. What will the Department's access programme do for the unmet need whereby people do not get pain relief from existing drugs?  I put it to him that the programme will leave them out in the cold and label them criminals if they attempt to access the product.  I asked the witnesses whether they thought it acceptable that such people were criticised and that the access programme left them out in the cold.  I put it to them that it is unacceptable.  I further asked them to respond to the fact that the majority of GPs in this country, and a higher proportion of GPs with specific knowledge in the area of addiction, favour the decriminalising of cannabis for medicinal purposes.

The argument that has been put forward would, to my mind, suggest that any novel drug would have such issues.  Nobody has expertise because it did not exist before.  Consider this for any new product, for example, in yesterday's great announcement with Orkambi.  There was nobody in the Department who knew anything about Orkambi until the data came through from the manufacturer, because the data did not exist.  I believe the argument being put forward about the lack of experts in the field is a null argument.<\/p> <p>  The extensive undergraduate programme and training for pharmacists gives us the capacity, through our knowledge of pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and all of that, to apply those professionally acquired skills to make reasoned decisions in the interest of public safety once a new drug comes on to the market.  A pharmacist does not just stop learning the day he or she gets a certificate, but instead he or she constantly learns and updates knowledge.  There are quite cumbersome processes in place for that level of expertise to be maintained, all in the interest of public health.  I do not think it is fair to suggest that because something is new, some lad has to go off and do a degree in Orkambi or whatever.  We have the skill set, as does the technical end of the pharmacology sector.<\/p> <p>  I refer to an expert, a professor of pharmacology, who was before the committee.  Perhaps I am wrong but I do not believe that scientists, as in pharmacologists, as distinct from pharmacists, have any professional regulatory ethical body.  Maybe I am wrong about that.  Nonetheless, a pharmacologist is a scientist in a laboratory environment with no interaction with actual people or patients.  There is a distinct difference between a pharmacologist and pharmacist.  Pharmacologists are not mentioned in any of the regulations about misuse of drugs.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the fact the majority of GPs in this country are up for this.  I have seen no study which shows that to be the case, and it is regrettable that the Chairman, Deputy Michael Harty, is not here.

These consultants deal with patients and families every day.<\/p><p>I have spoken to a number of them about the cannabis and THC issue and they tell me the scientific papers they have read about it.  The same applies for any other new treatment coming along.  They inform and educate themselves about new treatments and they are anxious to find them.  If new treatments are available, they will upskill for those treatments.  As I noted from the earlier statement, if they are unwilling to prescribe currently, it is generally because they are not satisfied with the level of clinical evidence that is available.  That is what I have to say about expertise.<\/p><p> The access programme is progressing and people are working on guidelines.  They are also looking at guidelines that exist in other countries.  I know in the past week that the people in the expert group drawing up the guidelines for clinicians and prescribers, as well as information for patients, have been looking at information from Australia, the United States, Canada and other places.  They have considered the type of guidelines that would help inform the various health professionals when it comes to prescribing cannabis and dispensing and supplying cannabis-based treatments for people.  We are looking at what happens abroad.  I know that when the HPRA did its report, it contacted medicines agencies and experts in other countries as part of its work.<\/p><p> Reference was made to a survey of GPs and I understand there was a 15% response rate to the survey.  The survey was probably taken before this Bill was published and before the access programme or the publication of the HPRA report.  The question may not be directly relevant.  Of the minority of GPs that responded, the numbers given by Deputy Boyd Barrett are accurate regarding those who said that medicinal cannabis should be available in some form.  In a sense, it is.  There is the option of the licence when endorsed by a consultant.  There will be the option of the access programme for the three conditions initially and possibly for other conditions in future.  In parallel with the access programme, the licensing option will still exist.  If a consultant has a particular patient where nothing is working, based on the reading of scientific papers the consultant may believe that cannabis-based treatment may be the right option.  The consultant can then apply to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017041300002#O02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Lennon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492071000,"counter":2450,"content":"<p>That is outside the three conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017041300002#P00200","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492071000,"counter":2451,"content":"<p>Yes.  We have informed both health professionals and patients that this continues to be the case when they contact us.  The reluctance comes from the fact that many consultants are not happy with the state of the clinical evidence.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked the difference between medicinal cannabis and cannabis, which is interesting.  Sometimes the terminology can be used to distinguish between street cannabis and cannabis that people wish to take for medical purposes.  Sometimes the cannabis is the same in the sense that it is the same dried cannabis material that is grown.  It is the whole-plant cannabis that Deputy Gino Kenny referred to.  It is available in certain countries, such as Canada or the Netherlands, and one can get a tub of leaf cannabis.  It is the same material that people might smoke illegally in a recreational way.  In other cases, what people refer to as medicinal cannabis has been processed further into an oil, powder or some other form.  It is the same constituent material and there are different strengths to cannabis, as there are with recreational or illegal cannabis.  There are different strengths of THC and CBD when cannabis is used for medicinal purposes.  It is the same material and the purpose can be different.  Sometimes the form is also different.  There is an cannabis product, Sativex, which is authorised for treatment of multiple sclerosis and there are synthetic cannabinoids that are authorised, including Nabilone.  There is a pure CBD product going through clinical trials now that is called Epidiolex.  It is at phase 3 trials and some of the health professionals working in the epilepsy are quite interested in seeing the results of the next stage of those trials.<\/p> <p>  There is the question of indemnity.  We checked with the State Claims Agency and it indicated that if a consultant is prescribing cannabis, either under licence from the Minister or part of the access programme, he or she will be covered by the clinical indemnity scheme in those cases.  I suppose in the way it is operating currently, the treatment must be endorsed by a consultant in either through licence or the access programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2017041300002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Lennon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492071000,"counter":2452,"content":"<p>There was a question from Deputy Durkan about whether one medicine would have the same effect on anyone that it was given to.  That is not the case.  Once a medicine is authorised, it is done for specific patient populations and contraindicated in many cases as well.  The doses will be different for separate patients and the same dose would not apply to an adult as against a child or even with a patient with reduced kidney or liver function.  Doses must be adjusted.  That point is particularly relevant when one thinks about the use of cannabis.  The endocannabinoid system, which is the system of cannabinoids in the body, was really only discovered in the late 1990s.  Professor Finn probably went into much detail about how little is known about that system and how we do not know how cannabis interacts with that system, produces its effects and may interfere with other medicines that a patient may be taking.  It could result in an enhanced effect of some other prescribed medicines or reduce the intended effect.  Those outcomes will potentially be negative for a patient.  The issue must be very carefully thought through before any decision is made about prescribing any medicine to a patient.

In the space of just a few months, there has been an expert report, an access programme and an expert group that is drawing up the guidelines for that programme.  The situation is moving rapidly.  Twelve months ago, the position was that cannabis was illegal and could not be used for any medical purpose.  We are now on a particular pathway and are proceeding in what we regard as a responsible way, given that we are discussing a product for which there is not sufficient clinical evidence and that is not an authorised medicine.

I have made a submission that sets out the background and some of the context of building control in Ireland but I would like to address some of the issues, principally the features of a cost-effective and robust system that accords with international best practice.<\/p> <p>  First, I will explain why housebuilding is high risk.  This sector is very vulnerable to non-compliance and needs robust controls of construction to protect life and reliable consumer protections to protect property.  These issues are not unique to Ireland and are a consequence of the way that housing is procured, which is generally different to construction procured under commercial contracts between an owner and a builder.  The housebuilding sector requires immediate and sustained focus, particularly the areas of spec-building and self-building.  There are two separate issues but the nub of both relates to the role of the State and the responsibilities of owners.  First, there is a State building control system which is to protect people.  The role of the State is to ensure that all buildings are safe and sustainable.  The first aspect of that is to ensure technical compliance in order to make occupation by owners safe and to make buildings sustainable.  The second aspect is protection of the State to ensure technical compliance on energy efficiency, environmental protections and contamination.  Aside from that, there is the issue of protection of property which involves consumer safeguards, particularly for owners and buyers who invest in housing and apartments because they are buying a product.  Consumer protection is important.  Building control means technical standards such as fire safety, access for the disabled, structural design, drainage, staircases, sound transmission between apartments.  These are compliance issues that can be measured by a professional.  They can be designed, measured, checked and tested, and a professional can stand over them.  Consumer protection issues concern the property, the product delivered from the market by a developer or a construction company.  This is important because problems do not appear immediately, they often take a lot of time.<\/p> <p>  In commercial and institutional buildings, such as schools, hospitals, hotels, factories, offices and shops the owner and the builder are separate entities.  Contracts are generally in place to deal with issues on site and latent defects after completion.  This is because commercial owners are generally more experienced, more invested in the durability and quality of building they produce and protect their capital investment through professional oversight, warranties, insurance and retention moneys.  There are mechanisms in place for that.  One size, however, does not fit all.  In housing, the owner and developer in a spec development situation or self-build are the same entity and these protections are not in place.  There is a conflict of interest.  The role of the State needs to be defined.  Its role is to protect consumers because they could be involved in this process without any of these safeguards and to protect people who come in at the end of the process and buy the product because the seller - the developer - may not be around by the time the problems appear.<\/p><p> For a home buyer, some elements of non-compliance technical issues might be evident or provable at completion but many defects take some time to appear and they can be complex and take a great deal of time, effort and legal issues to unravel.  They could be due to design faults, construction errors, an issue with low-quality materials or a failure of products, components or equipment that are put into the building.  Over time, all of these problems could be compounded by poor maintenance, subsequent work to the building, accidental damage or even just the environmental conditions of the material.  The priority in all of this consumer protection should be about fixing the problem first and sorting out the claims later.  It is more important to the consumer to get the issue dealt with.<\/p><p> We must ask why this is happening, where the flaws are in the system that allowed it to happen and what went wrong at Priory Hall, Longboat Quay and other developments.  First, there was an absence of third-party oversight of design and construction to prevent non-compliance at the design stage and on site.  Under the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, the legal responsibility is on the owner to appoint somebody to police the system.  In the case of a self-builder or a developer, however, they are effectively appointing somebody to police themselves so there is a conflict of interest there.  In addition, the appointed person does not have to be independent of the process and they have no legal powers.<\/p><p> The second issue is a lack of regulation of housing developers.  I make a distinction here between housing developers and builders.  The nature of the market is that most work is subcontracted.  A housing developer is undertaking an enterprise.  They may or may not have experience in the building industry and they may not be qualified or have technical expertise.  That is fine as they will appoint numerous people under them.  The regulation of the housing developer - the person controlling the process, controlling the supply chain and selling to the owner - is important here rather than the regulation of builders.  Speculative housebuilding probably does not have the same priority of the building being durable or a long-term investment.  That is another concern.<\/p><p> The third point is that there are inadequate consumer protections.  This relates to the legal rights and remedies for these people.<\/p><p> Those three issues were failings in the past that have not been addressed under BCAR.  The principal focus of BCAR is the availability of documentation, some improvements in the home warranty scheme and some statutory registration.  However, these are very much secondary issues to the core problem that people have with defective units.  BCAR has also been presented to consumers as a solution to the two problems of the protection of life and the protection of property.  This is a difficulty for a number of reasons.  First, the scope of building control regulations is not to protect property but to protect life.  Building control was never intended to be used as a 100% asset guarantee on a commercial property transaction.  That is a problem for the State because the scope of the State involvement has been stretched.<\/p><p> The second issue is what constitutes this rolling set of guarantees that has been promised and what it means.  Nobody is quite clear what it means.  Is it a single point liability on one person?  In that case, is it insurable?  Is the owner of a defective property expected to sue one person, and that person sues down the line, or is the owner of the defective property expected to sue everybody and hope something might stick?  There is no clarity on that.  There is also the problem that if the courts decide in the coming years that a compliance certificate is a property guarantee - and the courts will have to decide that - there might not be any insurance available to meet that award.  Even if an owner gets an award in court, professional insurance might not step in to deal with that.  The professional has no control over whether his or her insurance meets that claim.  That is a decision for the insurance companies.<\/p><p> It is clear that home buyers with problems will have to litigate or enter into arbitration or both.  There is no mechanism for them.  The new home warranties available in the market are limited in time and cover.  They do not include pyrite and there are other exclusions.  The expectation that professional insurance will stretch to cover these claims is doubtful.  In any event, it will be the professional insurance company which will decide if that is the case.  There is no guarantee that the professional insurance will be available or affordable for these claims in the future.  There is a great deal of doubt regarding this.  There are justified fears among professionals about entering into open-ended liability for the work of others on this and not just on their own work.  Under our legal system, if one is found 1% responsible, one can be 100% liable for the cost.  There are genuine fears among people that they could have a very small input into a problem yet they could carry the risk of all of it and their insurance might not be available to them.<\/p><p> The other difficulty is that all of the paperwork - the micromanagement of certificates, sub-certificates and sub-sub-certificates - is a barrier to collaboration.  It is a waste of resources and a barrier to the use of shared technologies.  Owners in this system have the cost of managing and paying for the system but they do not have any certainty about benefits.  There is a question over cost and benefit in the system.<\/p><p> To summarise on the costs, BCAR was designed to be forensic.  It was designed to document and record every process and every component.  That is very expensive.  The question is whether the market can bear this level of cost.  Increasingly, there is an administrative drain in this regard.  There is also a drain on people with the expertise to do the work properly to this level.  As a result, there are wide variations in how it is being interpreted on the ground.  At one end, commercial owners in many cases are paying very high costs for a quality assurance, QA, that is gold-plated.  If owners feel that is justified with their investment, they should be allowed to do it.  However, I am not sure that the State should regulate for it.  At the other end of the market, it has reverted to business as usual.  Certificates and inspections are available at low cost and there is a significant risk of repetition of past failings.<\/p><p> In terms of resources, the issue is that BCAR was rolled out at a time of very low levels of construction activity.  We already have a skills shortage.  There is an anticipation that there will be full employment next year, but there are 80,000 new jobs anticipated in construction.  Will the system be fit for purpose if we double the output in the coming years?  If there is a substantial change in construction technical methods which we have to achieve by 2020 and there is an influx of tens of thousands of workers, is the system robust enough to deal with that?<\/p><p> I will conclude with some suggestions and recommendations on what is needed for an effective system.  On the building control side, which is to do with the protection of life and the element the State would regulate for all buildings, first, the inspection of design and construction should be independent of the owner and under State control.  Whether that is through the local authority, panels of inspectors or by some other means is something that could be considered but it should be independent of the process.  Second, it should be a national standard for substantial compliance, so everybody knows exactly what they are standing over and what they are doing.  Issues of compliance should be clear and measurable.  This will also help owners, because if something is measurable it is easy to prove that it is wrong.  Third, there should be supports for designers and builders through producing approved construction details that everybody can use and which everybody knows are compliant.  We do not have that at present.  Fourth, the Building Regulations Advisory Body, BRAB, should be re-established.  It should have a technical support function and be a driver of innovation.  Last, there should be a standard system of registration for key professions and critical trades which would be a single point of contact for consumers and is clear and working to the same standard.<\/p><p> With regard to consumer protections, the commercial and institutional construction industry probably can look after most of its own arrangements.  There should be flexibility in the market for the market to decide and for owners to decide what is appropriate for their situation.  In the housing sector, there should be licensing of speculative housing developers and some mechanism of redress, perhaps through bonding, so that if they cease trading, there would still be an entity in place to protect buyers.  Second, there should be a robust system of mandatory warranty.  That could be tied to either an insurance product or possibly a national fund for defects that would go beyond the scope of the current warranties that are available.  Third, there should be a strategy to look at the construction industry insurance generally and to review the regulatory environment in that regard to find where the weaknesses lie.  There is a great deal of reliance and talk about the insurance that is available but there is no certainty that any of the insurance products will meet the need in any of this.<\/p><p> Fourth, there should be market surveillance of construction products, which is envisaged under the construction products regulations from Europe.  That has numerous advantages.  First, it will help the builders to know that their supply chain is compliant and that the materials are not dangerous and fraudulent.  It will help owners because they will have the benefit of this support.  It will also help the State.<\/p><p>If Ireland is the only country in Europe not actively implementing market surveillance, there is a risk it will become the dumping ground in Europe because there is no policing of the construction product sector.<\/p><p> A consumer support should be put in through a portal for information which gives them clear advice about how all of this works, what to expect and their entitlements.<\/p><p> We need to examine cutting administration costs, to deploy resources more strategically and to focus on a consistency of standards for owners, consumers, designers, builders and the trades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Hegarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2504,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Alan Baldwin to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#D00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492072200,"counter":2505,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present to it this morning.<\/p> <p>  I am a chartered building surveyor and the current chairperson of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI.  I am also the managing director of the Building Consultancy, a private consultancy practice offering building surveying and design and project management services.  I am joined by Kevin Hollingsworth, a chartered building surveyor and past chair of the SCSI building surveying professional group committee.  He is also the managing director of Omega Surveying Services and is actively involved in remediation of multi-unit complexes.<\/p> <p>  The SCSI is the largest professional body representing a membership of over 5,000 chartered surveyors and the home of 12 professional disciplines that straddle property, land and the construction sectors.  One of the SCSI&rsquo;s main priorities is to advance and maintain standards in our built environment in the public interest.  It is closely associated with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, RICS, the global organisation representing over 100,000 chartered surveyors worldwide.<\/p> <p>  Building surveying is a discipline which offers a variety of services across the entire built environment.  The knowledge base and competence of a chartered building surveyor is broad but based on a solid technical understanding of how buildings work both technically and functionally.  Their role, therefore, touches on all aspects of the construction and property industries, allowing them to approach their jobs from a holistic angle.  Some of their areas of expertise include design, building pathology advice, pre-purchase advice and building surveys, dilapidations, property management, contract administration, project management and statutory compliance.<\/p> <p>  In terms of statutory compliance, building surveyors are one of three disciplines designated under the new Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, to be design and assigned certifiers.  Assigned certifiers are responsible for co-ordinating the inspection and certification of building projects and provide the final certificate of completion when building works are finished and ready for occupation.  During the implementation of BCAR, the SCSI welcomed its introduction and actively participated throughout the Department&rsquo;s stakeholder consultation process.  The SCSI, through the construction industry council, works closely with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to develop the documentation assisting certification of BCAR on ancillary certificates.<\/p> <p>  The SCSI is supportive of the new building control regime and acknowledges it is a significant improvement from what was in place previously.  As a body, we believe that consideration should be given to the following matters.  There should be no opt-out provision for one-off houses and the Government should ensure all builders are subject to the same standards set down in BCAR.  The assigned certifier should be independent and preferably not a direct employee of the developer or builder.  There should be additional resourcing of independent oversight by local authority inspection staff to support a culture of transparency, traceability and accountability, as well as to assist in deterring cases of non-compliance with appropriate standards of buildings.  We also contend that a statutory system should be put in place to ensure only those builders and specialist contractors who are competent in their specific areas of activity are regulated to offer their services, while appropriate sanctions are in place to protect the public from such legacies experienced in recent times.<\/p> <p>  We welcome recent developments in home insurance policies covering latent defects insurance.  The policy typically is a first-party insurance cover where the policyholder does not have to go through the builder in the event of a claim and the policy attaches to the dwelling and transfers to subsequent purchasers during the ten-year cover period.  The policy must cover defective workmanship, design and materials and include structural failures, fire safety, mechanical equipment and drainage.  Such cover should provide for a sensible level of cover and not be constrained by low thresholds where the owner is required to pick up the cost of artificially low levels where excesses apply.<\/p> <p>  Recent regrettable high-profile failures, particularly in multiresidential complexes, were in evidence with the former regulatory system.  With that in mind, the SCSI wrote to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in March 2017, highlighting concerns and putting forward a set of recommendations to address these issues.  A copy of this submission has been made available to all committee members.<\/p> <p>  The SCSI suggests the development of a methodology to appropriately assess high-risk legacy buildings in consultation with industry and the Government to be carried out in a proportional manner.  Many developments may not have any recourse available to them to rectify the defects or do not have the funds available to solve the issues.  We recommend consideration be given to the financial impact on schemes where serious deficiencies are identified and investigate possible solutions to fund such repairs.<\/p> <p>  Much of what we will be discussing today is likely to focus on our building control oversight and legacy issues coming to the fore in terms of building defects.  As Ireland is now in the midst of a housing crisis, we need to plan for the future so we learn from mistakes of the past.  Our construction industry is only now showing signs of gearing up to cater for demand for house purchasing, which was blighted with problems since the downturn.  Our organisation has been active in response to our national housing crisis in highlighting the barriers to construction and housing supply.<\/p> <p>  In May 2016, the SCSI published a comprehensive report on the costs of delivering a three-bedroom semi-detached house to the market in Dublin.  We will shortly be publishing figures on the delivery of apartments to the market that will identify the costs of construction, as well as the additional costs associated with regulations, taxes, levies, finance and land.  All of these are part of the overall story in providing value for money and cost-effective housing solutions for those requiring accommodation.<\/p> <p>  As a professional body and professionals working at the coalface in the industry, we are here to share our experiences and thoughts regarding potential solutions.  However, it is up to policy makers to implement regulation changes which will work for our industry.  With this in mind, we remind the committee of the SCSI&rsquo;s recommendations to tackle the legacy issues pertaining to multi-unit complexes that have come to light through the media.  We have recommended that a mechanism is established whereby studies of high-risk multi-unit residential buildings, built in the recent past, are considered regarding serious immediate building defects impacting on safety health and well-being of its occupants.  Serious consideration should be given to setting up an emergency fund to deal with the most urgent of issues such as notification of fire to occupants, the risk of fire spread from apartment to apartment and from common area to apartment.  The CIRI, Construction Industry Register Ireland, register of competent builders with specialist contractors and individual crafts and construction entities should be established on a statutory footing to protect consumers in the future against recurring defects of this kind.  CIRI registration is conditional on compliance with all statutory regulations and appropriate competence in the designated category of service provided.  The SCSI proposes the Government considers setting up a loan facility over a relatively long term for building owners for serious building defects which would be outside the scope of any emergency scheme and where there is a current funding shortfall.<\/p> <p>  We request the Government reviews these proposals and considers convening a multi-stakeholder working group, involving relevant industry players and Government agencies, representatives of owner management companies and licensed managing agents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Baldwin"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2506,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Deirdre Fallon to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#D00400","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492072200,"counter":2507,"content":"<p>We thank the committee for the invitation to discuss the review of building regulations, building controls and consumer protection.<\/p> <p>  Although they are often considered and criticised together, it is important to restate that the planning and building control systems are entirely separate.  Legislation provides for different procedures in terms of the operation of the planning and building control systems.  The planning system seeks to provide high-quality development in the right location and at the right time.  The building regulation and control system should support this goal.<\/p> <p>  The future of our city, town and village centres and appropriate re-use of our vacant building stock are key aspects of building the sustainable communities of the future.  In the opinion of the institute, the latter could make a significant contribution towards the provision of urgently-needed homes.<\/p><p>The planning system cannot be said to be the main constraint on supply of housing.  There have been a number of changes to planning legislation to significantly reduce the costs of providing new homes such as changes in apartment standards guidelines, the reduction of the Part V contribution for social housing, reduced development contributions and a targeted development contribution schemes rebate.  When it comes to the reuse of buildings, however, the institute is of the view that building standards are a more significant barrier than planning permission<i>per se<\/i>, particularly where historic buildings are concerned.  Previous Living Over the Shop incentives have been ineffective in the main as refurbishment costs and complying with building and fire regulations have been the main barriers.<br\/><br\/>We previously recommended to the committee that local authority rapid response teams for housing developments be established.  These could be one-stop-shops for obtaining advice on all aspects of the statutory consent processes for new housing developments and proposals aimed at maximising the use of existing building stock.  They could be project managed by a professional planner who has responsibility for co-ordinating housing applications within a planning authority from pre-planning through to application stage. <br\/><br\/>There are a number of practical and regulatory issues which need to be taken into account in developing the criteria for exempted development for a change of use of vacant commercial properties to residential use, as proposed under the Action Plan for Rural Development.  These issues relate in particular to compliance with building regulations.  For example, the change of use of the upper floors of a commercial building to residential use or the subdivision of the entirety of a commercial building to multiple residential units raise the issue of compliance with building regulations.  Change of use to a single unit simplifies this process, but it does not negate the obligation on an individual to comply with regulations and to ensure the overall goal is the provision of high quality housing and homes for people who urgently require them.<br\/><br\/>In terms of consumer protection, one of the Irish Planning Institute&rsquo;s objectives is to raise the standards of the planning profession and to facilitate public awareness of planning and the planning profession.  Although the planning system requires planners to deliver an effective planning system, the term &quot;planner&quot; is used imprecisely.  Ministerial guidelines issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act refer to the term &quot;planner&quot; and also refer to the need for reports to be prepared and assessed by &quot;competent persons&quot; and &quot;competent authorities&quot;.  We believe that greater clarity is required around the title to emphasise that professional planners are suitably qualified professionals with competency secured by meeting continuous professional development obligations and acting in accordance with ethical obligations.  In keeping with the ethos of the planning tribunal report, this would increase public confidence in professional planners by making their knowledge and ethical obligations clear, although others could continue to provide planning services.  We believe that this can be achieved by inserting a definition of &quot;planner&quot; in legislation and guidelines and by establishing a register of planners.  We ask for the committee&rsquo;s support in this regard.  We believe that the definition of the profession of &quot;planner&quot; in legislation along with regulation of the profession would give a clear signal to the public that all aspects of the planning system are structured to protect and support the public interest and thus would assist in building confidence in the system. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Recommendations which relate to the construction stage of development and the planning system include allowing minor amendments to permitted development in certain circumstances, as long as they are not considered material amendments in the context of the overall development.  We recommend that consideration be given to the introduction of a system for the provision of certificates of lawful use and-or development which could be issued on foot of an application.  This will grant landowners and developers greater certainty in carrying out exempted development.  Commencement notices should include a site layout map indicating the units being commenced.  This would help overcome issues where more than one commencement notice is lodged over time for the same units or where a number of commencement notices are being applied for on the same site.  It would also make clear the units being proposed to be built for monitoring purposes.<br\/><br\/>The agreement of compliance issues before commencement of development can be a very major issue for the delivery of developments that have planning permissions.  Statutory provisions should be put in place requiring planning authorities to resolve compliance submissions within a specific timeframe and to give statutory effect to compliance approvals so that they can be relied on by applicants.  There should be no difference in standards of residential amenity and quality of development and place-making between built-to-rent schemes and residential schemes targeted at other tenures.  Statutory timeframes for the provision of pre-planning consultation meetings should be explored.<br\/><br\/>Guidance and information for property owners or potential developers on planning and its interaction with building regulations is limited.  In this regard, we hope to work with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government on revising and expanding its useful but out-of-date public information leaflet series.  The consolidation of planning legislation is, in our view, the clearest way to avoid delay, confusion and frustration any user of the system may experience and we urge the committee to support our call for it.  Addressing procedural and practical deficiencies in the existing planning code identified by practitioners as impeding the efficient delivery of housing should be prioritised. <br\/><br\/>The successful delivery of many of these recommendations will require a clear commitment to adequate resourcing of planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Adequate resourcing needs to be put in place in the first instance.  The last survey of the planning profession carried out by the Irish Planning Institute found that the number of planners employed in local authorities decreased by almost one third from 2006 to 2014.  A snapshot survey carried out by the institute earlier this year found that the numbers employed had only marginally increased.  The figure was in the order of 8% in the authorities which participated.  In order to meet the demands of a modern planning system, planning authorities must be properly resourced, including in terms of staffing and, particularly, in having an adequate complement of professional planners.<br\/><br\/>The institute is conscious of the need to avoid untimely delays in planning but any streamlining must have regard to the rights of the public to participate in decision-making, transparency and accountability in the development management process, and the need to safeguard proper planning and sustainable development.  We have noted to the committee previously that there is a worrying trend for the piecemeal centralisation or nationalisation of the planning system, which is not set out in any Government policy.  Moreover, a piecemeal approach to the removal of planning function from local authorities has the potential to utterly undermine certainty, efficiency and the efficacy of the planning system in Ireland.  There is increasingly limited opportunity for flexibility from local authorities.  We believe a suitable balance can be struck. <br\/><br\/>We thank the members for their time and the committee&rsquo;s staff for their assistance.  We are available to take questions or further comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Fallon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2509,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Fallon and call Deputy &Oacute; Broin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#E00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2510,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the three presentations.  By way of introduction, with these two hearings and the report that will arise from them we are hoping to not so much focus on the past but to try to come up with what we, as a committee, think are sensible recommendations to Government for both legislative and policy change.  While we are conscious of the high profile cases that have spurned our interest as politicians, we are also conscious of the fact that, to date, most of those have been pre-2014 developments.  Therefore, what happened in those instances is not necessarily as applicable to the regulatory regime we are currently examining.  Having said that, I have some specific questions for Ms Orla Hegarty and Mr. Alan Baldwin and then some general questions.<\/p> <p>  One of the things I am trying to get my head around in terms of the regulatory regime is the theoretical and actual relationship between the certifiers under the BCAR and the building control inspectors in the local authorities.  Ms Hegarty has commented on it.  Will she talk through it a little more?  From the outside, it seems like there is a privatised self-regulation or paid-for self-regulation while, at the same time, there are independent local authority inspections.  It does not seem to me that the two fit together clearly or well.  What is Ms Hegarty's view?<\/p> <p>  I raised my next question at the last hearing.  We get wildly differing figures on the BCAR costs.  Ms Hegarty outlined some figures.  However, Ronan Lyons, for example, has published figures for multiple unit developments.  These figures are in the region of &euro;27,000, just for the BCAR elements.  He is clear that there is no comprehensive audit or research and that these are just snapshot figures.  I am interested to know where people think the average figures lie.  Do we need to do some more significant research or keep some kind of an audit to track those costs so that we have actual data rather than the snapshot data we have to date?<\/p> <p>  It is obvious that there is a huge complexity of professionals, from the developer to the architect, involved in the design, building, and certifying etc. and there are many bodies regulating them or there is self-regulation.  Even when the construction industry register Ireland, CIRI, goes on a statutory footing, it will only cover some of the professionals involved in the construction end.  Does it make sense to have such a fragmented system?  I am interested in hearing all three panellists' response.  Is there a better model to standardise - not centralise - or to create a more coherent way of managing all of it, both in terms of registration and when something goes wrong.  If home owners want to make a complaint, to whom do they make it?  Are the procedures and all of those types of things the same?<\/p><p> Ms Hegarty mentioned an independent inspection regime.  We discussed this at the last hearing and an obvious issue was how long it would take a local authority to acquire the capacity for this.  Even before the recruitment embargo and the consequent reduction in numbers, the building control sections were pretty small.  What numbers would be needed?  This is a very big policy proposition and, while I have a lot of sympathy with it, if this committee is to make recommendations it needs to be realistic in terms of the cost implications to the State and the time it would take.  Ms Hegarty also talked about warranties, a national fund and bonding.  I would be interested in hearing the detail of these.  What are they and who would pay for them?  How would they be accessed?  Are there models of best practice?<\/p><p> I ask Mr. Baldwin the same question I put to Ms Hegarty.  As practitioners, how would the witnesses describe the relationship between certifiers and building control inspectors?  Mr. Baldwin spoke of the high-level study but the difficulty with this is in deciding how far to go.  In my constituency there have been two high-profile cases where residents accidentally discovered significant non-compliance with fire safety and building standards in the course of doing renovation works.  There would be tens of thousands of units in total across all the similar complexes built in the same area in that era.  Does Mr. Baldwin have any more detail on the high-level study?<\/p><p> The big questions surrounding the emergency fund are about who would pay into it and how would one access it.  Does Mr. Baldwin have any suggestions or recommendations on those points?  I was interested in what he had to say about BCAR.  It was said that the new system of privatised statutory self-certification was unique to Ireland, it did not operate in any other country, it reinforced the previous failed system and did not accord with international best practice.  The SCSI has some recommendations for reforming the BCAR and the assigned certifier system.  Can Mr. Baldwin give a little more detail on that?<\/p><p> The committee is trying to grapple with some issues.  For example, what is the best dispute resolution method when defects are found, and what is an effective redress?  Who foots the bill and what is the best way of putting in place a system for cases similar to Longboat Quay or Beacon south?  The witnesses are professionals in the field, while we are just political representatives, but there have been many hearings and I find it to be very fragmented.  I am very confused about how it all operates and I can only imagine how the individual home owner finds it when he or she discovers that there are no safety provisions in the property.  How do we make the system more coherent and more easily accessible and understandable to the home owners who find themselves in a defective building and do not know what to do?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#E00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2512,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin covered most of the issues.  Ms Hegarty spoke of the difference between regulation and control, and the desktop and paper submissions on energy standards as compared to the administration of the building control regulations, which involve going on site visits to give approvals.  The witnesses spoke of a pre-1990 period, before the local authorities carried out inspections on site as part of by-laws.  We might end up going back to that type of system in the future.  The witnesses suggested that the BCAR system amounted to self-regulation and was not the ideal way to move forward, saying we were the only country to have such a system.<\/p> <p>  Last week we received a couple of presentations and a report from the House of Commons in London following an investigation into its system, which was one of completely independent third-party inspections.  It frightened me that 93% of buyers reported problems with their buildings but, reading a bit further into it, I read that 70% of those complaints related to aesthetic finishes and decor and this put my mind at ease.  In the long term, the only way we can do this properly is by an independent third-party inspection regime.  We are still in a self-regulatory regime.  I might employ a builder, an assigned certifier and an auxiliary certifier but while this is an improvement on what was there before, which was nothing, the overall objective has to be to nip problems in the bud so that a problem does not arise in the first place.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses said they recognised the shortage of skills in the industry and that is a huge concern as we head into the most extensive programme of building activity that we have seen in years.  What impact will that have?  What is the level of professionalism available to manage these sites?  I gave crude examples last week of a major construction site where there was about to be a large pour of concrete and five or six lorries were waiting.  If the assigned certifier discovers something is wrong with the steel but his employer is standing over him, what is actually going to happen?  A staff shortage and skills shortages will cause problems where things need to get done.  Building control should be independent and we should not have self-regulation.<\/p> <p>  Later on we will ask the Department about the system but a lot of it involves submitting documents online.  One scans them in and puts them up and everything is hunky dory.  What level of local oversight is there of the documents?  There is an independent visit from the building control authority to a site but there are different stages of the inspection regime for every construction job and, according to the figure in the 2015 report, the local authority gets out to a job in 27% of new builds.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked how best we could have independent regulation in building control.  Are the skills out there?  If the private sector has the skills to certify, the State should be in a position to put in place a framework agreement for independent certification.  I will ask questions at a later stage on the practical, day-to-day operation of BCAR.  Do the witnesses believe it is working and that it is the way we should be moving forward?  Should we move to another system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#F00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2513,"content":"<p>For people watching the proceedings, the CIRI is the construction industry register of Ireland, an online register of competent builders.  Deputy Casey talked about the shortage of skills.  At the height of the boom, one in eight worked in the construction industry.  Can Ms Hegarty tell us what the figure is now?  We lost a lot of very skilled people during the downturn and this particularly affected local authorities, where people took early retirement.  The three members of this committee who are present were probably members of local authorities at the time and our planning departments, in particular, saw a decrease in staffing because of the fact that larger applications were not coming in.  It takes a long time to build that back up but we have been given assurances that the funding has been put in place and local authority staffing is being ramped up in that area, as well as in An Bord Plean&aacute;la, something that was touched on by Ms Hegarty.<\/p><p>Does she see that as an ongoing problem or are people starting to take up construction studies, town planning and such academic subjects again?<\/p><p> Ms Fallon or Mr. Baldwin touched on the issue of commencement notices.  I like their idea about the layout of a plan on a commencement notice but that might not be suitable for a one-off house or an application under 20 units.  Is that for larger developments to ensure there is natural monitoring of them so that it can be seen if the scheme is changed in terms of access into the site or whatever?<\/p><p> Many figures were given on the difference in cost in terms of all the standards and regulations that have been brought forward.  The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, says it is 2% and we also have the other extreme.  For clarification, what is the impact of all these standards on the cost?  We have to separate that from the standards we should have versus the cost of compliance.  It is about going on site and inspecting the developments but how do we choose in that regard?  Do we go with the larger scale developments because the witnesses cannot cover everybody?  Are larger scale developments the sites we have to monitor very closely or the one-off house in somebody's garden?  Where they prioritise will be different throughout the country.<\/p><p> While we have a register for people in the construction industry I like the idea of a planning register.  I had a couple of other questions and when they are answered I might ask some supplementary questions on that.

If I have misunderstood any, the Chairman might clarify them for me as I go through them.<\/p> <p>  The first was from Deputy Casey on private self-certification versus local authority inspectors.  I have a note here that that was in regard to their powers.  Under the legislation local authority inspectors have many powers.  They can go onto site, look for materials, take samples and look for documentation.  Assigned certifiers do not have any of those powers so to go back to the Chairman's scenario of somebody looking to pour concrete, even if the assigned certifier says they are not happy with that, they cannot do anything about it other than to say that when the building is finished they will not sign a final certificate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Hegarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2516,"content":"<p>And they are then forwarded on to somebody else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#G00300","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492072200,"counter":2517,"content":"<p>If the owner of that site chose to put them off the site for the day, he or she is within his or her rights to do that.  If they did not give him or her the documentation for the steel, he or she is within his or her rights to do that.  If the owner chose to replace them the next day with somebody else who was more manageable, he or she can do that as well.  Those are weaknesses in the system.<\/p> <p>  My second point is in regard to the impact of cost.  This is very difficult to quantify.  The issue is that it is designed to be expensive but the reality is that people either cannot or will not pay or cannot resource it to that level.  In a part of Australia where they went this way, there was a race to the bottom on fees and it became very cheap and ineffective.  From my research on the building register last year I know there is one assigned certifier who was inspecting more than 500 houses.  That is from my own count on the building register.  They were not on one site; they were on sites throughout the country.  I cannot imagine that high fees were being paid.  The fees were probably quite low.  The problem is that the diligent people who want to do this carefully and forensically in accordance with the law are being underpriced and cannot compete in that market.  The system favours the people who are not diligent rather than favouring the diligent.  Any system of control should favour the diligent and support them in trying to do a good job and remove the people undercutting them or those who are not doing a good service.  It should not favour the people who are cutting corners.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the impact on cost, people talk a lot about assigned certifier fees.  That is just one piece of it.  A design certifier who has to do all the design verification has to be paid also.  That is not talked about very much at all.  Under that, a great deal of sub-certification is being required from everybody, and many of those people are being asked to put additional insurances in place as well.  It is very difficult to quantify that because it gets buried in contracts, tenders and sub-contracts.  It is very difficult to sort out what that is because the requirement is in with everything else.<\/p> <p>  There is also an issue of specification because if professionals are being asked to be liable over time for everything, they will always look to raise the specification.  Rather than going with what is the national accepted standard on something they will always look to go higher.  That is inflationary as well in terms of what owners are actually getting.<\/p> <p>  The third question was about the fact that there are many bodies involved and the system being fragmented in terms of professionals.  It is, and there is not a consistent approach in the way any of that is managed and policed.  It is also an issue for cost because if we consider a level of an additional 80,000 people in the construction industry, are we looking at registering an additional 80,000 people on top of the potential 100,000 we have at the moment?<\/p> <p>  To go back to the numbers, at the height of the boom we had 170,000 or 180,000 people in the construction industry.  The number is approximately 120,000 now so in broad terms there are still 150,000 fewer in the industry than we had ten years ago.  Are we talking about registering all of those, assessing them all at point of entry and charging a fee on all of them every year, and the backlog of migrant workers coming here who have to be assessed before they can work?  There are major issues in that regard.  If we are talking about registering 100,000 people at &euro;600 each, that is a &euro;60 million cost to the construction industry so the benefit has to be weighed up in terms of what is important.  There are key professionals and trades that very much needed to be regulated, and that would include fire stoppers, alarm installers, engineers and others.<\/p> <p>  The next question was about an independent inspection regime and the capacity in local authorities.  There is a precedent in that regard.  The Building Control Act 1990 already makes provision for authorised persons to be appointed by the local authority.  They do not have to be employees of the local authority.  They can be on a panel of the local authority.  There is a precedent in the 2009 regulations where people were brought in to do fire safety certificate applications.  There is a precedent and a mechanism, and that is all possible.  It would be a lot to ask of the local authorities to upskill and employ staff very quickly.  It would also be very inflexible because if they take on staff one local authority might not have the volume of work but another local authority might need them.  It is a much more flexible process to use a panel.  It also means they can bring in expertise in strategic ways so if a specific fire engineering issue arises, they could bring in a technical expert through this sort of mechanism rather than expecting people in local authorities to be skilled in everything.  As I said, the mechanism is in place.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the point made about existing buildings and inspection, that panel could be a mechanism through which to do that to a national standard and with an inspection list of things that need to be done.  There would be consistency and a mechanism to gather that information and to apply standards across the board.  There could be huge benefits in that.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about who pays for bonds.  My thoughts on that are similar to an issue that can arise with the travel industry.  When an issue arose with people being stranded in Spain because travel companies collapsed a bonding mechanism was brought in whereby these companies were bonded and if someone was on holidays they were protected in that they were brought home or allowed to continue the holiday because there was a fund to cover that.  I wonder if a model like that, particularly for speculative housing developers, could be considered, the point being that the owner buys from the seller.  If the seller is no longer around or has ceased trading voluntarily or involuntarily, there is no redress.  A bonding mechanism would put different controls on people who are selling housing and would mean that people who buy from those entities have some immediate redress in those circumstances.<\/p> <p>  That was the first set of questions.  The second set was to do with third party inspection, and mention was made of the United Kingdom.  Deputy Casey said that 93% had problems but 70% of those were aesthetic.  That comes back to the issue of compliance which the technical experts can measure and should be accountable for versus the shoddy construction part.<\/p><p>At the end of the day, developers are the ones who control the process.  They buy the materials, pay the workers when things are done correctly or incorrectly and deliver the product into the market.  The shoddy construction element is an issue for the person providing the product not for the person checking technical compliance.  Perhaps the issue with BCAR is that technical inspectors are being asked to stand over shoddy workmanship as well.  Where does it stop?  Division of the two is important.  There is a problem with house building standards in the UK.  There are many reasons for that on which we could expand.  Some of it is to do with the inspection regime and some is to do with the procurement model, as I said earlier, where there are conflicts of interest.  Some of it is to do with the warranty scheme or even competition in the market.  Many big players control much of the market and there is no competition for buyers to go to the better product.  <\/p><p> Skills shortage is the single biggest issue for the construction industry at the moment.  There are two sides to this and a skills shortage will have two impacts.  One is that prices will go up because people are not available to do the work so other people can charge more.  The other side is that quality generally goes down because the people who are doing the work have another job to move onto.  They need to get paid and they need to move on.  It is very fractured.  Since 99% of the construction industry is in micro-enterprises, we are dealing with very small entities.  We do not have traditional house building companies like we had 30 years ago.  We have management companies that will employ people to do specific tasks who will then move on.  That is why this outside intervention is important.  If people are coming in for a week or two weeks to do some work in a house and they have to bring in  a crew to do something, they are being asked for an ancillary certificate before they get paid.  If they are not going to be on the site the next week, they will produce the certificate but what value does that certificate have to anybody in the process? <\/p><p> The next question was on the local authorities and the level of oversight in the BCMS.  I do not know how much oversight there is and my instinct is that resources are very constrained in the local authorities.  Planning departments were generally resourced and people understand what planning is, but building control departments are very under resourced.  In some local authorities, it is one person and not even a full-time person.  I made the point in the report that there are fewer building control officers in the country than dog wardens.  There are statistics published for dog control but not for building control.  It is very hard to get an insight into what is going on.  It is no criticism of the people in the local authorities who are trying to manage with what they have.  It is not reasonable to expect them to have full technical oversight of every drawing when thousands of drawings are being uploaded in a system that does not really balance which drawings have priority or which things are more important.  How do they manage that level of information?  <\/p><p> In terms of the level of inspection by the local authorities, statistics are published on target rates.  They are not obliged to inspect but there are target rates for each local authority.  I will speak from my own experience.  In my role, I monitor the work of graduate architects who are working out in the market on live building projects.  I have probably seen 400 or 500 in the past 20-plus years of live building projects in Ireland.  If I looked back on how many cases had issues with building control in a construction product, I could count the number on one hand.  That is my take on what actually happens on the ground in terms of local authority involvement.  Some of that is not just resources; it is because the law is very unworkable around enforcement.  It is very expensive for the local authorities to get into this and that is a barrier to them acting.  <\/p><p> The Deputy asked if BCAR is working on the ground.  In my experience, I have seen many different things and that is why it is very hard to quantify what it is costing.  I have seen the very high standard that some corporate clients have put in place.  Similarly, at the other end there is a lot of box ticking and people not really engaging with it.  It is not always that people have bad intent; sometimes they just do not have the skill or the necessary information to do the job properly.  Some buildings are being occupied without completion certificates because the tiniest detail can hold up a completion certificate.  It is not feasible for people not to move in if there is a tiny snag in a building.  That is a barrier so people are occupying buildings that do not have completion certificates.  The other problem is there is a three-week standstill period when a job is complete for the local authority to validate the completion certificate.  The code of practice says they should not start a technical assessment of the drawing at that stage.  What that means is the local building control officer should not start opening all the drawings at completion to check them.  He should check them if there is an ongoing concern during the course of the job but if there has not been an ongoing issue, they should just be filed.  The regulations allow three weeks for that process to happen.<\/p><p> What I have noticed is that in the first year people were planning to do that more quickly.  Over the past year, people are starting to put into their contracts that there is a standstill period of three weeks for this to happen at the end of a job.  That is a huge cost if the builder is keeping the heat and light on in the building and security on the site and the owner is delayed in occupying the building.  It could be an office building or a hotel.  There are costs associated with all of that.  That mechanism is certainly not working.  There is also an issue for assigned certifiers who find themselves in a situation they do not want to be in.  There is no mechanism for an assigned certifier to resign.  They have to be released by the owner.  That is another oversight in the regulations.  If an assigned certifier is in the very difficult situation of seeing bad practices on the site that they cannot stand over, they cannot take themselves out of the process.  <\/p><p> I mentioned some of the issues of skills and numbers.  It also concerns what we will regulate and whether we will regulate people, that is individual plumbers, electricians, architects and engineers, or whether we will regulate companies and entities.  At the moment there is a mismatch because builders are regulated by limited liability companies and professionals are regulated as individuals and are individually personally liable.  If a company ceases trading, there is protection for anybody involved but the professionals are very exposed because it is a lifelong commitment.    <\/p><p> Whether the money is spent on larger or smaller developments, there should be consistency.  If somebody is a self-builder building a house in a rural location there are risks for that person in terms of the building being energy compliant and properly connected to the drainage system which could impact locally if there is contamination.  There are key things that are actually measurable in terms of compliance that a professional can look at.  The same thing goes for larger, multi-unit developments.  We need to move away from the concept of a product guarantee and the signing off on shoddy workmanship and be very clear about what compliance is and what the role of the State and the market is in terms of product to establish the consumer protections that are necessary in the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Hegarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2519,"content":"<p>I will come back to Ms Hegarty.

The first observation that was made stemmed from our relationship with BCAR as assigned certifiers.  To speak from practical experience, when we take on an instruction and we start the process of preparing and submitting the documentation, it is a desktop exercise.  We are not engaging with any person.  There is no third party on the local authority side.  It is very much a process and procedure that one follows.  There is no relationship between us and the local authority.  It is a formality in terms of what one sends in and companies do it to a good standard.  We are very pleased with the system because it supports high standards which is what the society is about.  There is no relationship with the building control authority.  It is a desktop exercise.  In terms of our experience over the past three years, to echo what people have said previously, I do not think I have ever met a building control official.<\/p><p>Over the past three years we have been heavily involved in numerous projects where there was a requirement to provide fire safety certificates, disability access certificates, DACs, and act as assigned certifiers and designers.  I can honestly say that I have never met a building controller or am aware of meeting anyone coming to our sites.  <\/p><p> As for the end user who is the consumer, I am strongly of the view that we need a standardised system.  We need a person to act as a watchdog who has control and oversight.  As I travelled here this morning I recalled that when I left college 20 years ago, the 1995 construction regulations on health, safety and welfare were introduced.  At that time the regulations were fairly radical in terms of the responsibilities, procedures and processes that they introduced.  At the time the construction industry and the other stakeholders needed time and we need time with the BCAR system to come to terms with how it works.  The existing health and safety model and regime in the construction sector is first class and the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, model is a very good.  The HSA is involved in oversight and enforcement and it works.  The new process could work well if we learned some lessons from the HSA model and applied them to building control.  We need a watchdog that barks and bites occasionally.  Regrettably, and I will not be thanked for saying so, prosecutions will be necessary just as there were prosecutions when the health and safety legislation was rolled out.  There were some high-profile instances in which members were penalised quite significantly, and rightly so, but that is what is lacking in the current system.<\/p><p> On the capacity of a local authority, my society actively encourages the Government to look at current resources in the local authority.  To echo one of the other speakers, an analysis probably is needed on how many building control inspectors exist in this country.  The Government must first provide a report that sets out the current number.  Is it adequate?  Probably not.<\/p><p> As for how the private sector can help, independent oversight has advantages.  It might be that the local authority could engage an assigned certifier independently of the overall process.  As to how that could be funded, the model already exists in respect of the financial contributions obtained from developers and just needs to be extended to allow that facility to happen.  There are costs and fees associated with providing assigned certification.  It is difficult to quantify the level of fees.  Throughout the industry there have been many reports, from different institutions, on the level of fees.  From personal experience I know that fees are dictated by the complexity of the job, how much work is involved in assessing the information that one has been provided with and how frequently one must attend a site.  Site inspection is a fundamental part of this exercise.  It is not just confined to a desktop exercise and one needs to be on site.  There are costs associated with providing the service.  I genuinely cannot give an average figure as the fee varies from site to site.  I am happy to say that with most of our clients, the service has become part and parcel of what one provides.  One must do things to a certain standard anyway.  As one must now upload additional information or documentation on to the building control management system, BCMS, the clients are already paying for it so the information exists and should be made readily available to the local authority.  As to whether the local authorities are scrutinising the information, I leave it up to the committee to decide.  I suspect they are in some instances but a risk management strategy should be put in place to assist local authorities to identify buildings they need to look at.  I do not think the model exists to physically look at property. <\/p><p> On who should foot the bill for latent defects, I like the idea of an insurance bond.  Similar bonds exist in the motor industry for those who do not have insurance but have been involved in an accident.  As to whether I am suggesting a levy, Members of Parliament are the policymakers and make the decisions but, ultimately, the scheme must be funded in a certain way.<\/p><p> My colleague, Mr. Hollingsworth, shall comment on some of the other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Baldwin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492072200,"counter":2522,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked specifically about the potential high-level study.  He touched on the issue of accidental discovery, which is one methodology used to fund issues.  People also go looking for problems because the matter is in the media.  There is another cohort of people who have not looked, do not want to look or are totally oblivious to this matter.  The number of latent defects over the past three years is scary.  I have remediated 28 multi-unit developments.  Eleven of them are privately owned and funded by members to keep them out of the media and I am working on eight developments at present.  Only two weeks ago I sat in front of an extraordinary general meeting, EGM, and told people they would have to pay &euro;7,500 to remediate defects.  That situation is the genesis of our submission and it cannot continue.  The cause of these issues was, in my opinion, the Building Control Act 1990.<\/p> <p>  We have not had enough time to evaluate the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations.  It appears positive from the level of professional involvement and oversight but 27 years after the introduction of the 1990 regulations, it has been confirmed that self-certification was a bad decision and we have been left with legacy issues.  It is too early in the BCAR process.  From the society's involvement, we know there is a much higher level of on-site oversight and questions are being asked.  We do not think the process is perfect and improvements can be made.<\/p> <p>  We were asked for international comparisons.  I finished my education in the UK.  I worked between the UK and Australia for a decade before coming here.  In response to Deputy Casey's specific point, internationally, if the building control officer is on site and the trench is open, the concrete does not normally arrive until the next day.  It does not arrive until the building control officer assesses whether the foundations have been dug adequately and the soil has good bearing capacity.  It is only then that the foreman rings.  The building control officer is always present and he or she is independent and unimpeachable.  The system works.  Ireland uses a hybrid system that is unique when compared internationally, as stated by Mr. Baldwin.  Resources are a barrier to having an international system.  Deputy Casey mentioned that the by-laws were disbanded in 1990 and replaced by self-certification.  It would be incredibly difficult to ramp up the system immediately so there must be a staging process.  Ms Hegarty mentioned there is a facility to have authorised persons appointed by the local authority.  That aspect could deal with the undercutting that she pointed out.  Mr. Baldwin also touched on the need for an oversight tsar.  We have that provision with HIQA and the Financial Regulator.  We need it in the construction industry for both the actual construction and the local authorities.  We need to know the types of inspections, how many are being done and whether they are at key stages.  Somebody needs to monitor the entire construction industry.<\/p> <p>  To answer some of the Chairman's questions on how the local authority monitors red flag issues and whether the assigned certifier has changed matters, as we have said, we do not know how much of that has actually and tangibly been undertaken.  The skills shortage is key.<\/p><p>We would have been churning out, through Dundalk Institute of Technology, an average of 50 graduates per year.  Last year and this year it will only be 13.  We will have to wait another four years before that is back up to 50.<\/p><p> Another issue is the professionals appointed to act as assigned certifiers, including chartered engineers, registered building surveyors and registered architects.  The proper professionals are building control officers but we have no building control course in this country.  The Irish system we have created is putting people in who are not specialists in the field in which they are asked to work.  There is no short solution to that problem.  I hope I have answered all the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Hollingsworth","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492072200,"counter":2524,"content":"<p>I will clarify the point raised regarding commencement notices from multi-unit developments.  If it is proposed to start some of the units, the site layout plan would show which units are proposed and it would make for easier monitoring at a later stage.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to the great number of professionals involved with the construction industry and the issue has been touched on by everybody here.  From the perspective of professional planners, registration is something our members very much support insomuch that it makes clear to the public that if they are engaging a planner, they are engaging somebody with that professional qualification and there is a means for addressing any complaint that could arise at a later stage.  They can be sure that somebody is engaged with and continues with professional development and upskilling.  It is an important component of the overall planning and construction system.  There is a challenge to ensure that there is awareness among members of the public of the different roles people play.  As professional institutes, we all have a role and perhaps this raises the point of having some kind of centralised source of information for the public so people will know what body to approach in the event that they need redress or wish to make a complaint.

It is interesting because we discussed many of the same issues at our previous meeting and many of the same kinds of solutions seem to be emerging, which is really helpful.  These will be half-questions and half-observations.  It seems the witnesses are all moving towards the idea that one way of removing self-certification, as a sensible and pragmatic staging process, is to keep the BCAR but have local authorities as the employers or contractors for the certified assessors.  Under the legislation, would that give the certified assessors the power that building control officers currently have so, for example, they can go on site when they want, etc.?  It would seem that if this is possible, there would be a series of benefits.<\/p> <p>  First, it would not be a complete system overhaul and one would work within the existing model and make some changes that would not even require legislative alterations.  As the witnesses say, it would be a way of controlling costs, managing jobs properly and recording data, albeit at local authority level.  Am I right in thinking that is the direction in which that part of the discussion is going?  If it is, it is a very sensible idea.  The insurance bond came up at our previous meeting and it seems to be an interesting model to explore.  I wonder if there are other jurisdictions which operate something like that in this context.  Is it something at which we, as a committee, should be looking?<\/p> <p>  There was some discussion at our previous meeting regarding a kind of building authority.  With the Health and Safety Authority or the example cited by witnesses, should the committee perhaps look at some kind of building control and compliance authority?  This would not be instead of local authorities.  One of the points made on the previous occasion by the fire safety certifier related to the fact that there is much good local knowledge and information but it is about providing that kind of overarching watchdog role, which involves data collection and consistency of standards.  Is that something we should be considering?<\/p> <p>  I asked about the relationship between assessors and building control inspectors but I was not asking about their actual working relationship.  My question was probably not very clear.  It just seems that the two ideas do not fit together and it is almost as if they are from two different ways of thinking about building control and compliance.  One is a bit of a legacy that is a hangover from the previous system and is not really operating.  I am wondering if there is no actual relationship or clear added value in having both, is the solution not to merge them in the way I suggested at the start, with the local authority being the employer of the certifier?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#K00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2526,"content":"<p>We are using BCAR now but if I have a problem with a property ten years on, I can look at the building owner, the assigned certifier, the design certifier, the auxiliary certifier and sub-certification.  Where would I go with that claim, where would I start and how complicated will that claim be in ten years if we have all these different layers of certification and signing off?  Would I be dragged through the mill, starting with the owner, who would drag in the assigned certifier, the design certifier, the auxiliary certifier and then the sub-certification of a lift installation, for example?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Baldwin stated that he had not seen a building control officer on a site, which is worrying.  Mr. Hollingsworth stated there is no course or certification in Ireland for building control officers.  With local authorities and building control, it is currently subdivided into three sections, with a fire officer looking at fire certification; the disability section looking after its issues; and building control itself.  My understanding is that if a building control officer is fully educated and has the relevant skill set, he or she would control all of that.  In other words, it would all come under one heading.  This would mean that when somebody is dealing with a local authority, he or she would deal with one department and, possibly, one person.<\/p> <p>  I stated last week that the decision to remove one-off rural housing from the BCAR system and a number of extensions was wrong and it was done because of a concern about added cost of BCAR on one-off rural housing.  We need to educate people about the value of building control for their own safety.  An exercise must be done in that regard.  We need to bring all developments under building control, whether it is an extension or one-off rural house.  Every aspect of development should come under building control.  As has been pointed out, planning permission is completely separate to building control.  What is the view of the delegation on certification of rapid builds or modern technology now being used in building houses?  Some of these are not rapid builds but there is modular building off-site where the structure is craned into and installed to a site.  Is there any inspection of the manufacturing of those types of buildings or does this depend on supplier certification?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#K00400","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2527,"content":"<p>As we are running out of time, we will go through this section a little quicker.

I made the point this morning and I strongly believe that the State should take responsibility for there being a single watchdog or body - whatever it is called - to bring oversight and enforcement.  They compliment one another.  It would be unrealistic to expect the local authority officials to do the level of work in detail we are expected to do but we are providing them with the information in order to assist them in the process of ensuring compliance with regulations.

There is the issue of whether the assigned certifier could be appointed by the local authority.<\/p><p>That is a question of how the legislation is written and whether it can be done.<\/p><p> On international comparisons for insurance, in France there is decennial insurance, which is a ten-year insurance bond and that is the first point of redress for any policy.  That answers Deputy Casey's next question as to who is the first point of call in ten years' time.  If it is within that ten-year period, the policy would be the first point of call.  Six years is the statute of limitations for the professionals and for their professional indemnity, PI, and that policy would be key as to the extent of the cover and the mechanisms for claiming.<\/p><p> An overarching building control authority is the way forward.  The local authorities simply cannot be resourced up because of the skills shortage and even the courses to do it in the country.  Deputy Casey asked about the fragmented building control authority applications.  They are fragmented but the building control officers also do the disability access certificate, DACs.  The same person does the DAC, does the general building control inspections - whether or not they actually occur - and looks after dangerous building occurrences.  That person does a lot.  When there is approximately one or a half such officer per local authority, that is extremely difficult.<\/p><p> There is some wisdom in a single point of application combining the fire safety certificate and the DAC.  I personally do not understand why disability is more important than any of the other parts of the building control, such as ventilation which can cause condensation, mould and health problems.  On structure, when one makes an application in the UK to knock down a wall in one's home, one must provide structural calculations.  That is as important as anything else.<\/p><p> Deputy Casey raised the one-off house.  It is not merely for the initial builder that it needs to be protected because when that house is sold on, as it inevitably will be, there will be another consumer who also needs to be protected.  Although there is a cost for compliance, both in terms of the assigned certifier and the increased construction costs, those costs have to be met to protect both those who are initially building it and any subsequent purchasers.  The Deputy's final question related to modular building.  I do not know of any independent inspection of manufactured systems but the manufactured systems, in my experience of building pathology and finding defects, are where the major defects are.  When a new system comes onto the market and everybody starts building it, they do not read the instruction booklet.  It is not traditional cavity-block construction and more of the defects are associated with it.  It is a valid point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Hollingsworth","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492072200,"counter":2531,"content":"<p>I have a couple of points.  First, the issue of cost has been coming up.  I am picking up that it is perceived that local authority building control would be a cost barrier or a cost to the State.  The Northern Ireland model of building control is actually cheaper for owners and they have a rigorous regime.  Everything is inspected.  Whether one is taking down a wall in one's house, converting one's attic or building a porch, one may pay a couple of hundred euro for one inspection that gives some reassurance about that, but if one is building a new house it is considerably cheaper than our system would be under the assigned certifier inspections.  That is quite responsive.  People come out within a couple of days when they are called for state inspections.  There is a model that is virtually self-funding, paid for by owners and developers, in the North that could be looked at.<\/p> <p>  As for off-site construction, there is a lot of confusion about this because what we think of as traditional construction in housing is normally concrete-block based and where we are probably going in the future is towards more system building.  There is a lot of debate around this and it comes back to the issue of the asset value, and the protection of people as well.  The building regulations protect people long enough to escape from buildings.  They do not protect the building from burning down.  One is dealing with different issues here.  The other problem has been that although system building has come in and obviously will become more common because it is cheaper, there have been a lot of half measures of putting elements together on-site, that is, putting together timber party walls or construction that can fail easily with somebody, for instance, a neighbour, putting up a shelf or drilling a hole in the wall next door.  It is a policy decision as to whether that is acceptable because it only really happens in housing.  We do not see it in other building types.  It is to do with saving money at the construction stage but one would have to question the long-term durability and investment in that and the risk for people on the site.<\/p> <p>  Finally, on the issue of decennial insurance, which is a ten-year policy, France is under a different legal regime but there also are project insurance policies available in the UK that are becoming more common and even those who are building office buildings would be looking at that type of policy.  The advantage for the owner is he or she has one point of contact and if there is anything wrong, the owner goes there.  If they want to sue somebody down the line or follow up with other policies or other insurances, that is not the owner's problem as a consumer.  They can do that in the background over time but the owner gets the problem sorted out immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Hegarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2532,"content":"<p>Does Ms Fallon want to come back in on anything?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#L00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492072200,"counter":2533,"content":"<p>Not at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Fallon"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2534,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending this morning.

It was very interesting to listen to the earlier exchange of views and I hope we will address some of the issues raised in the opening statement and the discussions that follow.<br\/><br\/>The design and construction of buildings is regulated under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014.  The 1990 Act provides for the making of building regulations and building control regulations and establishes local authorities as the building control authorities, specifying the powers of inspection and enforcement they have.  The primary purpose of the building regulations is to protect the health and safety of people in and around buildings and their focus is on the protection of people rather than of property.  The second schedule of the building regulations 1997 to 2017 is comprised of 12 distinct parts, classified as parts A to M, each of which deals with a functional requirement for buildings or works, for example structure, fire safety, energy conservation, accessibility, etc.  Accompanying each part is a technical guidance document which the Department produces.  Where works are carried out in accordance with the relevant technical guidance, they are considered to be <i>prima facie<\/i>evidence of compliance with the regulations.  The Department's aim is to develop and promote a strong and evolving building code in support of quality construction and sustainable development.  The building regulations are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in light of emerging national issues and innovation and change in the sector and to implement European legislation.  The purpose of the building control regulations is to set out the procedures, administration and control mechanisms to secure the implementation of and compliance with the requirements of building regulations.<br\/><br\/>While it is important to recognise that there are many good quality buildings which comply with building regulations, we are all too well aware, unfortunately, of the many instances of building failures which have come to light over the past decade.  The economic and personal consequences of these situations have been very significant.  To address this situation, the then Minister announced in July 2011 that the system was to be strengthened.  A high level working group, which included officials from the Department and local government, liaised closely with industry to review the building control regulatory framework.  The group identified two key deficiencies.  These were the lack of professional involvement on site and the lack of accountability in relation to compliance with the building regulations.  After much negotiation and consultation, it was through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2011, SI 9 of 2014, that the reform agenda emerged.  The key measures in the 2011 regulations are the requirement that designs be certified by a registered construction professional and submitted before works commence; the requirement that owners appoint a competent builder who in turn must certify that construction works comply with building regulations at the end of the process, and the requirement that owners appoint an assigned certifier to prepare an inspection plan, carry out or oversee it and, ultimately, certify compliance with the building regulations on completion.<\/p><p> The assigned certifier must prepare an inspection plan, carry out or oversee that inspection plan and ultimately certify compliance with building regulations on completion.  Any changes in the circumstances of the owner, builder or assigned certifier must be notified to the local building control authority within a very short space of time during the construction works, that is, within two weeks.  A certificate of compliance on completion is jointly signed by the builder and the assigned certifier.  This must be accompanied by plans and documentation to show how the constructed building complies with the building regulations and also the inspection plan, as implemented.  The certificate of compliance, on completion, must be sent to the building control authority and included on a register before the building can be opened, occupied or used.  SI 9 also details what should be publicly available in relation to a building or works, in terms of the building register, which is made public for everyone.  In addition, SI 9 also provides that the drawings and particulars of any building or works should be accessible under freedom of information from the building control authority to any person who has an interest in the property.  It also provides for a more detailed outline of the roles and responsibilities of the key personnel, including owners, designers, assigned certifiers and builders, through a code of practice known as the code of practice for inspecting and certifying buildings and works.  That code was produced in late 2014 and revised last year.<\/p><p> I will now turn to building control authorities, about which there has already been much talk this morning.  I wish to clarify again that while the primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the building regulations rests with the designers, builders and the owners of the buildings, as part of the major reform that has occurred in recent years, the oversight and governance of the building control system was also scrutinised.  To improve the effectiveness of building control authorities, a number of changes have occurred.  The building control management system, BCMS, was developed.  BCMS is a national IT enabler which was launched to coincide with the commencement of SI 9 of 2014.  It ensures the consistent implementation of the measures in SI 9 and assists local authorities with the increased volume of documentation they are receiving.  The BCMS provides a common platform for clear and consistent administration of building control matters across the local authority sector.  In addition to the BCMS, a framework for building control authorities was published in 2014.  It standardised operational activity, that is, work practices, systems, procedures and decision-making in relation to oversight of building control activity across the sector.  I can provide more detail on that later, if necessary.<\/p><p> Another measure introduced was a compliance support work stream to support local authorities further in dealing with their own queries or with queries that had been brought to them by private practitioners.  These queries are dealt with at a centralised level and can then be applied nationally.  Training programmes are currently being developed to empower staff fully at building control authorities to carry out their work effectively.  These include foundation level courses, continuing professional development courses and also a professional postgraduate course.  Finally, and most fundamentally, is the requirement for meaningful inspections of building activity.  In this regard, a BCMS module is being developed on the inspection process whereby, at commencement stage, those engaging with the commencement notice would have to fill out an online assessment of the building with which they are involved.  This would inform a risk assessment at the back end of BCMS, which would then provide information to local authorities to carry out risk-based and targeted inspections, thus using their staff in the most effective and efficient way.<\/p><p> The Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, and the County and City Management Association, CCMA, have been instrumental in driving these reforms.  To sustain the momentum and commitment among the sector we are working towards encapsulating all of these work streams into a centralised structure for the governance and oversight of the building control function.  This structure will ultimately be a shared service embedded in a lead local authority.  The concept of shared services is to consolidate transactional activities, ideally using automated processes such as the BCMS, thereby allowing concentration on core and strategic activities at building control level.<\/p><p> In terms of consumer protection, there are a number of points to note.  Prior to its introduction, a commitment was given that SI 9 of 2014 would be reviewed after 12 months.  This review took place early in 2015.  The review found that industry stakeholders considered the reforms to be necessary, effective and that they should continue.  Statutory certification was welcomed by the insurance, banking and legal sectors and is perceived as a responsible regulatory measure which makes Ireland a more attractive place for construction related trade and investment.  It is worth noting that there has been an increase in the availability of construction related insurance products such as first party latent defects insurance.  Some of these insurance products also cover non-damage related issues and product failures.  This increase demonstrates that Ireland is a more attractive place for insurance and that the measures that have been put in place have worked.  This must be viewed in the context of the major retrenchment and conservatism in the wider insurance industry at the moment.<\/p><p> Another significant change that has happened in the recent past is the introduction of the construction products regulation which came into effect in July 2013.  The regulation establishes a common technical language across Europe for products being placed on the market.  This allows specifiers to define very clearly what they require from construction products.  The State has been involved in developing recommendations and guidelines for specifiers in this regard for various products.  On the other side, the regulation also requires that manufacturers declare performance using the same common technical language, thus informing specifiers, designers and builders very clearly whether the products meet the performance requirements stipulated and can be considered proper materials under the building regulations.<\/p><p> Another piece of the jigsaw in terms of consumer protection is the placing of the Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI, on a statutory footing.  The main objective of this is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the building regulations in the builder community of the construction sector which will benefit consumers and the general public.  The legislative proposals in this regard are being finalised by the Department with a view to them being presented to Government for consideration shortly.<\/p><p> The failures of the past in construction arose largely due to inadequate design, poor workmanship, the use of improper products or a combination of these.  The significant reforms that have been introduced and are under way are aimed at addressing these three distinct areas.  The reforms that have been in operation for a number of years now have brought a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects and have created a culture of compliance with the building regulations.  I thank the members for their attention and look forward to their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Neary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2539,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Neary for her presentation and invite Deputy &Oacute; Broin to pose some questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#N00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2540,"content":"<p>I thank Ms. Neary for her presentation.  Our questions to her will be slightly different from those that we put to the other witnesses.  A lot of our attention is focused on potential future policy and legislative change, which we are not going to try to pin the Department down on today.  That said, I have quite a lot of questions for Ms. Neary.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons we are dealing with this issue now is that we have an eye to the building control Bill.  Will Ms Neary give us an indication of where that is at, what kinds of issues are being examined and the timescale for the publication of the heads of that Bill or a draft?  That would be helpful in terms of our own deliberations in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  Ms Neary will have heard the previous speakers talk about the low levels of inspections by local authorities, the low numbers of staff and the fact that staff were burdened with other responsibilities.  In that context, does the Department have figures for the total number of building control staff?  Is the Department collecting figures on the numbers of inspections and compliance and enforcement related issues?  If such data are being collated, can they be shared with the committee today or at a later stage?<\/p><p> Deputy Casey's point on the rapid builds was a very good one and the answer was quite worrying.  Most of us have us have accepted that some of those new technologies have a positive potential in terms of delivery of the units, which is why I would be interested in any reaction Ms Neary has either to Deputy Casey's question or the responses that were given to it.<\/p><p> This is probably an unfair question as the witness will not be able to answer in the way I would like her to.  Much debate in the two meetings of this committee on this issue has centred on the contrast between self-certification, even the much more robust system of self-certification now in place, and independent third party inspection and certification, whether it is by local authorities or others.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that issue?  What has the Department been considering?<\/p><p> This is another question which the witness probably will not be able to answer but I will ask it anyway.  There is much merit in the idea of a building control and compliance authority.  Is the Department considering that possibility?  Does the witness have any thoughts on it?<\/p><p> At the two committee meetings we have had on this issue, we have either implicitly or explicitly been discussing private residential dwellings which are built to be sold on the private market.  We are also very interested in the issue of social housing.  While it is well known that some private estates have experienced defects in their constructions, in 1997 the flagship social housing development at Balgaddy in Clondalkin suffered widespread compliance failures which were independently verified and accepted by the local authority.  How does the presentation of compliance failures in social housing fit in with the overall presentation given by the witness?  A significant part of the Minister's plan involves the use of public private partnerships, joint ventures and the use of Part V agreements.  That is another set of relationships between builders and the local authority as the contracting body for the social houses.  Where do those types of units fit within SI 9?<\/p><p> I presume that the building control management system, BCMS, module and on-site inspections referred to by Ms Neary are carried out by the assigned certifiers and, if information is then sent to the local authority, inspections are considered at that point.  Perhaps the witness could clarify whether that is so and give some more detail on the issue.<\/p><p> Ms Neary said that it is more attractive for insurance.  I am not sure that is a good thing.  As discussed at a previous committee meeting, the difficulty with defects insurance taken out by a home purchaser is that they have to take out the policy and pay for it.  As I said previously, if I go into a record store and buy a CD and find out a couple of weeks later it is broken, I go back to the store and exchange the CD.  I do not have to take out an insurance policy to cover me for the selling of a faulty product.  I am not against defect insurance.  However, in light of the evidence of witnesses that other EU member states cover the cost of setting up some kind of fund or support scheme to cover the cost of defects discovered subsequent to building and the builder bears the liability the rather than the purchaser, is the Department considering adopting that model?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#N00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2542,"content":"<p>My contribution is targeted at the process rather than any individual.  I want to put on record my thanks for the offer to me to have an in-depth look at the BCMS system.  I will take it up in due time.<\/p> <p>  I am focused on trying to create significantly more independent oversight of building controls.  Currently, there are not sufficient resources at local authority level to do much more.  The figures given indicate an increase from 17% inspected in 2014 to 27% in 2015.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned by the inspections.  The BCMS system identifies seven or eight key actions within building construction where potential inspection could take place, such as excavations, foundations, basement, substructure, drainage, superstructure and completion.  If one divides the headline figure for inspections by the potential number of sub-inspections that should be happening on one project, it shows that the level of oversight is diluted.  Has there been one building project where a complete oversight of all the stages has been independently carried out?<\/p> <p>   There needs to be oversight from the initial stage where commencement notice and drawings are submitted.  In smaller-scale developments, the builder often starts without even construction drawings and is probably operating off planning drawings.  This is particularly so for one-off rural houses, a significant number of which are commenced off planning drawings.  The potential to opt-out for one-off rural houses is a bad decision.  This is equally true for extensions.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned different types of building.  I own a commercial business.  I can carry out a significant amount of work in refurbishing the business premises without notifying anybody.  I do not need certification.  I could probably apply for a fire certificate if there is significant change and would receive that certification.<\/p> <p>  There is not enough independent oversight of the building industry.  I accept that there has been an improvement and significant steps taken because there was nothing there before.  The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, system has helped.  We need to look at how to ramp up the witnesses' ability to enable further oversight and inspections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#O00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2543,"content":"<p>I think the question regarding rapid build has already been put.

I would like to hear Ms Neary's comments on that.<\/p> <p>  I welcome that significant reforms have been introduced and are under way.  As Deputy Casey said, we did not have any oversight at all so we have come a very long way in a couple of years, particularly in the development of the centralised structure for training, inspection, compliance and support, the building control management system and the proposed establishment of the Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI, which the witness mentioned.  However, certain issues that arose in the past decade need to be addressed.  Could the pyrite or concrete block issues happen again?  Are we doing things to ensure that does not reoccur?  Do the new regulations make it harder to bring older or historic buildings in cities back into use?  If there are problems in this regard, what are they?  How effective are current building control inspections compared with what they were previously?  What are the cost implications associated with compliance now and will the witness outline the various aspects of those cost implications?<\/p> <p>  Standards of energy efficiency have improved.

First, it will be circulated on the eCabinet system to the Departments and we hope to do that in the next few weeks.  It will then go to the Government for approval to proceed to pre-legislative scrutiny, at which time we probably will return to this committee to have a more in-depth conversation on it.  Its aim is to provide consumer protection whereby anybody on the register would be competent and compliant and anybody carrying out works under the Building Control Act would have to be a CIRI registered builder.  I will leave my comments on CIRI at that.<\/p> <p>  On inspections and the question regarding staff, we show on our website a list of building control officers and a point of contact.  There are about 70 points of contract for the 31 local authorities and the total number of people working in the building control area across the country is 332.  Those are the statistics from 2015.  The breakdown of that figure of 332 is 37 technicians, 111 administrative staff and 185 fire officers, engineers or building surveyors.  It works out at approximately 177 whole-time equivalents because the staff have other functions in the area of planning, fire control or housing.

A target inspection of 12% to 15% of new buildings was agreed with the County and City Management Association, CCMA, some time ago.  That has been achieved across most local authorities during the past ten to 12 years.  There have been instances on occasion where it has not been achieved related to resources or where staff have been deflected to other work in a building control area but just not in new buildings.  Both the target and what is reported through the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, and the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, specifically pertain to new buildings and only show one slice of the inspections that are happening.  We have engaged with local authorities in a survey of all the activity in which building control authorities are involved, whether it be in extensions, material alternations, change of use of buildings or new buildings.  With respect to construction products, they have powers of inspection under market surveillance.  We are trying to capture what building control authorities are doing at present.  The new buildings indicator may not be showing the full range of their work.

When a building control officer finds issues on a site, he or she goes to a single point of contract, which is the assigned certifier.  It is that person's responsibility to address the issue.  The anecdotal evidence is that the issues are being addressed quickly .  At the other end of the scale, when it comes down to the completion works, if there are loose ends or issues that have not been addressed through the process, that will delay the completion certificate being put up on the register, which can affect conveyancing and it would also be an offence to use or occupy the building.

That module is an IT development in the building control management system, BCMS.  When people lodge commencement notices, they will be asked for key information about the construction, the height of the building or key elements of the construction that would inform risk.  A risk assessment will be carried out and then it will be a matter of whether it is a building that is flagged for inspection or the time such inspection should take place, for example, if there is a point at which the fire-stopping system or compartmentation should be examined.

Ms Neary said that there are seven key stages in a simple building and that there could be 15 stages in a more complex building.

Let me focus on that for a minute.  While they are not required to be independent from the builder or the developer, the only person who can carry out the function of an assigned certifier is a construction professional registered with one of the three statutory registration bodies.  They are the only people who can do this work.  There are codes of conduct within each of those.  There are professional conduct committees.  If there is any issue with poor performance, complaints can be made and they can be brought before those committees.  That can result in them being taken off the register, which means they can no longer work in that field.  While they may not be independent of the teams, their work is governed by a statutory register and we would envisage a similar situation for the builders in the long run through CIRI.<\/p> <p>  Regarding other jurisdictions, while the UK had a full-approval system by the local authorities, it recently moved towards having independent private sector involvement.  It is a slight hybrid.  We have recently had visits from Dutch delegations.  The Netherlands had a full approval system that was becoming unworkable and it is looking to what we have done to see if it can learn and bring forward its reforms.<\/p> <p>  Also mentioned this morning was the success of the Health and Safety Authority.  Its model very much involves identifying key personnel as part of the building and construction teams to act specifically in the role of health and safety.  Similarly, under building control, we are identifying key professionally competent people to take responsibility for ensuring compliance.  There are many similarities.  In addition there is the audit function of the HSA.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to the concept of a national watchdog-type body, we would see that being the building control authorities.  They all work independently in each local authority, but there is a concept of a shared service offering compliance support, training and identification of when inspections should be carried out, and the BCMS developed to its full potential.  Such a shared service led by a lead local authority would provide that sort of centralised and national oversight to ensure consistency and risk-based inspections across the country.  It would also have the ability to produce statistics on inspections and enforcements.<\/p> <p>  An example of that is each local authority is required to have a building register with details of each commencement notice at local authority level.  The BCMS allows that to be brought at a national level into one building register, which is much more informative and easily accessible for everyone.  That is being developed into a more searchable format at the moment and will be available in the coming weeks.  In the fullness of time we would like to see enforcements recorded on that.  The shared service should be able to give a greater insight into the level of inspections that are happening across local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Another subject that came up was the rapid-build or modern methods of construction.  We were involved in developing the Office of Government Procurement framework last year which requires that these forms of construction have a six-year durability and fully comply with building regulations.  The innovation here is that they are built off site or are prefabricated before coming to site.  Third-party certification is required for that.  Some third party must analyse the system to ensure it complies with all parts of the building regulations.  That is the document assigned certifiers would use as a basis for inspecting what happens in the factory and then what happens on site with assembly.  All of the details should be covered in that.  We have been involved in this process on a number of social housing projects.  The assigned certifiers have certainly been very clear about their role in inspecting at the factory, as well as on site.  We have seen some very successful outcomes of it.  The Irish Building Control Institute held its national conference last month at which a building control officer gave a very good account of engaging with a site that had a modern method of construction.  He liaised closely with the manufacturer, which provided the third-party certification.  He was in a position to get from the factory records of when these were built.  It came to a very successful outcome.  He was satisfied that it had carried out due diligence in terms of compliance.  It is certainly on the radar.  That presentation was given to all building control officers to inform them of the process.<\/p> <p>  On social housing, another aspect of SI 9 that I did not cover was that the building control exemption previously available to local authorities was removed through SI 9.  All social housing must go through the SI 9 process or the BCAR process.  So there is no difference-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Neary"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2569,"content":"<p>I presume the local authority does not employ-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#Q00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492072200,"counter":2570,"content":"<p>An assigned certifier?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Neary"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2571,"content":"<p>Yes.

One recommendation of the 2012 pyrite panel report was to review the specifications for hardcore in light of the experiences over the legacy period.  The aggregates panel set up under the National Standards Authority of Ireland embarked on a review of that specification and published an edition in 2014.  There was a subsequent small amendment in 2016.  It basically outlines the precautions to be taken at the quarry and place of manufacture.  It incorporates the involvement of a professional competent geologist with a knowledge of the raw material.  It puts in place a process of checks and balances and a specification of performance that has become an industry standard.  That is harnessing one of the harmonised standards under the construction products regulation.  It has created a level playing field for all involved in the supply of aggregate products, particularly hardcore.<\/p> <p>  In tandem with that, a code of practice for the procurement and placement of hardcore was developed.  Manufactures are required to follow the technical specification in the quarry but once it leaves the quarry gate, the chain of custody as to what happens to it before it gets placed in the ground is also crucial.  It outlines the responsibility for all the actors involved in that chain, from the builder when he or she places the order for the product to when he or she receives it on site, and how documentation can be controlled and understood in a practical manner so that the person gets what he or she has requested.<\/p><p>Both of these documents have been in place now for a number of years.  They will be referenced in our latest edition of technical guidance documents C, which is under review.<\/p><p> Pyrite has been an Irish experience and is one which the panel has brought before to the European Committee for Standardization to ensure that there is general awareness of it in the harmonised standard, which is the common standard for aggregates across Europe.  The latest addition of that will reference the special precautions that need to be taken if pyrite is identified in the product.<\/p><p> Hard core is just one example of an aggregate with which we have experienced problems.  With regard to concrete blocks, the constituents of concrete blocks are predominantly aggregate and spent.  A similar level of responsibility has been incorporated into the latest edition of the standard for aggregates in concrete.  The industry has embraced the value of third-party oversight of the production process and from December of this year will allow for work practices to change.  The aggregate standard, SR 16, which gives guidance on the particular European standard for aggregates for concrete, has made a recommendation that is already published to involve a third party to give oversight to the process and ensure that the quarries that are making this product have the confidence to do so and are able to do so.  That is a positive measure to enable the declaration of the performance of those products to be placed on the market in a manner in which they are easily understood.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#Q01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Wickham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2579,"content":"<p>I have a couple of supplementary questions.  Ms Neary mentioned three pieces of information: the building inspector's rapid build presentation; the SI 9 review from some years ago; and the survey building control activity.  If some or all of that information - or a summary of it - was available to the committee, that would be really helpful.<\/p> <p>  I will return to the issue of the percentage of inspections.  Notwithstanding the fact that there are now obviously staffing increases, given the scale of increased construction activity that we all want to see in the private and social sector, I imagine it would be difficult to see the staffing increases at local authorities keeping pace with the level of increased construction and restoration of vacant units.  Is there a plan for or has the Department been discussing how to keep building control in line with the increased output that is desired?<\/p> <p>  Ms Neary spoke very briefly about the Dutch system and how the Dutch came here and looked at our model.  She said that their system is unworkable.  I would be interested to hear about countries in which there is 100% independent State inspector certification with which the Department has had engagement and the identified problems with that system.  If there is anything pertinent from that engagement that the witness could share, I think it would be of interest to the committee.<\/p> <p>  I have a worry about local authorities inspecting and certifying their own properties.  Again, this is not to cast aspersions on the quality of any local authority staff.  We do have developments such as Balgaddy, however, so we have to keep that in mind.  Who is the watchdog for the local authority social housing building control?  If the building control officers are the watchdogs, as the witness described, for the private sector, who fulfils that role when the local authorities are constructing buildings and, at the same time, inspecting and certifying them?<\/p> <p>  The final issue may involve a question the witnesses cannot answer.  We already have local authorities employing assigned certifiers for social housing projects.  There would be nothing to prevent the local authorities doing that for private developments.  Clearly, if the private developer was still footing the bill, it would be cost-neutral.  The value of doing it that way would be that is would not be too disruptive to the current system, but it would tackle the difficulty that Deputy Casey raised, which I share.  Again, this is not in any way to cast aspersions on people's professional integrity, but when I am employing somebody to do something, I have a particular relationship with that person.  When an independent third party appoints the person, that changes the relationship.  It is just a matter of fact.  Has or could the Department look at the idea of removing that last bit of self-certification, albeit a more robust system under SI 9 than was there before it, and could the assigned assessor not be appointed by the local authority and the costs still rest with the developer, albeit paid to the local authority?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#R00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2580,"content":"<p>I will be brief.

The re-utilisation of vacant historical properties is a complex issue and key priority under Rebuilding Ireland.  It is associated with a significant degree of uncertainty.  We have been made aware that individuals and developers are finding it difficult to engage with the system because of the singular regulatory requirements, whether in respect of fire safety, building control, planning, accessibility or conservation.  At times, it appears as if these areas are in conflict.  We are, therefore, anxious to address the matter.  The Living City initiative is a financial mechanism aimed at stimulating activity in this area.  Some local authorities are establishing multidisciplinary groups to facilitate developers in liaising with all of the key regulatory requirement personnel at the same time to ascertain what will constraints will apply to their developments.  We are shadowing this activity in the hope of finding common areas on which we can expand guidance to streamline or improve the system in this regard.  We hope this work, in which we are very interested and to which we are very committed, will be fruitful. <\/p><p> On the building control amendment regulations, BCAR, as part of the review in 2015 we attempted to put a cost on the assigned certifier role and the overall cost of the regulations for a one-off dwelling.  These costs amounted to approximately &euro;3,800 for the assigned certifier role and &euro;6,000 for a single dwelling.  Industry quotations do not appear to exceed those figures and may be even be a little lower.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland report found the average cost for an average three-bedroom dwelling was approximately &euro;5,500, which was approximately 2% of the overall cost.  The 2% figure is mirrored in social housing projects.  While this cost may be identified as the cost of compliance, the cost of non-compliance is far in excess of this figure.  For example, by the end of this year, taxpayers will have spent approximately &euro;60 million on pyrite remediation works on approximately 1,000 houses.  <\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to BCAR costs which are far in excess of our estimate.

As a former member of a local authority, I can stand over the quality and integrity of local authority staff.  However, we must be mindful that there are clear examples in recent history of local authorities demonstrably failing to provide the standard of accommodation required under the building control regulations in place at the time.  There is one clearly documented example of this in my constituency where something clearly went wrong.  The reason we have watchdogs is not that we do not trust local authority staff but that a watchdog reduces the likelihood of problems arising.  It is a little like the inspection regime for properties.  We have increasingly strong requirements for the inspection of private rental properties and approved housing bodies, whereas local authorities are allowed to self-regulate in this area.  This will also be the case in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#S01100","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492072200,"counter":2605,"content":"<p>As we move towards a shared service and a lead local authority having national oversight, the issue the Deputy raises could be dealt with, perhaps through the inspection or compliance work stream where protocols may be put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#S01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Neary"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1492072200,"counter":2606,"content":"<p>It is important to note that the same principles apply to assigned certifiers in local authorities who must also be members of one of the three professional bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#S01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Hurley"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2607,"content":"<p>Are there any further questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#T00100","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2608,"content":"<p>I have a quick question for Mr. Wickham.

An example of the third party, which I talked about, is the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI.  It is a notified body under the construction products regulation.  The Department is to notify an authority so we appointed the NSAI, which proved its competence to conduct auditing of manufacturers by means of the Irish National Accreditation Board.  If the checks and balances are in place and the manufacturer has a factory production control process consistent with the harmonised standards, the NSAI gives it a certificate of factory production control which allows it to lawfully place its product on the market.  The NSAI does not certify the materials; it certifies the process.  The obligation rests on the manufacturer.<\/p> <p>  What has changed is that we have market surveillance of construction products, which is a function of the Building Control Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Wickham"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2610,"content":"<p>Are there any further questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#T00400","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2611,"content":"<p>It would be great if the witness could share those three bits of information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017041300002#T00500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1492072200,"counter":2612,"content":"<p>We would welcome any further information the witnesses think is relevant to the report so that it will be a very robust document.
