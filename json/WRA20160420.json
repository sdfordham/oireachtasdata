Together with the national and regional Action Plans for Jobs, Enterprise 2015, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities, the Further Education and Training Strategy,  the National Skills Strategy and the Review of Apprenticeships, it is designed to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s workforce is equipped to respond flexibly to the demands of a growing economy and that unemployed jobseekers are positioned and supported to take up employment opportunities in the economy.<\/p><p>In framing and implementing these strategies the Government has consulted widely with stakeholders including employers, trade unions, and representatives of unemployed jobseekers.  In addition the State has a number of institutional arrangements in place that operate on an ongoing basis to inform the development and implementation of strategies.  In the case of the Pathways to Work strategy this includes the Labour Market Council, an independent group of industry leaders, advocates for unemployed jobseekers, trade unions and labour market experts.<\/p><p>The Department has also established a dedicated Employer Relations Division and Employer Engagement Teams in every Division who encourage, support and incentivise employers to recruit unemployed people on the Live Register.  As part of this role they work to match employer job specifications with people on the Live Register. To support this activity a new online system will be implemented later this year that will, among other things, enable employers to readily identify candidates who meet their skills requirements and enable the Department&rsquo;s case officers to further support jobseekers.  Data from the new system will provide real-time information on the skills and competencies being sought by employers and on any skills gaps.  This will be very useful to the relevant Government Departments and agencies seeking to address such gaps.<\/p><p>In a manner similar to the co-operation between the Department of Social Protection and the Labour Market Council, the planning and provision of education and training programmes by the Department of Education and Skills and its agencies is informed by the work of the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs which produces annual reports projecting the future skills needs of Irish industry. <\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection also works closely with the Department of Education and Skills, SOLAS and the Education and Training Boards to ensure that the strategic reforms underway in the education and training sectors, such as the establishment of Regional Skills Fora, are informed by the skills and competencies profile of unemployed jobseekers.  <\/p><p>In this regard training programmes such as MOMENTUM are specifically designed to provide education and training to long term unemployed people to help them gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growth sectors.  It is delivered in partnership with both public and private education and training providers who have developed linkages with employers.  Participants receive training in areas with recognised skill shortages where existing vacancies have been identified. <\/p><p>The Department also collaborates with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to co-ordinate efforts to respond to the needs of employers and jobseekers.  A Steering Group of senior officials monitors implementation of a &ldquo;Protocol for Cooperation&rdquo; between the agencies.<\/p><p>As an example of the kind of close inter-agency partnership taking place to ensure that jobseekers are equipped with the skills necessary to meet industry needs, the Departments of Social Protection, Department of Education and Skills and Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are co-hosting an event focussed specifically on &ldquo;Effective Collaboration&rdquo; to take place on 17 May 2017.  The event will be attended by representatives from all relevant agencies who will hear best practice exemplars and discuss ways to improve effectiveness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000055#WRA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1253"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Data","counter":22,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000055#WRA01450"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[7258\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000055#WRA01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"her views on the projected numbers of recipients of jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance over the next five years and to provide a table including the estimated number of recipients in a given week each year and the percentage change;

The incidence of certain contingencies can be difficult to predict and because of this, it is not possible to predict scheme demand over a five year period with accuracy.<\/p><p>For many schemes, it is difficult to project the change in recipients for each year over the next 5 years due to the potential impact of overall economic performance, labour market performance, customer circumstances and demographic changes.  Recipient number trends during 2015 and the first half of 2016 will be reviewed over the next few months, with the objective of finalising the forecast of recipient numbers for 2017.<\/p><p>The number of recipients on Jobseekers Allowance and Jobseekers Benefit is dependent upon economic performance, labour force performance, the availability and take-up of in-work supports and transfers to working age employment supports.  The 2016 REV Estimates includes a financial provision for jobseekers with an average Live Register of 305,250.  The 2016 Expenditure Report published at the time of the 2016 Budget in October 2016, assumed an average Live Register of 289,000 in 2017 and 273,000 in 2018.  These estimates are subject to review and change having regard to the performance of the labour market in the lead up to Budget 2017 later in the year.  At this stage, there is no Live Register forecast for the years 2019 to 2021.  Having regard to all of these factors, it is not possible to provide the number of weekly payments on Jobseekers Allowance and Jobseekers Benefit for each year over the next five years.<\/p><p>The number of recipients on State Pension (Contributory) is dependent upon life expectancy, the contributions record of recipients and the age at which a state pension becomes payable.  Section 7 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act of 2011 provides for increasing the pension age to 67 in 2021.  At present, demographic factors are likely to see the number of people qualifying for State Pension (Contributory) increasing in the range 17,000 to 18,000 each year up to 2021.<\/p><p>The number of recipients on State Pension (Non-Contributory) is dependent upon the number of people of pension age not qualifying for State Pension (Contributory), and the means of such people.  At present, the numbers accessing this scheme are falling by a few hundred each year.<\/p><p>The number of recipients on Illness Benefit is dependent upon the numbers of people in employment, the increasing age profile of the labour force, the average duration of illness or injury and the continuing impact of previous budget measures.  Given the range of potential variables, it is not possible to provide the number of weekly payments on Illness Benefit for each year over the next five years.<\/p><p>To qualify for Disability Allowance, a person must be substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment, be aged between 16 and under 66, must satisfy a means test as well as a medical test and be habitually resident in the State.  The following table provides the average number of recipients each year on Disability Allowance over the last five years: <table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Average Number of Recipients<\/td><td>100,280<\/td><td>101,550<\/td><td>103,100<\/td><td>108,800<\/td><td>115,030<\/td><td>119,270<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>While numbers on Disability Allowance have risen significantly over the last three years, it is more difficult to quantify the rate of increase for each year over the next five years given the range of variables outlined above affecting the number of recipients.<\/p><p>The numbers of recipients on One Parent Family Payment is dependent upon the number of lone parents where their youngest child is within the qualifying age for One Parent Family Payment satisfying a means test, availability of in-work supports for parents and economic circumstances of recipients, including their participation in the labour force.  The number of recipients on Carers Allowance and Carers Benefit is dependent upon the availability of carers to care for people requiring care.  All claims are subject to a medical assessment to determine the level of care required, with Carers Allowance being subject to a means test and Carers Benefit being subject to a contribution condition test.  Given the range of potential variables, it is not possible to provide the number of weekly payments on these schemes for each year over the next five years.<\/p><p>Finally, the number of recipients claiming the Social Welfare Allowance Basic Payments scheme is mainly influenced by the number of people receiving interim payments while awaiting a decision on their primary scheme (for example, Disability Allowance or Jobseekers Allowance).  Given variations in the throughput of new claims arising from various contingencies outlined above across the Department&rsquo;s range of primary schemes, it is difficult to project trends for each year on this scheme over the next five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000055#WRA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1253"},{"type":"question","counter":31,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[7264\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000055#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"to provide a table indicating the estimated annual cost of index-linking each of the following payments to inflation over the next five years: jobseeker's benefit; jobseeker's allowance; supplementary welfare allowance; illness benefit; disability allowance; one-parent family payment; carer's benefit; carer's allowance; State pension, contributory; and State pension, non-contributory; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1305","askee":"1253"},{"type":"question","counter":32,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[7265\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000055#WRA02300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the estimated annual cost of index-linking all weekly social protection payments to inflation over the next five years.","asker":"1305","askee":"1253"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[7266\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000055#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the estimated annual cost of index-linking all social protection payments to inflation over the next five years.","asker":"1305","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":34,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 15, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The information that the Deputy has requested is detailed in the table.

This included transferring CWS staff into case officer roles to meet activation commitments under the Pathways to Work Programme.  As part of this strategy, the Department is engaged in the delivery of integrated Intreo centres, which provide a full range of services, including the CWS, generally available in one location.<\/p>  <p>  CWS clinics were generally operating from Health Service Executive (HSE) premises.  Where CWS service delivery has been structured these services are now being provided from Departmental offices.  Premises, furniture and other equipment that remained in the ownership of the HSE were retained by that Agency.  The staffing and office requirements for all areas within the Department are continuously reviewed in the context of the ongoing development of integrated services, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department. <\/p>  <p>  A number of changes were made in January 2014 in relation to the delivery of CWS in the South Kildare\/West Wicklow area including Clane.  Service had traditionally been provided as a walk-in-service in local clinics one or two mornings per week for limited hours.  From January 2014 the CWS in the South Kildare\/West Wicklow area were restructured to three main centres: Naas, Newbridge and Athy.  This service is accessible by telephone call, followed up by appointments and home visits as required.  There is a commitment that all customers will have their telephone call returned within one working day.  This has eliminated the need for unnecessary travel to Department offices.  Emergency cases are prioritised and dealt with appropriately.  All clients were notified of the changes, including the new extended service times and contact details.  <\/p>  <p>  Approximately 1,500 telephone phone enquiries are received each month in the South Kildare\/West Wicklow area.  While statistics are not maintained on the number of telephone calls returned within the commitment of one working day, feedback from staff indicates that this is the case.

Accordingly, the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused, in the first instance, on the cohort of people who are unemployed and in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment.  <\/p><p>For those in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance and Jobseekers Benefit, it is a condition of their payment to engage in activation measures.  Recipients of other payments, including disability allowance (DA) and the one parent family payment (OFP), can voluntarily avail of activation services and supports.  The JobBridge internship scheme is now available to recipients of a wide range of payments (DA; OFP; Blind Persons Pension; Deserted Wives Allowance\/Deserted Wives Benefit; Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s contributory\/non-contributory Pension).  Recipients of these payments are not counted on the Live Register.<\/p><p>In addition, unemployed persons (including those formerly self-employed) not in receipt of qualifying payments may be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB training for unemployed people (at present there are 1,009 upcoming day courses and 552 upcoming evening courses).  Although not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course, they may receive some support for expenses on travel, meals and accommodation.  Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also open to people regardless of their social welfare status. <\/p><p>Many other services are also available to people who are not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment.  For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices regardless of their social welfare status. <\/p><p>An unemployed person who does not qualify for a social welfare payment due to the assessment of their means may be eligible to sign for social insurance contribution credits.  Persons who sign for credits for three months (78 days) of the last six months are eligible to participate in the JobBridge programme.  Persons signing on for credits for 12 months or longer over the previous 18 months are entitled to participate on Momentum courses through Solas, provided that they have been actively seeking work, however they will not receive any payment.  Persons signing for credits for six months or more are entitled to participate on ETB-run VTOS courses subject to availability.  In the case of VTOS courses, participants do not receive a training allowance but may receive travel and lunch allowances. <\/p><p>In short, the Government is committed to supporting as many people as possible to participate more fully in employment and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers they may encounter in finding and sustaining employment.  Within this overall objective it is appropriate to provide priority for those who are in receipt of payments that are conditional on being unemployed. <\/p><p>In developing the new <i>Pathways to Work 2016 - 2020<\/i>strategy, the Government engaged in extensive consultations with stakeholders including front-line workers delivering employment services to unemployed people.  The strategy reflects the views and ideas gathered during this process as well as taking account of inputs from across all of Government and from agencies such as the OECD and advisory bodies such as the Labour Market Council and the Joint Committee for Education and Social Protection.<\/p><p>Based on these inputs, the strategy for 2016 to 2020 will reflect a shift in focus from &lsquo;activation in a time of recession&rsquo; to &lsquo;activation in a time of recovery and growth&rsquo; and in this regard should have two main objectives:<\/p><p>-  First, to continue and consolidate the progress made to date with an initial focus on working with unemployed jobseekers, in particular people who are long-term unemployed.<\/p><p>-  Second, to extend the approach of activation to other people who, although not classified as unemployed jobseekers, have the potential and the desire to play a more active role in the labour force.<\/p><p>Accordingly <i>Pathways to Work 2016&ndash;2020<\/i>includes numerous, specific actions to increase labour market participation and employment progression of people who are not currently active in the labour market and to apply the concept of active inclusion as a guiding principle  particularly in the period from 2018 - 2020.<\/p><p>The principal specific actions relevant to job-seekers who are not on the Live Register are as follows:<\/p><p><b><i>Expand pro-active engagement to other people of working age who are unemployed but not in receipt of a jobseeker payment: <\/i><\/b><\/p><p>1.

Expand pro-active engagement to people who are working part-time but are in receipt of a welfare payment.<\/p><p>3.  Develop a pro-active engagement approach to support qualified adult dependants of job-seeker claimants in securing employment.

Promote the availability of existing services to &lsquo;voluntary engagers&rsquo;\/&lsquo;walk-in&rsquo; clients, including immigrants, who are not on the Live Register but wish to avail of employment services.<\/p><p>5.  Utilise inter-governmental public employment services such as EURES, and build relationships with public employment services in other countries to offer employment services to Irish emigrants seeking to return to work in Ireland.<\/p><p>6.  Offer Intreo clients access to the Social Inclusion Community Activation Programme sponsored by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and to the Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning.<\/p><p>7.  Incorporate, as appropriate, time spent as an adult recipient or beneficiary of other full-time welfare payments (e.g. as a one-parent family payment recipient, or as a qualified adult dependent of a primary claimant) when assessing eligibility for access to employment supports.<\/p><p><b><i>Extend and intensify the pro-active engagement approach for people with a disability.<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>1.

For the most part they are linked to having an underlying entitlement to a social welfare payment while temporarily detached from the labour force or having entitlement to statutory leave e.g. parental or maternity leave.  The primary purpose of PRSI credits is to secure social welfare benefits and pensions of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI such as during periods of unemployment or illness for example.   <\/p>  <p>  In order to qualify for credits, a person must first have entered insurable employment &ndash; he or she must have paid at least one PRSI contribution as an employed contributor and, unless deemed to be exempted, must be be available for and genuinely seeking work.  Subsequently, insured workers may be awarded credits if they claim a social welfare payment because they are out of work, or they are ill or incapacitated, or if they are engaged in certain training or education courses.  When a person does not qualify for a payment, they may sign-on for credits provided they qualify for the award of credits. <\/p>  <p>  The PRSI class at which a contributor paid his or her last PRSI employment contribution while working determines the type of credits which may be awarded.  Those whose last paid PRSI contribution was at Class A may be awarded Class A credits.  Those who paid PRSI, for example, at Class D (modified rate contributor) may only be awarded Class D credits.<\/p>  <p>  If at any stage in their working life, a person has no PRSI paid or credited contributions for two full tax years, they cannot be awarded credits again until they return to work and pay PRSI contributions for at least 26 weeks.  The rationale for this measure centres on the general principle that there should be a reasonable link between entitlement to benefit and a recent participation in the (active) labour force. <\/p>  <p>  Individuals who do not qualify for a payment but are signing for credits are included in the Live Register statistics.  The Live Register also includes all claimants for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, excluding systematic short-time workers, applicants for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance excluding smallholders\/farm assist and other self-employed persons.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Live Register it should be noted that the register is not designed to measure unemployment.

There were over 20,100 rent supplement tenancies awarded during 2015 and over 3,000 during the first three months of 2016 showing that significant numbers of individuals and families are being accommodated under the scheme.<\/p><p>The Department undertook a review of the rent limits in 2015 and found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply in the private rented market will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients.  The Department continues to closely monitor the situation and has implemented a national targeted policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits for both existing customers and new applicants to the rent supplement scheme.  The circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits, as appropriate.  In addition, the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans underway to extend this arrangement to commuter areas over the coming weeks. <\/p><p>This flexible and targeted approach has assisted over 7,570 rent supplement households nationwide to retain or acquire rented accommodation through increased rental payments.  A county breakdown of these cases is provided in the tabular statement for information.<\/p><p>Under the Exceptional Needs Payments (ENPs) scheme assistance may also be provided towards rent deposits or rent in advance.

Mindful of the current and ongoing discussions on Government formation any further development of policy will be a matter for the incoming Government.<\/p>  <p>  The current position is that the department has a cohort of jobseeker customers who are classified as casual jobseekers.  These are in-work customers who can claim a jobseekers payment for 2 to 3 days per week or who work week on\/week-off.  These customers are paid by cheque each week. Not all customers will be paid every week due to their changeable work patterns.<\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that these customers have been paid by cheque due to the changing nature of their work\/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue payments.  It is important to note that they are not paid via post offices under the department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the National Payments Plan, my department is seeking to reduce its usage of cheques as a payment method; this is not only a matter of decreasing the significant costs associated with cheques in the department and wider economy but also of moving to a more secure method of payment and enhancing customer convenience.<\/p>  <p>  When paid by cheque, customers have the option of lodging them direct to their accounts or negotiating them at banks or the Post Office.  The evidence available to the department is that the vast majority of the department&rsquo;s customers paid by cheque choose to lodge them direct to their accounts. <\/p>  <p>  The department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns and is able to offer payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual Jobseeker customers thereby increasing customer convenience.  This is in line with wider departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that in-work customers are paid by the most convenient method possible.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently the department has written to its casual Jobseeker customers asking them to provide their account details to enable direct payments to financial institutions.<\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the department does not issue these cheque payments to Post Offices, they are issued directly to the department&rsquo;s customers.  This process does not reduce the number of existing cash payments through Post Offices under the current contract between the department and An Post. <\/p>  <p>  I want to reiterate that what the department is doing is moving customers from cheque payments to the much more secure, customer convenient and cost effective payment method of payment directly into accounts in financial institutions.  This is entirely consistent with the National Payments Plan and in line with payment methods that now prevail across the economy.  The department must consider the most efficient payment method for our customers who are in employment most of whom get their salary payment into bank accounts.  To have weekly income (work + welfare) payable in two different ways is a highly inappropriate and costly way of dealing with people in employment.

In this regard it complements the service provided by the Department&rsquo;s own staff in Intreo Centres and by the Local Employment Service providers.<\/p>  <p>  Turas Nua Limited is one of two companies with which the Department has entered into contracts for the delivery of JobPath services.  The other company is Seetec Limited.<\/p>  <p>  Under the contract the companies act as agents of the Department and  must accept, work with and deliver a service to all and any clients that are referred by the Department.  The companies must deliver a guaranteed baseline level of service to all clients.  Participants on JobPath receive intensive individual support to help them address barriers to employment and to assist them in finding jobs.  Each person is assigned to a personal advisor who assesses a person&rsquo;s skills, experience, challenges and work goals.  A &ldquo;personal progression plan&rdquo; is drawn up that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job focused targets.  Participants are also provided with a range of training and development supports including online modules, career advice, CV preparation and interview skills.  Clients receive this service over the duration of a year or until they find employment and if they are placed into a job they continue to receive support for at least three months, and up to twelve months, while in employment.<\/p>  <p>  JobPath providers are paid fees if and when they place clients into sustained employment.  In this regard employment is defined as work of at least thirty (30) hours per week lasting for at least thirteen (13) weeks.  Contractors are paid a fee, in arrears, for each thirteen week period of employment up to a maximum of four payments or one year&rsquo;s work.  This payment approach incentivises the contractors not just to find work for people but to strive to ensure that the work is full-time and sustained.<\/p>  <p>  For the purposes of JobPath all long term unemployed jobseekers on the Live Register are categorised into groups based on their duration of unemployment (e.g. 1- 2 years, 2 - 3 years etc.).  Selection for referral to receive employment activation services from a JobPath provider is by means of stratified random sampling using these groupings; the objective being to ensure equity in selection and also that people referred to JobPath are a representative of the long term cohort on the Live Register.<\/p>  <p>  Participants on T&Uacute;S and Gateway are not eligible to receive the JobPath service while they are on such programmes.  However, once they have competed their time on T&Uacute;S or Gateway they may then be selected for JobPath.  <\/p>  <p>  It is not intended to publish the individual fees that are payable to the JobPath companies as these are commercially sensitive and to do so would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the contracts now in place and any future procurement that may be undertaken.<\/p>  <p>  The roll-out of JobPath is not yet completed.  It is expected to be finalised towards mid-year.  Given that clients will spend 52 weeks on JobPath it is necessary to allow sufficient time to elapse before a meaningful assessment can be carried out.  At the present time it is too early to undertake an evaluation of job placement performance.  As indicated in &ldquo;Pathways to Work 2016 &ndash; 2020&rdquo; the Department intends to publish JobPath performance statistics from Q3 2016. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000058#WRD02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1253"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000058#WRD02150"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[7626\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000058#WRD02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"to expedite an application under the carer's allowance scheme by a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath.","asker":"1250","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>The Department has no record of an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person concerned.

In this sense, a scheduled hospital appointment or a routine childhood illness would not attract force majeure leave.  An event might be urgent on the first day, but not on subsequent days if the initial urgency has passed;<\/p>  <p>- the need for the officer&rsquo;s presence is immediate when the officer&rsquo;s presence with the sick person could not have been delayed because of the seriousness\/urgency of the illness\/injury.  The officer had to be with or go to the sick\/injured person without any delay;<\/p>  <p>- the officer&rsquo;s presence is indispensable when the situation demands the presence of the officer.  Nobody else will do, or will be able to give the support that the sick\/injured person requires.<\/p>  <p>  These three criteria for force majeure leave must apply on each individual day for which force majeure is requested, not just the first day.<\/p>  <p>  Force majeure leave shall not exceed 3 days in any period of 12 consecutive months or 5 days in any period of 36 consecutive months.  An absence for part of a day is counted as one day for the purposes of force majeure leave.<\/p>  <p>  During an absence on force majeure leave, an officer is deemed for all purposes to be in employment.  Force majeure leave is paid leave.  It cannot be treated as part of any other leave such as sick leave, maternity leave, adoptive leave, annual leave or parental leave to which the officer is entitled.<\/p>  <p>  The HR Division of my Department is required, in applying the foregoing provisions, to be satisfied that, in the circumstances, an application for force majeure leave is fully justified.  Where this is not the case, the officer should apply for annual leave or other form of special leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000059#WRE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1253"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Leave","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000059#WRE01800"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[7692\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000059#WRE01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will review and address the anomalous position relating to the qualifying criteria for maternity benefit where current rules can mean that a mother who has to end their employment very early in their pregnancy due to a pregnancy related illness is denied entitlement to maternity benefit, as the rules do not make any allowance for such an illness when calculating if she satisfies the criteria for the minimum number of weeks since employment; if this matter has been raised with her Department previously; and if so, the rationale for not allowing force majeure allowances in such circumstances or providing specific amendments to legislation to deal with this scenario.

There are two basic principles which underpin the Irish social insurance system.  Firstly there is the contributory principle which links the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and their entitlement to a range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid, subject to legislative provisions, where a particular contingency arises, and without a means test.  Secondly there is the solidarity principle where the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more likely to have an income need as a result of circumstances that have arisen in their lives.  In this regard, it should be noted that most PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life.  For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another.  It should also be noted that access to Widow&rsquo;s\/Widower&rsquo;s\/Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension is available to those who have been married or in a civil partnership only, and that scheme will not benefit someone who has been single all their life.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the benefits and pension system is to provide a person with an adequate income.  The rate of payment is set with this objective in mind, and the fact that there are a number of ways one can qualify for a pension does not mean someone may qualify for multiple PRSI-funded payments at the same time.  As is common with social security systems across the world, the Irish social welfare system generally applies the principle of one person, one payment.  It can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time, e.g., an unemployed person may also become sick and incapable of work.  The PRSI paid by the person and their employers only provides coverage for one payment at such times.  Under the legislation for the schemes, if a person experiences more than one of these contingencies at the same time, generally he or she can receive only one core payment.  Amending the social welfare system to allow Illness Benefit to be paid in addition to a pension such as a Widow&rsquo;s pension would be a significant change to the system, providing certain people with the income considered necessary for two people, and would greatly increase costs.  This extra cost would have to be financed from either an increase in the rate of PRSI contributions, an increase in the Exchequer subvention to the scheme, or a reduction in the rate of payments.<\/p>  <p>  Widows over the age of 66 are less likely to be in a position to take up employment than those of working age.  When a person on a Widows&rsquo; contributory pension reaches the age of 66, their rate of payment will generally be aligned with the maximum personal rate for the State pension contributory.  Increasing the rate of payment for widows under 66 to that of those who have reached State pension age would also result in a significant additional cost that would have to be met from either increased PRSI\/subvention or a reduction in the rate of payments.  I have no plans to introduce such a change.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of supports in the social welfare system which benefit widows, including those of working age.  I was pleased to announce in Budget 2016 that the rate of the Fuel Allowance scheme was increased from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50, which will be of benefit to many disadvantaged widows of all ages, and householders on long-term welfare, and will assist with meeting the costs of their heating needs during the winter season.

Over 120,730 PDH mortgage accounts were classified as restructured at end-December, reflecting a 5.3 per cent increase in restructured accounts relative to Q4 2014.\u00a0 86.4 per cent of restructured accounts were deemed to be meeting the terms of their current restructure arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  2. All maturity categories of arrears, including the over 720 days category, declined in Q4 2015, with the over 720 days category recording a second consecutive decline.  Currently the number of PDH mortgage accounts in arrears for more than 720 days stands at 36,351.<\/p>  <p>  Based on Central Bank data, mortgage accounts with no arrears now make up 88 per cent of all mortgage accounts.  The continuing\u00a0improvement in data trends shown in the Central Bank quarter\u00a04 mortgage arrears returns are welcome and show that where there is meaningful engagement between lender and borrower, in the majority of cases an outcome that is beneficial to both parties can be reached.<\/p>  <p>  In addition my Department continues to monitor and publishes Mortgage Restructures data on a monthly basis that covers mortgage accounts for the six main lenders.  The figures in the latest publication for\u00a0February 2016 (published on 14\u00a0April 2016) show that Primary Dwelling Home (PDH) mortgage accounts in arrears continue to decline and now stand at 67,234 representing an improvement of almost 21 per cent compared to\u00a0February 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputies will be also be aware that the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) and the Consumer Protection Code\u00a0 provide a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that each borrower who is struggling to keep up mortgage repayments is treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner by lenders.\u00a0 The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and lenders to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.<\/p>  <p>  I would also refer Deputies to a new Government-funded scheme announced by the Minister for Justice in January to help people who are insolvent, and in mortgage arrears on their home,\u00a0to access independent expert financial and legal advice.\u00a0 MABS will act as the gateway to refer eligible distressed borrowers to\u00a0access this\u00a0scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I must reiterate that active engagement by indebted borrowers\u00a0with their lender\u00a0is key to achieving a\u00a0sustainable resolution, and I would urge borrowers in arrears, who have not already done so, to take that first step by contacting their lender directly or MABS for an\u00a0independent assessment of their situation and\u00a0advice on available resolution options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000060#WRF00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Clearance Certificates","counter":265,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000060#WRF00700"},{"type":"question","counter":266,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[7311\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000060#WRF00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a hard copy of a tax clearance certificate will be issued to a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny.","asker":"1248","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":267,"content":"<p>Section 95 of the 2014 Finance Act requires that all tax clearance certification must be provided via an electronic system with effect from 1 January 2016.

Similar rental inflation was experienced outside of Dublin with rents increasing by 9.9 per cent compared with Q4 2014. <\/p>  <p>  The indications are that this increase is being driven by an excess of demand over the available supply in the market.  For example, the Daft Rental Report for Q4 2015 noted that rental inflation has been driven by a shortage of rental properties.  This lack of availability is primarily attributed to the current housing output falling short of the demand for housing.  Forecasts for housing demand suggest that an average of around 25,000 units are required annually over the medium to longer term.  At present, the sector is falling well short of this target with completions in 2015 of just over 12,500 units.<\/p>  <p>  In such market conditions, it is likely that a reduction in the tax payable by landlords, such as that proposed by the Deputy, could lead to increased profit for landlords rather than a reduction in rent paid by tenants.<\/p>  <p>  It must also be noted that the level of income tax payable by a landlord in respect of a given amount of rental income can vary significantly, depending on the level of deductible expenses incurred by the landlord.\u00a0 For example, in the case of rental investment properties which have been purchased using loan financing, it could be expected that the net taxable rental income from a newly-purchased property would be much lower than the net income from an equivalent property owned for a longer term by the landlord, as the deductible interest expense incurred would be higher.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to rented residential premises, a landlord may, in general, deduct 75% of the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair rented premises when calculating rental income.\u00a0 The cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant and the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property are deductible.

One of the available phased payment options is Deduction at Source from ten separate payment schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).<\/p><p>The Deputy should note that deductions are not taken from Jobseekers Allowance as the temporary and intermittent nature of the allowance could result in shortfalls in the amount of LPT deducted leaving property owners with outstanding liabilities at year-end.\u00a0 Also, the concept of a de minimis welfare payment from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) is enshrined in social welfare legislation and deductions that would have the effect of reducing a person's take-home amount to below the minimum weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, currently &euro;186 per week, cannot be made.  In regard to the operation of &quot;deduction at source&quot; (DAS) from DSP payments, it has been ensured, through ongoing dialogue between Revenue and DSP officials, that individuals impacted by the &euro;186 threshold are given early notification that Local Property Tax (LPT) payments cannot be deducted and alternative payment methods are put in place.<\/p><p>In cases where LPT cannot be deducted from DSP payments, there are other phased payment options available to assist property owners in spreading the liability over the course of the year.  These options include monthly Direct Debits through banks and certain credit union accounts and flexible payments through four approved Payment Service Providers including An Post, Payzone, Omnivend and PayPoint.  Each of these service providers applies various transaction charges that are outside of Revenue's control.<\/p><p>The option to defer payment of LPT is provided for in Part 12 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) including full Deferral and Partial Deferral (50%) of LPT liabilities for property owners meeting certain conditions including 'Income Level', 'Hardship', 'Personal Insolvency' and 'Personal Representative of a Deceased Person'.  The income threshold for a full deferral is &euro;15,000 (single person) per annum and &euro;25,000 (couple) per annum and for a partial deferral is &euro;25,000 (single person) per annum or &euro;35,000 (couple) per annum.  These thresholds can also be increased by 80% of any gross mortgage interest payments.  However, 'Deferral' and 'Partial Deferral' are not exemptions and the tax becomes payable at a later date and carries an annual interest rate of 4%.<\/p><p>Any property owners who wish to apply for a 'Deferral' or 'Partial Deferral', can access their records online at and amend the payment instruction as required.  Alternatively they can contact the LPT Helpline at 1890200255 where an agent will confirm any balances due and assist with making alternative payment arrangements, including Deferral\/Partial Deferral as necessary.<\/p><p>I engaged Dr Don Thornhill to consider the operation of the Local Property Tax, in particular, any impacts on LPT liabilities due to recent property price developments.\u00a0 In his report on his review of the Local Property Tax - which was published on Budget Day 2015 - Dr Thornhill made a number of recommendations including that the existing deferral provisions should be continued and be reviewed and revised at frequent intervals.  Dr Thornhill also recommended that for owner-occupiers over 80 years of age or those with stated certified long term illnesses and disabilities who are living alone, consideration be given to raising the income limit for deferrals to &euro;20,000. <\/p><p>In my Budget 2016 statement,\u00a0I announced that I would be proposing to Government that the revaluation date for the LPT be postponed from 2016 to 2019.

The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is the Department primarily responsible for the formulation and implementation of policy and for the preparation of legislation in relation to housing.  It must be pointed out that any such proposal, including the funding of SMEs will ultimately be a matter for regulatory approval by the Registrar of Credit Unions.<\/p>  <p>  - The Personal Microcredit Scheme was commenced on a pilot basis in November 2015.  30 credit unions are involved in providing individual loans of between &euro;100 and &euro;2,000 with a maximum interest rate of 12%.  The initiative is being led by the Department of Social Protection in conjunction with the Department of Finance and other interest groups.  Monitoring data are being collected on a regular basis which will inform the structure and support necessary for a national roll-out.<\/p>  <p>  - The Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) is currently carrying out a review of implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Credit Unions.  This report is due to be completed by end June 2016.<\/p>  <p>  - The Government provided &euro;250 million in the Credit Union Fund.  This funding is ring-fenced specifically to provide financial support for credit unions restructuring under the Credit union Restructuring Board (ReBo).  The terms of the Restructuring Scheme, agreed between the Department of Finance and DG Competition at the European Commission are specific to restructuring credit unions and are measures granted under a State aid scheme.  There is no flexibility within the Scheme to provide funding for any measure other than restructuring.<\/p>  <p>  - The Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS) protects depositors in the event of a bank, building society or credit union, authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland being unable to repay deposits.  The DGS protects depositors up to &euro;100,000 per person per institution.  While Article 13(1) of the DGS Directive states that Member States may provide for lower contributions for low-risk sectors regulated under national law, this must be read in conjunction with the entirety of Article 13 and,\u00a0in particular, Article 13(2) which states that the method for calculating contributions to the DGS shall be approved by the competent authority which is the Central Bank, in co-operation with the designated authority, which also the Central Bank.\u00a0 In accordance with the requirements of Article 13, the European Banking Authority (EBA) issued guidelines on methods for calculating contributions to DGSs.  Competent authorities must ensure that these guidelines are applied by DGSs when developing methods for calculating risk-based contributions by their members.  The Central Bank as the competent authority has indicated that it intends to follow those guidelines.  I have\u00a0been informed by the Central Bank that the calculation methodology currently being developed will assess and rank each credit institution separately.  Therefore, individual credit unions will be separately assessed and ranked, and those deemed to be lower risk under the risk categories as set out in the EBA guidelines will pay a lower contribution.  Conversely, individual credit unions deemed to be higher risk under these risk categories will pay a higher contribution.\u00a0\u00a0It is\u00a0important to highlight that neither\u00a0the\u00a0Minister for Finance\u00a0nor the Central Bank can\u00a0act\u00a0outside the parameters of Article 13 as a whole, which gives the Central Bank the mandate to determine and calculate risk based contributions.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000060#WRF04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":299,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000060#WRF04100"},{"type":"question","counter":300,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[7622\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000060#WRF04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to my many written questions on this issue to confirm if there has been any update in relation to the Setanta Insurance issue following the recent decision indicating that claims should be made through the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland; to confirm if he has received a clarification relating to this decision being appealed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1351","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":301,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, progress on the Setanta Insurance issue\u00a0has been awaiting the outcome of legal proceedings in the case of the Law Society of Ireland versus the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland (MIBI).\u00a0\u00a0On 4 September 2015, the High Court\u00a0held that the MIBI is liable in respect of claims against the policy holders of Setanta.\u00a0 This decision\u00a0was\u00a0subsequently appealed by the MIBI and\u00a0the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court decision in the case. \u00a0The MIBI has announced that it has decided to apply to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal judgement.<\/p>  <p>  I expect to be in a better position to inform the House further\u00a0after the legal proceedings are concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000060#WRF04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Availability","counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000060#WRF04400"},{"type":"question","counter":303,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[7654\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000060#WRF04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total rate of credit lending to small and medium enterprises via the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland; the total level of take-up from the fund by businesses at 31 December 2015 and in quarter one of 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":304,"content":"<p>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) began lending in March 2015.

This is the largest decline across all EU Member States for whom data is available.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The decline in unit labour costs in 2015 is a continuation of the trend of significant improvement in Ireland's economy-wide cost competitiveness since 2008 (the peak year for unit labour costs in Ireland).  It is estimated\u00a0that\u00a0nominal\u00a0unit labour costs in Ireland\u00a0fell by\u00a020 percent between 2008 and 2015.  This compares\u00a0with an increase of 14 per cent in the UK and\u00a09 per cent\u00a0in the euro area over the same time period.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, relatively low consumer price inflation over the last number of\u00a0years\u00a0has contributed to the improvement in Ireland's competitiveness as\u00a0Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to those of our euro area peers.  For instance, annual HICP inflation in Ireland has been below or equal that of the euro area every year since 2008. <\/p>  <p>  The gains in Irish competitiveness achieved since 2008 have been hard-won through productivity improvements and\u00a0wage and price moderation.  It is important that this competitiveness is\u00a0preserved and continues to support growth.\u00a0 In this regard we must be cognisant that favourable exchange rate movements can reverse, as can be seen for example in the recent strengthening of the euro against Sterling.  Similarly gains from the fall in oil prices\u00a0may unwind in the future.\u00a0 Therefore we need to stay focused on continuing to improve\u00a0Ireland's competitiveness through other channels such as wage and productivity improvements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000061#WRG00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Charges","counter":316,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000061#WRG00350"},{"type":"question","counter":317,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[7735\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000061#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he and his Department continue to monitor the levels of bank charges being imposed by various banks; the basis for such charges, nationally and internationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":318,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, all\u00a0credit institutions in Ireland are independent commercial entities.

They may carry out flood alleviation works from their own resources or apply to the Office of Public Works (OPW) for funding under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  This purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  The scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.  Any application received will be considered in accordance with the scheme eligibility criteria, which comprise economic, social and environmental criteria including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management.   <\/p>  <p>  The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding, is the OPW's Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  The Programme is focusing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of and impact from flooding.  It is the principal vehicle for implementing the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy.   <\/p>  <p>  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans. <\/p>  <p>  Good progress is being made on the CFRAM Programme, the draft mapping is now being finalised following completion of the national statutory public consultation on 23rd December, 2015.  Work on the development of preliminary options to address flood risk is underway.  Following finalisation of the mapping and the identification of flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific measures that can address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified.  The Plans, which are scheduled for completion by the end of 2016, will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.  Further information on the Programme is available on www.cfram.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The Government recently announced increased levels of investment in the area of flood relief as part of the overall Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 and this investment programme will allow for consideration of measures arising from the Flood Risk Management Plans. <\/p>  <p>  The OPWs Capital Investment Programme has already seen 36 major flood relief schemes implemented since 1995.  The Government has allocated &euro;80.7m in 2016 for the OPW's overall Flood Risk Management Programme of which &euro;52.5m is for the continued implementation of the comprehensive programme of capital flood relief works.  There are currently five major schemes at construction in Bray Co. Wicklow, River Dodder Dublin, South Campshires Dublin, Ennis Lower, and Phases 2, 3 and 4 in Waterford City.  There are a further 26 schemes at design and planning stage and, of these, it is anticipated that construction works on schemes in Claregalway Co. Galway, Bandon and Skibbereen in Co. Cork, Templemore Co. Tipperary and Foynes Co. Limerick will be commenced this year. <\/p>  <p>  Other schemes in the capital works programme will be advanced through the planning or Confirmation (Ministerial approval) processes and every effort will be made to also progress some of these schemes to construction in 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  The OPW has statutory responsibility for maintenance of the drainage works carried out by it under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995.

Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.

Where the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), which is responsible for securing compliance with employment legislation, receives a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, the WRC will investigate with a view to establishing whether a person has statutory entitlements under employment law.  Complaints involving au pairs are considered on a case-by-case basis, in the light of the facts of each case. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to public awareness, the WRC maintains a high profile as the State body primarily responsible for information and compliance on employment rights in a number of ways.

To ensure that awareness of these obligations is maintained, the WRC collaborates with key partners including civil society organisations, the trade union movement, employer organisations and other State bodies.  WRC publications are widely distributed through the offices of community organisations, NGOs and Citizen Information Offices.

This is because UK membership of the Union is hugely important both to Ireland&rsquo;s interests, and to the interests of a stable, successful and prosperous EU as a whole.  The Government&rsquo;s overriding focus has been, and remains, on helping to keep the UK in the Union, not preparing for its departure.<\/p>  <p>  Work has been underway across Government Departments, including my own, for some time to ensure we best understand the range of issues at stake.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of the Taoiseach also plays a leading role, given the whole-of-government dimension that is essential in this work.  In this context, last May, a unit was established in the Department of the Taoiseach, specifically dealing with British-Irish and Northern Ireland affairs.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance, for example, commissioned the research published last November by the Economic and Social Research Institute on Irish-British macroeconomic links in the context of our joint EU membership.<\/p>  <p>  We know from this and various other published assessments that there are very significant strategic and economic risks for Ireland if the UK were to leave the EU.  In order to mitigate these risks, the Government played a constructive role in the negotiations that took place at EU level, including in the context of the discussions leading up to the European Council in February, working with the British Government and all our EU partners towards a consensual basis for the UK&rsquo;s continued membership of the Union.<\/p>  <p>  Given the importance to the enterprise sector of this issue, both IDA and Enterprise Ireland are factoring this issue into their own contingency planning and continue to track where potential impacts may arise.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, the pace at which any potential exit was achieved, and the terms which the UK might negotiate with the EU across a wide range of domains will be a key determinant of the impact on the economy, particular sectors and individual firms.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland already has a significant number of programmes available to companies who face competitive threats from various sources.  These include Lean Programmes, Market Diversification, Innovation and Management Development.  These will be the tools available to assist companies with planning and preparation.<\/p>  <p>  Further, a key policy priority in recent years both for my Department and for Enterprise Ireland has been to support geographic market diversification, so that Irish owned exports to non-UK markets increase by 50% to reach exports of between &euro;5 and &euro;6 billion by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  As a result, both Service and Manufacturing firms exports have shown a clear reduction in dependency on the UK market.  A growing number of Enterprise Ireland supported exporters are exporting to more than five countries - an indication of a strengthening resilience in market diversity terms.  In 2014, 41.8% of EI assisted exporting firms exported to more than five countries compared to 33% in 2009.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000062#WRH03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services Provision","counter":418,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000063#WRJ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":419,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[7725\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000063#WRJ00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he is satisfied that all means of assistance available to the indigenous business sector here are readily available and accessible; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":420,"content":"<p>The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; State support service for micro and small businesses in each local area.

These include the Basic Payments Scheme, which incorporated payments under the former Grassland Sheep Scheme, provided exclusively for the sheep sector.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a range of schemes under the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014 -2020 have been designed to support the sheep sector.  Sheep farmers continue to be significant beneficiaries from the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) scheme.  The ANC Scheme is worth &euro;195 million annually to some 100,000 farmers and in excess of &euro;1.3 billion over the lifetime of the RDP. <\/p>  <p>  Funding has also been made available under the RDP for the Green Low Carbon Agri Environment Scheme (GLAS).  Access to GLAS is on a tiered basis with those in Tier 1 receiving priority.  Tier 1 participants are mainly those with Priority Environment Assets, which include Natura Land and Commonage.  Many sheep farmers are commonage shareholders and will qualify for Tier 1 access.  Some 38,000 farmers have been approved under the first two tranches of the Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Increased provision has also been made for improving efficiency and profitability in sheep production under Knowledge Transfer Groups under the RDP.  Building on the successful Sheep Technology Adoption Programme, it is expected that the Sheep Knowledge Transfer Groups will commence shortly.<\/p>  <p>  A range of capital supports for sheep farmers is also available under the TAMS II scheme, including: solid floor housing with or without penning, slatted floor housing, mobile sheep handling facilities, fixed sheep handling facilities, replacement of sheep slats in addition to many other capital investments available to all livestock enterprises such as manure pits, silage pits etc.   <\/p>  <p>  Additionally approval has been sought by DAFM from the European Commission to include sheep fencing as an eligible item of expenditure in the TAMS II.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department also funds the activities of Teagasc, Bord Bia and Sheep Ireland in the areas of research, advice, education, breed improvement and marketing and promotion.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to a further direct payment per ewe, any coupled payment would require a redistribution of existing funds and would involve cuts in other farm payments from Pillar 1.  Any nationally funded payment would have to be considered in the context of exchequer funding availability and also State aid.  Any consideration of further funding for the sheep sector under the RDP could only be considered in the context of an overall review of the implementation of the RDP and would require a re-distribution of funds within the RDP.   <\/p>  <p>  The sheep sector is an important component of our agriculture sector and the third largest farming sector in Ireland with over 34,000 producers and 2015 proved to be another good year for the sheep sector.  A combination of higher carcase weight (up 1.9%) and higher factory prices (up 1.5%) meant that output value of the sector increased by over 3%.  Total sheepmeat exports increased by an estimated 5% to &euro;230 million between 2014 and 2015.  At farm level, prices reached highs not seen in five years and thankfully these strong prices have continued into this year. <\/p>  <p>  Increasing consumer demand and market access is a key component in driving the growth in the sheep farming sector in addition to improving technical efficiencies at farm level.  My Department continually works on securing new markets for all Irish agri-food products including sheep meat.  In addition last year Commissioner Hogan set up the Sheepmeat Reflections Group at EU level to examine the sheep sector and the support it needs going forward in order to continue to make an important contribution to agricultural output.  My Department is participating in this group and I expect the outcome of this exercise to be reflected in future deliberations on EU policy in the sheep sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000064#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Young Farmers Scheme Eligibility","counter":480,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000064#WRK01100"},{"type":"question","counter":481,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[7462\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000064#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will consider granting a person (details supplied) in County Donegal the 2015 young farmers scheme payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":482,"content":"<p>The person named submitted applications under the &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; category of the 2015 National Reserve and the Young Farmers Scheme.

In 2015 export volumes increased by approximately 8%, with growth to the UK, Continental Europe and International markets.  Export values at &euro;570 million, fell marginally by 2% during 2015 due to lower pig prices.  Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices followed by a supply response and\/or a recovery in demand.  My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure over the last year and a half and the difficulties that this is causing for producers.  This is not an exclusively Irish phenomenon, and Irish prices have actually remained ahead of the EU average for the last five months.  However I would also add that like any other EU Minister I do not have a role in the setting of prices. This is a function of the market.<\/p>  <p>  At the March meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels, I put forward a number of measures for the pigmeat and dairy sectors which I believe were needed immediately to help producers through their current difficulties.  On pigmeat my priority was to secure the re-opening of the Pigmeat Private Storage Aid Scheme as I believe its closure did not appear justified by the current state of the EU and global pigmeat market.  Given that the sector does not enjoy direct EU supports, market tools available in times of extreme price volatility must be deployed when necessary.  I am pleased to note that the Commission has agreed to the re-opening of this scheme in 2016.  At the April meeting I reiterated the need to move quickly on the proposals agreed in order to bring about the desired stabilising effects.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Russian pigmeat ban, the adverse effects of the effective closure of this market are still being felt by farmers.  Ireland has requested the Commission to continue and intensify its political, technical and diplomatic efforts to unlock the Russian market for EU pigmeat.  We proposed that the Commission reengage and secure access for products outside the scope of the Presidential decree, such as pig fats and offals.<\/p>  <p>  In the interim, a direct aid package payment will issue in the coming week to all pig farmers in Ireland with a minimum level of supply of 200 pigs slaughtered in 2015.  This means a flat rate payment of over &euro;3,000 to each farmer.  This will ensure that the payment is directed to those farmers most affected by price volatility, thus meeting the requirements of the EU Regulations providing the funding.  Furthermore, Commissioner Hogan has reiterated his determination to promote the EU&rsquo;s interests and open up new markets for EU products, with a specific &euro;30 million envelope for dairy and pigmeat available under the EU Promotion Scheme to reflect the market disturbances in those sectors.  Ireland, through Bord Bia, will be making an application for a proportion of this funding in the very near future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000065#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dairy Sector","counter":538,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000065#WRL01400"},{"type":"question","counter":539,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[7694\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000065#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the outcome of discussions at the recent European Union Agriculture Council in relation to the serious problems facing the dairy sector; the proposals there are to provide additional and much needed assistance at European level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":540,"content":"<p>The price of milk and dairy commodities is determined by a range of factors, including supply and demand at international level.  Food commodity markets including dairy markets have been characterised by significant levels of volatility for a number of years and this trend has continued throughout 2015 and into early 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Factors contributing to global price volatility in 2015 included the Russian Ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers including the EU on the supply side.  The longer term demographic and demand perspectives remain positive, but 2016 will be a challenging year.<\/p>  <p>  Production decisions are made by producers, taking prevailing market conditions as well as their efficiency of production and price of inputs into account.  The challenge posed by price volatility has been highlighted by my Department and others over a number of years, and indeed my Department has, including through its agencies, invested significant resources in providing farmers with advice and technology designed to improve on farm efficiency, reduce production costs, and make farm businesses more resilient in times of downward price pressure.  The abolition of dairy quotas in April 2015 allows farmers the freedom to make these production decisions on a commercial basis.<\/p>  <p>  That said, we obviously must offer support to the sector in times of prevailing difficulty such as we are now experiencing.  In this respect, I very much welcome the Presidency conclusions on the proposal for the package of support measures to address challenges in the dairy and pigmeat sectors which was agreed in Brussels at last month&rsquo;s Council.  This follows on from an earlier package of measures agreed in September of last year and takes account of the ongoing difficulties being experienced in the sector, where the duration of market turbulence has gone well beyond previous expectations.<\/p>  <p>  The package includes a number of proposals by Ireland to the Commission and other Member States in advance of Council, in particular the doubling of the intervention ceiling for skimmed milk powder and butter.  I also welcome the Commissioner&rsquo;s undertaking to consider further flexibilities in the PSA scheme for Skimmed Milk Powder, and to look at further flexibilities in the State Aid regime.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of input costs at farm level, I have called on the Commission to consider looking at temporary suspension of EU import tariffs on fertilisers to reduce input costs for Irish and EU farmers and I understand that the Commission is looking favourably on this request.  The Presidency conclusions also refer to the possibility of advance payments under CAP, as was done in 2015. In addition my Department is in the final stages of issuing &euro;26.4m in direct aid to dairy farmers funded by the exchequer and the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, with respect to financial instruments, I welcome the proposal for the European Investment Bank (EIB) and member states to work together with the Commission on the feasibility of an EU export credit tool. <\/p>  <p>  It remains clear that we need to deal urgently and effectively with this temporary problem.  We must ensure that EU farmers are protected from the worst impacts of low commodity prices in an appropriate way, but remain well placed to avail of emerging opportunities when markets recover.  Ireland is strongly positioned as a competitive producer of dairy, and while conditions are extremely difficult at present, Irish dairy farmers will be well placed to avail of the opportunity presented by market recovery in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000065#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Applications","counter":541,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000065#WRL01700"},{"type":"question","counter":542,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[7701\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000065#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of a single payment for a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":543,"content":"<p>An application under the 2015 Basic Payment Scheme was received from the person named on 6 May 2015.

These twin imperatives informed my approach to the negotiations in 2012 and 2013, and they continue to inform the process by which the various elements of CAP reform are now being delivered.<\/p>  <p>  Taking the direct payments system as an example, the Deputy may recall that I proposed an alternative approach to the redistribution of direct payments than that originally advocated by the European Commission, precisely because I wanted to ensure that the direct payments system could be made fairer and more equitable while at the same time ensuring that the level of transfer of payments between farmers was not of a scale that might jeopardise our objectives for the development of the sector.  We now have a system which satisfies these two requirements.  Last year&rsquo;s payments under the Basic Payment and other schemes represented the start of a process that, by 2019, will see a considerable shift in the balance of payments from those previously receiving very high rates per hectare to those previously receiving much lower rates of payment.  I believe that this not only makes the direct payments system fairer, but also ensures that it continues to provide support and income stability that will allow farmers to respond to the demands of the market.  As such, it also provides a vital tool to help us achieve the objectives outlined in the Food Wise 2025 strategy.<\/p>  <p>  I have also taken significant steps to encourage the participation of young farmers in agriculture, which is vital in terms of securing the critical role that farm families play in the development of the sector. In addition to providing for a top-up of direct payments, I have ensured that young farmers are prioritised in the allocation of payment entitlements from the national reserve.  These direct payments measures are further complemented by supports under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme where, for example, enhanced support for capital investment by young farmers has been made available under the TAMS schemes.<\/p>  <p>  More generally under Pillar 2 of the CAP, I am focussed on the socio-economic development of our farms and of our rural areas so that all farm families have an opportunity to realise their potential.  Schemes for improving sustainability (such as GLAS and the Beef Data and Genomics Programme) and competitiveness (such as TAMS) are complemented by continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now known as Areas of Natural Constraint).

In addition to these value increases, the dairy industry targeted a 50% increase in milk production by 2020, to be progressed following the abolition of milk quotas in April last year.<\/p><p>Progress on those targets were monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis.

Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.<\/p><p>If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy believes that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025: increasing the value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increasing value added in the sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion; and increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion.  With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agri-food sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development.  Realising these growth projections will be challenging, but I am confident that they can be achieved.<\/p><p>I chair the High Level Implementation Committee, including senior officials from relevant Departments and State agencies, which will drive implementation of the Food Wise recommendations.

My Department engages on an ongoing basis with many Third countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia, the meat industry, Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade and the European Commission on various market access issues.  2015 was a very successful year for meat exports.  According to Bord Bia overall exports of beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat and poultry increased by &euro;140 million to &euro;3.5 billion.  Although exports to the EU account for the majority of meat exports, Third Country markets are increasingly an important alternative outlet for the industry.<\/p>  <p>  I am constantly seeking to develop long-term trading relationships in new and expanding international markets for Irish meat products, raising the profile of Ireland and increasing international confidence in Irish meat production and control systems.  Since taking office I have led trade missions to a wide variety of destinations, including China, the United States, Algeria, Japan, West Africa and the Gulf States, in order to promote Irish food and beverages, including meat exports, and to open up new markets abroad.<\/p>  <p>  These initiatives and efforts have led to several notable successes in securing agreement to export Irish beef to the USA, Japan, the Philippines, Canada, Singapore, Egypt, Iran and Oman; to export sheepmeat to Canada, Singapore, South Africa, the Philippines, Hong Kong, the UAE, Canada and Oman; to export pigmeat to Australia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Serbia; and to export poultry meat to Singapore and the UAE.<\/p>  <p>  The opening of the US market to Irish beef in early 2015 has provided an important outlet that holds enormous potential for future development given that we are the first EU Member State to gain access.  An estimated 1,800 tonnes valued at &euro; 14 million was exported in 2015.  In Quarter 1 of 2016 approximately 700 tonnes with a value of &euro;6 million are estimated to have been exported, continuing the positive trends from last year.  My Department remains engaged with the US authorities to allow for the extension of beef exports to include manufacturing beef\/Beef Intended for Grinding (BIFG).<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made along the path to securing access to the Chinese market for Irish beef with the lifting of the BSE ban by China in February 2015, and an inspection visit by a delegation from AQSIQ to Ireland was hosted in January 2016.  Steps have been taken towards the opening of the Israeli market for beef exports once again following an audit visit to approve selected plants in February 2016.  A delegation from South Korea is expected to conduct a systems audit visit regarding beef access in May.<\/p>  <p>  Other market access opportunities being actively pursued at present include beef access for Vietnam, pigmeat access for Mexico and beef and pigmeat access for the Ukraine.  The search for new markets will continue in conjunction with various stakeholders.  This will also be guided by the implementation of Food Wise 2025 strategy which identified the future global growth opportunities which Ireland is well placed to benefit from, including: our reputation for food safety and controls; our natural competitive advantage in sustainable grass-based production; and a world class agri-food industry, backed by strong State support services.  These strengths and opportunities should enhance our search for new Third Country markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000065#WRL03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Safety Standards","counter":559,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000065#WRL03500"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[7747\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000065#WRL03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he is satisfied regarding the adequacy and frequency of checks and inspections in respect of food and food product labelling here and throughout the European Union with particular reference to the need to preserve the integrity of the food industry and recognise its importance to the economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":561,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, I attach great importance to the food and drink industries exports and their contribution to our economic recovery.

This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b><\/b>Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied.  In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have systems to identify any person who supplies the business with a food, and a system to identify other businesses to which their product has been supplied.  This is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.  There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224\/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404\/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.<\/p><p>My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants.

The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States.  Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department.  Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the FVO to ensure compliance.

Charges for the use of facilities and services at each of the Fishery Harbour Centres are levied by virtue of the Fishery Harbour Centres (Rates &amp;amp; Charges) Order 2012 (S.I. No. 214 of 2012) which came into effect on 1 July 2012.  Different rates apply according to the type and nature of the vessel, the different use made of the facilities by the vessel, the size of the vessel and the quantity and species of fish landed (where applicable).<\/p><p>The mandatory nature of the charges referred to is nothing new, and is consistent with the situation as it pertained in the previous Order S.I. No. 439 of 2003.  For ease of reference and for clarification, the relevant charges under S.I. No. 214 of 2012 are set out in the following table.<\/p><p>S.I. No. 214 of 2012 provides <i>inter alia<\/i>that charge no. 9 of Schedule 1 for the use of fresh water is &ldquo;...mandatory on all vessels using a Fishery Harbour Centre whether or not they use fresh water...&rdquo; other than vessels paying under charge no. 5, charge no. 10 in Schedule 1 or charge no. 17 in Schedule 2. In this regard, please note the following:<\/p><p>-  Charge no. 5 of Schedule 1 relates to landing of whitefish.  It is generally only larger fishing vessels that opt to be invoiced under this charge.<\/p><p>-  Charge no. 10 of Schedule 1 relates to use of the harbour by passenger boats\/vessels and cruise vessels.<\/p><p>-  Charge no. 17 of Schedule 2 relates to berthing of yachts and pleasure crafts.<\/p><p>-  Charge 9 takes account of different types of vessel, drawing a distinction as it does between fishing vessels, pelagic vessels and other vessels.  Within this framework, it also differentiates on size, between fishing vessels over and under 6 metres in length overall.<\/p><p>Waste charges are mandatory on all vessels using a Fishery Harbour Centre whether or not waste is disposed of, as set out in Charge 10 of Schedule 2.  The mandatory nature of the charge arises from national and EU legislative requirements and is also designed to reduce any incentive to discharge waste at sea.  A key principle underpinning this charge is that larger vessels generally tend to generate more waste and are charged more accordingly.  The 2012 Order revoked its 2003 predecessor and while vessels were categorised somewhat differently under the 2003 Order, there has been no increase in the quantum of water or waste charges since then.<\/p><p>In March 2015, following a complaint the Office of the Ombudsman found no issue with the mandatory nature of these particular charges.<\/p><p>That said, the Department is currently undertaking an internal review of the Fishery Harbour Centres (Rates &amp;amp; Charges) Order 2012 (S.I. No. 214 of 2012) , with the intention of introducing a new Order in 2017.

Notwithstanding that, the level of threat from this source is kept under close and constant review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all appropriate measures will continue to be taken by the authorities here, in co-operation with their international partners, in responding to any identified threats and in seeking to prevent attacks.  There is no complacency in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  I should emphasise that the main security threat in the State is from the so-called 'dissident' republican paramilitary groups who continue to be a priority counter-terrorism focus for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda authorities will continue to target those involved and to work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in bearing down on these groups.  The Garda&iacute; and the PSNI deserve praise for their ongoing work in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has developed considerable operational capacities in countering terrorism and in responding to critical incidents.  There is, in particular, a highly-trained and well equipped special intervention capability in the Emergency Response Unit that is supported by the regional Armed Support Units.  All the relevant agencies here cooperate closely in respect of any threats identified.  Where necessary, the considerable skills of the Defence Forces are also available in aid to the civil power.<\/p>  <p>  The ability to prevent attacks is as important as an ability to deal with such an eventuality.  The gathering of intelligence both domestically and from international sources plays a priority role in ensuring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can perform this task.  The sharing of information and the use of modern information technology structures to support this function is a key priority internationally.  The Government is committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to enable them to interact effectively at this level.  This includes connecting to the European Schengen Information System and, indeed, to other EU and Interpol information-sharing resources relevant to countering the terrorist threat.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing the effectiveness of information and intelligence-sharing and enhancing border security have been priority themes at recent meetings of the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council and they will remain at the top of the agenda for the foreseeable future.  A series of measures is being rolled out to build on and improve current operational co-operation and to develop the EU's legal framework for information-sharing, combating terrorism and controlling illegal firearms.

These children are, by definition, without parents or family in this jurisdiction and Tusla receives them into care on this basis while their applications for asylum are being processed and are referred to as separated children seeking asylum.<\/p><p>Separated children seeking asylum are placed in the care of the State, with Tusla.  Following a residential assessment, the majority of the children are placed with foster families and Tusla has a dedicated social work team to work with this vulnerable cohort.  A social worker is allocated to each separated child seeking asylum and the social worker has responsibility for the development and implementation of an individualised statutory care plan for the child.  If the social work assessment indicates that making a protection application is in the child&rsquo;s best interest, the social worker assists with the application.  <\/p><p>The State is duty bound by international and domestic law to protect and provide for separated children in the same way as it does for children normally resident in the State.  In order to provide the same standard of care provision for separated children seeking asylum as any other child in State care, an Equity of Care Principle was introduced in 2010 by the HSE.  Tusla maintains the equity and equality of services to separated children vis-&agrave;-vis other children in State care and ensures there is no differentiation of standard care provision, care practices, care priorities, standards or protocols.  All foster care organisations and statutory residential centres are inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), and private and voluntary residential centres are inspected by Tusla, against national standards.  The inspection reports are published on the respective websites. <\/p><p>My Department has a range of systems in place to ensure it is informed of risk to children and families.  Tusla, within its national office, has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team.  This team produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, and includes detailed reporting on key performance indicators.  Tusla also provides me with information on children in care, their placement type, care status and allocation of social workers.  All HIQA and Tusla inspection reports are reviewed and analysed by my Department.  The overview from these reports provides me with a level of assurance on the overall standard of care and protection capacity of Tusla.  Additional information is gleaned from the National Review Panel reports on individual cases, and also from investigations conducted by the Ombudsman for Children. <\/p><p>Children First (2011) applies to separated children seeking asylum.

Foster care is the main form of alternative care for children in need of care and protection and is the preferred option for children who cannot live with their parent(s)\/guardian(s).  At the end of December 2015, there were 6,388 children in care in Ireland.  Some 93% (5,932) of these children were cared for in foster placements.  The majority of children are in the care of general foster carers.  At the end of December 2015, some 64% (4,100) of children in care were in a general foster care placement and 29% (1,832) were in foster care with relatives.  <\/p><p>Key elements of the support to be provided to children in care include: access to a Link Social Worker for supervision and support to the foster carers; allocation of a dedicated Social Worker for children in care; onward referral and advocacy for access to specialist services to meet the child&rsquo;s identified needs, such as speech and language therapy, counselling and psychology services. <\/p><p>The link worker is a professionally qualified social worker and meets regularly with foster carers to supervise the capacity of the foster carers to adequately meet the needs of the child and to provide training, information and whatever other support that may be required.  At the end of December 2015, 79% (3,277\/4,151) of foster carers had a link social worker and 93% (5,492\/5,932) of children in foster care had an allocated social worker.  I would also note that Tusla provides funding to the Irish Foster Care Association which provides additional supports to carers, including training and advice services.<\/p><p>As the majority of children in care are in foster care family settings in the community, indicators of stability of the placement and participation in education are useful in monitoring the performance of Tusla in relation to overall welfare.  I am happy to say that Tusla has reported that the results for these indicators are positive and show that overall placement stability is very high and participation in education is on a par with the national participation rates.  In addition there are regulations and standards in place for foster and residential placements and there is a regime of regular monitoring and inspections by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA).  These inspection reports on available on <i>www.hiqa.ie.<\/i>All 17 areas have been inspected at least once by HIQA, as well as a number of private foster care services.<\/p><p>All children in care should have an allocated social worker but it is important to note that if a child has not been allocated a social worker, the cases are reviewed regularly by the principal social worker and are managed by duty social work teams to support the child's needs.

The additional funding of &euro;38 million which the Government has allocated to Tusla for 2016, will give the Agency greater capacity to respond to identified demand and to alleviate pressures being faced in areas such as unallocated cases and private residential and foster care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000068#WRO04100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":708,"content":"<p>Question No. 252 answered with Question No. 248.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care Education","counter":709,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000068#WRO04200"},{"type":"question","counter":710,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[7669\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000068#WRO04300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"to address concerns that there is insufficient capacity in the early education sector to accommodate the roll-out of the second preschool year under the early childhood care and education scheme; the capacity reviews which have been undertaken by his Department or Pobal to access the level of capacity within the sector; and the detail of the findings of such reviews.","asker":"1250","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":711,"content":"<p>The expansion of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme on foot of the allocation of additional funding in Budget 2016 will see the number of children benefitting from the Programme rise from around 67,000 to around 127,000 in a given programme year.  For the 2016\/17 programme year, it is estimated that 89,500 children will be eligible to enrol in the Programme from September 2016, an additional 22,000 from January 2017 and a further 15,500 from April 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The budgetary announcement in Oct 2015 gave services that wished to expand 11 months notice to plan for the first additional entrants and 18 months to plan for the peak demand in April 2017.

My Department continues to work closely with the City and County Childcare Committees to match this data against their reported capacity in the sector to meet the increase in demand.

In addition I am pleased to note that the Department of the Environment will provide &euro;10 million under the Capital Assistance Scheme to provide suitable accommodation for people transitioning from institutions in 2016.  The HSE estimate that a further 100 people could benefit from this initiative.  Some &euro;1 million in ring-fenced leasing funding is also being made available by the Department of the Environment in 2016 to support people moving from institutions into suitable social housing in the community.  This demonstrates the joined up commitment of both Departments to support the de-congregation programme.  <\/p><p>The HSE has developed a three strand approach to accelerate transitions from institutions in the period 2016-2021, with a target of 900 people to move to more suitable accommodation in this period. <\/p><p>Strand 1 - is focussed on large institutional settings at high risk of not meeting HIQA Standards;<\/p><p>Strand 2 - is focussed on moving people into suitable social housing in the community through the Department of Environment schemes; and<\/p><p>Strand 3 - is focussed on remaining service users in congregated settings who could move to suitable accommodation.<\/p><p>As the specific information requested in the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.

The Directive establishes a framework for cross border healthcare between EU\/EEA states to facilitate patients to access care in another Member State in accordance with their entitlements in their own country.  Under the Directive, known as the Cross Border Healthcare Directive (CBD), insured patients are entitled to have the costs of cross-border healthcare services reimbursed if the healthcare service in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation.

Access to healthcare abroad is based on patients following public patient pathways - i.e. patients must demonstrate they have followed the equivalent public patient pathways that a patient would follow if accessing public healthcare in Ireland.  Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other HSE clinicians.  The CBD excludes certain health services, e.g. services of public health, long term care, organ transplantation, etc.  All persons on public waiting lists, other than for such exempt health services, are eligible for the Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000069#WRP04700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"question","counter":767,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[7327\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000069#WRP04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason those availing of the cross-border treatment scheme have to pay for their treatment abroad up-front; if he is aware that this is not a requirement; if he will consider facilitating access to this scheme without up-front payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school and over 200,000 girls have received the vaccine since its introduction in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  The European Medicines Agency has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information. On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  Anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.

","asker":"1228","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":898,"content":"<p>I am aware that there is a lot of concern and worry among cystic fibrosis (CF) sufferers, and families of children who have CF, about the current debate on the cost and availability of this medicine.<\/p>  <p>  Orkambi (lumacaftor\/ivacaftor) is a combination drug for the treatment of CF in patients with two copies of a specific CF gene mutation.  The drug was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2015 and by the European Medicines Agency in November 2015.  To date, it has not been approved for reimbursement by any public health service in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Each country has its own process for approval.  The Irish process is laid down in law in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  Under this law, the HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the law.  It is appropriate that these should not be political decisions and that a scientific and evidence based approach is taken to determine the extent to which patients would benefit from treatment with expensive new drugs.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness, and the resources available to the HSE.  The process for approval of high-tech new drugs in Ireland involves three steps.  The first step involves a Rapid Review, which has been completed.  The second involves a full Health Technology Assessment by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  This expert assessment is scientific and objective and will evaluate whether the claims being made about the benefits of a new drug are valid, and to what extent, in terms of its impact on life expectancy, quality of life, reducing hospital admissions, reduced need for transplants etc.  The NCPE will also consider which patient groups might benefit, how the drug compares with existing treatments and if it is cost-effective at the price being sought by the manufacturer.  The Minister for Health has requested that the NCPE expedite this part of the process.  The Centre hopes to be in a position to issue its recommendation to the HSE in early June, and the HSE may then engage in price negotiations with the manufacturer.<\/p>  <p>  The process being followed is the same as that for other CF drugs like Kalydeco (ivacaftor), new drugs to treat cancer and other rare diseases.  Orkambi will be treated in the same way as these were, and has to be, under the law.  This process is designed to secure the best value for the HSE, and the savings that accrue from this process can be used to fund other health service developments, for example isolation rooms for CF and cancer patients, better ambulance services, home supports for the elderly and safer maternity services.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that it will be possible for Orkambi to be approved for patients who will benefit from it, and at a fair price, but it must go through the normal approval procedure first, like all other high-tech medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000072#WRS01400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Delays","counter":899,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000072#WRS01450"},{"type":"question","counter":900,"qnumday":317,"qnumall":"[7510\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000072#WRS01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a hospital appointment in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 7 and the reason for the delay in this person receiving an appointment.

The Government&rsquo;s core view &ndash; which I believe enjoys wide consensus in Ireland &ndash; is that we want the UK to remain a member of the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Within the context of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing work on this issue, I travelled to London on 5 April for a visit that encompassed a meeting with UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, contacts with the opposition Labour Party, meetings with leading members of the Irish Community and engagement with the Irish community media in the UK.  I also met last week with a cross-section of Irish employers and business groups to hear their views on the referendum and to hear what actions they were taking.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, through its diplomatic staff in Dublin, across Britain and Northern Ireland, in Brussels and further afield, continues to work actively on this issue and to contribute to wider Government efforts coordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach. <\/p>  <p>  An important focus of my visit to London on 5 April was to meet members of the Irish community and to engage with Irish community media in the UK.  I met with over 30 Irish community and business organisations and encouraged them to inform and involve their members, most of whom as Irish citizens resident in the UK are eligible to vote in this referendum.  According to the 2011 Census for England and Wales and the 2011 Census for Scotland, there are 601,917 people born on the island of Ireland resident in Britain, while it is also estimated that up to one in four people in Britain may have Irish heritage.<\/p>  <p>  Some leading individuals in the Irish community have also come together to form an independent campaign group, Irish4Europe, and I met with them to hear of their plans for the coming weeks in the run-up to the referendum on 23 June. <\/p>  <p>  During my meeting with the Foreign Secretary, I recalled that the Irish Government had been very active in helping to secure a settlement on the UK&rsquo;s EU membership at the February European Council.  I also reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s clear view in support of the UK Government&rsquo;s wish for the UK to remain in the EU. <\/p>  <p>  I meet regularly with my EU counterparts at meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council and use every opportunity to raise the issue of the EU-UK relationship with them, and to outline Ireland's perspective and the need to work together with a view to helping to keep the UK in the EU.  This all contributed to the work of EU Heads of State and Government at the European Council, and by Ministers at the General Affairs Council.<\/p>  <p>  I and my officials also discuss the matter with the Northern Ireland Parties and with civic society groups, in particular underlining our view that EU has made &ndash; and continues to make &ndash; a significant contribution to the promotion of peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The British Embassy has estimated that approximately 120,000 British citizens living in Ireland will be eligible to vote and I welcome and support the active outreach efforts undertaken by the Embassy in encouraging their citizens living here to register and vote in this referendum.  It is hoped that the regular statements by government and by other political, civil society, media and economic commentators will help to inform their vote.<\/p>  <p>  Determining the full implications for Ireland of a British withdrawal from the EU &ndash; should it occur - is not possible without knowing the terms and conditions of its future relationship with the EU, which would take a number of years to negotiate. <\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the Government is of course evaluating the potential impacts of a possible British exit from the EU and the steps which may be necessary to mitigate against the risks arising from this.  The ESRI has also conducted research on this issue, as have others including the Central Bank, the NTMA, Teagasc and IBEC. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000075#WRV04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications Data","counter":1075,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000075#WRV04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1076,"qnumday":379,"qnumall":"[7426\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000075#WRV04600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"to report on the meeting of target issue dates in the processing of passports and passport cards in 2016; his plans to meet the increased summer demand in 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1254","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1077,"content":"<p>The processing time for a passport varies, depending on the service the customer chooses.

The abduction in April 2014 of the schoolgirls from Chibok appalled the world. This attack was one of a number perpetrated on defenceless young people, seeking to destroy their education and their futures.    Ireland, together with our EU partners, continues to call on all parties to work for the release of the more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok who remain in captivity.  We are aware that a video has been released in recent days, from which family members and friends are said to have identified some of the girls.  <\/p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the Nigerian Government to create a secure environment in which the human rights of civilians are promoted and protected, including in those areas affected by Boko Haram. <\/p>  <p>  The Nigerian Government has seen some recent successes in tackling Boko Haram and regaining control of territory.

This breakdown has been all the more regrettable given that there were positive signs in the peace process as recently as early 2015. Ireland has been a strong supporter of the peace talks between the Turkish Government and the PKK.

However, religious leaders have condemned such actions as not in accordance with religious beliefs.  We must continue to make this distinction: the threat is posed not by religious belief, but by terrorist groups. The Minister for Justice and Equality takes the lead role in assessing and responding to the threat to national security posed by international terrorism.  The Minster has stated that there is no specific information concerning any threat to Ireland, and that the level of threat is kept under constant review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   Appalling attacks over the past year in France, Lebanon, Mali, Turkey and elsewhere have served to remind us that terrorism does not respect borders.  The recent horrific attacks in Brussels have demonstrated once again that the potential for terrorist attacks is heightened by European citizens returning from areas of conflict.  Accordingly, while member states have the primary responsibility for addressing terrorism, an effective response requires international cooperation.<\/p>  <p>  At EU level, external action to prevent and counter terrorism has been discussed regularly by the Foreign Affairs Council.  An EU Counter Terrorism Strategy for Syria and Iraq, was approved by the FAC in October 2014 and an outline of this was subsequently made public.<\/p>  <p>  Further discussions took place at the FAC in January and February 2015.  At our 9 February meeting we reiterated the EU&rsquo;s support for swift implementation of relevant UN Security Council Resolutions in full compliance with international law, fundamental values and international human rights standards.  We highlighted the need to step up EU external action and to that end, agreed to pursue initiatives in five broad areas.  These concerned strengthening partnerships with key countries in the Middle East and North Africa and with regional bodies such as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation; supporting capacity building in those countries; countering radicalisation and violent extremism; active engagement with international partners and organisations; and addressing underlying factors and crises.<\/p>  <p>  Under the heading of countering radicalisation and violent extremism we welcomed initiatives to facilitate interfaith dialogue, we invited the EU Special Representative for Human Rights to continue efforts to defend and advocate freedom of expression, religion and belief particularly in the MENA region, and we agreed that the EU would continue to work with faith-based organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Our discussions and conclusions fed into a meeting of the informal European Council on 12 February.  This meeting also took account of work undertaken by EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers to promote EU internal security. Heads of State and Government set out an agenda for action for 2015 on internal and external EU action.  This detailed guidance included a focus on promotion of tolerance, non-discrimination, fundamental freedoms and solidarity, including stepping up inter-faith and other dialogue, and promoting narratives to counter terrorist ideologies.<\/p>  <p>  Work on these various strands continued throughout 2015.  The December Foreign Affairs Council reviewed progress in implementing the measures agreed at our February 2015 meeting.  Progress was achieved in a wide range of areas, supported through the provision of substantially increased funding for counter terrorism activities in third countries.  Some &euro;142 million was allocated in 2015 compared to just &euro;10 million four years previously.  A comprehensive package of assistance has been put in place for Tunisia and it is hoped that this will lead to similar packages for other countries in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Counter terrorism experts were appointed in 2015 to a number of EU delegations in the MENA region, Turkey and Nigeria to work closely with the host countries to tackle the terrorist threat.  We also strengthened cooperation with international partners including the UN, the League of Arab States and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.

I call on all parties, including all members of the International Syria Support Group, to support the UN&rsquo;s efforts and to commit themselves to work sincerely and with urgency for a nationwide ceasefire, a negotiated peace agreement which will protect the rights of the Syrian people and preserve the pluralistic character, unity and sovereignty of a free and democratic Syria at peace.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly endorses the efforts of the United Nations to renew peace negotiations based on the 2012 Geneva communique principles and UN Security Council Resolution 2254, in particular the ending of violence, the formation of a transitional governing body with full executive powers and a constitutional reform process which would protect Syria&rsquo;s multi-ethnic and multi-sectarian character.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that there must also be legal accountability for victims of the Syrian conflict and in 2014 we co-sponsored a resolution called for referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.<\/p>  <p>  I would also note that the UN Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry has reported that the Assad regime is responsible for the majority of crimes against the Syrian people.<\/p>  <p>  While recognising the need for a political transition and an end to the Assad regime, I want to make clear that it is the Syrian people&rsquo;s right to decide on Syria&rsquo;s future national leadership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000076#WRW02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1123,"content":"<p>Question No. 397 answered with Question No. 377.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":1125,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000076#WRW02900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":1124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000076#WRW02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1125,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[7251\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000076#WRW02900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when a written decision will issue to a school (details supplied) in County Donegal regarding the building of a new classroom; if she will permit this classroom to be built as part of the main school building rather than as a stand-alone building; if not, the reasons for same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1325"},{"type":"speech","counter":1126,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the school referred to by the Deputy has made an application to my Department for significant capital funding for the provision of additional classroom and ancillary school accommodation.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, due to the competing demands on my Department's capital budget, my Department's focus at this time is on the need to prioritise available funding towards the provision of essential school classroom accommodation where an additional teacher appointment has been made.<\/p><p>The application from the school in question is currently being considered in that context and a decision will be conveyed to the school shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000076#WRW03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1325"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Applications","counter":1127,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000076#WRW03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1128,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[7255\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000076#WRW03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding the grant aid for major capital works for a school (details supplied) in County Cork; the developments from the schools appraisal unit; when a decision will be made; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1283","askee":"1325"},{"type":"speech","counter":1129,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the school referred to by the Deputy has made an application to my Department for funding for capital works.<\/p><p>Further details relevant to the application were requested from the school.

The previous Government decided to reduce the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.  Overall, the removal of qualification allowances had the effect of further reducing the pay of new entrant teachers by between 5 and 7 percent.<\/p>  <p>  The measures above &ndash; which applied to new entrants only and which were in addition to the pay reductions imposed on public servants generally -  were implemented at a time of extraordinarily difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.  It is estimated that some 6,700 teachers who entered the profession since 2011 have been affected by the measures.<\/p>  <p>  Maintaining the high quality of our education system and the teaching profession is a key concern of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Haddington Road Agreement re-aligned the pay scale for teachers who entered teaching between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 with that of pre-2011 entrants.  An improved pay scale for post-1 February 2012 entrants was also agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement will begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years.  The flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement are proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000078#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1325"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Funding","counter":1192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000078#WRY00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1193,"qnumday":420,"qnumall":"[7443\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000078#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of applications for school grants (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1325"},{"type":"speech","counter":1194,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that commensurate with the level of funding available for the Summer Works Scheme, applications are being assessed on a top down basis in accordance with the prioritisation criteria outlined in the governing Circular Letter for the Scheme.

The Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme has been developed specifically for local authority mortgage borrowers, as part of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) arrangements which operates in local authorities.  The scheme was piloted in Dublin City and Westmeath County Councils in 2013 and rolled out nationally in 2014.  In total, 193 LAMTR cases have been completed to date, 7 of which were in Laois and 6 in Kildare, with a significant number of other cases being progressed by local authorities in the context of their operation of the MARP.<\/p><p>The LAMTR scheme is similar to the scheme for borrowers with mortgages from private commercial lending institutions, insofar as it also targets low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  Further information on the LAMTR scheme is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Both schemes also ensure that the family remains in their home.  In the case of LAMTR, ownership of the home is transferred to a local authority, rather than to an Approved Housing Body (AHB) as is the case under the MTR scheme in the private lending sector. Both schemes require the household to be eligible for social housing in order to access to the scheme.<\/p><p>My Department does not have access to information relating to the number of borrowers who have been offered the Mortgage to Rent Scheme by their specific private lending institution.  The lender is the main point of contact for the borrower in terms of the operation of the scheme - only lenders can put an application forward for the scheme.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) can advise borrowers in mortgage distress how to access the Scheme, but it is up to the lender to offer the borrower access to it.<\/p><p>According to the latest figures available, at the end of February 2016, a total of 785 cases were either complete or being actively progressed under the Mortgage to Rent (MTR) Scheme for borrowers of private commercial lending institutions; 27 of these were in Laois, with 64 in Kildare.  Of these, 150 cases had completed all stages of the process. In total, since the introduction of the Scheme in 2012, 3,256 cases had been submitted; 93 of these were in Laois, with 210 in Kildare.

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities. <\/p>  <p>  In October 2015, the Government approved a programme to deliver 500 units of rapid-delivery housing across the Dublin Region for homeless families currently in commercial hotels. An initial 22 units are being delivered in Poppintree, Ballymun. In November 2015, Dublin City Council entered into a contract for the delivery of the 22 units in Ballymun at a cost of &euro;4.2m excluding VAT. This is the original tender cost and remains the approved cost, equating to approximately &euro;191,000 excluding VAT per unit. While a wide range of possible costs were suggested by various parties outside the tender process , including at the time that a variety of modular-type units were demonstrated in September 2015, it is only through the tender process , on the basis of a clear specification for high quality units, that a definitive project cost is established. The average cost of these units   must be considered in the context of their early delivery and the quality involved.   <\/p>  <p>  This programme of rapid-delivery housing provision is being implemented to mitigate the issues associated with an increasing volume of homeless households accommodated in inappropriate commercial hotel arrangements. The units will provide accommodation for those families currently in hotels in the first instance, offering a greater level of stability while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured. Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support planning for access to all required services, including welfare, health and housing services. The temporary assignment of these units to homeless households, and the duration of occupancy by them, is a matter for housing authorities.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000082#WRCC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1349"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":1405,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000082#WRCC00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Fisheries","counter":1404,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000082#WRCC00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1405,"qnumday":492,"qnumall":"[7597\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042000082#WRCC00700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"to consult with the fisheries board over plans to close Lough Sheelin near Finea, County Westmeath (details supplied) to course fishermen for a period leading up to trout season.","asker":"1250","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1406,"content":"<p>I have been advised that Inland Fisheries Ireland advertised a public consultation from 17 February to 16 March 2016 to seek\u00a0views on the\u00a0introduction of\u00a0a local bye-law on Lough Sheelin (Managed Wild Brown Trout Fishery) to close angling for any species by rod and line from 13 October each year to the end of February of the next following year.

On 29 September 2015, the Government agreed and published its 6 year Capital Plan, <i>Building on Recovery<\/i>, which included an allocation of &euro;275m for the National Broadband Plan.

In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of all premises in Ireland (both commercial and intervention area) will have access to high speed broadband within two years of the contract award, with 100% of premises connected within 5 years.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Department will have a robust governance procedure in place which ensures that the winning bidder(s) deliver their obligations under the contract to the required standards and within the required timeframes.\u00a0 In addition, the Department continues to monitor the rollout of network deployment plans in the commercial areas to ensure that services are delivered in line with commitments made by operators. <\/p><p>I am confident that through the combination of existing commercial investment and the State intervention, that all our citizens will have the same, if not better,\u00a0access to\u00a0high speed broadband services available internationally.<\/p><p>In the mobile telephony market, market operators are currently investing in the rollout of 4G networks. These are\u00a0providing a substantial level of improvement in performance and capabilities over previous 3G and 2G technologies.
