The National Competitiveness Council was established by the Government in 1997 and serves as an independent voice advising on Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position and the means by which it may be enhanced.  The council&rsquo;s role is, therefore, an advisory one.  We do not formulate policy but rather advise on areas of focus to improve competitiveness.  Our membership includes people with relevant expertise in competitiveness, business people and representatives from employer and trade union organisations.  The CEOs of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the chair of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission are also members.<br\/><br\/>Each year the council publishes three annual reports.  The Costs of Doing Business in Ireland report is a requirement under the Action Plan for Jobs and benchmarks key business costs and highlights areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors.  Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Scorecard provides a comprehensive statistical assessment of Ireland's competitiveness performance. <i><\/i>Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge uses this information along with the latest research to outline the main challenges to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and the policy areas to enhance our position.  The council&rsquo;s annual submission to the Action Plan for Jobs is also included as part of this year&rsquo;s<i><\/i>competitiveness challenge report.  We also publish a series of two to three page bulletins on various aspects of competitiveness.<br\/><br\/>Ireland&rsquo;s ability to compete and sell goods and services abroad is the key determinant of economic growth, our ability to provide sustainable jobs, the wage rates that people are paid and, importantly, our ability to provide quality public services.  Our recent competitiveness challenge report, a copy of which was provided to members, reports that the economy is in its strongest place since the onset of the recession. This is a significant achievement and the council wishes to acknowledge the role of Government and the Oireachtas.<br\/><br\/>Ireland&rsquo;s improving competitiveness performance has been central to the recovery in employment and economic growth.  Since 2011, Ireland&rsquo;s relative international competitiveness, as measured by a range of international indices, has improved.  Ireland moved from 16th to 7th in 2016 in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook, and from 24th to 23rd in the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report.  In addition, the World Bank&rsquo;s most recent Doing Business 2017 report shows Ireland is now ranked 18th out of 190 countries, but down one place since last year&rsquo;s report.<br\/><br\/>The concern of the council is that our significant improvement in competitiveness is largely the result of a cyclical cost competitiveness adjustment, that is, the economic crash putting downward pressure on prices, and external factors beyond our control such as the low value of the euro, low interest rates and low energy prices.  The recovery was also helped by the record levels of investment in infrastructure in the run-up to the crisis.  This allowed an expansion of output after the crisis without a consequent increase in prices or shortages.  However, we are now seeing significant price pressures and hidden inflation in the economy.<br\/><br\/>At the same time, the economy now faces a significant threat from other external factors beyond our control, including Brexit, a potential shift in economic policy in the US, and the uncertain nature of the political economy of the EU.  This makes it crucial that we address those factors within our control, these being maintaining cost competitiveness and investing in supporting infrastructure and talent.  The decisions made today will determine the competitiveness of the economy in the future.<br\/><br\/>Importantly, these factors also determine the quality of people&rsquo;s lives.  Overall living standards, wages, housing, transport options to and from work, leisure time and access to social protection, education and health care are all dependent on how competitive we are in international trade.  As such, a message of sustainable recovery is at the heart of the competitiveness challenge report we published in December.  We must rigorously pursue cost competitiveness, address barriers to investment and growth, drive productivity performance and be responsive to the competitiveness challenges and opportunities that are emerging.  The challenges posed by Brexit provide additional motivation to pursue cost competitiveness across a range of business inputs, including legal, property and insurance where costs continue to be a concern.  It brings into sharp focus Infrastructure bottlenecks and skills mismatches, which have also become more acute, while issues such as increasing industrial unrest are emerging as threats.<br\/><br\/>The report covers a lot of ground but I will refer to five key areas.<\/p><p>In regard to public finances, efforts to bring fiscal stability and improved performance have been exceptional.  It is important to ensure our fiscal position remains sustainable in the face of an uncertain international trading and investment environment.  The council is of the view that we should avoid any narrowing of the tax base which might leave us exposed in the future and we must ensure the tax system supports and rewards employment and work.  Second, housing affordability has a direct and significant effect on the competitiveness of the economy.  The solution is clearly on the supply side.  We welcome the Rebuilding Ireland plan but believe that it will take time to implement and to effect change.<\/p><p> Research suggests the single greatest factor that explains differences in prosperity between countries are the demographics and skills of the population.  With increasing corporation tax competition, skilled labour must now be the key emphasis for retaining and winning foreign direct investment and the growth of a cohort of internationally trading indigenous companies.  Failure to tackle the under-resourcing of higher education is placing Ireland at a considerable disadvantage internationally and will have a significant medium-term impact on competitiveness and productivity in the economy. We would urge follow-through on the recommendations of increased State funding alongside income contingent loans.<\/p><p> Delivering world class water and waste-water infrastructure is a long-term project, but it is a project that must commence today.  The Council supports a funding model that delivers an adequate and reliable funding stream for public water services, is consistent with the user pays principle, protects vulnerable citizens and rewards conservation.<\/p><p> Finally, our medium-term competitiveness is being affected by the restrictions on capital investment.  Our past investment in capital was a crucial ingredient to our rapid recovery, and we support any Government and Oireachtas efforts to have the restrictions on capital investment eased.  We encourage that the fiscal space remaining goes towards investing in the future productive capacity of the economy.<\/p><p> This is just a brief summary of the council&rsquo;s views.<\/p><p> In closing my statement, I would like to say that we appreciate policy-making and legislation are being carried out in very difficult and uncertain times.  Following years of fiscal retrenchment, and a general reduction in living standards, it is understandable that people wish to see a degree of payback from all of the sacrifices made.  We understand that this makes Government and Oireachtas decision making extremely challenging but crucial to Ireland&rsquo;s future prospects.  In the pursuit of equity within this generation we must also consider equity between the generations.  We need to ensure that, in efforts to satisfy short-term demands, we must also work to secure the prospects of future generations.<\/p><p> I would like to express the gratitude of the council for affording us the opportunity to meet the committee today and I am happy to answer, as best as I can, any questions members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Peter Clinch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Clinch.

Does Professor Clinch think that we are doing enough first as a country, by which I mean the Government, but second in terms of business and unions, in facing up to how big a challenge it is?  Are we sleepwalking as a nation into it, hoping that it will be all right on the night?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#C00300","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487088000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Brexit is obviously one of the major challenges that we are facing but it is not the only challenge.  It is important to say that there are developments at EU level and also in the US that are also critical, so perhaps those items may be considered together in how we respond to what are general broad international challenges.  In recent years we have been performing very well relative to the UK in our international partners.  One of the key issues are the short-term and long-term implications that it has across a range of areas, including trade and investment, the labour market, energy as well as a many of these sectoral competitiveness impacts.  Clearly where the biggest threats arise are in the agrifood, financial and tourism sectors, which are very employment intensive sectors.  That is a big concern as well as political concerns around the border.  Bord Bia's report that &euro;570 million was lost in the value of food exports last year is an immediate example of what uncertainty around Brexit does but also reflects the change in the exchange rates.<\/p> <p>  Probably what is best to look at is how do we compare with the UK in terms of competitiveness.  The Competitiveness Council is undertaking an exercise to do that and I will give the committee some broad indicators.  In comparison with the UK, we have a similar performance in the rankings with respect to the quality of our institutions, of government, the quality of higher education and training, the efficiency of product markets, but relative to Ireland the UK has a very large market size and much higher rankings in terms of its macroeconomic environment.  Our infrastructure ranks poorly.  The UK is stronger in financial market developments, in labour market efficiency, technological development, innovation and business sophistication.  <\/p> <p>  One of the key things that we need to look at is labour market functioning.  As an example of the sorts of threats that we could have from Brexit, the UK scores much more highly on labour market efficiency.  What we would be concerned about is where the British Government moves in its policies that would increase the UK's competitiveness relative to Ireland.  Having said that, there are also potential advantages from Brexit, particularly in terms of financial services and increased foreign direct investment. The other area of particular concern is taxation.  The Competitiveness Council is essentially doing an exercise examining these comparators with the UK.  To answer Deputy Calleary's question about how Ireland is responding to Brexit as a nation, it is quite obvious that a lot is going on in individual Departments.  Where we need to place greater emphasis is if it was a company facing into this particular difficulty, we would be examining, for example, where to place our expenditure in response to what is a structural shift in the market.  The medium review of our capital development plan is an opportunity to see whether we are placing our investments where they ought to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Peter Clinch"},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Reference was made to the capital development plan and also the national planning framework, and its review.  The council's report had a lot to say about capital investment and Professor Clinch also remarked that on the value of pre-crash capital investment towards assisting the recovery, our ability to repeat that particular investment is restrained because of fiscal rules.  It is very restrained in a way that it was not previously.  Apart from increasing taxation, what other ways would Professor Clinch see to address that?  The council has also highlighted that we need to do more about climate change, reducing and meeting our carbon reduction targets.  To link that in with the national planning framework, one of the points the council has highlighted is switching people to public transport in terms of higher density population locations, but that is not the way we do things.  I suppose we must come back to Professor Clinch's last remarks about the practical reality of governance.  We have a very disbursed regional structure.  The national planning framework is a chance to take the burden out of Dublin, where the economic growth of 40% of our economy, high rent, high infrastructure costs and start developing opportunities around it.  Should we link the capital plan review, the national planning framework and carbon reduction efforts together as well as making them all Brexit-proof?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#C00500","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487088000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>On infrastructure, it is important to say that the key determinant of our economic growth rate in the future is our productivity growth rate and the key lever that Government has is the public capital programme to boost that.  Investment is required in both hard infrastructure, but also soft infrastructure such as business supports, education and investing in our people.  At the moment, it is rather startling that our gross fixed capital formation is about 2% of GDP equivalent; it is 2.7% in the United Kingdom, as a comparison, and our capital investment is half of what Finland is investing.  Clearly, what we are investing is deficient relative to what our competitors are investing.  Everything else being equal, one would expect that to have a negative impact on our competitiveness in the future.  This is one of the challenges because for many of the indicators or determinants of competitiveness in five or ten years time it is about what we do today.  We saw that in the recovery where our capital investment was an aid to our recovery.  It is absolutely crucial, then, that we find ways to enhance our capital programme.<\/p><p>With regard to the fiscal rules, the key thing we will have to do, and which we urge Government to do, is articulate the case for a relaxation of the fiscal rules around capital spending at a European level.  There is a very big difference between current spending and capital spending.  Capital spending is an investment for a return.  With that in mind, what we have asked for in the review of the capital programme is that the case is made clear on having a methodology underpinning that capital programme, that is a strong cost benefit methodology to show where the investments can create the greatest return.  One of the issues around the capital review relates to the sorts of <i>ex ante<\/i>cost benefits; those things tend to happen on the individual projects that take place rather than on the overall programme.  In the review, there is an opportunity to revisit that and to revisit it in the light of the Deputy's first question on Brexit about whether there are areas where we need to create greater investment in order to head off some of the international challenges we are facing.  It is worth saying that in our competitiveness rankings, we rank very poorly on capital spend in the perception of those who answer the surveys, including a lot of business people.  In the WEF ranking, we rank fiftieth in terms of the perception of the quality of our capital, which is extremely poor.  We have a perception problem as well as a reality problem.  <br\/><br\/>To move on to the Deputy's second question, linking this to the national planning framework is essential.  There is no point in having a national planning framework if the capital spend does not match up to that.  That joined-up policy framework is crucial.  When the national planning framework is produced, we would expect to see that it maps to the capital programme and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  <br\/><br\/>I can make a number of points on the national planning framework.  It is a critical piece of economic policy infrastructure and should be seen as such.  I hope that when it appears, it is clearly grounded in economic realities and that there is an economic strategy document that would demonstrate through that its impact on the social fabric of the country as well.  It will be important that, unlike the national spatial strategy, it is grounded in that reality and is something that can actually be delivered.  It is not easy to change the spatial pattern of economic activity.  The Deputy referred to Dublin versus the rest of the country.  It would be unfortunate to go down that route and to see it as some sort of competition.  We are in a global competition-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Peter Clinch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I want to be clear that I do not see it as a competition.

The challenge there in terms of the population distribution is not something the council has a solution to.  With regard to climate change, clearly transport is one of the key areas that is very hard to change given the pattern of our population.<\/p> <p>  Returning to Dublin, we must be careful to ensure that Dublin remains competitive because we are in this international competition.  Dublin has infrastructural problems so we need to be careful about how we do our expenditure and that we do not neglect it.

It is the way I operate because I find it easier.  I will first deal with some of the five key areas Professor Clinch has highlighted.  He states in the first one that we need to ensure our fiscal position remains sustainable, which we would obviously all agree with.  He then goes on to say we should avoid any narrowing of the tax base.  The first thing we have to look at and acknowledge is that there is a carry-over from this year in terms of full-year effects of budget 2017.  I understand it is about &euro;500 million, which will narrow what is known as the fiscal space.  To increase the fiscal space, our only options are to increase revenue or cut spending.  When Professor Clinch says we should avoid any narrowing of the tax base, can he be more specific about what taxes he is referring to, given that in the last budget there was a cut to the universal social charge and a commitment to cut it even further over the next number of years?  On the shrinking fiscal space and the demands Professor Clinch has identified in housing and capital investment and so on, how will we meet those demands?  That is my first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#D00700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487088000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>On the issue of the narrowing of the tax base, we need to go back to why we needed to broaden it during the crisis.  The narrowing of the tax base was identified at the time as being one of the contributory factors towards a lack of sustainability of the public finances and the reason why universal social charge was introduced.  Our concern about the commitment to remove the universal social charge is having a sustainable tax base into the future.  The difficulty with removing the universal social charge is establishing where the funding will come from.  It is a challenge we are putting out.  We are saying if the Government is going to narrow the tax base, there are some risks, and we are asking where the alternative funding will come from.  It is the question we are asking rather than answering as a competitiveness council.  Having a competitive tax system is a crucial aspect of the competitiveness offering of Ireland.  At the moment, to give the committee a quick view on our tax base, we are still very competitive on corporate tax but we have increased competition in the corporate tax area, as we know without going into details, including the UK reducing its rate to 15%.  On our VAT regime, we are relatively competitive but there is a threat from the UK which is also part of our Brexit response, which Deputy Calleary has asked about.  We have very high rates of capital gains tax relative to others.  In Ireland in 2014, we had the third highest capital gains tax rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Peter Clinch"},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I will just come back to the question I asked because we have a responsibility to scrutinise budgetary policy.

Given that there are very low levels of capital investment in comparison with other European countries which is a problem in health and housing, but I would also imagine in roads, flood relief and those types of areas, if we do not get the flexibility that we need - and we can articulate those arguments but obviously we are at the mercy of those in Europe - should we make greater use of the flexibilities which we currently have?  Finally, there was no mention of public sector pay.  We do not have any provisions for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021.  How much of a challenge is that going to be in terms of the overall fiscal space and the need to deal with and manage expectations in unravelling and unwinding financial emergency measures in the public interest cuts?  I think the cost of that would be about &euro;1.4 billion. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#E00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487088000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>On the funding of capital expenditure and expenditure rules, the council's position has been that we are aware this is a very complex area.

I notice the council refers to GNI or national income specifically in a number of comparators that it has used.

When I became chair two years ago, I was keen that we placed a much stronger emphasis on productivity.  It was interesting that when we went looking for the data, it was actually quite hard to find the data at a sectoral level, for example, on productivity.  We have just recently produced a report working with the CSO and others and finally we are shedding some light on productivity across different sectors.  That is an advance.  In terms of productivity the story looks superficially great.  Many developed economies are in negative multi-factor productivity growth.  It is the big concern for policy makers internationally and some believe that large leading companies are getting well ahead of the follower companies.  It is something that we should be concerned about here because we see a big difference in productivity between the multinational sector and the rest of the economy.  Our robust productivity rates rely on quite narrow sectors and a narrow range of companies.  What is important is to grow productivity in those areas which have high employment intensity.  We see lower levels of productivity in areas such as retail, hospitality and construction, and those are the areas on which we need to focus.  We also tend to see that internationally traded companies are more productive and there is a learning effect of operating overseas.  We have also seen that our productivity growth rates have been boosted by the loss of jobs in areas that are lower productivity such as construction, which is an obvious one, and retail during the crisis.  We have to be careful when we look at the very nice figures that bring us to the top of the table of what is going on beneath that and also of the social consequences which are ignored.  <\/p> <p>  In productivity, the story is good, on the face of it, but we have to find ways of boosting productivity right across all business and the public service as well.  Public service productivity is also crucial to competitiveness.  That comes from things like the discussion we had over investment in infrastructure, investment in talent and skills, supporting and rewarding entrepreneurs, by which we mean the large numbers of people who employ two or three people in all sorts of jobs, not just high-tech or those types of areas.  We have also identified the need to improve what is called diffusion, which is getting all the know-how from leading companies over to companies right across the economy.  It is really important that the message of higher productivity rates hits those in all jobs, this is not just something for people in white coats and so on.  That allows us to answer this question which is that an economy does not have to be low wage to be competitive, it is about productivity growth rates.<\/p><p>If an economy can boost its productivity growth rate by even a small amount, it can skip a generation, in respect of the prosperity of its population.  The importance of productivity was demonstrated in the latter years of the Celtic tiger when we saw growth rates in the economy getting ahead of productivity growth rates.  This would suggest there is something wrong and there was something wrong.  Essentially we turned the clock back to 2001 or 2002, which was where our model stopped being sustainable.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Peter Clinch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Following up on my colleague's questions earlier, would Professor Clinch say that in housing and in health care services, we have rationed them relentlessly?

The knock-on effect of that is exceptional.  For firms, property is very high among those areas that are most important for the costs and competitiveness of the business.  Expensive commercial property affects the competitiveness of firms and that has a knock-on effect on what firms can pay their workers.

It is always important when thinking about innovation that one does not just think of a high-tech start-up, incubators or investment in research.  That is very important but it is also in people.  What we have argued for in this battle for talent is a sustainable funding model for the higher education sector.  In spite of their inadequacies, the rankings demonstrate what is going on.  To a large extent the fall in rankings is because of the fall in the ratio of staff to students in the institutions.  We have looked for a model that encourages participation in order that people are able to access education without, perhaps, the financial assistance of their family.  We do not favour the option of all the burden falling on the student.  As we also recognise the multiple demands on State funding, we did not think that the required funding would be available as a State subvention.  As there is evidence to suggest that those who have received higher education receive benefits beyond what the State accrues, we favour a balance of State funding and income-contingent loans that are available to people from all backgrounds.  We do not get into any more detail other than that because there has been an expert group that has examined this and has made recommendations and we would rely upon its expertise.

The committee has had discussions with a number of witnesses on third level funding and education in general.  There has been some agreement, albeit not unanimous agreement, among members about both attendance rates and the fact that so many Irish students go on to third level and the appropriateness of some of the courses they pursue at third level for their future economic prospects and careers.  There has been great emphasis among parents, correctly and understandably, on their children receiving an education or an opportunity they may not have received themselves.  However, that might not necessarily correspond with the best practice in other European countries that have high-wage economies, are successful from a competitiveness point of view but do not have as high a proportion of their school leavers going on to third level.  Perhaps such countries have more young people doing apprenticeships.  There is an attempt now to reinvigorate and launch apprenticeships in Ireland but they had largely disappeared as an option for many students for a long time in this economy.

This year, reflecting on two of the challenges in the competitiveness scorecard we produced, we focused on the higher education system.  I suppose we would suggest our recommendations this year should not be read in isolation of the ones last year that dealt more with the issue of apprenticeships.  In January 2017 we had the launch of the Government's plan to expand apprenticeships and traineeship in Ireland and consequently we have an aim to achieve 50,000 apprenticeships by 2020.  There is a key commitment in the Action Plan for Education to implement that, which we would encourage.  We agree with the Chair on the importance of providing suitable education for all people and all types of career opportunities and not to have a focus on one part of the education system over another.  When it comes to funding, it always is a challenge that this sometimes is perceived to be the case, that is, that primary education is the most important or that secondary or higher education are so perceived.  It really is a system and if competitiveness is to be delivered at the end of that system, it is crucial that all parts are properly funded and properly resourced.  That whole education and training sector is our key lever now that there is increased tax competition.  The things that will make sure that Ireland remains competitive are getting costs down and making sure we make the investments in infrastructure and in people.

There is no sense or meaning to it.<\/p><p>I do not see anybody speaking out about this on a constant basis.  If one can borrow money at 1% or 2% and in doing so one can make 10% or 12% it does not make sense.

That leads on to what we should be doing and Professor Clinch has touched on that.  We have an opportunity here, especially with Brexit coming down the line.  It is like a disease that is going to come upon us.  It is a fact that we are going to be interfered with in terms of what we can or cannot do.  I touched on this earlier.  We need to connect with other parts of the country.  I can drive to Galway in two hours now and I can be in Cork in just over two hours or two and a half hours.  I remember working in Cork back in the 1960s when it took four and a half hours.  This whole thing seems to be madness.<\/p><p> In the area I represent house prices are going up at the rate of 20% to 30%.  The whole thing is so imbalanced.  There needs to be proper capital investment to enable people travel in a reasonable amount of time to different parts of the country where they could live in peace and comfort.

I am asking Professor Clinch's view on this to see if I am talking nonsense.  <\/p><p> I also hear cries for retaining the USC but the USC was brought in as an emergency measure and there was no basis to it in the tax system.  It is now a sort of a mortal sin to talk about reducing it or eliminating it, there is no sense nor meaning to it.  A taxation system should be based on a proper footing and it should not become a means of people satisfying their conscience by trying to avoid taxes by as much as they can.<\/p><p> This leads me on to another fact of life.  People, and the best of luck to them, are now setting up their own businesses, especially in the trades area. If one gets a plumber into the house, or a carpenter or an electrician or a general handyman, most of the reward given to the person doing the work is by cash.  I doubt very much whether we are getting proper returns compared with the PAYE payer.  There is a huge gap between the disposable income of people who are earning what are regarded as high salaries and those who are earning money doing work in a situation where it is very easy to avoid our taxation system.

It strikes me that the opportunity is there in the review of the capital programme to grasp that nettle, but it is a complex area.  There is a logic around the fiscal rules on current spending and there is a logic around the fiscal rules for capital spending, but the logic around capital spending is that there will be a return on it, that it will not be wasted expenditure that has to be continually repeated.  The evidence is there about what capital spending can do, the evidence is there that we do not measure up in terms of capital spending to those economies that we are trying to compete with.  The evidence is also there that capital spending will hamper our productivity rate which in turn will hamper our economic growth rate which in turn will hamper our ability to pay for current spending for valued public services.

That is the only way that the net can be broadened while at the same time avoiding allowing certain individuals to effectively continue making false returns.

We also have to note how heavily we rely upon oil and that 76% of those oil imports come from the UK.  That shows one possible implication of Brexit.  In electricity generation, 46% comes from gas and 96% of our gas is imported from the UK.  These are rather dramatic figures when we think what implications Brexit might have for the single energy market.  Fortunately, it appears that energy generally has been exempt from border taxes and tariffs in terms of trading, but it would be important that the Government has that close to the top of its list in terms of its advocacy around Brexit negotiations.  It is important to ensure the UK and the European Commission also have it close to the top of their lists to ensure we retain the Single Market and it does not somehow get caught up in heated negotiations as something that is worthy of negotiation.  The optimal functioning of the integrated all-island energy market is crucial, but if there were to be a threat to that, we would have to examine interconnectors into continental Europe, which is a very expensive challenge but is something that is an obvious implication if there were to be a problem.<\/p> <p>  In terms of matching the electricity supply and demand by locations, there is a link to infrastructure which is ensuring that, in our National Planning Framework, for example, we take advantage of where there are areas with an excess supply of electricity compared with other areas.  In terms of improving supports for electricity generation, the potential for generating electricity at a micro level or in a person's own home, feeding that back into the grid and the relationship with electric cars, there is a challenge there in that we have not been meeting our targets for electric cars.<\/p> <p>  What is important from a competitiveness point of view is that we deliver that infrastructure at the least cost.  The council is very pleased to see that competitiveness is highlighted alongside security of supply and other issues in the energy White Paper.

Given where I live, I often take the ferry between Rosslare and France.  Do we need to state our case more strongly to our colleagues in the European Union that, in light of our peripheral nature once Brexit happens, there ought to be very specific exemptions for Ireland on things like the fiscal rules because we are going to be at such a disadvantage because of our location?<\/p><p>Does Professor Clinch have any views on those kinds of issues and their impacts on the economy?

Clearly we have to look at alternatives and this might go back to Deputy Calleary's first point about whether we are putting in place the appropriate Brexit plans.  I do not get to see what are the machinations of the Government and its Departments until they are produced but it is something to which the council has drawn attention in its reports.  Again, I agree it makes absolute sense to examine these things and to think through the implications of what we would have to do in a worst-case scenario.

Perhaps this is an area where it can practically come into play.  I have two brief questions.  I read an IMF report recently in which it became clear that of the countries that had been studied, up to 90% of their capital funding was secured from private sources.  In Ireland we do not come near even 10% but we have this traditional perception that capital funding must always come directly from the State to provide a road or whatever.  Are there ways and means in which we can try to lever more money out of the private sector into capital investment projects?  We have done it in bundles of schools and things like that, which has been successful to a degree and things have changed from a position a few years ago where there was virtually none from the private sector.  Can we do more and is there an interim measure that could help to bridge the gap before the change in the fiscal rules?  The change in the fiscal rules will require a treaty change and we are familiar that such things do not happen that easily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#J00300","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Were it not for Tom Roche, we would not have had a bridge across the Liffey.

It has been a fantastic environment in which to leverage private funding and it is very obvious anecdotally that there has been a lot of funding trying to find opportunities to be deployed within Ireland.  The issue returns to the question of the fiscal rules and public capital, that generally these things have to be matched.  If we do not have matching funding, we will not be able to leverage as much of the private funding.  That has to be part of the picture of the case that is made on why we should be seeking a relaxation of those rules.  Once again, we need to be careful.  We need to demonstrate the return and we need to demonstrate that we can provide that return and we also need to demonstrate that we are spending it on the right things.

Competitive public services are essential for competitiveness.  As a competitiveness council we must advocate those ways of providing infrastructure that are the most cost competitive.  To do that we need to encourage conservation.  The challenge is how does one encourage conservation if one is not following a user-pays principle.  The water commission has reported and it is still suggested, as far as we can see, that encouraging conservation somehow is important and we look forward to certainty on the funding model that aids competitiveness and we look forward to hearing Oireachtas considerations of what the appropriate model will be that will encourage the efficient use of water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#J01200","nonspeaker":"Professor Peter Clinch"},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>That is a very politically correct answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#J01300","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487088000,"counter":69,"content":"<p>It is not an easy one and I am putting that to members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#J01400","nonspeaker":"Professor Peter Clinch"},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>No, that is fair enough.

My division, strategic energy policy, is a co-ordinating division across all of the areas so it is probably useful if I start with that.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the major points in our opening statement that are of relevance.  On 30 November last, the European Commission published the Clean Energy for all Europeans package.  It contained eight legislative proposals.  We are discussing seven of those today.  One of them is within the remit of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  The eight proposals are grouped into four main categories.<\/p><p> The first category is energy efficiency, which is the Energy Efficiency Directive and the Energy Performance and Building Directive that is with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  The second grouping is energy market reform.  This is the electricity internal market design regulation, the Electricity Internal Market Design Directive, the Agency for the Co-operation of Energy Regulators, ACER, regulation, and the risk preparedness in the electricity sector regulation.  The third category is just one item, the Renewable Energy Directive.  The fourth and final group is the governance of the energy union regulation.<\/p><p> I will address in brief the situation around the Maltese Presidency.  At the moment they are looking to progress all of the files but with specific priority on the two energy efficiency files.  They have set out - in Council terms - what is likely to happen.  The Maltese expect to reach a general agreement on both of the energy efficiency files by the end of the Maltese Presidency in mid-2017.  They expect to have completed a progress report on the other six files.  All eight proposals will be discussed at the Energy Council on 27 February.  Countries will be invited to give their initial views.  The two energy efficiency files will be discussed at the Energy Council informal meeting in May with a view to reaching a general agreement in the June Energy Council meeting. <\/p><p> I will now go into more detail on each of the four categories.  Turning first to the Energy Efficiency Directive and the Energy Performance and Buildings Directive, the key provisions of note in the Energy Efficiency Directive is to include a 30% binding EU target for energy efficiency.  This is an increase on the at least 27% target in the EU Council decision of October 2014.  There is also provision to extend the energy efficiency obligation scheme beyond 20202 all the way to 2030.<\/p><p> The other proposal in the energy efficiency area is the Energy Performance and Buildings Directive, which again is held by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  It is worth noting that buildings consume 40% of the energy produced in the EU and the proposed directive will encourage the use of ICT, smart technologies such as building automation and charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.  Ireland is generally supportive of these proposals.<\/p><p> The second package is the energy market reform.  This package consists of four legislative proposals, the first three of which are recasts, that is a set of amendments to existing regulations and this is how they have been set out, mainly to two regulations and one directive that were in the third energy package as adopted in 2009.  The third proposal is the ACER regulation - the third of the amendments to the third package - specifically to the legislation on the agency for the co-operation of energy regulators.  This regulation makes recommendations on ACER having increased responsibilities in specific aspects of increased regional co-operation among energy regulators and on providing enhanced powers to the agency.  The security of electricity supply regulation is very much a peer to the security of gas supply regulation on the electricity side and Ireland would have a relatively positive view on that.<\/p><p> The third package is the Renewable Energy Directive.  The provisions of the proposed Renewable Energy Directive build on the existing directive and provide a framework for renewable energy development to 2030.  It takes account of the political agreement reached by the European Council in October 2014 to increase EU energy share from renewable energy to a level of at least 27% by 2030 .  This target will be delivered through individual member states&rsquo; contributions.  The EU-level target in the proposed directive represents a fundamental shift away from legally binding national targets.  The 2020 national renewable energy target of 16% for Ireland will become the baseline target set out to 2030.  In addition, supplementary measures for electricity, heating and cooling, and transport will be required so that the EU target will be collectively reached.  The level of economic growth between 2021 and 2030, combined with delivery of energy efficiency savings, will determine the level of renewable energy measures required in order for Ireland to make a cost-effective contribution towards delivery of the EU target in the period to 2030.<\/p><p> The final group of proposals is around the governance of the energy union.  I stress that this really does cut across all the other proposals.  I shall explain briefly the history of this and the Council's conclusions of October 2014.  It was agreed that a reliable and transparent governance system, without any unnecessary administrative burden, would be developed to help ensure the EU meets its energy policy goals.  These goals include the 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions; at least a 27% share for renewable energy; and at least a 27% improvement in energy efficiency, currently proposed to increase to 30%.  The energy union strategy of 25 February 2015 broadened the scope of governance beyond the 2030 framework to all five dimensions of the energy union, namely, energy security, solidarity and trust; a fully integrated European energy market; energy efficiency contributing to moderation of demand; decarbonising the economy; and research, innovation and competitiveness.  The State of the Energy Union, from November 2015, proposed that the governance should be anchored in legislation.  On 30 November 2016 the legislative proposals were introduced.<\/p><p> The key elements of the proposed governance includes the need for each member state to develop a draft national energy and climate plan, the draft of which would need to be prepared, as proposed by 1 January 2018 and a final plan by 1 January 2019.  The plan would consolidate existing national planning and reporting obligations across all, or as much as possible, of the climate and energy area.  It will replace, or delete, more than 50 different existing sectorial plans and reports with one comprehensive integrated plan and report.  For example, the national energy efficiency action plan, the national renewable energy action plan and the monitoring mechanism regulation for greenhouse gasses, would all be integrated in this single ten year plan.  The national energy and climate plan will include trajectories for national emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency and the measures required to achieve these trajectories.  These trajectories must be sufficient for countries to meet member state targets and, collectively, for the EU to meet its targets.  We will need to set out objectives related to decarbonisation with a 50 year perspective, as proposed.  Member states will also be required to co-operate on a regional basis in preparing their national energy and climate plans.  The European Commission will have the right to make recommendations on the draft plans, of which member states must take utmost account.  Once these plans are in place there will be biennial reporting on progress in regard to the plans, with the first report due in 2021.<\/p><p> Another key element of the proposed governance is that the European Commission may take action in 2023 if it assess that the EU is at risk of not meeting its targets.  This could require member states to take action such as adjusting their share of renewable energy, in heating and cooling and in transport, or to make a financial contribution to an EU level fund.  It may also lead to EU-level actions such as increasing or enhancing energy efficiency standards.  With regard to the fund, it is worth noting that if a member state does not maintain its baseline share of renewable energy, which was 16% in Ireland's case, it is proposed that the gap would be covered by the country making the contribution to an EU-level fund which would then be used for energy efficiency or renewable energy measures throughout the EU.<\/p><p> It is fair to say that the proposal is viewed as positive but quite ambitious, as has been expressed by many countries and not just Ireland, about the level of ambition of completing this draft plan by 2018, but it is proposed that these plans need to be developed in parallel with the legislative proposal that is underwriting them and the other legislative proposals that are inputting into them.  In view of the timeframes involved for the period 2021 to 2030, we cannot negotiate all the proposals and then start writing the plan.<\/p><p> I will conclude on the first part of our discussion which looked at consultation.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment will commence a public consultation later this month on the whole clean energy package.  This will further inform views and give people, society and business, etc., the ability to directly input into what Ireland's negotiating stance should be on these proposals.<\/p><p>I could move on and outline Brexit as well, if that helps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017021400002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487091600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>That would be great, thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017021400002#J00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487091600,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I appreciate that a number of the members of the committee attended the Brexit civic dialogue last Monday.  We know that Brexit is one of the most significant socio-economic challenges we face.  Energy is a core sector.  We have key links with the UK in energy, and the figure that should interest us most is our energy import dependency.  In 2015 Ireland imported 88% of the energy we use.  The UK is the source of much of this energy.  Natural gas is probably the best example.  We use natural gas to generate over 40% of our electricity.  It heats our homes and businesses and generates power for industry.  In 2015, 97% of the natural gas used in Ireland was imported from the UK.  That has dropped with the opening of the Corrib gas field.  Corrib will supply over 50% of our gas needs this year and in coming years, but it will not have a long lifespan.  By 2025 it is estimated that Ireland will be 85% dependent again on UK pipeline gas.  When we highlight the energy dependency Ireland has on the UK it is important to note that we are not the only country that has energy links with the UK.  France, Belgium and the Netherlands all have either natural gas or electricity interconnectors with the UK, therefore Ireland will be working as one of a number of European countries to ensure that the secure trade in energy continues between the UK and EU member states.<\/p> <p>  The Government has set out a number of priorities in the area of Brexit.  The priorities are maintaining trade in secure supplies of energy between the UK and EU member states, maintaining the single electricity market across the island of Ireland, accommodating Ireland's ability to met EU obligations and ensuring appropriate energy infrastructure.  On Monday, 6 February we had an all-island Brexit civic dialogue on energy in Boyle, County Roscommon, which was attended by members of the Committee, and at that meeting we presented an outline of what I have described and the key priorities.  We also had a wide range of groups from industry and society represented in a number of break out sessions which discussed the impacts of Brexit.  We will be compiling and publishing a report on that civic dialogue and we will also be inputting.  The chair of the civic dialogue was Jim Gannon, the CEO of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and he will be bringing the views of the energy dialogue to the all-island civic dialogue in Dublin Castle, which is on Friday 17 February.  <\/p> <p>  It is worth re-emphasising that there is an extensive programme of engagement with all other EU Governments and EU institutions, including the EU commission's Brexit task force, who we have met on the specific issue of energy.  This activity and engagement is being carried out at a political, diplomatic and official level.  <\/p> <p>  It is important to note that the two parts of what we have discussed here, which is the clean energy package and Brexit, will both be negotiated in parallel but not necessarily at the same time.  The negotiations for Brexit and the negotiations for the clean energy package will be happening in parallel, which we need to take account of in those negotiations.  <\/p> <p>  We have the heads of each of the sections across energy and climate, so we can direct the questions that arise to the appropriate person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017021400002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1487091600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>My first question is about energy from renewable sources.

Although we are now in a situation where the renewable target is an EU-wide target of 27%, at the moment there are no nationally binding targets emerging.  From our perspective we have sub-targets across renewables in heat, transport and electricity, and it will be up to Ireland, and the Minister indeed, to decide the share within those sub-sectors as we go forward.  We will be entering the negotiations on the basis of Ireland's contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017021400002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Confrey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487091600,"counter":87,"content":"<p>ACER was set up in 2009 as part of the third energy package, and this package is amending that legislation.

The session in Boyle was useful from the point of view of trying to get a handle on Brexit from an energy point of view, and the potential difficulties and opportunities that is going to present.  Three things are happening together - the European clean energy package, which has just been outlined, the withdrawal of Britain from the European Union and our international and moral obligations in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  The session in Boyle crystalised it for me.  We have to make these three things move in the same direction.  We have to increase our energy independence and increase our energy security.  It has just been outlined that we are 97% or 98% dependent for our gas supplies on imported gas.  We do not control the valve.  It will come through the British pipeline.  We do not control that pipeline.  There is the issue of other energy sources as well.  Alongside that, while we are making good progress with electricity generation from renewable sources, in terms of meeting our commitments of reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions we are falling behind quickly.  In terms of overall energy importation, we have to reverse the fact that we are 88% dependent for our energy on imported fossil fuels because they are not renewable.<\/p><p>Obviously they have a time limit, but there is a cost as well.  The issue of Brexit has thrown up all that uncertainty.<\/p><p> In view of the above it would appear we have to turn the challenge quickly into an opportunity.  We can moan about all the difficulties that Brexit will cause but there are a couple of immediate issues.  The single energy market on the island is in existence since 2007.  We want to see that continue and we want to see further areas of co-operation.  In view of the clean air project that is under way on foot of this and that, I note, down as a high priority, if there is energy being imported or coming from an interconnector, be it from the North or from England, it may not come from renewable sources.  They are ahead of us in some ways - Scotland is way ahead of us - but they may not be as ethical.  Given some of the right-wingers who are running the show or calling the shots in England at present, how they produce it may not be as ethnical.  One might have Trumpism arising, in terms of digging up coal anywhere one can get it and burning it.  In that regard, where do we fit in and what are its implications?<\/p><p> The other question I have relates to the potential disruption of supplies if we do not control the pipeline.  If it is passing through EU territory, that is fine.  However, I foresee - I hope I am wrong - rocky negotiations with Britain and the other 27 member states.  The other 27 member states cannot be seen to give England an easy ride on these matters.  That opens up the potential for our security of supply being impaired.  It also opens up the possibility of tariffs and the possibility of price increases.  Have Department officials any update on that?  Are there any projections as to what might happen in that regard?  I do not expect them to have all the detail.<\/p><p> All of those issues tell me that we have to proceed in producing renewable energies quickly and sustainably to ensure that we have a level of energy security given the uncertainties arising from Brexit and all of the other matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017021400002#J00700","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487091600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The clean energy package, in particular, the governance framework and the national energy and climate plan, is designed to encompass our international obligations, such as the Paris agreement and the emissions reduction.  It is all about moving to the period 2021 to 2030.  That governance framework covers that and I suppose there is a consistence there.  Brexit throws an issue in there that is a significant challenge.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanley also commented on the independence and security of supply.  This was a real key theme that came out of the day in Boyle, County Roscommon.  A number of the different break-out groups all made a similar point, which was we need to use renewable energy and increase our sustainability in Ireland.  For many who attended, the figures for import dependency, that in 2015 Ireland imported 88% of the energy we use and imported 97% of the natural gas used from the UK, were somewhat of a surprise.  Many knew we imported a lot of energy but this showed the stark reality and that 50% of energy is derived through oil.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Deputy's two specific questions, the single electricity market and the need to continue further co-operation is one of our key priorities as set out.  The way we are looking at doing that is as follows.  Prior to any Article 50 declaration or prior to negotiations starting, what we are doing is taking the opportunity to educate as many of our peers in Europe to discuss with our peers in the UK and Northern Ireland so that they can understand our commitment to the single electricity market and our commitment to an ongoing relationship with the UK but in a European context.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the point on renewable sources, when energy is imported or exported across any interconnector, for instance, between Ireland and Northern Ireland, between Ireland and the UK with the East-West interconnector or, indeed, between the UK and France, the energy is not classified as green, brown or nuclear.  There is no origin with that energy.  It is merely pure electricity.  We all adhere to the same standards because we all are member states of the European Union.  That applies to environmental air quality, etc.  In terms of energy from a coal-fired powerstation versus energy from a wind turbine, it is very much measured in country of production.  Imports or exports crossing an interconnector are not measured as such currently.  In fairness, there are no proposals in the clean energy package to change that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of disruption of supplies, Ireland is dependent on imports of gas.  In terms of the negotiations, there is the security gas directive on which I might pass over to my colleague to give more details, but being in a European legislative framework ensures where there is a shortage of gas in Ireland that the UK is legally bound to help us.  Of course, before that was in place we had intergovernmental agreements on the interconnectors and the gas interconnectors.  The key point for us is as part of the Brexit negotiations the first priority we set out is to ensure continued secure trade in energy requires no tariffs and a legal mechanism to ensure that security of supply.  I am not sure whether Mr. Goodwin may want to add anything on energy security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017021400002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Brady"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487091600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Not really, no.

Vice President &Scaron;efovi was in Dublin two years ago setting out the approach the Commission would take.  In the 2020 package, all the political agreements were done in advance before the poor Ministers of Finance knew what was going on.  They learned of it in a state of shock.  We had these targets and so on.  This time, because there is less political support for action on climate and renewables, they are putting the pieces of the jigsaw together slowly and getting agreement.  That is what we are seeing in this wide range of packages.  I cannot remember who said that in Europe, to a certain extent, what we have done is stitched renewables into the system.  In the first quarter, we have made the transition we need to make by stitching them into the existing system.  Now we are planning the next quarter of the renewables being put in and we have to change the entire system because they are affecting the whole system.  It is a completely different energy system.  This is not small legislation.  It is very important and significant and concerns how we change our entire energy system.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Confrey said that 16% would be our baseline but 16% is our current target.   Are we saying that any ambition we have to plan for in the January 2018 big new national energy plan has to assume we are starting from 16% and we will go from there?  We are currently at 9.1%.  What will the cost be for not being at 16% in 2020 or whatever time the fines kick in?  Surely that must lead to a huge increase in ambition for the scale we have.  This is not like the climate package where we have a very soft deal in terms of baselines being set.  I am sure Mr. O'Neill will have all the details.  We have a soft option in terms of where we start.  Mr. Confrey is saying we are starting with a harder option in renewables because in some ways we have to start from 16% even though we will be nowhere near 16%.  If I am right about that, I would be interested to hear Mr. Confrey's thoughts.<\/p> <p>  The second question is on the 50-year plan.  We have to write the plan within the context of a 50-year vision.  If the Paris Accord is to mean anything and if European energy policy stacks up, it will effectively mean we have to go to a zero carbon energy system in that sort of timeframe.  Does that mean the Department will have to change its entire energy White Paper, which gives us an out until 2100 before we go to that sort of an energy system?  How will we ramp up and change our energy White Paper to reflect that greater ambition we are going to commit to?<\/p> <p>  In terms of our interconnection, Mr. Brady said we will have to try to secure future gas and electricity interconnection with the UK and that we will have to look for legal mechanisms for that.  Is there an alternative to the European Court of Justice, ECJ, as the final arbiter on the legal structures?  Have the witnesses met their UK civil service contacts in their counterpart Department?  It is no longer called DECC but it is Mr. Chisholm's Department.  Has it been an issue for discussion?  Where are the discussions on the issue of legal mechanisms?<\/p> <p>  I am sorry for these rapid fire questions but I could ask questions all night on this because it is very interesting.  How much money have we availed of so far?  What projects have we planned to avail of from the Juncker investment fund in the clean energy area, whether efficiency, interconnection or generation?  I understand they recently increased the fund by &euro;200 billion and directed that 40% of it should be in the clean energy area.  I am interested to know what we have so far availed of in the Juncker investment fund.  What big projects are ready to go that we think may avail of the Juncker investment fund?<\/p> <p>  What was our lending in the past two or three years?  What do we plan for this year and next year in the clean energy space in terms of European Investment Bank, EIB, lending?  What sort of access to funding have we got from that?

We were at 9.1% overall at the end of 2015, so we have quite a way to go.  I will comment on how that target is broken down.  It is broken down in three ways.  The target for renewable electricity is 40% and we were at just over 25% at the end of 2015.  The target for renewable heat is 12% and we were just over 6.5% at the end of 2015.  The target for renewable transport is 10% target and we were at 5.7% at the end of 2015.  In general terms we have quite a way to go.<\/p> <p>  Our projections and the intelligence available to us suggest we will hit the renewable electricity target, which is 40%, but we have challenges in both heat and transport.  The Commission released a progress report on renewable energy on 1 February.  Its calculations and methodology indicate that Ireland, based on the trajectory we reported in our successive national energy efficiency action plans, will hit around 15.5% of our overall target which indicates a shortfall of about 0.5%.

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, which has looked at this, has indicated to us that for each percentage point we fall below the 16%, the cost estimate is in the range of about &euro;100 million to &euro;150 million.  What can we do about that if we find ourselves under the target by 2020?  There are co-operation mechanisms, called statistical transfers, under the existing 2009 directive.  In essence, it means Ireland could trade with other member states that have overachieved.  We are at the early stages of analysing what that would require in terms of a legislative framework and our ability to trade.  We are one of perhaps four member states, based on the report I have referenced, that are unlikely to hit their targets by 2020.

Would we need to revisit the White Paper?  We would certainly need to put our 50-year perspective into our national energy and climate plan.

There are a couple of points in this regard.  The first is there will be no negotiation until Article 50 is triggered.  Within that negotiation, Ireland will be part of the EU 27 so we do not envisage, even when Article 50 is triggered, that we will hop on a plane and go across to the UK.  It is very much that we will be inputting to the EU 27 and their negotiations.  The UK White Paper on exiting the European Union, EU, was very clear in a number of areas but it left open the potential for the UK to remain within the European framework on different elements.  One of those may well be the internal energy market but we just do not know.  Ireland would certainly be very supportive of that but how Britain would remain in that without the Court of Justice of the European Union is a key question.

The Deputy is right in that there is a very important opportunity in terms of the potential of EU financial instruments.  Ultimately, the scale of the action required, looking to the coming decades, is beyond what the Exchequer alone could support.  It has been a very important part of energy efficiency policy, in particular, for the past number of years to explore alternative funding options.  In that regard, there are a number of issues about the Irish market for energy efficiency, particularly the residential aspect.  There is the question of the suitability of the scale of what Ireland would need, as it has tended not to be on the large scale that would normally be funded by these kinds of EU projects.  That is one area that must be addressed and there is an openness in terms of the European Investment Bank, EIB, understanding that its approach must become somewhat more flexible.<\/p> <p>  There is also the very important aspect that when we look at using EU financial instruments, we must have a very well-developed business case to do so.  That is why a number of schemes have already begun and we are bringing them forward in 2017, with additional Exchequer funding that we have managed to secure, around piloting deeper retrofits, including fuel switching away from fossil fuels in the residential sector.  That is the kind of larger scale work, with investments of &euro;20,000 to &euro;30,000 in individual houses, that could allow us to avail of these types of financial instruments.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, while there is a very clear incentive coming from EU energy policy to avail of these funds, on the other hand there are issues arising from fiscal rules with which the Government must conform.  That particularly arises with the public sector and its buildings, which could also be an area of potential for EU funding.  The need for any such investment to impact the Government balance sheet is something that the Commission is looking into.  Along with a number of other member states, we have pushed for that and we expect to hear from the Commission and EUROSTAT on the rules around the impact on the balance sheet around mid-year.

The principle is that biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels may only count towards the target if they fulfil certain sustainability criteria and the greenhouse gas emissions savings criteria.  This means that, slowly but surely, the drive at EU level is to ensure sustainability criteria are tightened.  It picks up the 2020 package in terms of meeting our renewable transport target.  Most of our emphasis has been around biofuels but the sustainability element was probably not properly accounted for back then.  It is a food versus security debate and concerns the use of advanced biofuels, as opposed to those fuels that are crop-based.

There has been a budget allocation for that this year, so that scheme is planned to be up and running this year.  It is a key scheme to contribute not only to our 2020 targets, but also forward to our 2030 targets.

We have seen the EPA's continual greenhouse gas emissions projections.  While measures might contain emissions from the residential sector, they would continue to grow without much deeper levels of renovation.  However, an important point to remember in this regard, which experience over recent years has borne out, is that it is not just the provision of financing that brings about the activity we require on the ground; we must remember that for energy efficiency policy to take effect, individual citizens must decide to act of their own volition.  This level of central direction is not available to us, so we must make the proposition for deep renovation, of which financing is just one part.  This is why &euro;5 million is being allocated to the deep retrofit pilot in 2017 to establish not just the financing options, but the entire suite of the energy efficiency package that will encourage people to make the decision to act, make that investment and seek to borrow money, which would still need to be complemented by a grant or incentive element.  The point is that financing is critically important, but there is very clear evidence in Ireland and further afield that it is not the only factor.

In July of last year, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the two companies, witnessed by our Minister, the Taoiseach and the President of France in Dublin to move to the next stage of development, which is the two-year development and feasibility study.  The plan is that at the end of the two years, the project would be ready to move to the actual development phase in terms of carrying out the planning permissions and the environmental studies and getting any of the permits and requirements needed.  Regarding a timescale, the project would be developed around the middle of the 2020s.  The project is very much on course.  It is a project of common interest, PCI, under European legislation.  It receives Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, funding, and I understand it may well be in the process of drawing down more funding for the feasibility studies it is carrying out.  There are a few key points to make about the Celtic interconnector in the context of Brexit.  First, post-Brexit, Ireland will only be connected to the European energy market via the UK; we will have no direct connections.  Therefore, the Celtic interconnector could be a direct electricity interconnector to the European market, which would give us access to potentially cheaper electricity and the potential ability to export renewable energies to the greater European market.  Second, the Celtic interconnector is not the solution to many of the issues we talked about earlier.  It is of the order of 500 MW to 700 MW.  That will undoubtedly help our security of electricity supply but it would not in any way replace the question of gas we talked about and the reliance on gas.  Reliance on gas from the UK may drop because we may be importing more electricity from France or be able to generate more renewable energy on our own system, but the reliance on gas generally would not decrease.  Therefore, I would not like to give the impression that the Celtic interconnector could solve all our problems, but it is definitely a very positive project and is in a very positive space, and work is ongoing on its development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017021400002#N00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1487091600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>What is the Department doing about Brexit and its challenges?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017021400002#N01000","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487091600,"counter":135,"content":"<p>That fourth point, which also follows up on something that was said earlier, was that energy infrastructure is a key element.

The presentation we gave in Boyle at the civic dialogue was very similar to the presentation we gave to the Barnier task force, setting out the key issues we see for Ireland and the key potential actions that need to be taken.  One of the latter is appropriate energy infrastructure.  Regarding electricity, direct interconnection to the wider European market undoubtedly needs to be examined more, as well as the potential for other methods of importing natural gas - for instance, liquefied natural gas, which may need to be considered.  In the context of Brexit, we are putting these challenges and priorities on the radar of our European colleagues and the Barnier task force, and energy infrastructure is very much one of our four key energy priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017021400002#N01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1487091600,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Ryan again before we finish up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017021400002#N01200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1487091600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Regarding Mr. Brady's last point, the UK has apparently just signed a memorandum of understanding on the North Seas countries' offshore grid initiative, which the Dutch Government introduced last June.<\/p><p>The fact that it did it in November is not insignificant.

When one measures flow to a house, one can use that information for a variety of purposes.  The decision to meter in Ireland was obviously a Government decision with the intention of supporting user-based charges to begin with.  In the meantime, we have focused on the other benefits from using meters in terms of supporting the operation of our business.  An awful lot of the information points to the fact that a relatively small amount of households use a huge amount of water.  For example, we now know that 1% of households use over 20% of all of the water supplied to households.  We also know that 5% of households use a third of the water supplied to households.  Due to having a leak alarm on individual meters, we also know that about 7% of houses have continuous night flows that are very indicative of leaks.  We have been able to target the proportion of leakage that is on the household side more directly through the first fix scheme.  To date, we have achieved considerable success in terms of saving water on that front.<\/p> <p>  District meters are a completely different piece of the infrastructure.  They are designed to determine the amount of water supplied to a region or area.  In rural areas one might have 50 premises on a district meter because of the length of pipes.  In towns and cities it tends to be more like 1,000 to 1,500 premises.  The Republic of Ireland has 4,407 district meters compared with 3,072 in Scotland.  Therefore, we are very well covered in terms of district metering.  In 2014, our problem was that about 50% of the district meter infrastructure was not working as it had not been maintained over the previous four or five years.  We have got a lot of the problem sorted out.  We are installing a leakage management system that will provide headquarters with live data from all of the meters, thus allowing us to plan our district meter programme.  <\/p> <p>  In broad terms, we distribute 1.7 billion litres of water every day with roughly 600 million litres ending up with households, roughly 300 million litres ending up in non-domestic operation and other uses and about 765 million litres or 45% is lost in leakage on the public side.<\/p><p>The big issue with leakage is undoubtedly on the public side.  That is where the district meters are crucial and it is where the sustained effort over the next ten to 20 years will be required to bring it down to the levels other countries have achieved.  On the domestic side, approximately 170 million litres of the 600 million litres appear to be leakage, based on what the district meters are telling us.  That is the distinction between those two.<\/p><p> In terms of what is excessive usage, the guide or the information I can provide to the committee comes back to the fact that approximately 7% of households typically on a read - in other words, approximately 55,000 of a typical 800,000 reads in a quarter - show the leak alarm.  The statistics show that 5% are using one third of all the water.  Clearly, there is very significant usage at the top end of the usage curve.<\/p><p> On the question about conservation and driving behaviour, that information is telling us that the fundamental gain is around stopping the leakage and encouraging or helping households to fix leaks.  The gains that will be made by means of behavioural change in terms of basic consumption are much lower than that, because when we exclude the 7% that are currently showing leaks the other 93% are only using approximately 110 litres per person, which is very comparable with the northern European figures.  We are not in a bad place where the vast majority of people are concerned.  Conservation is very much about the houses that have leaks, whether inside the house or under the driveway or garden.<\/p><p> In the context of apartment blocks, the most logical and straightforward thing to do would be to have a bulk meter and use some type of aggregate allowance.  It is extremely difficult to meter individual apartments.  There are some that are constructed in such a way that one could do it, but the vast majority are very difficult and we do not see it being a feasible option anytime soon.  Bulk metering certainly would work and that would also catch water that might be used around the site.<\/p><p> Those are the main points I wish to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487073600,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I will add to some of those points.

First, 12 out of 20 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, countries use metering for water charging, so it is common.  Certainly, metering is the norm in our experience of utility regulation when it comes to charging for a utility, bearing in mind that we regulate both energy and water.

What is clear is that if one knows there is leakage in domestic houses by virtue of the meters, we can target it and it is probably the cheapest water to recover.  Such domestic repairs, even the first-fix repairs funded by Irish Water, are relatively cost effective.  Ultimately, none of that takes away from the fact that we have to do a massive amount of work on our public water network, in terms of finding and fixing leaks, replacing pipes, installing pressure management systems and all of the other elements that go into that network.  In that sense, one is not an option compared with the other.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the economics of installing meters, that is not a question that Irish Water has addressed because the decision to install the phase one meters was a Government one made in the context of user-based charges.  That said, we have tried to put some estimate on the long-term benefit of metering in terms of economic return.  If we take a 40 year return period, for example, and look at the savings in water - assuming that out of the current level of household leakage of approximately 165 to 170 million litres, at least 70% to 80% of that can be saved consistently and retained over time - then we see that there is a long-term benefit in terms of both capital deferred and the marginal cost of producing water.<\/p><p>About one third to a half of household water lost through leakage goes down the sewer.  Very little of the water lost through external leakage goes into a sewer but usually into the ground.  If one takes this into account, as well as the deferred capital, whether it would fully justify the cost over a 40 year period is marginal, but it is getting there and that is without considering the environmental benefits and so on.<\/p><p> What members heard from representatives of Scottish Water and Welsh Water during the meeting last week was that, in the absence of a Government policy decision on user based charges, the decision to meter water usage was not a priority for them.  Welsh Water clearly sees metering as a very attractive option.  That is primarily driven by users who want to have their low usage recorded and pay for water on that basis.  Their figures suggest the high users are not captured in metering.  That is why it is operating on the basis that the householder will come forward and request that a meter be installed.  Up to about 50% of households have had meters installed.  <\/p><p> It is fundamentally a policy matter.  I am identifying for members all of the benefits that flow from having a meter in terms of the way we can manage water supply, account for water usage, target local leakages and understand the level of leakages from the public system.  One of the great fallacies prior to metering was that the domestic consumer was using about 145 litres per person.  We now know that is not right.  We know that if we exclude the top 7% of households, usage is about 110 litres per person.  That has forced us to re-evaluate the level of leakages from the public system because we were understating them and assuming more was being lost from households.  Whether that is the case in Scotland, I am not sure, but it would be hard to understand a person in Scotland using 20% more water than a person in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I want to revert to the experience in Scotland and Wales with water meters.  Representatives of Scottish Water stated at last week's meeting that it could detect leaks using its district metering system.  This clearly is at odds with a previous statement issued by Irish Water.  We also learned last week that only half of Welsh Water customers were metered but that this had resulted in a 40% reduction in leakages.  Much of the evidence provided by the two companies illustrates that individual meters are not required to reduce water leakages and promote conservation.  Has Irish Water or the regulator assessed the use of district metering as the best mechanism to reduce leakage levels?  I wonder why Welsh Water was not contacted by Irish Water about its approach to the metering programme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#F00300","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487073600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>The policy framework in the three jurisdictions was different.  The decision to install domestic meters in Ireland in advance of and as part of the process of bringing in user based charges for water was political.  The authorities in Scotland have not gone down that road.  There is a charging system which involves a flat charge.  Like all of the English water companies, Welsh Water had a flat charging system, or a system related to the rateable valuation.  However, all of the companies in England and Wales have gradually started to encourage metering.  In Wales the level of household metering of water usage is up to 50%, while Anglian Water is metering the water usage of 80% of its customers, as water is seen as a very critical resource.  The water companies are introducing metering on an opportunistic basis for new builds or where they are rehabilitating water mains and so on.  Let me repeat that there are significant benefits.  <\/p> <p>  In an urban area the district meter typically meters water usage in 1,000 to 1,500 properties or premises.  It tells exactly how much water is going into the district.  If one knows the level of domestic and non-domestic consumption, one can calculate with a reasonable degree of accuracy the likely leakages from the public system.  If one sends out crews with acoustic devices during the day - it is more efficient to do so at night time - they can find leaks in the public system and also evidence of high flows through a stop cock to a premises.  One can follow up with a waste notice process, as I outlined to Deputy Paul Murphy, or one could apply an excess charge.  Currently, where they show up on our meters, we write to the customers concerned.<\/p><p>The district meter facilitates the leakage programme.  The idea that a substantial part of one's operating resources should be diverted to chase household leaks does not make sense if there are domestic meters.  With ten to 12 readers, in any one quarter we can read 800,000 to 900,000 meters and find 50,000 to 60,000 leaks on premises.  Nothing like that number could be found if we were using operational crews.  We would be lucky to find a number in the hundreds.  Crews would be diverted away from the very job we would wish them to do, which is to find leaks in the public system.  The two are complementary.  It is not a competition between district and domestic metering.  <\/p><p> District metering is an imperative for us.  Ireland has already invested a lot of money in it.  The greater Dublin area was metered in the 1990s.  I do not know the exact amount of money that was invested, but it was in the tens of millions of euro.  About &euro;130 million was invested in district meters across the country between 2000 and 2010.  We now have a substantial infrastructure of district meters, more in fact, per premises, than in Scotland.  Irish Water has been bringing them up to scratch because about 50% were not working.  A lot of the valves had been breached and we installed a lot of pressure valves.  In the past two years we have spent tens of millions of euro in revamping the infrastructure to make it ready and fit for use.  We have also installed a pressure management system and this year will install a national leakage management system to collect all of the information.  Our primary focus is on identifying leakages in the public system.  I am comparing that with what can be done if there are also 900,000 domestic meters which also help to find a lot of leakages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Mr. Grant said at the start of his answer that the provision of meters was a political decision.

Scottish Water is a fascinating case because the decision that was made backfired when Scottish consumers started to face increased costs.  I understand the primary driver behind the provision by Welsh Water of individual meters for its customers - obviously, it is highly in favour of meters and has clearly advocated in favour of such provision - is the need to enable them to monitor their water consumption and achieve lower water bills through such monitoring and to provide for a much more efficient system of billing.  I wonder if this fits with Irish Water's experience in Ireland.

Mr. Grant has indicated that approximately 28,000 leaks have been repaired.  Under the completely archaic and dysfunctional system that previously applied in Ireland, if a massive complaint was made by neighbours who came across a leak, the relevant local authority would eventually have tried to stop the leak through a substantial and lengthy process using various legal channels.

I take it from the answer given by Mr. Grant that not only would it be cumbersome to have to send out staff to define the nature of the problem on a one-on-one basis but also that it would be quite difficult for such a system to detect a smaller leak.  Will he indicate on a cost basis how much more expensive such a leak detecting system would be?  How efficient does he think it might be for an individual household?  Would the use of such a system be possible in Dublin, where large numbers of houses are connected to district meters?  As he indicated, this is not the norm in other parts of the country.<\/p><p> I would like to mention a final issue on which I am seeking an update.

The reduction that was noted when this system was first announced evaporated, in effect, as the charging system changed.

Meters are not provided for free in Scotland.  When householders assess the charges imposed on them in the context of the potential savings in their bills, they can see that it is not economical for them to install meters at their own expense.  That is the Scottish scenario.  On the other hand, meters are provided for free in Wales on an opt-in basis.  Interestingly enough, the authorities in Wales are willing to do repairs on the customer side every two years or so.  This is akin to the first-fix scheme here.  I suppose this demonstrates that by providing information on leakages and taking a proactive approach to the customer, we can help the customer to identify where the leak is and fix it if it is under the driveway.  This is of benefit to the customer and the company in terms of conservation.<\/p> <p>  The 28,000 repairs mentioned by Deputy Colm Brophy were undertaken as a direct result of the identification through the use of meters of between 50,000 and 60,000 leaks on household properties.  We have approximately 50,000 people engaged in that process.  It is reasonable to assume that we will continue to gain big benefits from this activity.  It is interesting that a leak under a driveway leads, on average, to the loss of approximately 6 tonnes of water per day, which is an enormous amount of water and the equivalent of the figure for 20 houses.  It reflects the fact that a reasonably significant leak - it does not need to be a major leak - results in the waste of a lot of water over a 24-hour period.  This is where the bigger picture is lost in much of the discussion about conservation.  We absolutely encourage the use of water-saving devices in the home.  The use of water-saving showers and the employment of rainwater harvesting facilities are good and will result in marginal reductions in water consumption based on standard usage but leaks ultimately dwarf everything else.  It is really important to be able to fix leaks and encourage people to do so.<\/p><p>In terms of the powers that exist without the meter, there are clearly legal provisions but they are cumbersome like most legal processes.  Their implementation takes an awful lot of resources in terms of following them up, the possibility of appeal to courts by the householder and so on.  The provisions in the legislation ultimately provide for a restriction on supply, which was quite a topical matter.  It is certainly not something we have done.  It has been done by local authorities as a means of trying to help the neighbour who does not have a supply where the householder took no action.  None of that makes sense if there are options of helping the customer directly to fix the leak or at least finding the leak for them and enabling them to do so.  <\/p><p> Going back to the question of the district meter finding leaks, the district meter tells us what water is flowing into an area.  That area could have 500 houses but in a town or city it more typically has 1,000 or so.  If we sends crews around at night time, we will find leaks on household properties but that is obviously time consuming.  I am contrasting that with the fact that in any quarter, over a two-month period, ten people can read 900,000 meters.  That gives us an awful lot of information, not just leakage information but also usage information and information we can use for management purposes.  Once we have the meters, using them makes complete sense from an operational point of view and the benefits of that are obvious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Deputy Casey is next and Deputy Pringle is after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#J00200","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":185,"content":"<p>To further expand on the issue of the district metering, Mr. Grant said there are over 4,400 district meters in Ireland.

I would not necessarily claim that 70 megalitres being saved in leakage reduction is sustainable at the level of 70 megalitres because leakage is a bit like washing up in that one has to do it all the time.  Part of the difficulty with leakage up to now is we have hit on it sporadically but we have not sustained the effort.  That is the real challenge and that is an important point to make.<\/p> <p>  On the question of excessive usage and of unmetered premises, that is certainly a difficulty.  They fall into the category of premises that have to be dealt with through an operational process.  We will from time to time find premises that are unmetered that have high usage and there are a number of options that can be taken.  If it can be metered, a meter can be installed and that will bring the premises into the loop but sometimes it cannot be metered.  Very often it is a complex or a shared service situation, of which we have many throughout the country, both with respect to accessing the backyard and some newer developments where mews buildings and so on have been tied on to one another.  The metering programme has identified many of those anomalies.  There is an issue around equity and there is no easy solution to it.  In the case of apartment blocks, an aggregate allowance could be allocated for the block and the management company could be billed for that.<\/p> <p>  As far as billing and getting paid are concerned, that is part of the decision making process to be arrived at by the Oireachtas.  Clearly, having the means to effectively collect money is crucial.  If, for example, we took the 90 percentile figure and 10% were identified as the cohort above the allowance, there would have to be a process whereby they would be notified and given either one quarter or several quarters to respond to it.  Based on the first-fix scheme, there is reasonable evidence that a reasonable number would respond to that.  It is difficult to say what the final number billed would be but we can surmise that quite a few would take action on foot of a potential liability.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Would the regulator like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#L00500","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487073600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I would concur that clearly there is an equity issue if some people have meters and are subject to an excess charge and those without meters would not be subject to it.

We are learning a good deal here today, including, essentially, that meters, whether they are district or household, are not only in place for charging but for capturing critical data and identifying leaks, as well as to benefit water conservation behaviour.<\/p> <p>  Some of the questions I intended to ask have already been answered, so I will not go over them again.  From listening to public debate on this issue up to now, one would get the impression that there was no district metering but I am glad it has been put on the record that substantial district metering is already in place.  It is disappointing that there is still more than 45% leakage from the system even with that in place.  Is metering required specifically on connections to drive down a reduction in leakage around the country?  Has Irish Water a national monitoring and control system to identify leaks?  If it has, does that cover all networks in terms of alarms and all so on?  Did that exist prior to Irish Water being established or did local authorities do different things?  What has been Irish Water's experience where leaks have been identified on metered households?  What has been the response from householders?  Did they act on it and stop the leak or did they leave it continue?  I would be interested to get a response to that question.<\/p><p> In its recommendations the expert commission advised that, where possible, a charge for excessive use beyond normal usage be introduced.  The committee will require advice from the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, on this issue.  In the CER's view, how would this excess charge be implemented without meters?  That is a critical and fundamental question the committee needs to have answered.<\/p><p> With regard to value for money for the taxpayer and the cost per consumer for the provision of a public water supply, again the CER plays a critical role in protecting the consumer and ensuring moneys are invested wisely.  Irrespective of how it is paid for, whether it is through a charging system or general taxation, from what I have heard so far in today's debate is that metering benefits conservation, leakage identification and consumer behaviour.  Is there a value put on that from the CER's perspective?  If so, is there a provision or a recommendation that metering in the longer term would be more cost effective for the taxpayer because it would identify leaks and encourage conservation?<\/p><p> The CER stated earlier that where new houses are connected to the water supply, it would recommend a meter be installed.  As there is network renewal and replacement going on with main services, as well as lead pipe replacement, would it not be more cost efficient when installing new pipework to also install a meter?  It would save duplicate visits to a site and provide opportunities to capture data and more network details for management, as well as feeding into conservation behaviour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#L00800","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I will allow Deputy &Oacute; Broin in for a brief question.

The more factual information we have on it the better.  Current usage according to Irish Water is 111 litres per person per day, when ones takes out the outliers.

We would recommend that under any approach.<\/p> <p>  In terms of charging for excessive usage, the key point is that in the absence of a meter, one cannot charge for excessive usage if one cannot measure the consumption.  Therefore, the point that we have made is that in the absence of a full-scale metering roll-out, we should look at alternatives which would allow meters to be rolled out gradually.  We must look at each of those options and we have already been through many of those, such as mains replacement, new build, bulk metering of multi-unit developments, opt-in and other such initiatives.  A report carried out in 2009 in Great Britain, where charging was and is in place, found that there was an additional 15 litres per person, per day to be gleaned from a charging system based on metering.

If so, did Irish Water make any views available to the Government of the day on the whole domestic metering process?  Would Irish Water have indicated to the Government that this metering process was not a valid or cost-effective process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#O00500","speaker":"1348"},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Grant to be brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#O00600","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487073600,"counter":216,"content":"<p>That was all done by Bord G&aacute;is prior to Irish Water and prior to my time, so I have no knowledge of any discussions that took place around that, other than that Bord G&aacute;is undertook the project and Irish Water, on its establishment, took over the project and was then faced with the contracts.<\/p> <p>  On new builds, now that we have infrastructure to read the meters, having an extra 20,000, 30,000 or 40,000 meters is no great burden at all, and it makes total sense to me to put them in new builds because very often plumbing defects will be captured very early on.

The IHF which was founded in 1937 is the national representative organisation for the hotel and guesthouse sector.  As a key stakeholder in Irish tourism, we work with our industry partners to ensure there are the right conditions for tourism to grow and prosper, thereby enabling it to contribute to recovery and job creation in the economy.  We welcome the opportunity to contribute to the work of the committee on the Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016.  I stress that the IHF is supportive of employment regulation that is balanced and proportional and that takes into account the requirements of employers and employees in an equitable manner.<\/p><p>We have serious concerns that the Bill would impose disproportionate and excessive restrictions on employers in the tourism and hospitality sector by limiting their ability to manage the flow of work in their businesses.  The hospitality business requires a level of flexibility in order to respond effectively to varying levels of customer demand, which is seasonal in nature.  Employers must be able to respond to fluctuations in staffing requirements on an ongoing basis.  For example, a premises may be asked to cater for a large event on short notice.  When this arises, hotels examine their staffing requirements, looking first at their full-time and part-time employees and seasonal staff, including students, and perhaps a small pool of additional staff that would be available to be called upon on a voluntary basis.  This approach is mutually beneficial for both the employer and employee and provides a degree of flexibility that is required in the sector. <br\/><br\/>Before outlining our specific concerns about the Bill, I would like to comment briefly on the study carried out by the University of Limerick.  This study showed little evidence of the use of zero hours contracts in Ireland.  We are not aware of any of our members who operate this type of contract.  The report also cites that only 2.6% of employees in Ireland are working variable hours on a part-time basis, which is very low and this includes those who are satisfied with this arrangement, as their preferred option.<br\/><br\/>The following provisions of the Bill give cause for serious concern.  Section 3 poses a particular concern in that it effectively eliminates the ability of businesses to determine the number of hours they can provide to an employee.  Section 3(1) in effect means that the new minimum number of hours for a given employee after six months has to be greater than the average number of hours worked during the previous six months.  This would result in the employer being required to provide in an ever increasing minimum number of hours for a given employee.  This would require the employer to provide more hours than the business can justify.  We view the six month reference period as extremely short.  It would be detrimental to tourism related businesses given the seasonal variations in the industry.  In particular, the Bill does not allow for situations where the number of hours worked in a six month period is irregular or exceptional.<br\/><br\/>We also have serious concerns about the provision in section 3(4) which provides that an employer can only refuse an employee&rsquo;s request for additional hours if the business is experiencing severe financial difficulties.  This is excessively restrictive and entirely unsuitable for businesses that require flexible working arrangements in order to meet varying customer demand.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>In response to the five specific matters identified for consideration by the committee, the first area relates to low hour and zero hours contracts.  As noted earlier, zero hours contracts are not found to be prevalent and levels of variable part-time contracts are very low.  As to whether zero hours contracts should be banned, we believe that a legislative response banning zero hours contracts would be excessive and disproportionate.  While zero hours contracts are not prevalent in Ireland, under certain circumstances there may be a desire on the part of both employees and employers that they should remain in place, where such arrangements are mutually beneficial.  Any legislative change should therefore only be implemented<b><\/b>based on credible evidence demonstrating a clear need which we believe does not exist.<br\/><br\/>As to<i><\/i>whether the Bill provides sufficient flexibility in its application for small businesses, employers in the hospitality sector, including hotels and guesthouses, need to be in a position to respond to varying levels of customer demand.  Examples include when events catered for by a premises arise at short notice and the seasonality of tourism levels during the year.  This requires a level of flexibility that would be seriously adversely affected by the proposed Bill.  The impact on a small seasonal hospitality enterprise, the backbone of Irish tourism, would be even more pronounced and would be detrimental to their ability to effectively manage their businesses.  It is therefore very concerning that the Bill does not provide any flexibility in its application for small businesses and creates a new level of administrative burden. <br\/><br\/>As to whether workers should be able to request a minimum set of hours, it is our view that it would be detrimental to businesses for employees to have a statutory right to vary the terms of their contracts of employment.  Such a right would have serious consequences for competitiveness and for employment in our industry.<br\/><br\/>On the question of changing the remit of the Low Pay Commission, we do not believe the remit of the commission should be extended to review proposals on banded hours contracts.  The priority of Government should be to review available enforcement measures as opposed to responding by introducing additional legislation that would have substantial unintended consequences.<br\/><br\/>In carrying out scrutiny of the Bill, the Irish Hotels Federation, IHF, would urge the committee to take into account the realities employers face when managing flows of work in their businesses.  In particular, we urge the committee to consider the disproportionate adverse impact the proposed restrictions would have by limiting flexibility, increasing costs and imposing an unnecessary additional legislative burden businesses.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to address this Oireachtas Joint Committee and we look forward to addressing any matters that the members may wish to raise <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Fenn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Finn.

As members are all aware, small firms are the backbone of the Irish economy and of the 238,000 businesses, more that 98% are in the category of small businesses.  A small business is defined as a company that employer fewer than 50 people.  In some 21 counties we are the majority employer.  Last year approximately 20,000 new people decided to that risk and set up a business venture.  It is important to point out that studies consistently show that only one in two of those firms will make it beyond five years.  Among all the other challenges they are facing in terms of markets, customers and finance and all of the usual things, the regulatory burden is becoming more of an issue, and in terms of labour legislation in particular it is becoming a barrier to employment and increasing employment.  We need to be cognisant of that in any review of potential new legislation.<\/p> <p>  We particularly welcome that in the &ldquo;Action Plan for Jobs&rdquo; this year, the Minister saw fit to call out the fact that we need to formalise our concept of &ldquo;think small first&rdquo; and that there should be a test implemented.  I encourage the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to take the lead on it and in the context of this specific Bill to apply the principles that were defined by the EU around understanding the real consequences on business prior to any legislation..  We would advocate that this should be done at principle.  At a basic level we need to look at the problem we are trying to address, we need to see whether they are other options we could use prior to legislation and if there is no alternative other than new legislation we need to cost it and on balance decide whether it is worthwhile going forward or not.  <\/p> <p>  In everything to do with the Bill and going back to the University of Limerick study, our biggest consideration is the fact that there is no evidence.  Nobody should be making decisions on the basis of anecdotes.  I have my share of anecdotes and I know from the transcripts of last week's meeting that the employees side also had a series of anecdotes.  We need to get to a better bar of evidence based policy making across the board and we should start here.  In parallel, as on many other topics we have a Private Members' Bill moving at the same time as the Government Bill.  Even from our perspective in terms of trying to track that Bill, never mind the Government Bill, the time and efficiency of our legislative process is questionable.<\/p> <p>  On the basis that the Bill under discussion is being given due scrutiny, I will go through the specific matter have been raised and share our insights on them.  I mentioned that submitted a detailed response to the Department in January 2016 on the prevalence of zero-hour contracts and low hour contracts among Irish employers and their impact on employees.  I have also sent that submission to the committee secretariat.  Our response gives members a flavour of the practicalities from a variety of sectors and regions about how they saw these types of measures playing out.  If the members scan through that response they will notice the reality in most employment is that employers ask employees to tell them what hours they are available and they then create the entire roster and schedule around that.  It is not about imposing on employees, it is the other way around.<\/p><p>In essence, the power balance, from the perspective of most of those companies, is with the employee already and we are simply trying to fit their lifestyle and other needs and desires into what we are trying to do.<\/p><p> The committee was anxious to ask about how we solve this problem and one of the issues raised was the difficulties for workers with variable hours in getting mortgages.  I would call on the committee to start questioning the logic of that.  We campaigned long and hard to have business banking changed from asset-backed lending to cashflow lending because the former is not an acceptable way of doing business.  Equally, why are banks still hung up on permanent full-time hours when a P60 will tell a completely different story?  One should start to think about matters in terms of how else we might tackle the issues of concern at the root cause of this because we must have innovation in everything that we do and the world is moving on.  I have just come from a briefing in Revenue on the PAYE modernisation system.  It is changing its entire system to reflect the new way of working, new hours, different requirements and integration of welfare.  We must also replicate those concepts here in our discussion of labour law.<\/p><p> On the question on whether zero-hour contracts should be banned, the SFA's members and anyone I have advised have looked at this and decided that their use is unaffordable..  I have no direct knowledge of any of the SFA's members using zero-hour contracts.  When these were being introduced - this came from an EU directive - the labour movement, in essence, the trade union movement, argued for zero-hour contract provisions in terms of recompense to be introduced to protect workers.  Where there is that give and take, where one is asking workers to be available to do work and, therefore, they cannot take up other opportunities, there should be recompense.  Equally, if it is casual on both sides, then there is no need because those concerned can do other things and be productive in their time should that employer not have opportunities.  They are not causing any harm and they work well as they are.<\/p><p> In terms of the third question raised, there is no flexibility in the Bill.  It is a poorly drafted Bill and is open to all kinds of interpretation.  It is very important on Committee Stage to get it right.<\/p><p> In terms of the position of the notice, I have run this by a number of members.  The idea that one would put up on a notice board personal details of every employee and his or her hours of work raises significant data protection issues of concern for workers as well, but the idea that one would have to translate it into English, Irish and any other language is nonsense.  On the translation costs alone, one cannot merely Google it.  If it is in law and one will be held liable, one must ensure it is correct and one cannot merely put it into a translator mechanism.  All such practical issues involve a greater administrative burden than any other legislation currently on the Statute Book and we must guard against that.<\/p><p> The committee had a discussion here as to whether to exempt small business.  I represent small firms.  We never argue for exemptions because in the real world doing so overly complicates everything and also stops firms growing.  If one states this will only apply to companies with more than five or ten employees, one will soon see a common thread where no one will go over that if he or she does not have to unless he or she is scaling up.  We do not want to impose such barriers and complexities on the system.  We need legislation to work for every business all of the time but we need to think small first in our approach to how we legislate and regulate.  I would also point out that our surveys show the average number of employees one has before a HR professional is employed to deal with all of this is 52.  Some 98% of businesses do not have a HR professional and coping with 40 pieces of legislation is a massive burden.  That is the same whether one has one employee or 500.  One has to come up to speed, understand and know of these rules.  That is a  huge issue.<\/p><p> On the fourth question, in terms of the need for flexibility, it is definitely our members' understanding that if-and-when contracts work for many.  The committee will see in the submissions testimony from members that they concern here those who one might expect, such as students and females with balancing requirements, but also those pursuing other interests, such as artists and those who want to do their ideal job but who cannot afford financially to stick with it and need other work at the same time.  There are many reasons we would want to use these.  We definitely need to maintain such flexibility.  There is a huge assumption that low hours and low pay are the same; they are not.  Indeed, most of the ultra-flexible contracts that we see are at the high end, involving those who choose, because they can, in the IT professions, in engineering, in medical, to come and work in different ways.  That is certainly important.<\/p><p> On the right for a worker to request increased hours and to permit refusal only on objectively justified grounds which grounds are restricted to experiencing severe financial difficulties, the idea in the Bill is that one must concede to give hours.  As the Bill is worded, the only way out of giving hours is to go public stating that one is financially in dire straits.  This will not happen.  Despite the fact that many businesses during the recession could have claimed under the National Minimum Wage Act  2000 that they were experiencing severe financial difficulty, they never did.  They never invoked that exemption.  They simply made workers redundant or, if they could hang on to them, put them on short-time or lay-off provision.  Having measures such as this in place will not work.  In reality, one cannot get beyond the reputational damage.<\/p><p> The other point then, if such is the case, is that if the first employee who requests these additional hours gets them, does that mean everybody else has to lose out because there are only a certain number of hours, and one employee wins and everybody else loses?  When one gets into the practicalities of this, merely dealing with it is complex.<\/p><p> On the final question on the Low Pay Commission, the commission has a big enough job to do as it is.  It has a specific remit and it needs to be better at it.  It needs to produce better evidence, going back to the fact it has not produced any new data since it was established.  We need to focus on that area.  The Workplace Relations Commission is already well established.  We have members in and out of the WRC all the time.  Clearly, persons can already bring cases on all of these issues under the Industrial Relations Acts, the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 or the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Callan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Callan.

The restaurant sector employs 72,000 and contributes &euro;2 billion annually to the economy.<\/p> <p>  I do not intend to go through our detailed submission which I circulated already to members but I will outline our reasons as to why the Bill is not fit for purpose.  At the outset, I believe it is important to note that the Restaurants Association of Ireland is supportive of employment legislation that works for both the employer and the employee.  The restaurant sector is a key part of Ireland's tourism product and has been an important contributor to the improvement in Ireland's tourism performance over the past couple of years.<\/p> <p>  It is essential that the policy environment for the sector is conducive to the survival, growth and maintenance of a high-quality competitive offering.  The restaurant sector has a wide geographical spread and supports rural as well as urban economic activity and employment.  The sector has a broad geographical footprint and provides valuable full-time and part-time employment in every county around the country.<\/p> <p>  For most restaurants, labour costs account from close to 40% of total operating costs with profit margins on average between 2% and 5%.  Hence, the sector is sensitive to increases in rates of pay.  It is a seven-day-a-week business but restaurants' busiest part of the week would be Thursday through to Sunday.<\/p> <p>  To be a successful restaurant business, one must operate with a large amount of flexibility.  Restaurants take bookings for lunch and dinner in good faith.  While some operators take deposits, many customers are unwilling to pay deposits for the dinner.  No shows for bookings are widespread in the sector and have a negative impact on our daily labour and food costs.<\/p> <p>  The association is of the view that the Bill, in its current format, does not take into consideration the workings of the restaurant and hospitality business and the realities within which establishments work on a day-to-day basis.  If the Bill were to be enacted in its current form, it would have substantial negative consequences for employers and employees.  The Bill does not take into account the need for businesses to operate with flexibility.<\/p><p>Under the Bill, it does not appear to matter if the employer does not have work to offer.  Given the nature of the restaurant industry, this would be impossible.  Many of our member restaurants operate in seasonal areas where they would only be operational between mid-April and mid-October.  These businesses are dependent on large numbers of tourists visiting their localities, villages and towns.  They provide local employment but if they had to be provide guaranteed hours in the off-season, they would have to close their doors.  The Bill does not contain a provision for employers to move employees back to a lower band where necessary, for example, when the season comes to an end or business deteriorates.<\/p><p> The RAI is concerned about section 3, under which employers would be obliged to demonstrate that they cannot provide more hours because they are in severe financial difficulties.  No restaurant owners would want to publicise or state that they were in financial difficulty.  The restaurant industry operates on tight margins and having to publicise to their local community and competitors that they are in financial difficulty could result in them losing even more business and having to close. <\/p><p> I refer to the study on the prevalence of zero-hour contracts among Irish employers and their impact on employees carried out by the University of Limerick.  As pointed out in our submission to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the UL report, the study which the university was commissioned to undertake was on zero-hour contracts and not on \"if and when\" contracts.  The study found that zero-hour contracts are not extensive in Ireland.  The report also states that the Central Statistics Office found that only 5.3% of those working in Ireland are on \"if and when\" contracts.  It also found that of the 57,100 jobs created in 2015, 56,800 of them were full time.  Part-time contracts are used in the restaurant, hospitality and tourism sector where there are seasonal fluctuations in work, where it is difficult to predict the minimum level of staff required or where the need for urgent cover can arise.  Restaurants increase their workforce as needed during business peaks on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.<\/p><p> The Bill offers zero flexibility for employers whose trade depends on those with disposable income and tourism.  It would only increase costs and the administrative burden on restaurants.  Banded hours contracts are more likely to have the effect of reducing the total number of employees rather than increasing the total number of hours per employee.  We thank the committee for its time and the invitation to attend.  We are happy to engage with all stakeholders on the issues raised.  I reiterate that were the Bill to proceed in its current form, it would have serious ramifications for the restaurant industry, increasing costs as well as affecting the ability of restaurants to expand and create new jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Cummins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for their presentations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#E00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I also thank everyone for their presentations.  They were similar and there was a great deal of repetition, which is reflective of the nature of the businesses in which they are all engaged.  I cannot help but note the irony that over the years, working lives have changed.  Work practices have changed and there have always been objections from employers to benefits that might accrue to workers.  When an attempt is made to introduce legislation that might improve the lot of workers, employers always throw their toys out of the pram.<\/p><p>I read the debate on the Factory Act 1833 in Britain recently.  It was implemented to limit child labour.  Similar arguments were made by employers then.  They said the legislation would make life impossible, and it would ruin employment and competitiveness and decimate profits.  I do not wish to compare any of the representatives with the terrible employers of the post-Industrial Revolution era who had children up chimneys and on factory floors but, nevertheless, the pattern is that when legislation that could benefit workers is brought forward, employers tend to complain bitterly.  While I welcome it, it does not go far enough.<\/p><p>I would like to take some of the facts in the presentations to task.  It is wrong to say there is no evidence that there is a connection between low pay and low hours; on the contrary, there is a great deal of evidence.  The CSO has published studies, while TASC and Social Justice Ireland have published evidence that there is a direct link between low income and low hours.  We attended a briefing last year when the Bill was brought before the House.  A Dunnes Stores worker described her working life and that of her colleagues.  She said:<\/p><blockquote>Three quarters of the 10,000 Dunnes Stores workers are employed on what they call &quot;flexi-hour contracts&quot; with a minimum of 15 hours per week.  Despite this, most of us work above that.  Some of us work 25 or 35 hours, some work less but the average hours are between 25 and 30.  All we want is a new contract that reflects the hours we actually work so that we can have an income we can depend on from week to week.  Our income can fluctuate from &euro;400 one week to &euro;150 the next, entirely at the discretion of the local manager, and this makes it impossible for us and our families to plan our lives.  Many of our colleagues have been denied loans with credit unions and mortgages because a bank looks at the amount of money we have, then looks at our contracts and sees how unreliable they are and how low the hours are.<\/blockquote> <p>That is one of many people who have given evidence in this regard.  It is, therefore, ridiculous to say there is no relationship between low pay and low hours.<\/p><p>There is a worrying and shocking prevalence of low pay in the State.  Approximately 24% of the entire workforce is officially deemed to be low paid and we are one of the highest low-paid economies in the OECD.  Legislation such as this is necessary both to protect livelihood and lifestyle of workers and to protect the income they can earn.  I ask the witnesses to consider the consequences of doing nothing.  Reference was made to the need to think about this and one witness stated the way we are going about this business is flawed and leaves a lot to be desired.  If the witnesses think that, then perhaps one or two of them should put themselves forward for election the next time on the basis that they could do this better.  Our business is protect workers and to enhance their lives.  Currently, the lives of hundreds of thousands of workers are being severely impacted because of anti-social and anti-family contracts and a lack of contracts in many cases.  My worry is that the contracts in place are becoming increasingly precarious and difficult.  For example, Deliveroo only takes on workers on the basis of work being available.  Otherwise, they are considered to be self-employed and they do not even earn the minimum wage.  They are subject to accepting work through an app and it is extremely competitive.  There are many &quot;maybes&quot; for workers and families.  This issue affects one quarter of the working population.  This matters and data show there is a relationship between low hours and low pay.<\/p><p>If zero-hour contracts are not prevalent and if they are not such a big deal for their industries, why are the representatives so worried about the impact of legislation that will give workers limited access to a contract that will allow them to approach a credit union or a bank and to be able to depend on their income and their working life?  If, on the one hand, people are saying there is no such thing as zero-hour contracts and the UL study is flawed, what is the panic?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#E00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>The Deputy referred to an issue that is raised all the time, which is the uncertainty of working hours.

There are a lot of hours involved in trying to run a hotel.  Hotels also have huge variations in demand for services.  By and large, in the industry we see a lot of full-time jobs that involve people on full-time contracts.  We also have part-time jobs with people who are happy to take part-time jobs.  We have people who take the seasonal jobs and there is a small coterie of people who are on flexible hours and these may be students.  The federation spends a lot of time promoting human resources best practice.  We also spend a lot of time working with the agencies to try to develop new apprenticeships, new traineeships and new ways of creating full-time employment for people who may start out in part-time positions.  It is our job, not to seek to have 3,000 employees on our books, but to seek to minimise the number of employees and thereby give as many people as possible the full-time contracts the Deputy believes they should have, and which we also think they should have.  I must be clear, however, that a huge amount of people have made lifestyle choices; they do not want to work the traditional nine-to-five hours five days per week.  They are quite happy to work in different hours.  Even today, as we looked at the new initiatives being put in place by the Revenue Commissioners around the PAYE structures, it is interesting that the Revenue figures show the amount of people - over 200,000 - in Ireland with more than one job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Fenn"},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Is that 200,000?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#F00600","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487088000,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Yes.

In fact, we seek at all times to ensure that the people who are employed in our industry are well served by their employers and by the relationships between the employer and the employee.  It is our belief that the more an imposition is put in to the legislation, the more it damages the relationship between the employee and employer.

We fully accept that there are many variations in employment.  The specific zero-hours piece is the one that does not exist because one has to compensate people for a minimum of 15 hours or 25% of hours worked, regardless of whether the employer needs the person or not.  My colleague, Ms McGuone's full-time job is in helping our member companies to be compliant, to deal with the other side of this, and it is certainly not the case that people are trying to undermine employees' entitlements.  If anything, employees tend to come to their employers, as the first port of call, to ask about their entitlements.  It is interesting that the Deputy named a specific company, which is a concern, because we should not legislate for what is going on in one company or even a number of companies.  There are 238,000 businesses and we cannot control that one company.  We certainly do not speak for it.  People like that will come up with other ways around the issue, regardless of the legislation.  It behoves us to look at how the majority of businesses are behaving and what this legislation might do to them.  All of us here have one common aim, which is to get the country back to full employment.  This requires more people to set up businesses, to navigate these complexities and to deal with these issues.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of low pay, Ireland has the second highest minimum wage in Europe, so the Deputy cannot argue that our workers are underpaid, as of today.  I believe that our experience in that regard is that every time the minimum wage goes up, workers reduce their hours.  If the members read the testimony I forwarded to the committee, I show the scenario where people keep cutting back their hours because they want to retain welfare benefits.  People are actually leaving the labour market because they are worried.  Real reform around welfare is needed to look at these factors and ensure that it is not mitigating against people working.  Time and time again I have seen situations where companies had to put people on a three-day week during the recession.  Now there is enough work to bring them back for five days a week but people are refusing to return.  That is the biggest problem.  These are skilled workers and their employers want them to work more but they have decided that it is not worth their while after tax -  Ireland is still very heavy on taxation - and welfare are taken into account.  It shows there are loads of other factors at play, but our ambition is to create good quality jobs for everybody.  That is in all our interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Callan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487088000,"counter":245,"content":"<p>The last two speakers covered a lot but I want to make two points.  With regard to the restaurant sector, the vast majority of employees in the industry are probably in their first job.  They are students who are looking for a job to pay their way through college and so are waiters or waitresses.  When we look at benchmark Irish employees in our sector against other European norms, Ireland has the second highest wage rate in the European restaurant industry.  This is a proven fact.  At the end of the day, these are businesses that must make a profit to keep their doors open.  If a restaurant does not make a profit the doors must close.  Across much of rural Ireland we can see many businesses closed and those that are still open are finding it tough to keep their doors open.  In my submission to the committee I have explained how the margins in our sector are small at between 2% and 5%.  This is a fact and anyone in the business will tell one that.  If there are employers who are not compliant - and a company that is directly involved in our area has been named - then employees should go to the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, which is the avenue to go to if the employee has a problem with an employer.

I have worked in retail and in bars and restaurants.  I have also worked as an IT recruiter, where I had IT contractors on very healthy hourly salaries.  They wanted to work on contracts and they wanted zero-hour contracts and the flexibility of being able to work remotely or from home at hours of their choosing.

If something goes down, not all their eggs will be in the one basket.  Many thought leaders are telling employees, particularly those in the digital economy, that they should have multi-stream incomes and that these may be micro-incomes across multi-streams.

We still have 0% inflation.  Inflation has not increased since 2008, so most businesses are adopting the approach that, essentially, it will make decisions around it doing well if it does well.  On profit-sharing in the traditional sense, a cash based profit-sharing scheme is taxed in exactly the same way as income tax.  We need more innovative employee share option-type models.  Revenue and the Department undertook a consultation last year but in the Budget Statement last year it was kicked to touch until this year.  This is particularly an issue for tech-type startup businesses, where highly valued employees are being asked to take a big gamble by going with a startup to begin with but they have no potential to benefit on exit if the business is successful.<\/p><p>More innovative measures are needed in order for these startups, which may not be able to afford &euro;100,000 salaries, to attract talent.  This would help certain sectors of the economy.<\/p><p> A very interesting finding of our most recent conditions of employment survey was that during the recession, people became much more focused on benefits.  We have seen stark increases in the number of small companies paying, for example, maternity and paternity leave top-up, health insurance and so on.  Again, it is not necessarily just a matter of basic pay.  This is all about building loyalty and engagement, rather than shopping around, and how people feel in the workplace.  We have certainly seen a move in this regard as well.<\/p><p> On the broader commercial environment aspect, business costs are the biggest issue, whether it is labour, insurance, energy, commercial rates or whatever else.  It is great to hear that the committee is considering this next.  The capital investment aspect is also massive.  I know the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, is planning to bring forward the mid-term review of the capital investment plan.  If we do not get broadband, do not build out our roads and do not get our infrastructure right, we cannot benefit from any potential increased investment.  These are becoming huge blockers, particularly to activity in the regions.  Dublin's economic activity accounting for half the entire GDP of the economy is not good for anyone.  London is about 20% of the UK's economy, most capital cities are 8% to 12% of the country's economy and our figure is 45%.  It is unsustainable and a very significant issue.<\/p><p> Regarding the taxation side of things, matters such as the capital gains tax, CGT, incentive for entrepreneurs and PAYE are definitely important.

It takes them two minutes every month to do it.  Ms Callan is complicating this.  The Bill is simple.  If the witnesses have amendments that would work, I think Deputy Cullinane himself said when he was here that he is open to accepting any sensible amendments to his Bill.  However, we need to address the issue of people who are on if-and-when contracts, do not know when they will be working, cannot get loans and cannot plan their futures.  I do not see the witnesses coming forward with any solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#H00200","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487088000,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I watched the session with Deputy Cullinane last week.  What strikes me is the idea that Deputy Quinlivan can say it is a simple Bill.  It should be read word for word.  We are the ones who ultimately must comply with the legislation.  We are giving the committee our best guess as to how difficult it will be to comply with what is in the Bill and its unintended consequences.  Any of us can come up with a good concept, but if one goes through the Bill literally, word for word, it has many unintended consequences.  Is that good legislation?  We have demonstrated today many of these practical issues.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the point about Googling, if the Bill is made law and I am the employer and does not want to be in breach of the legislation, I cannot rely on this in my defence before a tribunal, wherever I might end up, if I make a mistake.  Again, good employers comply properly but they will also consider this and will make decisions to ensure they avoid any of the liability under the provisions of the Bill.  Therefore, one must ask whether the Bill will achieve the desired consequences in the majority of employments.  Again, going back to Deputy Neville's point, no matter what Deputy Quinlivan says, we have not seen the evidence.  Where is the evidence?  Where are the numbers?  Deputy Quinlivan has his anecdotal stories from individual employees; I have my anecdotal stories from vast numbers of employers.  That is no way to make legislation.

It is a little like last week, when we had a panel of people saying there is no real problem and that very few people are employed on precarious work.  Yet all of us, I think, from across the parties know there is a big problem.  Perhaps I will take up our colleague from the Hotels Federation.  My previous job was as a SIPTU official so I have worked with a number of hotels in Limerick.  Not one of them issues contracts different from this one.  I refer to a contract issued by the Strand Hotel.  It is a fine hotel, in fairness, in Limerick.  The contract states, \"As a casual employee, your hours will be communicated to you by the departmental rota\".  How many hours is this lady going to have to work next week?  Unless she has worked there for three and a half years so far, is that acceptable in the witnesses' eyes?  This is a big problem.  I challenge Mr. Fenn to name for me hotels in Limerick that do not issue contracts such as this.  I can assure him that I have worked to try to organise all workers subject to these contracts and I know exactly the type of contracts the Hotels Federation's members issue.  They issue contracts such as this one, that is, if-and-when contracts, which guarantee no hours and whereby people do not know from one week to the next what hours they will get and what pay they will get.  When they raise this, if they have the temerity to do so, what happens?  They do not get any hours the following week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#H00400","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I would prefer if Mr. Fenn did not mention any hotels because they have no representatives here to defend themselves.

By and large, there is a big fluctuation in the demand for the hours required.  Given that hotels are open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, there is a huge number of hours to be filled.  What we see is employers seeking to reduce the number of employees they have on their payrolls, get people to stay with their businesses for longer periods and improve retention.

In addition, we refer to 40 to 50 other legislative measures to protect employees in this country and the active and professional Workplace Relations Commission to look after the rights of workers.  In that context, employers make their choices on an individual basis.  In law, we have a voluntarist industrial relations system.  Employees have a choice and they can join a union if they wish.  Employers also have a choice and they can engage in political bargaining if they wish, but they are not required to do so.

There is much common ground between the various parties and, indeed, between the various employers in terms of trying to improve the lot of workers.  We should try not to be confrontational about that.<\/p> <p>  I would like to have a little more data.  Much of what we are discussing here is anecdotes from both sides of the spectrum.  Deputy Neville expressed that to me too.  It would be helpful if we could hone in on data in the cross tabulations.  If there is 2.6%, what percentage of those are students, what percentage of them have multiple part-time jobs and so forth?  That would be helpful.<\/p> <p>  Ms Callan raised an interesting point about the regulatory impact assessment.  Are the RAI and the Irish Hotels Federation in favour of that too?  I presume they would be.  It appears that it should be a minimum requirement for this.  In addition, if this Bill was enacted without any amendments, as some are proposing, how would it affect the witnesses' member organisations?  Have the organisations quantified how many jobs it might cost or the type of impact it might have financially on an individual business?  Have any assessments been carried out in that regard?<\/p> <p>  In terms of the specifics mentioned by Ms Callan, the point made about banking, mortgages and the need for banks to look at matters differently is commendable and is certainly worth examining.  However, it is also quite easily manipulated and if we went back in that direction would there not be further problems in the mortgage sector?  I am concerned about the idea of looking at P60s alone and trying to project forward into the future for people.  Obviously, a business can be seasonal.  Somebody could have one good year for income but could have five bad years thereafter.  It appears to be a bad way of doing things.<\/p> <p>  The witness is correct with regard to the flexibility around the hours per week and posting the hours.  Regarding the requirement to post in English, Irish and any other language, given the nature of restaurants and hotels with new staff joining and other staff leaving, it appears that the any other language requirement would be a serious burden.  I doubt that one could simply Google and chance it.  One would open oneself to a serious court challenge or a serious employment tribunal case if one got it wrong.  If one got it wrong on a consistent basis and ended up dismissing an employee thereafter, one would be open to a serious challenge if it turned out one's translations were incorrect.  That is a serious burden to place on people.<\/p> <p>  My final question is directed in particular to Mr. Fenn.  Does he think that if these regulations are imposed they will have a substantial impact on the organisation's members, in the context of the federation competing with relatively unregulated entities such as Airbnb and the like?  Is that a potential problem in the future?  There is much talk about self-employed versus employed.  I named one organisation but we see this happening more extensively.  It is not confined to the food delivery sector, and I will be careful not to name individual organisations.  In the home cleaning area, for example, people are being displayed as self-employed rather than employed.  It also applies to industries that we have considered to be self-employed for a long time, such as taxi driving.  There are over-arching organisations, people wearing uniforms and elements that are normally associated with traditional employment, yet they are on self-employed contracts.  That is probably worthy of discussion in and of itself on another occasion.  What exactly constitutes an employee and a self-employed person at present is a worthy topic.  However, perhaps the witnesses would respond to my questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#J01500","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Fenn wish to respond to the last question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#J01600","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487088000,"counter":288,"content":"<p>In the last part of that question the Deputy referred to an individual company, so we might talk in general about what we refer to as the shadow economy, the sharing economy or the like.

The difficulty we are experiencing is that there is not a level playing pitch at present.  There is much wonderful rhetoric about disrupters in the economy and so forth, but ultimately it comes down to the fact that there are people who are working in jobs, employers who are trying to create employment for them and people who are providing the best service they can for their customers.  Customers might decide to go elsewhere, which is fine.  That is part of the cut and thrust of competition.  However, what should not happen is that the others are advantaged in a way that is unfair to the people who, over many years, have invested billions of euro in the Irish economy, particularly in tourism, and to allow \"disrupters\" to arrive and just change that without recourse.

It is a very detailed, scientific review of the business and it will find that a business may be perfect in every respect, except perhaps a failure to display a poster.

The CSNA is not anti-employee or anti-trade union.  It has never supported any political party and it recognises the efforts made by the drafters of this Bill to address what they perceive to be a particular problem with regard to the difficulties encountered by some workers in securing less precarious contracts.  Our written submissions set out our response to the five specific matters for consideration that the committee requested.  I do not intend to reintroduce these matters but I will obviously cover any of the queries that either the Chairman or the members may have.<\/p> <p>  We take the attitude that every Bill, whether Government sponsored or a Private Members' Bill, should be accompanied by a regulatory impact assessment, RIA, in keeping with better Government principles, as adopted over a decade ago.  Such an assessment would analyse the cost implications for businesses, particularly small businesses, and consider alternatives to legislative intervention.  It would also examine the size and scale of the problem, something that the University of Limerick study was lamentably shy on discovering.  An RIA would also seek to meet all relevant stakeholders in advance of progressing toward a Bill.  We understand that this Bill has not had the benefit of employer consultation.  The CSNA does not believe that the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny is the correct approach for devising coherent and competent legislation, as it is dealing with a published Bill rather than being involved in creating the legislation.  The CSNA does not accept that additional legislation, which by extension places additional regulatory burdens on an entire cohort of employers, is an appropriate or necessary response in the absence of evidence that would quantify a problem that could only be resolved by the introduction of new laws.<\/p><p>The Bill is one-sided in its direction and suffers from a lack of appreciation of the employers' perspective.  It seeks to increase the rights of workers by way of increasing obligations on employers without any provision to offset them if and when their businesses require urgent attention.  It does not make provision for how anomalies and unforeseen consequences that would follow from it, if enacted, would be addressed.  A worker returning from maternity or extended sick leave would quite legitimately expect to be able to return to the position she had held prior to her absence.  How would these returns be accounted for if the workers who had filled their hours had demanded their new banded hours contract replace the hours they had worked?<\/p><p> Many of our members employ workers in the evening, at weekends and on public holidays.  The Bill makes a crude reference to hours worked without considering the nature of these hours.  If a worker seeks an entitlement  to receive a new contract based on hours worked in the preceding six months, there will be no restriction or obligation to restrict such hours to similar periods, as previously worked.  It has the potential to restrict flexibility.<\/p><p> The business model our members adopt requires very significant elements of flexibility to meet an ever-changing retail environment.  Convenience retailing extends across a substantial portion of the day, from as early as 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., at a minimum, seven days per week.  There are, within each week, significant peaks and troughs.  Local events can and do create the need for extra or fewer hours.  These events are not predictable, nor are they constant.  Granting an employee the right to be employed based on previous hours worked displays a lack of understanding of our businesses and the ever-changing nature of this most challenging environment.<\/p><p> Banded hours are most certainly one of the ways some employers can regulate their businesses.  They cannot be applied by all employers who, by virtue of the size or nature of their business, need a greater degree of flexibility, whether for seasonal, structural or financial considerations.<\/p><p> The CSNA is very conscious that the Bill, if enacted, will create the potential for substantial additional costs for our members if they are involved in interaction with the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  These costs are not limited to the cost of engaging legal counsel.  There are also costs associated with responding to the commission, attending the adjudication hearing and the Labour Court.  There are additional costs involved in the provision of easily read notices in an unspecified number of languages.  These have to be accessed, approved and completed, at a cost to every employer in the State.  We consider such obligations to be unnecessary and disproportionate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vincent Jennings","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487088000,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for the invitation to appear before it to discuss this Private Members' Bill.  I am joined by Mr. Tommy Smyth who is a human resources expert with great experience in assisting Retail Grocery Dairy &amp;amp; Allied Trades Association, RGDATA, members and other retail employers.  RGDATA represents family-owned independent grocery retailers in Ireland.  Our members own and operate over 3,500 shops, convenience stores and supermarkets in every community throughout the country and are significant employers providing vital local full and part-time jobs in cities, towns and villages all over Ireland.  It is a fact that independent stores have a far greater employment intensity than the multiples.  The independent sector has a 35% market share and employs around 90,000 employees.  The multiples have 65% of the market and employ about 35,000 staff.  Lidl has an average number of 20 workers per store, while Aldi employs an average number of 24 workers per store.  The employment intensity of an equivalent independent grocer is between 50 and 120 employees.  We represent very important employers right around Ireland.  The split between full-time and part-time workers is about 50:50 within RGDATA members' shops.  This reflects the cyclical nature of convenience retailing.  Some days are busier than others, while some periods within the day are more active than others.<\/p> <p>  Employees in RGDATA members' shops are issued with a contract of employment stating the hours they have been employed to work.  The contract includes a flexibility clause which the employee signs to accept.  As a roster is posted weekly all employees know their hours a week in advance.  In general, full-time staff have set weekly hours and work the same days every week.  Part-time staff have a set number of hours but may work on different days each week on a rota basis.  Part-timers are usually college students and parents who want to work specific hours that fit in with their college courses or parenting commitments.  Our members provide vital jobs for college students who travel home to work at weekends.  The students are also available to work more hours during holiday periods.  This is invaluable to shop owners who need cover in the summer months or the busy Christmas period.  This is a mutually beneficial system.  It suits the students who want to fund their college life and also suits our members who need staff who are flexible and want to work more hours on busy weekends and in holiday periods.<\/p> <p>  Our members pride themselves in supporting their local community and employees tend to live locally, show great loyalty to their employer and stay for many years.  As the employers tend to be local; therefore, they too live and spend locally.  Profits are not repatriated out of their county, let alone the country.<\/p> <p>  Continuity of employment within RGDATA members' shops is also very high.  According to a Jim Power Economics report for RGDATA, over 64% of employees in independent shops have worked for the same employer for more than five years.  This high retention rate clearly demonstrates that both part-time employees and employers are happy with the current system.  Nearly 90% of employees are paid in excess of the statutory minimum wage.  Labour costs are a huge issue for independent retailers who operate under incredibly challenging economic conditions.  They face increasing levels of competition from major international giants and many are based in village and town centres that have not yet seen the benefit of economic recovery.<\/p> <p>  Retailing is a sector that bore the brunt of the downturn and is making a very slow recovery.  Independent retailers work with employees to find a mutually agreeable roster, but they have to include a flexibility disclaimer in a contract of employment in order that they can react to external factors that can affect their business.  Examples are bad planning decisions allowing a proliferation of supermarkets on the outskirts of small towns, changes in the road network that impact on passing trade and local job losses.  The loss of jobs in Dell in Kildare will lead to a loss of lunch expenditure and passing trade for several RGDATA members.  Even weather events, such as a big freeze affect footfall and expenditure in local shops.  All of these factors impact on small local employers.  Flexibility of hours, managed in a fair manner, is key to keeping a business open and jobs available.  We are not talking about rich corporations but about local main street traders whose margins are very tight.  In order to maintain local jobs in rural areas, these employers need to be able to react to change.  Many RGDATA members draw a salary from their business at less than the minimum wage equivalent.<\/p> <p>  We have a number of concerns about the Bill.  First, it is seeking to address a problem which is not present in our members' stores.  Our members do not offer zero hour contracts.  Second, the Bill goes beyond zero hour contracts to target banded hours.  These are very different issues and we believe banded hours legislation is being piggy backed onto the negative headlines that zero hours contracts attract.<\/p> <p>  As I explained, employers need to seek some flexibility in regard to part-time roles to ensure that during times when quiet is trade, their wage bill does not become disproportionate to the lower sales.  Employers do this through communications with employees and those who are most flexible are talked to first.  If employees are aggrieved, they have many avenues open to them.  They include internal grievance procedures; the Workplace Relations Commission's code of practice: the Workplace Relations Commission's conciliation, mediation and adjudication services; the Labour Court; the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997; and contract law.<\/p> <p>  Third, the Bill is prescriptive in intervening in the working relationship between an employer and employees.  Excessively restrictive labour laws act against the retention of employees.  RGDATA is aware of retailers who were unable to restructure existing employment arrangements with employees owing to legal restrictions and had to let people go rather than restructure their working conditions.  These were all circumstances where the employees were happy to work reduced hours or accept reduced pay, but the law prevented this from happening.<\/p> <p>  The Bill seeks to make a certain roster legally fixed after a period of time and override any flexibility clause in a contract.  If the Bill is passed, employers will shy away from giving mutually agreeable hours to an employee and will keep hours flexible all the time.  This is likely to be less desirable to the employee.<\/p> <p>  While we are not aware of the analytical data used to prepare the Bill, we and the human resources experts that assist our members do not come across grievances arising in this area and we do not believe it requires further legislation. <\/p> <p>  In summary, RGDATA believes the Bill will introduce new rules and regulations governing the employment relationship between shop owners and their employees that are neither required nor necessary.  Unnecessary rules add to the cost of doing business in Ireland and this adversely impacts on employment creation, local jobs, important part-time jobs and job retention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Buckley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487088000,"counter":320,"content":"<p>Many thanks for the invitation to discuss the proposed Banded Hours Contract Bill.  We in Retail Excellence welcome the decision to allow further scrutiny of the legislation, which, if enacted, will have far-reaching consequences for our industry and beyond.  The retail industry is the heartbeat of the economy.<\/p><p>It represents 45,000 family-owned businesses and accounts for 282,000 employees, so today presents an opportunity for us to outline our misgivings on this proposed legislation, which would have a severe impact on those retailers.<br\/><br\/>At the outset I point out that we are not an organisation that sees itself in conflict with policies or legislation that are pro-employee. On the contrary, we are one of the few employer organisations that welcomed last year&rsquo;s recent minimum wage increase.  So, when we make arguments for and against legislation it is in a balanced manner, taking into consideration the essence of what we stand for, which is retail excellence, as without good employees we will never reach this ideal.  We fully acknowledge there have been incidents of employment rights abuses but these are minimal and very much a peripheral exception rather than the industry norm.  Therefore, we contend that a scramble to penalise everyone for the actions of a few is premature and that recent indicators point to the fact that more people are in a better position in terms of their hours of work and earnings.  CSO figures indicate the number of casual and part-time workers continues to fall, as does the trend in the figures for part-time underemployment.  Therefore, we do not agree with this attempt to stop what is often termed the &quot;casualisation of work&quot; as we feel it is a move that is out of sync with the aforementioned employment trends in the industry.<br\/><br\/>In light of the foregoing, it is imperative we strike a correct balance between the rights and needs of workers and that of employers.  We must find solutions that make sense and that work in practice for all concerned and ultimately help retailers grow because when our members thrive, they in turn increase their employee capacity.  We must desist from any actions that erodes the competitive nature of doing business.  We have enough to do as a country to stave off the uncertainty and unpredictability of Brexit and President Trump, dual issues that are already impacting on consumer sentiment and general spend in retailers' outlets.  Addressing employment issues should not mean changing the complete fundamentals of the relationship between employees and employer, which this Bill purports to do.  It creates penalising burdens on Irish employers that could very well have the opposite effect of what is intended by Sinn F&eacute;in.<br\/><br\/>There are elements of this Bill that make little sense in a business environment.  Section 3 provides the right for employees in a company to seek and be given more hours if they request to move to a higher band after six months of continuous employment.  An employer may only refuse the request if the employer is experiencing severe financial difficulties.  If it refuses, the employer may be brought to the Workplace Relations Commission and, on appeal, to the Labour Court, which will find in favour of the employee unless the employer can prove severe financial difficulties.  This is a step too far and will destroy the largest employer in this State as section 3, in addition to this point will, in its entirety, will do three things.  It will increase the cost of doing business in that the investment of time, resources and administration will deflect attention from the ordinary challenges of running a business in financially straitened times.  It will create a situation wherein employees can continue to demand further increases in hours six months subsequent to the first time they have been awarded an increase in hours; band mobility is a rolling stone and this is a unilateral step too far.  The section also compels business owners to disclose their sensitive financial information to their employees.  This information should not be for an employee's consumption and instead of safeguarding an employee's position, it may very well have the completely opposite effect if such information made it into the public realm.<br\/><br\/>Under section 5, the requirement that notices in Irish, English and any other language be displayed showing the number of hours being allocated to workers in the next week or month and the relevant bands is again imposing a further cost imposition on business, investing time and efficiencies in further administration.  Moreover, the six-month reference period is far too short and takes no consideration of seasonal work patterns or those working in some industries like health and education, or employees who cover for colleagues on a prolonged period of maternity leave, etc.  The Bill unilaterally imposes an obligation on the employer to give more hours than he or she might not have a necessity for, which makes no sense in the circumstances.  So, to counteract this, the logical act for employers to do if this Bill is enacted is to reduce hours and increase the numbers on low hours contracts.  That is the very practice this Bill purports to stop.<br\/><br\/>We must be mindful that business by its very nature requires forward planning for contingencies.  Now more than ever this practice has become pertinent in the face of Brexit.  We have seen from December&rsquo;s consumer sentiment index the increase in online shopping on<i>.co.uk <\/i>websites and that retail is already in decline and could very well enter into a recessionary space if the trends continue.  So, many employers may be unwilling to grant additional working hours in the circumstances but may require the flexibility of employees in light of absenteeism, maternity leave and so on.  Yet this Bill provides that unless they are in severe financial difficulties, they cannot refuse to give additional hours.<br\/><br\/>Many might say this Bill will act as a deterrent to employers but we would go further and say it is punitive and imposes intolerable burdens on employers.  The inflexible nature of it and the administrative burden indicates that bad legislation is being created, which will make things inordinately difficult for small employers and will undoubtedly lead to jobs being lost and our competitiveness being damaged.  It would be better to focus on those unscrupulous employers who created the issues rather than penalising the compliant majority because to enact this aspirational Bill would be to suggest that our recently reformed WRC mechanism is obsolete and ineffective, which is not the case.  Again, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this forum and thank members for listening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Higgins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank the three groups for their time in making the submissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#O00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":323,"content":"<p>There is an obvious trend in what is being articulated by a number of the organisations here today and I agree with much of it.  There are particular flaws within this Bill, as has been highlighted by some members of the committee.  As I stated from the outset, the nub of this is getting at unscrupulous employers who exploit employees, as the witnesses mentioned.  That is the intention but it is a matter of how we go at this, particularly with regard to smaller businesses.  I have worked in small retail businesses through the years.  They are a flatter type of organisation and the owner of the business might get quite close to the staff and vice versa.  The staff would have a good handle on how the business performs.  It is not that there would be layers of management that could sometimes obscure information or massage the figures because the employees are so removed from the commercial side or figures in the business.  The people running a cash register or counter in a drapery shop would know what way the sales are going.  Over a period they get to know the business and understand when it fluctuates.  I understand the sense in that.  I asked the other witnesses as well about focusing on what is termed \"unscrupulous employers\".  Given that the issue has been around for a while - perhaps before my time as I was elected to this House last year - have any studies been done by the organisations leading to statistics about unscrupulous employers either inside or outside the organisations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#O00300","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487088000,"counter":324,"content":"<p>We do a survey among members every few years through Mr. Jim Power, the economist.

We need to keep Irish businesses competitive and keep costs low, particularly in the context of the dual threat of Trump and Brexit.

Before I call Senator Gavan, I would like to mention that my background is in retail.  My family owned an independent grocery retailer for 17 years and was a member of RGDATA.  We have a family jewellery business as well.  I have been on both sides of the counter as an employee and as an employer.  I accept Ms Higgins's point about the importance of businesses having good working relationships with their staff.  A retailer who asks a member of staff to open a small shop in a small town at 7 a.m. must be sure that he or she will turn up to turn on the coffee machine and take in the newspapers, etc.  It is very important.  Although many smaller shops and businesses have good working relationships with their employees, it is fair to say that issues have been flagged to all of us as elected representatives.  That is why we are looking at this proposal.  The uncertainty of working mothers and fathers who do not know from week to week how many hours they might have is one of the issues that has been flagged to me on many occasions.  The lack of regular hours from week to week makes it harder for such people to look for loans for cars or houses.  I know it is more difficult to get a mortgage now.  When people are organising child care, they need to know whether their child needs to be minded for two days next week or three days the following week.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate the points that have been made by the retailers because I have been in their position.  However, we need to try to address the issues that exist.  That is what the committee is trying to do.  We accept there are many good employers who look after their staff.  We are cognisant that the activities of some businesses are determined by factors like tourism numbers or the weather.  We understand that a shop beside a university, a college or a school will be very busy in September, but will not do much business in June, July or August.  As I have said, this issue has been flagged with all of us as elected representatives.  The Government is examining it at the moment with the intention of introducing legislation.  It would not be drafting legislation unless an issue had arisen at some stage.  We need to tease this out.  We have to try to get our heads around these important issues.  We are not saying all employers are the same.  We need to try to get a handle on the fact that some workers feel discommoded.  They do not think they are getting the right treatment.

We were delayed due to votes in the Seanad but I have read the witnesses' submissions.  I have asked every group that appeared before this committee who have concerns about this Bill the same question, which I will also ask of the witnesses.  We have a problem in that some people are being abused.  A figure of 48,000 employees was given to us in a previous presentation based on a University of Limerick study that found the 2.5% of the workforce have these types of contracts.  That is a large number of people.  If unscrupulous employers are using these contracts as a way to avoid giving people regular work, we need to address that.  In a previous life I was involved in a trade union but I am also an employer.  I employ doctors, nurses, administration staff on a part-time and full-time basis but I can give them predictable hours.  There are seasonal issues within the hospitality sector and in certain smaller businesses and that is fully acceptable, but there is also a problem with some people being abused.  We do not know the scale of that, which was acknowledged by everybody, and therefore more research on this is needed.  I do not believe this Bill is the way to address it but it raises the issue which needs to addressed.  I apologise for the long preamble in asking the witnesses what suggestions they have for how we can address this issue.  We have had some people appear before the committee who tried to tell us that there is not an issue, but there is an issue.  How can we do address it?  We do not want to be use a sledgehammer to crack a nut, which many people believe this Bill is because it is inflexible and so on, but there is an issue of equity and fairness involved.  As I said to a previous group, the 48,000 employees with these types of contracts is quite a large number of people and if it was my brother, sister, son, daughter or mother, I would be very upset and cross about the fact that there is inequity in some instances.  How do we protect workers from that?  That is my question to the witnesses but it is not put to them in a pejorative or aggressive fashion.  We are seeking to address an important issue.  All I have heard from those who have come before the committee is that we should accept this Bill or that there is not a problem and we should discard the Bill.  Neither of those views will fix this problem for us.  We need something in the middle.  I accept we need more research.  I would be grateful to hear if the witnesses have any ideas that might help us to address this issue or on how we can protect workers from those who would abuse the current situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017021400002#Q00500","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487088000,"counter":353,"content":"<p>It is not our function as representatives of employers to bring about legislative change.

If there is a quantifiable number and it is found that there is nothing other than legislative action that should be taken, then a regulatory impact assessment would assist in doing that.  The Department could then carry out a series of consultations to quantify the job involved.  The University of Limerick study was lamentably light in providing evidence, even though it strayed well beyond its terms of reference.  However, what is most certainly did was to state that there is not a problem but that there is this issue and it should be examined in another way.  Why would the Department not home in on that, bring in the stakeholders, tell them these are the findings, having done an additional study, and ask them what are the solutions?  We are not only employers but are mothers, fathers, grandfathers, uncles aunts and so on.  We do not want to live in a society where there is a Victorian style of employer.

We have seen the highly publicised cases where some unscrupulous employers have acted very badly and wrongly when it came to their employees, but, as I pointed out in my submission, they are very much in the minority and on the periphery.  More critically, more research was required when it came to presenting this Bill because research is very much the steering wheel of every issue.  Unless we have research it is very difficult to drive an issue and to draft balanced legislation in the circumstances.  Further consultation with employer groups before the legislation was brought forward would have provided an opportunity for all of us to put forward our proposals, think things through and brainstorm to come up solutions in those marginal examples of cases where employers have exploited their staff.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, the word \"uncertainty\" has been used a good deal.  There is no worse industry for uncertainty than the small business sector.  I pointed out that there is a huge degree of uncertainty surrounding the retail industry.  We saw that from the December figures with the consumer sentiment being down.  Many small business people have restructured through examinership and so on during the recessionary period.  They have cut costs as much as they can.  They might not have created jobs but they saved a great number of jobs in this country over the course of the recession and people need to be mindful of that.  Businesses have the same challenges as some employees in terms of uncertain hours.  I mention the impact of President Trump's policies and of Brexit, of which nobody knows what will be the fallout.  Many businesses plan in terms of longer-term contingencies.  We must recognise the nature of doing business in this country in the circumstances.

If they are parents, they work in the mornings and want to be finished to fit in with school times.  The employers knows that.  They might have students who work weekends and work shifts.
