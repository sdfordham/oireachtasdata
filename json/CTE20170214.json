I have a few questions.  Whoever is most able to answer them can do so.  In light of last week's meeting, could they outline why individual metering at people's homes is more beneficial than district meeting?  Could they elaborate on whether there are benefits in this regard?<\/p> <p>  The expert commission recommends a charge for excessive usage.<\/p><p>How can we charge for excessive usage if there is no meter to measure usage?  <\/p><p> In light of the commission's recommendations, how can we reduce excessive water usage in apartment blocks?  To paraphrase, the report stated it might be easier to meter blocks of apartments rather than individual units.  How can the excessive charge element be dealt with if there is a meter for an apartment block but not one for each individual apartment?<\/p><p> In terms of conservation, have we domestic or international data that show metering affects behaviour?  Is there evidence that shows measuring usage has a knock-on effect on behaviour and conservation?  If householders can receive data on their water usage, does that support the conservation of water?<\/p><p> Let us say nothing had happened with water to date and we were starting at ground zero, would the delegation consider metering to be a good idea?  I cannot understand how we can get proper metrics without meters.  If Irish Water had a blank sheet, would it still call for meters?  My comments have centred on the conservation element of metering and how can we deal with excessive usage if we do not know how much water people use.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#B00300","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487073600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The purpose of an individual meter is to measure.  When one measures flow to a house, one can use that information for a variety of purposes.  The decision to meter in Ireland was obviously a Government decision with the intention of supporting user-based charges to begin with.  In the meantime, we have focused on the other benefits from using meters in terms of supporting the operation of our business.  An awful lot of the information points to the fact that a relatively small amount of households use a huge amount of water.  For example, we now know that 1% of households use over 20% of all of the water supplied to households.  We also know that 5% of households use a third of the water supplied to households.  Due to having a leak alarm on individual meters, we also know that about 7% of houses have continuous night flows that are very indicative of leaks.  We have been able to target the proportion of leakage that is on the household side more directly through the first fix scheme.  To date, we have achieved considerable success in terms of saving water on that front.<\/p> <p>  District meters are a completely different piece of the infrastructure.  They are designed to determine the amount of water supplied to a region or area.  In rural areas one might have 50 premises on a district meter because of the length of pipes.  In towns and cities it tends to be more like 1,000 to 1,500 premises.  The Republic of Ireland has 4,407 district meters compared with 3,072 in Scotland.  Therefore, we are very well covered in terms of district metering.  In 2014, our problem was that about 50% of the district meter infrastructure was not working as it had not been maintained over the previous four or five years.  We have got a lot of the problem sorted out.  We are installing a leakage management system that will provide headquarters with live data from all of the meters, thus allowing us to plan our district meter programme.  <\/p> <p>  In broad terms, we distribute 1.7 billion litres of water every day with roughly 600 million litres ending up with households, roughly 300 million litres ending up in non-domestic operation and other uses and about 765 million litres or 45% is lost in leakage on the public side.<\/p><p>The big issue with leakage is undoubtedly on the public side.  That is where the district meters are crucial and it is where the sustained effort over the next ten to 20 years will be required to bring it down to the levels other countries have achieved.  On the domestic side, approximately 170 million litres of the 600 million litres appear to be leakage, based on what the district meters are telling us.  That is the distinction between those two.<\/p><p> In terms of what is excessive usage, the guide or the information I can provide to the committee comes back to the fact that approximately 7% of households typically on a read - in other words, approximately 55,000 of a typical 800,000 reads in a quarter - show the leak alarm.  The statistics show that 5% are using one third of all the water.  Clearly, there is very significant usage at the top end of the usage curve.<\/p><p> On the question about conservation and driving behaviour, that information is telling us that the fundamental gain is around stopping the leakage and encouraging or helping households to fix leaks.  The gains that will be made by means of behavioural change in terms of basic consumption are much lower than that, because when we exclude the 7% that are currently showing leaks the other 93% are only using approximately 110 litres per person, which is very comparable with the northern European figures.  We are not in a bad place where the vast majority of people are concerned.  Conservation is very much about the houses that have leaks, whether inside the house or under the driveway or garden.<\/p><p> In the context of apartment blocks, the most logical and straightforward thing to do would be to have a bulk meter and use some type of aggregate allowance.  It is extremely difficult to meter individual apartments.  There are some that are constructed in such a way that one could do it, but the vast majority are very difficult and we do not see it being a feasible option anytime soon.  Bulk metering certainly would work and that would also catch water that might be used around the site.<\/p><p> Those are the main points I wish to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487073600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I will add to some of those points.  The Deputy asked if the data in general support conservation.  Data will always support conservation, whether it is at individual household level, at the aggregate level of the district or at national level.  One will always look to data to give the evidence that would support decision-making.<\/p> <p>  On the final question about whether metering would be a good idea, at ground zero, I cannot give a definitive answer but I can offer a few observations.  First, 12 out of 20 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, countries use metering for water charging, so it is common.  Certainly, metering is the norm in our experience of utility regulation when it comes to charging for a utility, bearing in mind that we regulate both energy and water.  Typically, however, we would look to a full evidence-based cost-benefit study to make a determination on a question such as that, so it would be premature for me to give the Deputy a direct answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Is the witness saying that if we were starting at ground zero, he could not say whether metering would be good or bad, even though he says that metering promotes conservation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#D00300","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487073600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Of course metering promotes conservation.

What is clear is that if one knows there is leakage in domestic houses by virtue of the meters, we can target it and it is probably the cheapest water to recover.  Such domestic repairs, even the first-fix repairs funded by Irish Water, are relatively cost effective.  Ultimately, none of that takes away from the fact that we have to do a massive amount of work on our public water network, in terms of finding and fixing leaks, replacing pipes, installing pressure management systems and all of the other elements that go into that network.  In that sense, one is not an option compared with the other.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the economics of installing meters, that is not a question that Irish Water has addressed because the decision to install the phase one meters was a Government one made in the context of user-based charges.  That said, we have tried to put some estimate on the long-term benefit of metering in terms of economic return.  If we take a 40 year return period, for example, and look at the savings in water - assuming that out of the current level of household leakage of approximately 165 to 170 million litres, at least 70% to 80% of that can be saved consistently and retained over time - then we see that there is a long-term benefit in terms of both capital deferred and the marginal cost of producing water.<\/p><p>About one third to a half of household water lost through leakage goes down the sewer.  Very little of the water lost through external leakage goes into a sewer but usually into the ground.  If one takes this into account, as well as the deferred capital, whether it would fully justify the cost over a 40 year period is marginal, but it is getting there and that is without considering the environmental benefits and so on.<\/p><p> What members heard from representatives of Scottish Water and Welsh Water during the meeting last week was that, in the absence of a Government policy decision on user based charges, the decision to meter water usage was not a priority for them.  Welsh Water clearly sees metering as a very attractive option.  That is primarily driven by users who want to have their low usage recorded and pay for water on that basis.  Their figures suggest the high users are not captured in metering.  That is why it is operating on the basis that the householder will come forward and request that a meter be installed.  Up to about 50% of households have had meters installed.  <\/p><p> It is fundamentally a policy matter.  I am identifying for members all of the benefits that flow from having a meter in terms of the way we can manage water supply, account for water usage, target local leakages and understand the level of leakages from the public system.  One of the great fallacies prior to metering was that the domestic consumer was using about 145 litres per person.  We now know that is not right.  We know that if we exclude the top 7% of households, usage is about 110 litres per person.  That has forced us to re-evaluate the level of leakages from the public system because we were understating them and assuming more was being lost from households.  Whether that is the case in Scotland, I am not sure, but it would be hard to understand a person in Scotland using 20% more water than a person in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I want to revert to the experience in Scotland and Wales with water meters.  Representatives of Scottish Water stated at last week's meeting that it could detect leaks using its district metering system.  This clearly is at odds with a previous statement issued by Irish Water.  We also learned last week that only half of Welsh Water customers were metered but that this had resulted in a 40% reduction in leakages.  Much of the evidence provided by the two companies illustrates that individual meters are not required to reduce water leakages and promote conservation.  Has Irish Water or the regulator assessed the use of district metering as the best mechanism to reduce leakage levels?  I wonder why Welsh Water was not contacted by Irish Water about its approach to the metering programme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#F00300","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487073600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>The policy framework in the three jurisdictions was different.  The decision to install domestic meters in Ireland in advance of and as part of the process of bringing in user based charges for water was political.  The authorities in Scotland have not gone down that road.  There is a charging system which involves a flat charge.  Like all of the English water companies, Welsh Water had a flat charging system, or a system related to the rateable valuation.  However, all of the companies in England and Wales have gradually started to encourage metering.  In Wales the level of household metering of water usage is up to 50%, while Anglian Water is metering the water usage of 80% of its customers, as water is seen as a very critical resource.  The water companies are introducing metering on an opportunistic basis for new builds or where they are rehabilitating water mains and so on.  Let me repeat that there are significant benefits.  <\/p> <p>  In an urban area the district meter typically meters water usage in 1,000 to 1,500 properties or premises.  It tells exactly how much water is going into the district.  If one knows the level of domestic and non-domestic consumption, one can calculate with a reasonable degree of accuracy the likely leakages from the public system.  If one sends out crews with acoustic devices during the day - it is more efficient to do so at night time - they can find leaks in the public system and also evidence of high flows through a stop cock to a premises.  One can follow up with a waste notice process, as I outlined to Deputy Paul Murphy, or one could apply an excess charge.  Currently, where they show up on our meters, we write to the customers concerned.<\/p><p>The district meter facilitates the leakage programme.  The idea that a substantial part of one's operating resources should be diverted to chase household leaks does not make sense if there are domestic meters.  With ten to 12 readers, in any one quarter we can read 800,000 to 900,000 meters and find 50,000 to 60,000 leaks on premises.  Nothing like that number could be found if we were using operational crews.  We would be lucky to find a number in the hundreds.  Crews would be diverted away from the very job we would wish them to do, which is to find leaks in the public system.  The two are complementary.  It is not a competition between district and domestic metering.  <\/p><p> District metering is an imperative for us.  Ireland has already invested a lot of money in it.  The greater Dublin area was metered in the 1990s.  I do not know the exact amount of money that was invested, but it was in the tens of millions of euro.  About &euro;130 million was invested in district meters across the country between 2000 and 2010.  We now have a substantial infrastructure of district meters, more in fact, per premises, than in Scotland.  Irish Water has been bringing them up to scratch because about 50% were not working.  A lot of the valves had been breached and we installed a lot of pressure valves.  In the past two years we have spent tens of millions of euro in revamping the infrastructure to make it ready and fit for use.  We have also installed a pressure management system and this year will install a national leakage management system to collect all of the information.  Our primary focus is on identifying leakages in the public system.  I am comparing that with what can be done if there are also 900,000 domestic meters which also help to find a lot of leakages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Mr. Grant said at the start of his answer that the provision of meters was a political decision.

From independent surveys, the result seems to be that Scottish Water consumers are paying some of the highest water charges in Europe.<\/p><p>My understanding is the delivery of cost savings to customers, particularly those who want to be able to avail of cheaper water costs through water conservation, is a direct benefit of having a meter.  Scottish Water is a fascinating case because the decision that was made backfired when Scottish consumers started to face increased costs.  I understand the primary driver behind the provision by Welsh Water of individual meters for its customers - obviously, it is highly in favour of meters and has clearly advocated in favour of such provision - is the need to enable them to monitor their water consumption and achieve lower water bills through such monitoring and to provide for a much more efficient system of billing.  I wonder if this fits with Irish Water's experience in Ireland.  I think it is fair to say it is probably one of the main things we would like to achieve in Ireland in the use of meters.<\/p><p> I would like to refer to some other issues.  Mr. Grant has indicated that approximately 28,000 leaks have been repaired.  Under the completely archaic and dysfunctional system that previously applied in Ireland, if a massive complaint was made by neighbours who came across a leak, the relevant local authority would eventually have tried to stop the leak through a substantial and lengthy process using various legal channels.  This resulted in the leak continuing for a substantial period.  How would Mr. Grant characterise Irish Water's ability to repair a domestic leak for a customer, thereby delivering savings to him or her, from the point of detection to repair?<\/p><p> We heard testimony about a magical system involving a district meter that could be used in Ireland to detect a leak and link it definitively with an individual house in order that it could be repaired.  I take it from the answer given by Mr. Grant that not only would it be cumbersome to have to send out staff to define the nature of the problem on a one-on-one basis but also that it would be quite difficult for such a system to detect a smaller leak.  Will he indicate on a cost basis how much more expensive such a leak detecting system would be?  How efficient does he think it might be for an individual household?  Would the use of such a system be possible in Dublin, where large numbers of houses are connected to district meters?  As he indicated, this is not the norm in other parts of the country.<\/p><p> I would like to mention a final issue on which I am seeking an update.  I understand the introduction in this country of metering with an allowance initially resulted in a reduction in water usage.  The reduction that was noted when this system was first announced evaporated, in effect, as the charging system changed.  Is my understanding correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#G00900","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487073600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>The Deputy has compared the very different policy positions taken in Scotland and Wales.  Meters are not provided for free in Scotland.  When householders assess the charges imposed on them in the context of the potential savings in their bills, they can see that it is not economical for them to install meters at their own expense.  That is the Scottish scenario.  On the other hand, meters are provided for free in Wales on an opt-in basis.  Interestingly enough, the authorities in Wales are willing to do repairs on the customer side every two years or so.  This is akin to the first-fix scheme here.  I suppose this demonstrates that by providing information on leakages and taking a proactive approach to the customer, we can help the customer to identify where the leak is and fix it if it is under the driveway.  This is of benefit to the customer and the company in terms of conservation.<\/p> <p>  The 28,000 repairs mentioned by Deputy Colm Brophy were undertaken as a direct result of the identification through the use of meters of between 50,000 and 60,000 leaks on household properties.  We have approximately 50,000 people engaged in that process.  It is reasonable to assume that we will continue to gain big benefits from this activity.  It is interesting that a leak under a driveway leads, on average, to the loss of approximately 6 tonnes of water per day, which is an enormous amount of water and the equivalent of the figure for 20 houses.  It reflects the fact that a reasonably significant leak - it does not need to be a major leak - results in the waste of a lot of water over a 24-hour period.  This is where the bigger picture is lost in much of the discussion about conservation.  We absolutely encourage the use of water-saving devices in the home.  The use of water-saving showers and the employment of rainwater harvesting facilities are good and will result in marginal reductions in water consumption based on standard usage but leaks ultimately dwarf everything else.  It is really important to be able to fix leaks and encourage people to do so.<\/p><p>In terms of the powers that exist without the meter, there are clearly legal provisions but they are cumbersome like most legal processes.  Their implementation takes an awful lot of resources in terms of following them up, the possibility of appeal to courts by the householder and so on.  The provisions in the legislation ultimately provide for a restriction on supply, which was quite a topical matter.  It is certainly not something we have done.  It has been done by local authorities as a means of trying to help the neighbour who does not have a supply where the householder took no action.  None of that makes sense if there are options of helping the customer directly to fix the leak or at least finding the leak for them and enabling them to do so.  <\/p><p> Going back to the question of the district meter finding leaks, the district meter tells us what water is flowing into an area.  That area could have 500 houses but in a town or city it more typically has 1,000 or so.  If we sends crews around at night time, we will find leaks on household properties but that is obviously time consuming.  I am contrasting that with the fact that in any quarter, over a two-month period, ten people can read 900,000 meters.  That gives us an awful lot of information, not just leakage information but also usage information and information we can use for management purposes.  Once we have the meters, using them makes complete sense from an operational point of view and the benefits of that are obvious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Deputy Casey is next and Deputy Pringle is after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#J00200","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>To further expand on the issue of the district metering, Mr. Grant said there are over 4,400 district meters in Ireland.

I would not necessarily claim that 70 megalitres being saved in leakage reduction is sustainable at the level of 70 megalitres because leakage is a bit like washing up in that one has to do it all the time.  Part of the difficulty with leakage up to now is we have hit on it sporadically but we have not sustained the effort.  That is the real challenge and that is an important point to make.<\/p> <p>  On the question of excessive usage and of unmetered premises, that is certainly a difficulty.  They fall into the category of premises that have to be dealt with through an operational process.  We will from time to time find premises that are unmetered that have high usage and there are a number of options that can be taken.  If it can be metered, a meter can be installed and that will bring the premises into the loop but sometimes it cannot be metered.  Very often it is a complex or a shared service situation, of which we have many throughout the country, both with respect to accessing the backyard and some newer developments where mews buildings and so on have been tied on to one another.  The metering programme has identified many of those anomalies.  There is an issue around equity and there is no easy solution to it.  In the case of apartment blocks, an aggregate allowance could be allocated for the block and the management company could be billed for that.<\/p> <p>  As far as billing and getting paid are concerned, that is part of the decision making process to be arrived at by the Oireachtas.  Clearly, having the means to effectively collect money is crucial.  If, for example, we took the 90 percentile figure and 10% were identified as the cohort above the allowance, there would have to be a process whereby they would be notified and given either one quarter or several quarters to respond to it.  Based on the first-fix scheme, there is reasonable evidence that a reasonable number would respond to that.  It is difficult to say what the final number billed would be but we can surmise that quite a few would take action on foot of a potential liability.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Would the regulator like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#L00500","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487073600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I would concur that clearly there is an equity issue if some people have meters and are subject to an excess charge and those without meters would not be subject to it.

We are learning a good deal here today, including, essentially, that meters, whether they are district or household, are not only in place for charging but for capturing critical data and identifying leaks, as well as to benefit water conservation behaviour.<\/p> <p>  Some of the questions I intended to ask have already been answered, so I will not go over them again.  From listening to public debate on this issue up to now, one would get the impression that there was no district metering but I am glad it has been put on the record that substantial district metering is already in place.  It is disappointing that there is still more than 45% leakage from the system even with that in place.  Is metering required specifically on connections to drive down a reduction in leakage around the country?  Has Irish Water a national monitoring and control system to identify leaks?  If it has, does that cover all networks in terms of alarms and all so on?  Did that exist prior to Irish Water being established or did local authorities do different things?  What has been Irish Water's experience where leaks have been identified on metered households?  What has been the response from householders?  Did they act on it and stop the leak or did they leave it continue?  I would be interested to get a response to that question.<\/p><p> In its recommendations the expert commission advised that, where possible, a charge for excessive use beyond normal usage be introduced.  The committee will require advice from the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, on this issue.  In the CER's view, how would this excess charge be implemented without meters?  That is a critical and fundamental question the committee needs to have answered.<\/p><p> With regard to value for money for the taxpayer and the cost per consumer for the provision of a public water supply, again the CER plays a critical role in protecting the consumer and ensuring moneys are invested wisely.  Irrespective of how it is paid for, whether it is through a charging system or general taxation, from what I have heard so far in today's debate is that metering benefits conservation, leakage identification and consumer behaviour.  Is there a value put on that from the CER's perspective?  If so, is there a provision or a recommendation that metering in the longer term would be more cost effective for the taxpayer because it would identify leaks and encourage conservation?<\/p><p> The CER stated earlier that where new houses are connected to the water supply, it would recommend a meter be installed.  As there is network renewal and replacement going on with main services, as well as lead pipe replacement, would it not be more cost efficient when installing new pipework to also install a meter?  It would save duplicate visits to a site and provide opportunities to capture data and more network details for management, as well as feeding into conservation behaviour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#L00800","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I will allow Deputy &Oacute; Broin in for a brief question.

Knowing what we now know, was &euro;500 million for universal water metering an effective use of that resource or would there have been a better way to target that money, given how small a number of households appear to have domestic household leaks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#M00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>We will allow the witnesses to answer the questions but we will have to finish at 1.10 p.m.  I thought Deputy &Oacute; Broin's questions were going to be short.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#M00400","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>That was short for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#M00500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I accept that.

We would think it is a sensible policy to have meters where one can be installed for &euro;40 or &euro;50 as the marginal cost when there is either a new build or one is replacing the network.  That makes sense.<br\/><br\/>We are putting in place a national control system.  There were individual sub-county systems that differed a lot and not everyone had full telemetry on the district metering area.  Dublin had a relatively good system and we have taken that into Irish Water as the bulwark of our system.<br\/><br\/>In terms of acting on leaks, surprisingly it has taken three or four letters to get people to engage on the first fix.  We have 50,000 engaged at the moment out of almost 100,000 that we have notified.  One of the points is that people do not seem to be aware of the damage that can be caused to their property by very significant leaks.<br\/><br\/>In Scotland, their position is policy driven to a large extent.  On the core point of <i>per capita<\/i>usage and the comparison internationally, including all the high outliers leaves the figure in the 130s of litres, but omitting them gives about 125 litres as an average figure.  If all the 7% is distilled out, as it were, we are down to about 110, which is comparable with Denmark and Germany and countries like that.  When we start looking at countries in southern Europe or the USA, we are looking at lifestyle changes and the way people live and it is very hard to make a comparison.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#N00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>We are, however, at the low end in terms of OECD figures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#N00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487073600,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Yes, we are, but we do not irrigate, for example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487073600,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I wish to add a few points to that.  An excess charge would be within the context of the circumstances being dealt with within the particular jurisdiction, for example, lifestyle may change consumption over time.  Therefore, whatever decisions are taken, they cannot stand forever.  Something like that would always be kept under review because lifestyle changes may change patterns of consumption.  That is always looked at within the context of national circumstances.<\/p> <p>  I agree that one of the options that could be looked at as well as new build is mains replacement, but as with any of these options, coming to the value for money piece, we would look at the evidence, where it exists, as to whether the particular investment was a sound one.  That would require gathering whatever evidence was available and conducting a cost-benefit analysis.  We would recommend that under any approach.<\/p> <p>  In terms of charging for excessive usage, the key point is that in the absence of a meter, one cannot charge for excessive usage if one cannot measure the consumption.  Therefore, the point that we have made is that in the absence of a full-scale metering roll-out, we should look at alternatives which would allow meters to be rolled out gradually.  We must look at each of those options and we have already been through many of those, such as mains replacement, new build, bulk metering of multi-unit developments, opt-in and other such initiatives.  A report carried out in 2009 in Great Britain, where charging was and is in place, found that there was an additional 15 litres per person, per day to be gleaned from a charging system based on metering.  There are benefits from metering in terms of usage but there are obviously leakage reductions to be achieved through other conservation measures as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I call Senator Clifford-Lee, Deputy Heydon and Deputy Healy for three short questions.
