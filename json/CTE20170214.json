The National Competitiveness Council was established by the Government in 1997 and serves as an independent voice advising on Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position and the means by which it may be enhanced.  The council&rsquo;s role is, therefore, an advisory one.  We do not formulate policy but rather advise on areas of focus to improve competitiveness.  Our membership includes people with relevant expertise in competitiveness, business people and representatives from employer and trade union organisations.  The CEOs of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the chair of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission are also members.<br\/><br\/>Each year the council publishes three annual reports.  The Costs of Doing Business in Ireland report is a requirement under the Action Plan for Jobs and benchmarks key business costs and highlights areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors.  Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Scorecard provides a comprehensive statistical assessment of Ireland's competitiveness performance. <i><\/i>Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge uses this information along with the latest research to outline the main challenges to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and the policy areas to enhance our position.  The council&rsquo;s annual submission to the Action Plan for Jobs is also included as part of this year&rsquo;s<i><\/i>competitiveness challenge report.  We also publish a series of two to three page bulletins on various aspects of competitiveness.<br\/><br\/>Ireland&rsquo;s ability to compete and sell goods and services abroad is the key determinant of economic growth, our ability to provide sustainable jobs, the wage rates that people are paid and, importantly, our ability to provide quality public services.  Our recent competitiveness challenge report, a copy of which was provided to members, reports that the economy is in its strongest place since the onset of the recession. This is a significant achievement and the council wishes to acknowledge the role of Government and the Oireachtas.<br\/><br\/>Ireland&rsquo;s improving competitiveness performance has been central to the recovery in employment and economic growth.  Since 2011, Ireland&rsquo;s relative international competitiveness, as measured by a range of international indices, has improved.  Ireland moved from 16th to 7th in 2016 in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook, and from 24th to 23rd in the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report.  In addition, the World Bank&rsquo;s most recent Doing Business 2017 report shows Ireland is now ranked 18th out of 190 countries, but down one place since last year&rsquo;s report.<br\/><br\/>The concern of the council is that our significant improvement in competitiveness is largely the result of a cyclical cost competitiveness adjustment, that is, the economic crash putting downward pressure on prices, and external factors beyond our control such as the low value of the euro, low interest rates and low energy prices.  The recovery was also helped by the record levels of investment in infrastructure in the run-up to the crisis.  This allowed an expansion of output after the crisis without a consequent increase in prices or shortages.  However, we are now seeing significant price pressures and hidden inflation in the economy.<br\/><br\/>At the same time, the economy now faces a significant threat from other external factors beyond our control, including Brexit, a potential shift in economic policy in the US, and the uncertain nature of the political economy of the EU.  This makes it crucial that we address those factors within our control, these being maintaining cost competitiveness and investing in supporting infrastructure and talent.  The decisions made today will determine the competitiveness of the economy in the future.<br\/><br\/>Importantly, these factors also determine the quality of people&rsquo;s lives.  Overall living standards, wages, housing, transport options to and from work, leisure time and access to social protection, education and health care are all dependent on how competitive we are in international trade.  As such, a message of sustainable recovery is at the heart of the competitiveness challenge report we published in December.  We must rigorously pursue cost competitiveness, address barriers to investment and growth, drive productivity performance and be responsive to the competitiveness challenges and opportunities that are emerging.  The challenges posed by Brexit provide additional motivation to pursue cost competitiveness across a range of business inputs, including legal, property and insurance where costs continue to be a concern.  It brings into sharp focus Infrastructure bottlenecks and skills mismatches, which have also become more acute, while issues such as increasing industrial unrest are emerging as threats.<br\/><br\/>The report covers a lot of ground but I will refer to five key areas.<\/p><p>In regard to public finances, efforts to bring fiscal stability and improved performance have been exceptional.  It is important to ensure our fiscal position remains sustainable in the face of an uncertain international trading and investment environment.  The council is of the view that we should avoid any narrowing of the tax base which might leave us exposed in the future and we must ensure the tax system supports and rewards employment and work.  Second, housing affordability has a direct and significant effect on the competitiveness of the economy.  The solution is clearly on the supply side.  We welcome the Rebuilding Ireland plan but believe that it will take time to implement and to effect change.<\/p><p> Research suggests the single greatest factor that explains differences in prosperity between countries are the demographics and skills of the population.  With increasing corporation tax competition, skilled labour must now be the key emphasis for retaining and winning foreign direct investment and the growth of a cohort of internationally trading indigenous companies.  Failure to tackle the under-resourcing of higher education is placing Ireland at a considerable disadvantage internationally and will have a significant medium-term impact on competitiveness and productivity in the economy. We would urge follow-through on the recommendations of increased State funding alongside income contingent loans.<\/p><p> Delivering world class water and waste-water infrastructure is a long-term project, but it is a project that must commence today.  The Council supports a funding model that delivers an adequate and reliable funding stream for public water services, is consistent with the user pays principle, protects vulnerable citizens and rewards conservation.<\/p><p> Finally, our medium-term competitiveness is being affected by the restrictions on capital investment.  Our past investment in capital was a crucial ingredient to our rapid recovery, and we support any Government and Oireachtas efforts to have the restrictions on capital investment eased.  We encourage that the fiscal space remaining goes towards investing in the future productive capacity of the economy.<\/p><p> This is just a brief summary of the council&rsquo;s views.<\/p><p> In closing my statement, I would like to say that we appreciate policy-making and legislation are being carried out in very difficult and uncertain times.  Following years of fiscal retrenchment, and a general reduction in living standards, it is understandable that people wish to see a degree of payback from all of the sacrifices made.  We understand that this makes Government and Oireachtas decision making extremely challenging but crucial to Ireland&rsquo;s future prospects.  In the pursuit of equity within this generation we must also consider equity between the generations.  We need to ensure that, in efforts to satisfy short-term demands, we must also work to secure the prospects of future generations.<\/p><p> I would like to express the gratitude of the council for affording us the opportunity to meet the committee today and I am happy to answer, as best as I can, any questions members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Peter Clinch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Clinch.

Does Professor Clinch think that we are doing enough first as a country, by which I mean the Government, but second in terms of business and unions, in facing up to how big a challenge it is?  Are we sleepwalking as a nation into it, hoping that it will be all right on the night?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#C00300","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487088000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Brexit is obviously one of the major challenges that we are facing but it is not the only challenge.  It is important to say that there are developments at EU level and also in the US that are also critical, so perhaps those items may be considered together in how we respond to what are general broad international challenges.  In recent years we have been performing very well relative to the UK in our international partners.  One of the key issues are the short-term and long-term implications that it has across a range of areas, including trade and investment, the labour market, energy as well as a many of these sectoral competitiveness impacts.  Clearly where the biggest threats arise are in the agrifood, financial and tourism sectors, which are very employment intensive sectors.  That is a big concern as well as political concerns around the border.  Bord Bia's report that &euro;570 million was lost in the value of food exports last year is an immediate example of what uncertainty around Brexit does but also reflects the change in the exchange rates.<\/p> <p>  Probably what is best to look at is how do we compare with the UK in terms of competitiveness.  The Competitiveness Council is undertaking an exercise to do that and I will give the committee some broad indicators.  In comparison with the UK, we have a similar performance in the rankings with respect to the quality of our institutions, of government, the quality of higher education and training, the efficiency of product markets, but relative to Ireland the UK has a very large market size and much higher rankings in terms of its macroeconomic environment.  Our infrastructure ranks poorly.  The UK is stronger in financial market developments, in labour market efficiency, technological development, innovation and business sophistication.  <\/p> <p>  One of the key things that we need to look at is labour market functioning.  As an example of the sorts of threats that we could have from Brexit, the UK scores much more highly on labour market efficiency.  What we would be concerned about is where the British Government moves in its policies that would increase the UK's competitiveness relative to Ireland.  Having said that, there are also potential advantages from Brexit, particularly in terms of financial services and increased foreign direct investment. The other area of particular concern is taxation.  The Competitiveness Council is essentially doing an exercise examining these comparators with the UK.  To answer Deputy Calleary's question about how Ireland is responding to Brexit as a nation, it is quite obvious that a lot is going on in individual Departments.  Where we need to place greater emphasis is if it was a company facing into this particular difficulty, we would be examining, for example, where to place our expenditure in response to what is a structural shift in the market.  The medium review of our capital development plan is an opportunity to see whether we are placing our investments where they ought to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Peter Clinch"},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Reference was made to the capital development plan and also the national planning framework, and its review.  The council's report had a lot to say about capital investment and Professor Clinch also remarked that on the value of pre-crash capital investment towards assisting the recovery, our ability to repeat that particular investment is restrained because of fiscal rules.  It is very restrained in a way that it was not previously.  Apart from increasing taxation, what other ways would Professor Clinch see to address that?  The council has also highlighted that we need to do more about climate change, reducing and meeting our carbon reduction targets.  To link that in with the national planning framework, one of the points the council has highlighted is switching people to public transport in terms of higher density population locations, but that is not the way we do things.  I suppose we must come back to Professor Clinch's last remarks about the practical reality of governance.  We have a very disbursed regional structure.  The national planning framework is a chance to take the burden out of Dublin, where the economic growth of 40% of our economy, high rent, high infrastructure costs and start developing opportunities around it.  Should we link the capital plan review, the national planning framework and carbon reduction efforts together as well as making them all Brexit-proof?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#C00500","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487088000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>On infrastructure, it is important to say that the key determinate of our economic growth rate in the future is our productivity growth rate and the key lever that Government has is the public capital programme to boost that.  Investment is required in both hard infrastructure, but also soft infrastructure such as business supports, education and investing in our people.  At the moment, it is rather startling that our gross fixed capital formation is about 2% of GDP equivalent; it is 2.7% in the United Kingdom, as a comparison, and our capital investment is half of what Finland is investing.  Clearly, what we are investing is deficient relative to what our competitors are investing.  Everything else being equal, one would expect that to have a negative impact on our competitiveness in the future.  This is one of the challenges because for many of the indicators or determinants of competitiveness in five or ten years time it is about what we do today.  We saw that in the recovery where our capital investment was an aid to our recovery.  It is absolutely crucial, then, that we find ways to enhance our capital programme.<\/p><p>With regard to the fiscal rules, the key thing we will have to do, and which we urge Government to do, is articulate the case for a relaxation of the fiscal rules around capital spending at a European level.  There is a very big difference between current spending and capital spending.  Capital spending is an investment for a return.  With that in mind, what we have asked for in the review of the capital programme is that the case is made clear on having a methodology underpinning that capital programme, that is a strong cost benefit methodology to show where the investments can create the greatest return.  One of the issues around the capital review relates to the sorts of <i>ex ante<\/i>cost benefits; those things tend to happen on the individual projects that take place rather than on the overall programme.  In the review, there is an opportunity to revisit that and to revisit it in the light of the Deputy's first question on Brexit about whether there are areas where we need to create greater investment in order to head off some of the international challenges we are facing.  It is worth saying that in our competitiveness rankings, we rank very poorly on capital spend in the perception of those who answer the surveys, including a lot of business people.  In the WEF ranking, we rank fiftieth in terms of the perception of the quality of our capital, which is extremely poor.  We have a perception problem as well as a reality problem.  <br\/><br\/>To move on to the Deputy's second question, linking this to the national planning framework is essential.  There is no point in having a national planning framework if the capital spend does not match up to that.  That joined-up policy framework is crucial.  When the national planning framework is produced, we would expect to see that it maps to the capital programme and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  <br\/><br\/>I can make a number of points on the national planning framework.  It is a critical piece of economic policy infrastructure and should be seen as such.  I hope that when it appears, it is clearly grounded in economic realities and that there is an economic strategy document that would demonstrate through that its impact on the social fabric of the country as well.  It will be important that, unlike the national spatial strategy, it is grounded in that reality and is something that can actually be delivered.  It is not easy to change the spatial pattern of economic activity.  The Deputy referred to Dublin versus the rest of the country.  It would be unfortunate to go down that route and to see it as some sort of competition.  We are in a global competition-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Peter Clinch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I want to be clear that I do not see it as a competition.

The challenge there in terms of the population distribution is not something the council has a solution to.  With regard to climate change, clearly transport is one of the key areas that is very hard to change given the pattern of our population.<\/p> <p>  Returning to Dublin, we must be careful to ensure that Dublin remains competitive because we are in this international competition.  Dublin has infrastructural problems so we need to be careful about how we do our expenditure and that we do not neglect it.

It is the way I operate because I find it easier.  I will first deal with some of the five key areas Professor Clinch has highlighted.  He states in the first one that we need to ensure our fiscal position remains sustainable, which we would obviously all agree with.  He then goes on to say we should avoid any narrowing of the tax base.  The first thing we have to look at and acknowledge is that there is a carry-over from this year in terms of full-year effects of budget 2017.  I understand it is about &euro;500 million, which will narrow what is known as the fiscal space.  To increase the fiscal space, our only options are to increase revenue or cut spending.  When Professor Clinch says we should avoid any narrowing of the tax base, can he be more specific about what taxes he is referring to, given that in the last budget there was a cut to the universal social charge and a commitment to cut it even further over the next number of years?  On the shrinking fiscal space and the demands Professor Clinch has identified in housing and capital investment and so on, how will we meet those demands?  That is my first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#D00700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487088000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>On the issue of the narrowing of the tax base, we need to go back to why we needed to broaden it during the crisis.  The narrowing of the tax base was identified at the time as being one of the contributory factors towards a lack of sustainability of the public finances and the reason why universal social charge was introduced.  Our concern about the commitment to remove the universal social charge is having a sustainable tax base into the future.  The difficulty with removing the universal social charge is establishing where the funding will come from.  It is a challenge we are putting out.  We are saying if the Government is going to narrow the tax base, there are some risks, and we are asking where the alternative funding will come from.  It is the question we are asking rather than answering as a competitiveness council.  Having a competitive tax system is a crucial aspect of the competitiveness offering of Ireland.  At the moment, to give the committee a quick view on our tax base, we are still very competitive on corporate tax but we have increased competition in the corporate tax area, as we know without going into details, including the UK reducing its rate to 15%.  On our VAT regime, we are relatively competitive but there is a threat from the UK which is also part of our Brexit response, which Deputy Calleary has asked about.  We have very high rates of capital gains tax relative to others.  In Ireland in 2014, we had the third highest capital gains tax rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Peter Clinch"},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I will just come back to the question I asked because we have a responsibility to scrutinise budgetary policy.

Given that there are very low levels of capital investment in comparison with other European countries which is a problem in health and housing, but I would also imagine in roads, flood relief and those types of areas, if we do not get the flexibility that we need - and we can articulate those arguments but obviously we are at the mercy of those in Europe - should we make greater use of the flexibilities which we currently have?  Finally, there was no mention of public sector pay.  We do not have any provisions for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021.  How much of a challenge is that going to be in terms of the overall fiscal space and the need to deal with and manage expectations in unravelling and unwinding financial emergency measures in the public interest cuts?  I think the cost of that would be about &euro;1.4 billion. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#E00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487088000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>On the funding of capital expenditure and expenditure rules, the council's position has been that we are aware this is a very complex area.

I notice the council refers to GNI or national income specifically in a number of comparators that it has used.

When I became chair two years ago, I was keen that we placed a much stronger emphasis on productivity.  It was interesting that when we went looking for the data, it was actually quite hard to find the data at a sectoral level, for example, on productivity.  We have just recently produced a report working with the CSO and others and finally we are shedding some light on productivity across different sectors.  That is an advance.  In terms of productivity the story looks superficially great.  Many developed economies are in negative multi-factor productivity growth.  It is the big concern for policy makers internationally and some believe that large leading companies are getting well ahead of the follower companies.  It is something that we should be concerned about here because we see a big difference in productivity between the multinational sector and the rest of the economy.  Our robust productivity rates rely on quite narrow sectors and a narrow range of companies.  What is important is to grow productivity in those areas which have high employment intensity.  We see lower levels of productivity in areas such as retail, hospitality and construction, and those are the areas on which we need to focus.  We also tend to see that internationally traded companies are more productive and there is a learning effect of operating overseas.  We have also seen that our productivity growth rates have been boosted by the loss of jobs in areas that are lower productivity such as construction, which is an obvious one, and retail during the crisis.  We have to be careful when we look at the very nice figures that bring us to the top of the table of what is going on beneath that and also of the social consequences which are ignored.  <\/p> <p>  In productivity, the story is good, on the face of it, but we have to find ways of boosting productivity right across all business and the public service as well.  Public service productivity is also crucial to competitiveness.  That comes from things like the discussion we had over investment in infrastructure, investment in talent and skills, supporting and rewarding entrepreneurs, by which we mean the large numbers of people who employ two or three people in all sorts of jobs, not just high-tech or those types of areas.  We have also identified the need to improve what is called a fusion, which is getting all the know-how from leading companies over to companies right across the economy.  It is really important that the message of higher productivity rates hits those in all jobs, this is not just something for people in white coats and so on.  That allows us to answer this question which is that an economy does not have to be low wage to be competitive, it is about productivity growth rates.<\/p><p>If an economy can boost its productivity growth rate by even a small amount, it can skip a generation, in respect of the prosperity of its population.  The importance of productivity was demonstrated in the latter years of the Celtic tiger when we saw growth rates in the economy getting ahead of productivity growth rates.  This would suggest there is something wrong and there was something wrong.  Essentially we turned the clock back to 2001 or 2002, which was where our model stopped being sustainable.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Peter Clinch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Following up on my colleague's questions earlier, would Professor Clinch say that in housing and in health care services, we have rationed them relentlessly?

The knock-on effect of that is exceptional.  For firms, property is very high among those areas that are most important for the costs and competitiveness of the business.  Expensive commercial property affects the competitiveness of firms and that has a knock-on effect on what firms can pay their workers.

It is always important when thinking about innovation that one does not just think of a high-tech start-up, incubators or investment in research.  That is very important but it is also in people.  What we have argued for in this battle for talent is a sustainable funding model for the higher education sector.  In spite of their inadequacies, the rankings demonstrate what is going on.  To a large extent the fall in rankings is because of the fall in the ratio of students to staff in the institutions.  We have looked for a model that encourages participation in order that people are able to access education without, perhaps, the financial assistance of their family.  We do not favour the option of all the burden falling on the student.  As we also recognise the multiple demands on State funding, we did not think that the required funding would be available as a State subvention.  As there is evidence to suggest that those who have received higher education receive benefits beyond what the State accrues, we favour a balance of State funding and income-contingent loans that are available to people from all backgrounds.  We do not get into any more detail other than that because there has been an expert group that has examined this and has made recommendations and we would rely upon its expertise.

The committee has had discussions with a number of witnesses on third level funding and education in general.  There has been some agreement, albeit not unanimous agreement, among members about both attendance rates and the fact that so many Irish students go on to third level and the appropriateness of some of the courses they pursue at third level for their future economic prospects and careers.  There has been great emphasis among parents, correctly and understandably, on their children receiving an education or an opportunity they may not have received themselves.  However, that might not necessarily correspond with the best practice in other European countries that have high-wage economies, are successful from a competitiveness point of view but do not have as high a proportion of their school leavers going on to third level.  Perhaps such countries have more young people doing apprenticeships.  There is an attempt now to reinvigorate and launch apprenticeships in Ireland but they had largely disappeared as an option for many students for a long time in this economy.

This year, reflecting on two of the challenges in the competitiveness scorecard we produced, we focused on the higher education system.  I suppose we would suggest our recommendations this year should not be read in isolation of the ones last year that dealt more with the issue of apprenticeships.  In January 2017 we had the launch of the Government's plan to expand apprenticeships and traineeship in Ireland and consequently we have an aim to achieve 50,000 apprenticeships by 2020.  There is a key commitment in the Action Plan for Education to implement that, which we would encourage.  We agree with the Chair on the importance of providing suitable education for all people and all types of career opportunities and not to have a focus on one part of the education system over another.  When it comes to funding, it always is a challenge that this sometimes is perceived to be the case, that is, that primary education is the most important or that secondary or higher education are so perceived.  It really is a system and if competitiveness is to be delivered at the end of that system, it is crucial that all parts are properly funded and properly resourced.  That whole education and training sector is our key lever now that there is increased tax competition.  The things that will make sure that Ireland remains competitive are getting costs down and making sure we make the investments in infrastructure and in people.

There is no sense or meaning to it.<\/p><p>I do not see anybody speaking out about this on a constant basis.  If one can borrow money at 1% or 2% and in doing so one can make 10% or 12% it does not make sense.

That leads on to what we should be doing and Professor Clinch has touched on that.  We have an opportunity here, especially with Brexit coming down the line.  It is like a disease that is going to come upon us.  It is a fact that we are going to be interfered with in terms of what we can or cannot do.  I touched on this earlier.  We need to connect with other parts of the country.  I can drive to Galway in two hours now and I can be in Cork in just over two hours or two and a half hours.  I remember working in Cork back in the 1960s when it took four and a half hours.  This whole thing seems to be madness.<\/p><p> In the area I represent house prices are going up at the rate of 20% to 30%.  The whole thing is so imbalanced.  There needs to be proper capital investment to enable people travel in a reasonable amount of time to different parts of the country where they could live in peace and comfort.

I am asking Professor Clinch's view on this to see if I am talking nonsense.  <\/p><p> I also hear cries for retaining the USC but the USC was brought in as an emergency measure and there was no basis to it in the tax system.  It is now a sort of a mortal sin to talk about reducing it or eliminating it, there is no sense nor meaning to it.  A taxation system should be based on a proper footing and it should not become a means of people satisfying their conscience by trying to avoid taxes by as much as they can.<\/p><p> This leads me on to another fact of life.  People, and the best of luck to them, are now setting up their own businesses, especially in the trades area. If one gets a plumber into the house, or a carpenter or an electrician or a general handyman, most of the reward given to the person doing the work is by cash.  I doubt very much whether we are getting proper returns compared with the PAYE payer.  There is a huge gap between the disposable income of people who are earning what are regarded as high salaries and those who are earning money doing work in a situation where it is very easy to avoid our taxation system.

It strikes me that the opportunity is there in the review of the capital programme to grasp that nettle, but it is a complex area.  There is a logic around the fiscal rules on current spending and there is a logic around the fiscal rules for capital spending, but the logic around capital spending is that there will be a return on it, that it will not be wasted expenditure that has to be continually repeated.  The evidence is there about what capital spending can do, the evidence is there that we do not measure up in terms of capital spending to those economies that we are trying to compete with.  The evidence is also there that capital spending will hamper our productivity rate which in turn will hamper our economic growth rate which in turn will hamper our ability to pay for current spending for valued public services.

That is the only way that the net can be broadened while at the same time avoiding allowing certain individuals to effectively continue making false returns.

We also have to note how heavily we rely upon oil and that 76% of those oil imports come from the UK.  That shows one possible implication of Brexit.  In electricity generation, 46% comes from gas and 96% of our gas is imported from the UK.  These are rather dramatic figures when we think what implications Brexit might have for the single energy market.  Fortunately, it appears that energy generally has been exempt from border taxes and tariffs in terms of trading, but it would be important that the Government has that close to the top of its list in terms of its advocacy around Brexit negotiations.  It is important to ensure the UK and the European Commission also have it close to the top of their lists to ensure we retain the Single Market and it does not somehow get caught up in heated negotiations as something that is worthy of negotiation.  The optimal functioning of the integrated all-island energy market is crucial, but if there were to be a threat to that, we would have to examine interconnectors into continental Europe, which is a very expensive challenge but is something that is an obvious implication if there were to be a problem.<\/p> <p>  In terms of matching the electricity supply and demand by locations, there is a link to infrastructure which is ensuring that, in our National Planning Framework, for example, we take advantage of where there are areas with an excess supply of electricity compared with other areas.  In terms of improving supports for electricity generation, the potential for generating electricity at a micro level or in a person's own home, feeding that back into the grid and the relationship with electric cars, there is a challenge there in that we have not been meeting our targets for electric cars.<\/p> <p>  What is important from a competitiveness point of view is that we deliver that infrastructure at the least cost.  The council is very pleased to see that competitiveness is highlighted alongside security of supply and other issues in the energy White Paper.  A big job of the council is to make sure competitiveness gets considered in all these policy areas.

Perhaps this is an area where it can practically come into play.  I have two brief questions.  I read an IMF report recently in which it became clear that of the countries that had been studied, up to 90% of their capital funding was secured from private sources.  In Ireland we do not come near even 10% but we have this traditional perception that capital funding must always come directly from the State to provide a road or whatever.  Are there ways and means in which we can try to lever more money out of the private sector into capital investment projects?  We have done it in bundles of schools and things like that, which has been successful to a degree and things have changed from a position a few years ago where there was virtually none from the private sector.  Can we do more and is there an interim measure that could help to bridge the gap before the change in the fiscal rules?  The change in the fiscal rules will require a treaty change and we are familiar that such things do not happen that easily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017021400002#J00300","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1487088000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Were it not for Tom Roche, we would not have had a bridge across the Liffey.

It has been a fantastic environment in which to leverage private funding and it is very obvious anecdotally that there has been a lot of funding trying to find opportunities to be deployed within Ireland.  The issue returns to the question of the fiscal rules and public capital, that generally these things have to be matched.  If we do not have matching funding, we will not be able to leverage as much of the private funding.  That has to be part of the picture of the case that is made on why we should be seeking a relaxation of those rules.  Once again, we need to be careful.

When one measures flow to a house, one can use that information for a variety of purposes.  The decision to meter in Ireland was obviously a Government decision with the intention of supporting user-based charges to begin with.  In the meantime, we have focused on the other benefits from using meters in terms of supporting the operation of our business.  An awful lot of the information points to the fact that a relatively small amount of households use a huge amount of water.  For example, we now know that 1% of households use over 20% of all of the water supplied to households.  We also know that 5% of households use a third of the water supplied to households.  Due to having a leak alarm on individual meters, we also know that about 7% of houses have continuous night flows that are very indicative of leaks.  We have been able to target the proportion of leakage that is on the household side more directly through the first fix scheme.  To date, we have achieved considerable success in terms of saving water on that front.<\/p> <p>  District meters are a completely different piece of the infrastructure.  They are designed to determine the amount of water supplied to a region or area.  In rural areas one might have 50 premises on a district meter because of the length of pipes.  In towns and cities it tends to be more like 1,000 to 1,500 premises.  The Republic of Ireland has 4,407 district meters compared with 3,072 in Scotland.  Therefore, we are very well covered in terms of district metering.  In 2014, our problem was that about 50% of the district meter infrastructure was not working as it had not been maintained over the previous four or five years.  We have got a lot of the problem sorted out.  We are installing a leakage management system that will provide headquarters with live data from all of the meters, thus allowing us to plan our district meter programme.  <\/p> <p>  In broad terms, we distribute 1.7 billion litres of water every day with roughly 600 million litres ending up with households, roughly 300 million litres ending up in non-domestic operation and other uses and about 765 million litres or 45% is lost in leakage on the public side.<\/p><p>The big issue with leakage is undoubtedly on the public side.  That is where the district meters are crucial and it is where the sustained effort over the next ten to 20 years will be required to bring it down to the levels other countries have achieved.  On the domestic side, approximately 170 million litres of the 600 million litres appear to be leakage, based on what the district meters are telling us.  That is the distinction between those two.<\/p><p> In terms of what is excessive usage, the guide or the information I can provide to the committee comes back to the fact that approximately 7% of households typically on a read - in other words, approximately 55,000 of a typical 800,000 reads in a quarter - show the leak alarm.  The statistics show that 5% are using one third of all the water.  Clearly, there is very significant usage at the top end of the usage curve.<\/p><p> On the question about conservation and driving behaviour, that information is telling us that the fundamental gain is around stopping the leakage and encouraging or helping households to fix leaks.  The gains that will be made by means of behavioural change in terms of basic consumption are much lower than that, because when we exclude the 7% that are currently showing leaks the other 93% are only using approximately 110 litres per person, which is very comparable with the northern European figures.  We are not in a bad place where the vast majority of people are concerned.  Conservation is very much about the houses that have leaks, whether inside the house or under the driveway or garden.<\/p><p> In the context of apartment blocks, the most logical and straightforward thing to do would be to have a bulk meter and use some type of aggregate allowance.  It is extremely difficult to meter individual apartments.  There are some that are constructed in such a way that one could do it, but the vast majority are very difficult and we do not see it being a feasible option anytime soon.  Bulk metering certainly would work and that would also catch water that might be used around the site.<\/p><p> Those are the main points I wish to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487073600,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I will add to some of those points.

One will always look to data to give the evidence that would support decision-making.<\/p> <p>  On the final question about whether metering would be a good idea, at ground zero, I cannot give a definitive answer but I can offer a few observations.  First, 12 out of 20 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, countries use metering for water charging, so it is common.  Certainly, metering is the norm in our experience of utility regulation when it comes to charging for a utility, bearing in mind that we regulate both energy and water.

What is clear is that if one knows there is leakage in domestic houses by virtue of the meters, we can target it and it is probably the cheapest water to recover.  Such domestic repairs, even the first-fix repairs funded by Irish Water, are relatively cost effective.  Ultimately, none of that takes away from the fact that we have to do a massive amount of work on our public water network, in terms of finding and fixing leaks, replacing pipes, installing pressure management systems and all of the other elements that go into that network.  In that sense, one is not an option compared with the other.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the economics of installing meters, that is not a question that Irish Water has addressed because the decision to install the phase one meters was a Government one made in the context of user-based charges.  That said, we have tried to put some estimate on the long-term benefit of metering in terms of economic return.  If we take a 40 year return period, for example, and look at the savings in water - assuming that out of the current level of household leakage of approximately 165 to 170 million litres, at least 70% to 80% of that can be saved consistently and retained over time - then we see that there is a long-term benefit in terms of both capital deferred and the marginal cost of producing water.<\/p><p>About one third to a half of household water lost through leakage goes down the sewer.  Very little of the water lost through external leakage goes into a sewer but usually into the ground.  If one takes this into account, as well as the deferred capital, whether it would fully justify the cost over a 40 year period is marginal, but it is getting there and that is without considering the environmental benefits and so on.<\/p><p> What members heard from representatives of Scottish Water and Welsh Water during the meeting last week was that, in the absence of a Government policy decision on user based charges, the decision to meter water usage was not a priority for them.  Welsh Water clearly sees metering as a very attractive option.  That is primarily driven by users who want to have their low usage recorded and pay for water on that basis.  Their figures suggest the high users are not captured in metering.  That is why it is operating on the basis that the householder will come forward and request that a meter be installed.  Up to about 50% of households have had meters installed.  <\/p><p> It is fundamentally a policy matter.  I am identifying for members all of the benefits that flow from having a meter in terms of the way we can manage water supply, account for water usage, target local leakages and understand the level of leakages from the public system.  One of the great fallacies prior to metering was that the domestic consumer was using about 145 litres per person.  We now know that is not right.  We know that if we exclude the top 7% of households, usage is about 110 litres per person.  That has forced us to re-evaluate the level of leakages from the public system because we were understating them and assuming more was being lost from households.  Whether that is the case in Scotland, I am not sure, but it would be hard to understand a person in Scotland using 20% more water than a person in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I want to revert to the experience in Scotland and Wales with water meters.

This clearly is at odds with a previous statement issued by Irish Water.  We also learned last week that only half of Welsh Water customers were metered but that this had resulted in a 40% reduction in leakages.  Much of the evidence provided by the two companies illustrates that individual meters are not required to reduce water leakages and promote conservation.  Has Irish Water or the regulator assessed the use of district metering as the best mechanism to reduce leakage levels?

The decision to install domestic meters in Ireland in advance of and as part of the process of bringing in user based charges for water was political.  The authorities in Scotland have not gone down that road.  There is a charging system which involves a flat charge.  Like all of the English water companies, Welsh Water had a flat charging system, or a system related to the rateable valuation.  However, all of the companies in England and Wales have gradually started to encourage metering.  In Wales the level of household metering of water usage is up to 50%, while Anglian Water is metering the water usage of 80% of its customers, as water is seen as a very critical resource.  The water companies are introducing metering on an opportunistic basis for new builds or where they are rehabilitating water mains and so on.  Let me repeat that there are significant benefits.  <\/p> <p>  In an urban area the district meter typically meters water usage in 1,000 to 1,500 properties or premises.  It tells exactly how much water is going into the district.  If one knows the level of domestic and non-domestic consumption, one can calculate with a reasonable degree of accuracy the likely leakages from the public system.  If one sends out crews with acoustic devices during the day - it is more efficient to do so at night time - they can find leaks in the public system and also evidence of high flows through a stop cock to a premises.  One can follow up with a waste notice process, as I outlined to Deputy Paul Murphy, or one could apply an excess charge.  Currently, where they show up on our meters, we write to the customers concerned.<\/p><p>The district meter facilitates the leakage programme.  The idea that a substantial part of one's operating resources should be diverted to chase household leaks does not make sense if there are domestic meters.  With ten to 12 readers, in any one quarter we can read 800,000 to 900,000 meters and find 50,000 to 60,000 leaks on premises.  Nothing like that number could be found if we were using operational crews.  We would be lucky to find a number in the hundreds.  Crews would be diverted away from the very job we would wish them to do, which is to find leaks in the public system.  The two are complementary.  It is not a competition between district and domestic metering.  <\/p><p> District metering is an imperative for us.  Ireland has already invested a lot of money in it.  The greater Dublin area was metered in the 1990s.  I do not know the exact amount of money that was invested, but it was in the tens of millions of euro.  About &euro;130 million was invested in district meters across the country between 2000 and 2010.  We now have a substantial infrastructure of district meters, more in fact, per premises, than in Scotland.  Irish Water has been bringing them up to scratch because about 50% were not working.  A lot of the valves had been breached and we installed a lot of pressure valves.  In the past two years we have spent tens of millions of euro in revamping the infrastructure to make it ready and fit for use.  We have also installed a pressure management system and this year will install a national leakage management system to collect all of the information.  Our primary focus is on identifying leakages in the public system.  I am comparing that with what can be done if there are also 900,000 domestic meters which also help to find a lot of leakages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Mr. Grant said at the start of his answer that the provision of meters was a political decision.

From independent surveys, the result seems to be that Scottish Water consumers are paying some of the highest water charges in Europe.<\/p><p>My understanding is the delivery of cost savings to customers, particularly those who want to be able to avail of cheaper water costs through water conservation, is a direct benefit of having a meter.  Scottish Water is a fascinating case because the decision that was made backfired when Scottish consumers started to face increased costs.  I understand the primary driver behind the provision by Welsh Water of individual meters for its customers - obviously, it is highly in favour of meters and has clearly advocated in favour of such provision - is the need to enable them to monitor their water consumption and achieve lower water bills through such monitoring and to provide for a much more efficient system of billing.  I wonder if this fits with Irish Water's experience in Ireland.  I think it is fair to say it is probably one of the main things we would like to achieve in Ireland in the use of meters.<\/p><p> I would like to refer to some other issues.  Mr. Grant has indicated that approximately 28,000 leaks have been repaired.  Under the completely archaic and dysfunctional system that previously applied in Ireland, if a massive complaint was made by neighbours who came across a leak, the relevant local authority would eventually have tried to stop the leak through a substantial and lengthy process using various legal channels.  This resulted in the leak continuing for a substantial period.  How would Mr. Grant characterise Irish Water's ability to repair a domestic leak for a customer, thereby delivering savings to him or her, from the point of detection to repair?<\/p><p> We heard testimony about a magical system involving a district meter that could be used in Ireland to detect a leak and link it definitively with an individual house in order that it could be repaired.  I take it from the answer given by Mr. Grant that not only would it be cumbersome to have to send out staff to define the nature of the problem on a one-on-one basis but also that it would be quite difficult for such a system to detect a smaller leak.  Will he indicate on a cost basis how much more expensive such a leak detecting system would be?  How efficient does he think it might be for an individual household?  Would the use of such a system be possible in Dublin, where large numbers of houses are connected to district meters?  As he indicated, this is not the norm in other parts of the country.<\/p><p> I would like to mention a final issue on which I am seeking an update.  I understand the introduction in this country of metering with an allowance initially resulted in a reduction in water usage.  The reduction that was noted when this system was first announced evaporated, in effect, as the charging system changed.  Is my understanding correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#G00900","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487073600,"counter":109,"content":"<p>The Deputy has compared the very different policy positions taken in Scotland and Wales.  Meters are not provided for free in Scotland.  When householders assess the charges imposed on them in the context of the potential savings in their bills, they can see that it is not economical for them to install meters at their own expense.  That is the Scottish scenario.  On the other hand, meters are provided for free in Wales on an opt-in basis.  Interestingly enough, the authorities in Wales are willing to do repairs on the customer side every two years or so.  This is akin to the first-fix scheme here.  I suppose this demonstrates that by providing information on leakages and taking a proactive approach to the customer, we can help the customer to identify where the leak is and fix it if it is under the driveway.  This is of benefit to the customer and the company in terms of conservation.<\/p> <p>  The 28,000 repairs mentioned by Deputy Colm Brophy were undertaken as a direct result of the identification through the use of meters of between 50,000 and 60,000 leaks on household properties.  We have approximately 50,000 people engaged in that process.  It is reasonable to assume that we will continue to gain big benefits from this activity.  It is interesting that a leak under a driveway leads, on average, to the loss of approximately 6 tonnes of water per day, which is an enormous amount of water and the equivalent of the figure for 20 houses.  It reflects the fact that a reasonably significant leak - it does not need to be a major leak - results in the waste of a lot of water over a 24-hour period.  This is where the bigger picture is lost in much of the discussion about conservation.  We absolutely encourage the use of water-saving devices in the home.  The use of water-saving showers and the employment of rainwater harvesting facilities are good and will result in marginal reductions in water consumption based on standard usage but leaks ultimately dwarf everything else.  It is really important to be able to fix leaks and encourage people to do so.<\/p><p>In terms of the powers that exist without the meter, there are clearly legal provisions but they are cumbersome like most legal processes.  Their implementation takes an awful lot of resources in terms of following them up, the possibility of appeal to courts by the householder and so on.  The provisions in the legislation ultimately provide for a restriction on supply, which was quite a topical matter.  It is certainly not something we have done.  It has been done by local authorities as a means of trying to help the neighbour who does not have a supply where the householder took no action.  None of that makes sense if there are options of helping the customer directly to fix the leak or at least finding the leak for them and enabling them to do so.  <\/p><p> Going back to the question of the district meter finding leaks, the district meter tells us what water is flowing into an area.  That area could have 500 houses but in a town or city it more typically has 1,000 or so.  If we sends crews around at night time, we will find leaks on household properties but that is obviously time consuming.  I am contrasting that with the fact that in any quarter, over a two-month period, ten people can read 900,000 meters.  That gives us an awful lot of information, not just leakage information but also usage information and information we can use for management purposes.  Once we have the meters, using them makes complete sense from an operational point of view and the benefits of that are obvious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Deputy Casey is next and Deputy Pringle is after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#J00200","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":112,"content":"<p>To further expand on the issue of the district metering, Mr. Grant said there are over 4,400 district meters in Ireland.

I would not necessarily claim that 70 megalitres being saved in leakage reduction is sustainable at the level of 70 megalitres because leakage is a bit like washing up in that one has to do it all the time.  Part of the difficulty with leakage up to now is we have hit on it sporadically but we have not sustained the effort.  That is the real challenge and that is an important point to make.<\/p> <p>  On the question of excessive usage and of unmetered premises, that is certainly a difficulty.  They fall into the category of premises that have to be dealt with through an operational process.  We will from time to time find premises that are unmetered that have high usage and there are a number of options that can be taken.  If it can be metered, a meter can be installed and that will bring the premises into the loop but sometimes it cannot be metered.  Very often it is a complex or a shared service situation, of which we have many throughout the country, both with respect to accessing the backyard and some newer developments where mews buildings and so on have been tied on to one another.  The metering programme has identified many of those anomalies.  There is an issue around equity and there is no easy solution to it.  In the case of apartment blocks, an aggregate allowance could be allocated for the block and the management company could be billed for that.<\/p> <p>  As far as billing and getting paid are concerned, that is part of the decision making process to be arrived at by the Oireachtas.  Clearly, having the means to effectively collect money is crucial.  If, for example, we took the 90 percentile figure and 10% were identified as the cohort above the allowance, there would have to be a process whereby they would be notified and given either one quarter or several quarters to respond to it.  Based on the first-fix scheme, there is reasonable evidence that a reasonable number would respond to that.  It is difficult to say what the final number billed would be but we can surmise that quite a few would take action on foot of a potential liability.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Grant"},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Would the regulator like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#L00500","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1487073600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I would concur that clearly there is an equity issue if some people have meters and are subject to an excess charge and those without meters would not be subject to it.

However, in the meantime there were a number of options that could be pursued, to some of which Mr. Jerry Grant has alluded, such as bulk metering for multi-unit developments or, for example, a requirement for all new builds to have meters installed.  There was also the idea that we might have an opt-in scheme where there could be a form of rebate on a notional charge that the Government was paying on the household's behalf.

We are learning a good deal here today, including, essentially, that meters, whether they are district or household, are not only in place for charging but for capturing critical data and identifying leaks, as well as to benefit water conservation behaviour.<\/p> <p>  Some of the questions I intended to ask have already been answered, so I will not go over them again.  From listening to public debate on this issue up to now, one would get the impression that there was no district metering but I am glad it has been put on the record that substantial district metering is already in place.  It is disappointing that there is still more than 45% leakage from the system even with that in place.  Is metering required specifically on connections to drive down a reduction in leakage around the country?  Has Irish Water a national monitoring and control system to identify leaks?  If it has, does that cover all networks in terms of alarms and all so on?  Did that exist prior to Irish Water being established or did local authorities do different things?  What has been Irish Water's experience where leaks have been identified on metered households?  What has been the response from householders?  Did they act on it and stop the leak or did they leave it continue?  I would be interested to get a response to that question.<\/p><p> In its recommendations the expert commission advised that, where possible, a charge for excessive use beyond normal usage be introduced.  The committee will require advice from the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, on this issue.  In the CER's view, how would this excess charge be implemented without meters?  That is a critical and fundamental question the committee needs to have answered.<\/p><p> With regard to value for money for the taxpayer and the cost per consumer for the provision of a public water supply, again the CER plays a critical role in protecting the consumer and ensuring moneys are invested wisely.  Irrespective of how it is paid for, whether it is through a charging system or general taxation, from what I have heard so far in today's debate is that metering benefits conservation, leakage identification and consumer behaviour.  Is there a value put on that from the CER's perspective?  If so, is there a provision or a recommendation that metering in the longer term would be more cost effective for the taxpayer because it would identify leaks and encourage conservation?<\/p><p> The CER stated earlier that where new houses are connected to the water supply, it would recommend a meter be installed.  As there is network renewal and replacement going on with main services, as well as lead pipe replacement, would it not be more cost efficient when installing new pipework to also install a meter?  It would save duplicate visits to a site and provide opportunities to capture data and more network details for management, as well as feeding into conservation behaviour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#L00800","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I will allow Deputy &Oacute; Broin in for a brief question.

The representative from Scottish Water said he did not recognise the figures.  When I checked it later, I found the average household charge for domestic water in Scotland is &euro;406 a year and it has one of the lowest average household charges of all northern European countries, in some cases by &euro;300 or &euro;400 a year.<\/p> <p>  We have to make decisions around the excess charge.  The more factual information we have on it the better.  Current usage according to Irish Water is 111 litres per person per day, when ones takes out the outliers.  Even with the outliers, it is 123 litres per person per day.  That is substantially below the OECD average.  What is the CER's view on that, particularly given the fact that many of those OECD countries already have metering and metered charges?  It is more than half the figure for the US or Canada and is significantly lower than many other OECD countries.<\/p> <p>  Has any modelling been done by the commission or by Irish Water on what an excess charge might look like, how many households it might apply to and on the revenue intake versus the cost of administering the charge?  The Department stated on the last day that it is not just about the money it brings in but also about changes in behaviour.  There are several longitudinal studies of the way in which meters do or do not affect water consumption behaviour.  Has the CER knowledge of that research?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Jerry Grant said that due to having a leak alarm on individual meters, 7% of houses have a leak while 5% are using a third of all water supplied to households.

That makes sense.<br\/><br\/>We are putting in place a national control system.  There were individual sub-county systems that differed a lot and not everyone had full telemetry on the district metering area.  Dublin had a relatively good system and we have taken that into Irish Water as the bulwark of our system.<br\/><br\/>In terms of acting on leaks, surprisingly it has taken three or four letters to get people to engage on the first fix.  We have 50,000 engaged at the moment out of almost 100,000 that we have notified.

On the core point of <i>per capita<\/i>usage and the comparison internationally, including all the high outliers leaves the figure in the 130s of litres, but omitting them gives about 125 litres as an average figure.  If all the 7% is distilled out, as it were, we are down to about 110, which is comparable with Denmark and Germany and countries like that.

An excess charge would be within the context of the circumstances being dealt with within the particular jurisdiction, for example, lifestyle may change consumption over time.  Therefore, whatever decisions are taken, they cannot stand forever.  Something like that would always be kept under review because lifestyle changes may change patterns of consumption.  That is always looked at within the context of national circumstances.<\/p> <p>  I agree that one of the options that could be looked at as well as new build is mains replacement, but as with any of these options, coming to the value for money piece, we would look at the evidence, where it exists, as to whether the particular investment was a sound one.  That would require gathering whatever evidence was available and conducting a cost-benefit analysis.  We would recommend that under any approach.<\/p> <p>  In terms of charging for excessive usage, the key point is that in the absence of a meter, one cannot charge for excessive usage if one cannot measure the consumption.  Therefore, the point that we have made is that in the absence of a full-scale metering roll-out, we should look at alternatives which would allow meters to be rolled out gradually.  We must look at each of those options and we have already been through many of those, such as mains replacement, new build, bulk metering of multi-unit developments, opt-in and other such initiatives.  A report carried out in 2009 in Great Britain, where charging was and is in place, found that there was an additional 15 litres per person, per day to be gleaned from a charging system based on metering.  There are benefits from metering in terms of usage but there are obviously leakage reductions to be achieved through other conservation measures as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FFJ2017021400002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1487073600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I call Senator Clifford-Lee, Deputy Heydon and Deputy Healy for three short questions.
