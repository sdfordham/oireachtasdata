This new arrangement will apply to members of the teacher unions which have signed up to the Lansdowne Road Agreement i.e. TUI and INTO.<\/p>  <p>  When other Lansdowne Road increases are also factored in, there will be a 15% increase in the starting pay of new entrant teachers between 31 August 2016 and 1 January 2018 (from &euro;31,009 to &euro;35,602).\u00a0 For an individual TUI\/INTO member who started teaching in September 2015, they will see a 22% increase in their pay (including increment) between 31 August 2016 and 1 January 2018 (from &euro;31,009 to &euro;37,723).<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, it must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated cost would be between &euro;65 and &euro;70 million per annum.\u00a0 Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  The agreement on new entrant pay shows what is possible through dialogue and negotiation within the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  The Government is wholly committed to the implementation of the Lansdowne Road Agreement as the most appropriate way for progress to be made on pay restoration and reform of our public services into the future.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has committed to establishing a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300055#WRC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300055#WRC00600"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[33087\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300055#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when an application for a new school (details supplied) will be approved; if the school is on his Department's building programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":135,"content":"<p>The school referred to by the Deputy has submitted an application to my Department for a new school building.

A new Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) has been developed to assist private property owners and local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to harness this potential, and bring these vacant houses into social housing use to provide homes for families on local authority waiting lists.<\/p><p>The new scheme was launched in Waterford and Carlow on a pilot basis in October, and depending on the take-up from private property owners, will be rolled out to further local authorities early in 2017.  The purpose of the pilot is to ensure that the scheme is workable from local authorities&rsquo; and AHBs&rsquo; perspectives. It is anticipated that other local authorities will come into the scheme on a rolling basis, with full roll-out expected within 6 months.  My Department is engaging with individual local authorities , including Louth County Council, in order to arrange a schedule for the roll-out of the new scheme nationally.<\/p><p>AHBs have a proven record in managing the refurbishment of properties and being good landlords puts them in an excellent position to play a key role in the success of the scheme. Several AHBs will be working together with Waterford and Carlow local authorities to manage the scheme in those particular areas.  As the scheme is rolled out in other local authority areas, more AHBs around the country will become involved with local authorities in the delivery of the scheme.<\/p><p>The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding required to bring them up to the standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met up-front by the local authority or the AHB.  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.<\/p><p>A property owner can either choose to arrange a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.  Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities and the local authority or AHB will have on-going management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties.<\/p><p>The local authority will determine the eligibility for the scheme having regard to the location and the suitability of the property for social housing and also taking into consideration the extent of the repairs that may be required.  The maximum costs of repairs allowable under this initiative will be &euro;40,000. <\/p><p>Early estimates are that at least 150 units will be secured in 2017 and up to 3,500 properties will be targeted over the next five years.

A new Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) has been developed to assist private property owners and local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to harness this potential, and bring these vacant houses into social housing use to provide homes for families on local authority waiting lists.<\/p><p>The new scheme has just been launched in Waterford and Carlow on a pilot basis, and depending on the take-up from private property owners, will be rolled out to further local authorities early in 2017.  The purpose of the pilot is to ensure that the scheme is workable from local authorities&rsquo; and AHBs&rsquo; perspectives. It is anticipated that other local authorities will come into the scheme on a rolling basis, with full roll-out expected within 6 months.<\/p><p>AHBs have a proven record in managing the refurbishment of properties and being good landlords puts them in an excellent position to play a key role in the success of the scheme.  Several AHBs will be working together with Waterford and Carlow local authorities to manage the scheme in those particular areas.  As the scheme is rolled out in other local authority areas, more AHBs around the country will become involved with local authorities in the delivery of the scheme.<\/p><p>The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding required to bring them up to the standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met up-front by the local authority or the AHB.  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.<\/p><p>A property owner can either choose to arrange a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.  Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities and the local authority or AHB will have ongoing management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties.<\/p><p>The local authority will determine the eligibility for the scheme having regard to the location and the suitability of the property for social housing and also taking into consideration the extent of the repairs that may be required. The maximum costs of repairs allowable under this initiative will be &euro;40,000. <\/p><p>Early estimates are that at least 150 units will be secured in 2017 and up to 3,500 properties will be targeted over the next five years. I have provided &euro;6 million in capital funding in 2017 for the cost of the repairs, and &euro;140 million over the lifetime of the <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>Action Plan. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300056#WRD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Development Contributions","counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300056#WRD02100"},{"type":"question","counter":222,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[33217\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300056#WRD02200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the levels of outstanding and unpaid development levies owed by developers to Fingal County Council for each of the years 2011 to 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":223,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[33218\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300056#WRD02300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the levels of outstanding and unpaid development levies owed by developers to Dublin City Council for each of the years 2011 to 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":224,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.<\/p><p>Development contributions allow local authorities to recoup some of the costs to public funds of servicing land for private development.  They provide a mechanism by which developers can contribute to the cost of providing public infrastructure and facilities that benefit development in the area and are expended on public infrastructure defined under the Planning Acts.  These include the provision of open spaces, recreational and community facilities, roads, some water services, public transport, schools, school sites, broadband and flood relief works.  The adoption of these schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority.  It is a matter for the members to determine (i) the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply and (ii) the expenditure of contributions within the confines of their scheme-conditions. <\/p><p>Arising from the Government&rsquo;s effort to meet commitments in relation to the general government deficit limit, the local government sector&rsquo;s impact on the General Government Balance (GGB) is currently required to deliver a neutral position each year.

However, within these overall limits, there is additional capacity for new non-mortgage borrowing and the expenditure of capital balances on hand by local authorities, which must be sanctioned by my Department.  In reviewing requests for sanction, consideration is given to ensuring that priority infrastructural investment can proceed; that contractual commitments and on-going projects can proceed; and that development contributions already collected and aligned to specific capital projects can be utilised efficiently.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Local authorities are obliged to include data on current and long-term development contribution debtors in their Annual Financial Statements.

Total bad debt provisions for all current debtors are reported within the notes to the Annual Financial Statements but do not separately identify the portion relating to current development contribution debtors.  Long term debtors are debts due in respect of periods greater than one year.  Long-term development contribution debtors are matched in the Annual Financial Statement by deferred income.  This acknowledges that the debts of long term debtors are not income in the current period, and are thus deferred to future periods and may or may not become due depending on the progress of individual developments.<\/p><p>It should be noted that local authorities operate on an accrual accounting basis and therefore recognise income as earned or billed and not just as cash received.

The means test also ensures that the amount of rent supplement payable is appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution that recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  The current weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;40 for coupled households.  Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs. <\/p>  <p>  The rent supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase.  Income from employment and family income supplement <\/p>  <p>  (FIS) in excess of the standard SWA weekly rate of payment attract an additional income disregard and are assessed as follows; the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes. <\/p>  <p>  Persons in receipt of the One-Parent Family or Jobseeker's Transitional payments are not excluded from receiving rent supplement, however restrictions do exist in respect of persons engaged in full-time education.

In addition to measures to tackle paramilitarism, criminality and organised crime through enhanced police and justice cooperation, the Agreement recognised that community engagement and support for change would be required.  This included a commitment to develop a strategy on disbanding paramilitary groups.<\/p>  <p>  Progress on implementing the provisions of the Fresh Start and Stormont House Agreements are considered at quarterly review meetings. These are attended by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the First and deputy First Ministers and, where relevant to her portfolio, the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice.  I represent the Government at these meetings.  The last review was held on 29 June 2016, with dates for the next meeting under active discussion. <\/p>  <p>  The June quarterly review meeting discussed the report of a three-person panel, established on foot of the Fresh Start Agreement to recommend the elements of a strategy for the disbandment of paramilitary groups. This panel, comprising Lord John Alderdice, Monica McWilliams, and John McBurney, made over forty recommendations.  The Northern Ireland Executive updated the review meeting on its then draft Action Plan to take these recommendations forward.   In July, the Northern Ireland Executive published its Action Plan on Tackling Paramilitary Activity, Criminality and Organised Crime. <\/p>  <p>  The Northern Ireland Executive is committed to carrying out research into the social costs and implications of paramilitarism; to undertake a public awareness campaign on the harms done by paramilitarism and organised crime; and to report on efforts to tackle paramilitarism which will be linked to wider cross-Departmental and statutory agency work programmes aimed at reducing community divisions and the causes of sectarianism.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Fresh Start Agreement, the UK Government committed to providing an additional &pound;25 million over five years to tackle continuing paramilitary activity, with the Northern Ireland Executive to match this amount.  I understand that the Northern Ireland Executive has already begun its drawdown towards implementation of the Action Plan and related commitments.<\/p>  <p>  On 13 September, I signed an international agreement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to establish the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC), which the Fresh Start Agreement states will report annually on the progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland. These reports will inform future Northern Ireland Executive Programme for Government commitments through to 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The Government will shortly bring forward legislative proposals before the Oireachtas to establish the IRC in law.

The individual case of Gao Zhisheng, a human rights defender detained for denouncing the persecution of practitioners of Falun Gong, was also raised at the dialogue.  Most recently, human rights issues were discussed at the 18th EU-China Summit which was held in Beijing on 12-13 July 2016.

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities. <\/p>  <p>  In June 2011, the Report &ldquo;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings&rdquo; was published by the Health Service Executive (HSE), which identified that in 2008 approximately 4000 individuals with disabilities lived in congregated type settings.  These are places where ten or more people reside in a single living unit or are campus based.  It found that, notwithstanding the commitment and initiative of dedicated staff and management, there were a significant number of people still experiencing institutional living conditions where they lacked basic privacy and dignity, and lived their lives apart from any community and family. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, 2725 people live in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings. <\/p>  <p>  St John of God Services in Kerry has been identified as one of the priority sites for de-congregation.  The HSE is committed to working with St John of God Services to transition 17 residents in ward style accommodation from the current unsuitable accommodation on campus to more appropriate settings in the local community.  Comprehensive transition plans will ensure that there is extensive engagement with the person themselves, their families, carers and advocates, as well as the service provider, to ensure successful and sustainable transitions into the community.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the existing residents will benefit from greater opportunities to participate in local communities and will, over time and with proper planning, move to living in the community.  It is important to point out that it is Government and HSE policy to move on from these congregated settings in the best interests of patients but this will be done in a planned and phased way and with due regard to the personal choices of every individual.  The welfare and dignity of residents is absolutely paramount, and the needs of the individual will be the first consideration.<\/p>  <p>  The focus of the HSE has been on enhancing the quality of life of residents and highlighting the residents who would most obviously benefit from the opportunity to move to community living.  In doing so, the HSE are recognising that for some individuals with significant disabilities, this move presents greater challenges and will not be considered for some time. <\/p>  <p>  The Chief Officer has arranged to meet in early November with St John of God management to ensure that communication and engagement with families is improved and that the appropriate discovery processes are in place in advance of plans for any individuals to move to community living, and with the family representatives group to ensure their concerns are being heard and that there is a process in place to work together with them and the service provider into the future in the best interests of the residents. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the appropriate level of engagement is now underway between St John of Gods and the HSE with the residents, their advocates, and their families.  It would be appropriate to allow this process to conclude before considering a visit to the Beaufort campus.<\/p>  <p>  As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on \"Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion\", I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300058#WRF04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":395,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300058#WRF05000"},{"type":"question","counter":396,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[33224\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300058#WRF05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence concerning a company (details supplied);

and <\/p>  <p>  -  Class 2 charges apply where 24-hour nursing care is not provided, subject to a current maximum of &euro;130 per week for a person whose income is &euro;194 or more. <\/p>  <p>  -  Affordability and the avoidance of financial hardship are built-in features of the charging provisions under the 2005 Act and Regulations: <\/p>  <p>  -  Firstly, the Act caps the amount which may be charged &ndash; at 80% of the non-contributory State Pension weekly rate.  At present, that means an upper limit of &euro;177.60 per week. <\/p>  <p>  -  Secondly, the charges are structured to ensure that those paying them retain a reasonable income for personal use: at least &euro;33 per week for those paying Class 1 rates and at least &euro;64 per week for those paying Class 2 rates. <\/p>  <p>  -  Thirdly, the Act provides that the HSE may reduce or waive a charge imposed on a person if necessary to avoid undue financial hardship. <\/p>  <p>  To assist in the fair application of the provisions of the 2005 Act and Regulations, the HSE has developed national guidelines for the determination of long-stay charges for inpatient services.  These include the need to have regard to the individual circumstances of each service user and his or her dependants.  The guidelines ensure that the applicable charge is determined taking account of each person&rsquo;s income and necessary outgoings while receiving care, including reasonable regular financial commitments.  This avoids any unfair burden on the service user or his or her dependants.<\/p>  <p>  As the issue raised by the Deputy relates to an individual case, this is a service matter for the Health Service Executive.

The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery.  As a result 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management were received.  It was very clear from this that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed.\u00a0 Taking account as far as possible of the views of stakeholders, a draft policy document was\u00a0 prepared and published\u00a0for consultation.\u00a0\u00a049 submissions were received, again often conflicting and a further meeting with \u00a0those who had made submissions was held in February 2012 regarding the draft policy, again there was no consensus.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Having considered\u00a0all views and having regard\u00a0to the sustainability of the fisheries,\u00a0the Minister came to a decision setting down a detailed policy, which\u00a0I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks.\u00a0 In order to provide for the needs of inshore herring fishers, which did not have the required track record\u00a0under the policy, smaller vessels under 20m in length have access to an open herring\u00a0 fishery in the North West of up to 5% of the Area 6A South adjusted quota.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Periodic allocations are made available for operators covered by these arrangements.

International best practice for the management of Atlantic Salmon requires the adoption of the precautionary approach and the cessation of indiscriminate mixed stock fisheries.\u00a0 Since 2007, the harvest of salmon, by commercial and recreational (angling) means, has been restricted to those stocks of rivers that are meeting their conservation limits. <\/p>  <p>  The individual river management strategy is based on the fact that each of Ireland&rsquo;s salmon rivers has its own unique stock of salmon which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn and create the next generation of fish exclusive to that river. Fisheries are only considered in rivers where the estimated returns are above the conservation limit for the river. <\/p>  <p>  The SSCS is a statutorily independent committee comprised of scientists from IFI, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (Northern Ireland), and other State bodies and third level institutions.\u00a0 The SSCS provides independent advice to IFI as regards the annual individual stock assessments for Ireland&rsquo;s wild salmon rivers.\u00a0 This independent scientific advice underpins the management decisions and advice of IFI as regards all aspects of the angling and commercial season for salmon on an individual river basis.<\/p>  <p>  The model and processes used by the SSCS are recognised internationally as best practice. Delegations from a number of countries have visited IFI and the SSCS to examine and seek to learn from the Irish approach to Salmon management.

The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map\u00a0should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to\u00a0<\/p><p>The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies to\u00a0roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State Intervention Area comprising\u00a0over 750,000 premises\u00a0including over\u00a050,000 premises in County Mayo, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland.  Since bidders were invited to participate in dialogue with the Department, there have been approximately 150 hours of meetings, with considerable more interaction to follow over the coming months.  In the course of this dialogue, the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. \u00a0Householders and businesses may potentially get speeds not just of 30Mbps but up to 1000 Mbps with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds.<\/p><p>Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given that discussions are ongoing in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century.\u00a0 <\/p><p>During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids. <\/p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and-or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300059#WRG03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Generation","counter":459,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300059#WRG03800"},{"type":"question","counter":460,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[33107\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300059#WRG03900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will intervene to ensure the future of a power plant (details supplied) is protected in view of an announcement by a company and the announcement indicates future closure of the plant in years to come; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":461,"content":"<p>At the outset I want to say that any loss of jobs and the impact on individuals, households and local communities is\u00a0 a source of real regret.<\/p>  <p>  Tarbert power station, like all such plants, has a physical and operational design life.

The re-opening of the Phoenix Park tunnel in the coming weeks for commuter services from the Kildare line to the stations between Connolly and Grand Canal Dock and the expansion of DART services to a ten minute frequency will also help to grow the business.<\/p>  <p>  While there has been much speculation regarding the future of individual rail lines,\u00a0I want to stress that no decisions will be taken on any of the options identified in the Review in advance of\u00a0the full process of public consultation.\u00a0 The public consultation will give the public and other interested parties the opportunity to see the analysis on rail funding and to contribute to all aspects of the debate on the future of rail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300060#WRH03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greenhouse Gas Emissions","counter":529,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300060#WRH03200"},{"type":"question","counter":530,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[33257\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300060#WRH03300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"in view of the fact that the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area plans an increase in carbon emissions, if he is of the view that the strategy is in line with Government commitments to decrease carbon emissions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1281","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":531,"content":"<p>\u200bI do not accept\u00a0the Deputy's\u00a0assertion about the GDA Transport Strategy's impact on carbon emissions.\u00a0 In fact the Strategy -\u00a0which was prepared by the National Transport Authority and approved by my predecessor earlier this year -\u00a0commits to promoting transport options that will reduce carbon emissions.<\/p>  <p>  Various policies related to climate change, carbon emissions and associated action plans were still under development at the time of preparation of the Strategy.\u00a0 The\u00a0Strategy explicitly recognises\u00a0that the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 includes provisions for the preparation of a \"national mitigation plan\" and a \"national adaptation framework\", which will establish energy related targets and actions to be adopted across the transport sector.\u00a0\u00a0The Strategy commits to incorporating relevant targets and actions arising from that Act and related policies in the area of transport energy within its statutory Integrated Implementation Plans.\u00a0 Incorporation of such relevant targets and actions may increase the current forecasted impact of the Strategy in terms of reducing carbon emissions.\u00a0 It is my view, therefore, that the GDA Transport Strategy is in line with Government commitments to decrease carbon emissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300060#WRH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Services","counter":532,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300060#WRH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":533,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[33258\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300060#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on increasing the subvention to the CI&Eacute; group; his views that an increase is needed to improve public transport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1281","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":534,"content":"<p>\u200bAs I discussed with the Deputy at a recent meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport I believe that increased subvention funding can assist in the delivery of improved public transport services<\/p><p>Budget 2017 has allocated an additional &euro;31 million to public transport services (PSO and rural transport) when compared with this year's allocation.<\/p><p>It is a statutory function of the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the Dublin Transport Act 2008 to decide upon the exact allocation to each operator.

By encouraging the development of new economic activities, Research, Development and Innovation policy-measures strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s competitive advantage and build potential new areas of economic activity.  The impacts of our investment in innovation and research include increased competitiveness, the creation and maintenance of high-value jobs and the attraction of foreign direct investment.<\/p><p>We know that investment in R&amp;amp;D translates into improved job creation and enterprise performance.  Firms that invested in R&amp;amp;D grew employment by 14% between 2000 and 2014 while those that did not invest in R&amp;amp;D saw employment decline by 40%.  Similarly, R&amp;amp;D performing companies grew exports by 181% between 2003 and 2014 compared to a loss of 42% in exports for non-R&amp;amp;D performing companies over the same period.<\/p><p>Innovation 2020 the Government&rsquo;s strategy for research and development, science and technology emphasises the importance of innovation and technology in driving productivity growth and fostering competitiveness in a global market place.  The strategy also calls attention to the role of innovation in contributing to employment, export and investment growth, as well as to the competitiveness of indigenous enterprise and in attracting and embedding Foreign Direct Investment in Ireland.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland (EI) plays a particularly important role in supporting job creation in Ireland. In 2015 EI helped in the maintenance and creation of 300,000 Irish jobs both directly and in-directly.  Support for innovation and technology played a crucial role in delivering this result. <\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland offers commercialisation and technology transfer supports directed at generating spinout companies, boosting entrepreneurship and increasing licensing into industry.  These supports include EI&rsquo;s Commercialisation Fund and Campus Incubators as well as the Technology Transfer Strengthening Initiative which is overseen by Knowledge Transfer Ireland.<\/p><p>In addition, Enterprise Ireland operates a range of supports to help companies engage with third level researchers to undertake collaborative research for the benefit of companies.  These collaborations are delivering impact and creating significant opportunities.  A direct correlation has been found between collaboration activities, increased entrepreneurship and quantifiable increases in job creation. <\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland supports collaboration activities through a number of its initiatives - innovation voucher schemes, innovation partnerships, Technology Centres and Technology Gateways.  In 2015 Enterprise Ireland supported 896 collaborative projects between business and Higher Education. <\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland has recently launched its Small Business Innovation Research Initiative (SBIR), a mechanism which enables public sector bodies to connect with innovative ideas and technologies, to provide novel solutions for specific public sector challenges and needs. SBIR is particularly suited to small and medium-sized business as contracts are of relatively low value and operate in short timescales.  <\/p><p><b><\/b>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s main objective is to encourage investment into Ireland by foreign-owned companies.  Investments approved by IDA Ireland in the first half of 2016 will lead to the creation of 9,100 jobs as companies roll out their plans over the coming months and years. This performance is on a par with the first half of 2015 which was one of Ireland&rsquo;s best years for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). <\/p><p>The area of research, development and innovation (RDI) is of strategic importance to IDA Ireland.  A company decision to invest in RDI may be to support improvement in productivity; to develop a strengthened reputation for quality or to develop new products and services.<\/p><p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy Winning FDI 2015-2019 outlines a plan to support clients in creating 80,000new jobs and increase employment in the client portfolio to 209,000 by 2019.  Support for RDI will be key to achieving these targets. Research, development and innovation investments not only embed existing FDI operations and employment but pave the way for future investment, job creation and export growth.  As the global battle for FDI intensifies, our investment in research and development will become even more critical to attracting and retaining FDI companies. <\/p><p>The increase in RDI investment since 2000 has improved our attractiveness as an FDI location. 60% (just under &euro;60m) of IDA&rsquo;s total grant-aid budget is allocated to RDI projects each year.  This investment leverages RDI expenditure of &euro;500m by IDA clients for these approved projects and an overall annual spend by MNCs of &euro;1.4bn per annum on RDI.  This has the effect of anchoring FDI clients and securing sustainable employment and related benefits to the Irish economy.<\/p><p>The National Support System for Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for research and innovation, is coordinated by Enterprise Ireland.  Horizon 2020 is part of the drive to create new growth and jobs in Europe, has a budget of almost &euro;75 billion and runs over the period 2014-2020.  Both Ireland&rsquo;s indigenous and FDI companies are active users of Horizon 2020.  Irish companies that compete successfully for funding from Horizon 2020 will boost their innovative capability and competitiveness which in turn will deliver strong national economic impacts, including job creation. <\/p><p>Demand for the Framework Programme from Irish companies has been high.  In the first 33 months Ireland's draw down was &euro;336.6 million, placing Ireland on target to meet its goal of securing &euro;1.25bn from Horizon 2020 by 2020.  Of this funding, over &euro;104 million went to companies and &euro;73.6 million of this went to SMEs.  Ireland has the highest success rate in Europe for the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument with a 16% success rate, compared to a European average of 6%. Innovative Irish SMEs have secured &euro;26.5 million.  Enterprise Ireland client companies account for 56% of all company funding with IDA Ireland clients securing 21%.<\/p><p>70% of the Horizon 2020 budget (&euro;52 billion) is to be allocated between 2017 and 2020, which gives Irish companies the opportunity to continue availing of these supports. <\/p><p>The recent national ex-post evaluation of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7) estimated that the European Commission contribution of &euro;625M to Ireland from 2007 to 2013 would lead to an estimated 2,000 jobs created per year.  It is expected that such figures will grow considerably in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s current target to double participation in the period 2014-2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300061#WRJ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobs Data","counter":567,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300061#WRJ00900"},{"type":"question","counter":568,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[33188\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110300061#WRJ01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the total number of new jobs created in the manufacturing sector in the past 12 months; her targets in this regard over the next year; the extent to which these jobs are likely to be spread throughout the country; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":569,"content":"<p>The Action Plan for Jobs is one of the Government&rsquo;s key instruments to support job creation.

Its principal function is, once each year, to examine the national minimum hourly rate of pay and to make a recommendation to the Minister respecting the rate, ensuring that all decisions are evidence based, fair and sustainable, and do not create significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission submitted its first report in July 2015. Its recommendation to increase the minimum wage from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.15 per hour was accepted by Government and the increase came into effect on 1 January last.<\/p>  <p>The Commission&rsquo;s second report was submitted to Government in July and the recommendation made by the Commission for an increase to &euro;9.25 per hour was approved by Government on 11 October.  I signed the Order on 13 October to effect the increase from 1 January next. <\/p>  <p>  The Living Wage concept is grounded in the idea that a person&rsquo;s wage should be sufficient to maintain a safe, decent standard of living.  At an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and thus the interaction of individual earnings with household income and State-provided supports such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement as well as supports available in relation to housing, education and health all contribute to an individual&rsquo;s standard of living. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated.  The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement. It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to reduce poverty levels by supporting an increase in the minimum wage to &euro;10.50 per hour over the next five years and rely on the annual recommendations of the Low Pay Commission on the level of adjustment each year.<\/p>  <p>  The independence of the Low Pay Commission is firmly established in the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015 (the Act).
