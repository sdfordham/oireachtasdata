Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for the NRA in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.<\/p><p>  Because of the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in roads expenditure over the past number of years and based on current figures there will be a further reduction\u00a0next year.\u00a0 In 2007 there were grants of &euro;2.375 billion available towards national, regional and local roads; these grants have fallen to &euro;719 million in 2013.

The reality is that the available funds do not match the amount of work which could be undertaken.\u00a0 For this reason it is not possible to progress a range of worthwhile projects and the main focus has to be on the maintenance and repair of roads and this will remain the position in the coming years.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  In relation to projects of the scale of the M20, it is not feasible given current and future projections that the State would be in a position to build this from its own resources.

I am concerned that large numbers of HGVs continue to use regional and local roads in order to avoid tolls, and are driving through towns, villages and rural areas with large populations.  This has safety implications for other road users, residents and pedestrians.\u00a0In addition\u00a0by using local and regional roads instead of custom-built motorways, HGVs are adding to the wear and tear of the legacy\u00a0roads network.  For this reason I\u00a0asked the National Roads Authority (NRA) to look at the feasibility of lifting tolls for heavy goods vehicles for one month on one or more motorways across the country, as a trial.<\/p><p>  Based on the feedback I have received I have decided to go ahead with the toll free month on a number of routes - the M1, M3, M6 and Limerick Tunnel.\u00a0 By trialling a toll free month on these routes I want to see if HGV operators can be persuaded to use the motorways more.\u00a0 While there is a cost attached to this I think it is worthwhile to give us an opportunity to study traffic levels in detail and assess the implications and for HGV operators to evaluate the time and efficiency benefits of using these motorways.  I have selected the routes for inclusion in the trial with the issue of\u00a0regular avoidance of parts of the motorway network\u00a0by heavy goods vehicles very much in mind.  The M1 outside Drogheda is a good example, where large numbers of HGVs avoid the toll but have to pass through Slane in order to do so, which is hugely inconvenient to both the truck drivers and local residents.  The M3 motorway from Dublin to Kells, the M6 from Ballinasloe to Galway and the Limerick tunnel are also good examples, with large numbers of trucks using the older road nearby to avoid the tolls.<\/p><p>  I cannot say at this point that\u00a0this trial will lead to any change in tolling policy. \u00a0While toll rates\u00a0vary in line with consumer prices, the base rates\u00a0are built into the PPP financing arrangements that enabled the high quality motorway network to be built.

This new service provided by Aer Lingus will help to sustain this investment and help attract further investment in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100058#WRE02600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":216,"content":"<p>Question No. 143 answered with Question No. 95.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":217,"content":"<p>Question No. 144 answered with Question No. 64.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sporting Events","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100058#WRE02850"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[40901\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100058#WRE02900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if consideration has been given to Ireland hosting the Homeless Football World Cup; the supports that are currently being given to the Irish Homeless World Cup team; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I am aware of the serious implications which now arise for several prospective adoptive parents who believed that they were at an advanced stage in the adoptions process. I can confirm that the Irish Embassy in Moscow approached the relevant Russian authorities shortly after the introduction of the new provisions in order to clarify the impact on prospective adoptive parents.  The Russian Ministry of Education and Science advised the Embassy that all Russian orphaned children, including those already referred to prospective parents, must now be on the national adoptions database for an additional 6 months than was previously the case, before being eligible for international adoption.    In response to a subsequent request from my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Frances Fitzgerald T.D., who has lead responsibility on this matter, I asked our Embassy in Moscow to seek an urgent meeting with the relevant Russian authorities to see whether there may be any scope to waive new regulations in respect of prospective adoptive parents from Ireland who have been most affected by the new Russian provisions. <\/p><p>  The Ambassador has since discussed the matter with the Deputy Foreign Minister, seeking some flexibility on their part in dealing with the unique set of circumstances that these Irish families find themselves in and seeking his assistance in arranging a meeting with the Minister for Education and Science, who has lead responsibility on the Russian side. I very much hope that this meeting can take place soon.<\/p><p>  Minister Fitzgerald has also discussed the matter with the Russian Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires in Dublin and her Department will host a delegation of Russian officials later this month for further talks on a proposed bilateral adoptions agreement between Ireland and the Russian Federation.<\/p><p>  Let me conclude by saying that I have the greatest sympathy for those who believed they were nearing the end of the process of adoption only now to find themselves in an exceptionally difficult situation as a result of the changes in Russian procedures. Indeed, my Department has been in contact with a number of prospective parents in Ireland who fear that they will now be unable to complete their adoptions before 31 October 2013 when their Irish certificates of eligibility are due to expire under the Adoptions Act 2010.   I hope that a satisfactory arrangement can be arrived at to accommodate their particular circumstances.

An information feature was published in the Metro Herald on 9 January. Coinciding with the visit of the College of the European Commission to Dublin, the feature marked the start of the Presidency, the 40th anniversary of Ireland joining the EEC and the European Year of Citizens.  It also drew attention to the Presidency website  as a source of ongoing information for the public about the Presidency and about Ireland in Europe. This feature cost &euro;14,000 plus VAT.<\/p><p>  Metro Herald was again used for an information feature on 2 July to outline the results of the Presidency as it came to an end. To provide information beyond Dublin and the surrounding counties, a further information feature was published with a national newspaper, the Irish Independent, on 5 July. Each of these features cost &euro;14,000 plus VAT.<\/p><p>  These features were placed through the advertising agency which holds a framework contract for print advertising with the government; the agency was consulted as to the reach achieved by such features, the optimum timing for publication, the availability of specific dates and of course maximising value for money given the limited budget available.  At the outset of the Presidency, we secured 37 billboard posters for Dublin city centre from Dublin City Council - there was no rental cost for these and minimal design cost as we re-used the Presidency branding already developed.  There was no online or broadcast advertising undertaken and no further publications are planned.<\/p><p>  As is customary for an EU Presidency, a report outlining our legislative results over the six months was produced on 1 July. The cost incurred were &euro;6,236.10 for the design of the 100-page report in four language versions and &euro;3,891.96 for translation. This document, produced within a tight turnaround time, is available for download on the Presidency website at  in all four languages. There was also a limited print run of this report which was managed by the in-house printing capacity in the Department of Finance.<\/p><p>  These modest outlays will be covered from within the Presidency budget in the Department of the Taoiseach. As you may be aware, the overall budget for the 2013 Presidency was set at &euro;60 million, excluding security costs. This amounted to an overall figure in excess of 40% less than the cost of the 2004 Presidency.  With some costs still to be determined, it is now clear at this stage that projected Presidency spending will come under the original Presidency budget of &euro;60m. The revised projected Presidency spend is now &euro;51m, a saving of at least &euro;9m.  As final payments are made, a full financial report will be published later this year setting out the final cost of the Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100060#WRG00500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":287,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100060#WRG00600"},{"type":"question","counter":288,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[39077\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100060#WRG00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has discussed the issue of Syria with the British Prime Minister since D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann rose for its summer recess.","asker":"1066","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":289,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[39078\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100060#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has had any contacts with French President Francois Hollande in relation to the Syrian crisis.","asker":"1066","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[39080\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100060#WRG00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the contact he has had with EU leaders over the summer recess in relation to the Syrian crisis.","asker":"1066","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":291,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[39087\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100060#WRG01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if European leaders have recently discussed the situation in Syria; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":292,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168 to 171, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  I spoke with the EU High Representative Cathy Ashton on Wednesday 28 August about the gas attacks in Syria on 21 August 2013.  Syria was among the principal topics discussed at the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers which I attended in Vilnius on 7 September and where we were briefed on the US perspective by Secretary of State John Kerry.

Mr. Gurr&iacute;a used the opportunity of his visit to launch the OECD&rsquo;s Economic Survey of Ireland, a biennial assessment of this country&rsquo;s economic performance and prospects. I welcome the analysis contained in the Survey, with its focus on tackling youth unemployment, in particular, and its consideration of how Ireland can best build a knowledge-based economy. I am confident it will assist the Government in planning the next steps of our economic recovery.  Mr. Gurr&iacute;a also had a number of other engagements during his time in Dublin. In addition to meetings with me and with the Taoiseach, the Secretary General met with  Ministers Bruton and Burton and  also participated in a round-table with the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and visited the Digital Skills Academy.<\/p><p>  My own discussions with Mr. Gurr&iacute;a were open and constructive. I thanked him for the OECD&rsquo;s valuable contribution to the formation of economic and social policy in Ireland, especially in the current context of our imminent exit from the Troika programme and the upcoming budget in October. I also outlined some of the challenges we are still facing and the need for the Government to build on progress already achieved.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to report that Mr. Gurr&iacute;a was positive in his assessment of our economic prospects. His view was that Ireland has firmly returned to growth mode and that we can expect stronger figures in 2014 as the external environment continues to improve. He felt that we were beginning to see the benefits of difficult policy decisions already made and that our return to the financial markets would be a significant boost, both domestically and for the EU as a whole. He also pledged the OECD&rsquo;s continuing assistance in the time ahead.<\/p><p>  Mr. Gurr&iacute;a was complimentary too about the achievements of the Irish EU Presidency, including agreement on the Youth Guarantee. I described the challenges we face in reducing the unacceptably high level of unemployment in Ireland and some of the measures we have taken to tackle the problem, which have recently begun to bear fruit. I welcomed the OECD&rsquo;s work underway in  drawing up an Irish Youth Employment Action Plan  &ndash; and said that we look forward to drawing on that document in due course as a source of policy ideas and international best practice. Mr Gurr&iacute;a also updated me on the important work the OECD is undertaking on taxation, and in particular on Base Erosion and Profit Sharing (BEPS). We will continue to support and constructively engage with the OECD in this important project.<\/p><p>  It is clear to me, after Mr. Gurr&iacute;a&rsquo;s successful visit and our open exchanges with him about Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery, that we only stand to benefit from continued active engagement with the OECD. I will encourage further cooperation with the organisation in the years ahead and stress the need for us to leverage their considerable expertise and experience to Ireland&rsquo;s best advantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100060#WRG01700","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Policy","counter":299,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100060#WRG01800"},{"type":"question","counter":300,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[41073\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100060#WRG01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to Oxfam's latest report Growing Disruption: Climate Change and the fight against hunger which provides up to date links between climate change and causes of hunger, particularly the threat on food security arising from a reduction in crop production; his position regarding climate change links to world hunger and if he will take on board recommendations outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - IPCC AR5 - working group I report released shortly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Leaders also agreed that any new steps towards strengthening economic governance needed to be accompanied by stronger legitimacy and accountability, with appropriate involvement by national parliaments and the European Parliament.  This message was reiterated by the March 2013 European Council in the context of ongoing work on deepening EMU.<\/p><p>  The Informal Meeting of Ministers and State Secretaries for European Affairs chaired by the Irish Presidency in January 2013, considered the issue of democratic legitimacy and accountability.  The discussion focussed on immediate practical steps that could be taken within the existing supporting measures within the Lisbon Treaty. Ministers expressed support for greater interaction between the European Parliament and national parliaments, including through COSAC.  Ireland chaired the XLIX COSAC plenary in June 2013, which welcomed the successful intensification of interparliamentary exchange of information on subsidiarity scrutiny since the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty, in many cases contributing to specific scrutiny outcomes. COSAC affirmed the importance of effective execution of this role by national parliaments and encouraged further cooperation between national Parliaments when appropriate in order to reach the thresholds under the Treaties.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, arising from its right of legislative initiative, and before proposing new initiatives, the European Commission verifies whether the EU has the right to take action and whether the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States. In this context, I refer the Deputy to the Commission's Annual Report on Subsidiarity and Proportionality. The Report for 2012 was published in July 2013.  .<\/p><p>  Furthermore, national Parliaments have an important role under the Treaties in scrutinising European Commission legislative proposals for compliance with the principle of subsidiarity and, where appropriate, issuing reasoned opinions where a breach is considered to have occurred.

During my visit to the US last week, I spoke with several key contacts in the US Congress including leading members of the House Judiciary Committee, Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Chair of the Congressional Friends of Ireland, Pete King.  I also met with representatives of Irish community groups as well as some community members who are undocumented.  I am acutely aware of the difficulties they face as a result of their undocumented status.  I am more determined than ever to continue to work to find a solution to their plight.<\/p><p>  A resolution of the situation facing the undocumented Irish in the United States remains a priority for the Government.  The Government also attaches great importance to seeking provision for future flows of migration between Ireland and the United States through the extension of the &ldquo;E-3&rdquo; visa scheme to include Irish citizens.   In this context, we very much welcomed the US Senate&rsquo;s approval of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill by a 68-32 margin on 27 June last.  The comprehensive draft legislation, which was drafted over several months by a bi-partisan group of eight US Senators, provides for extensive reform of the US immigration system. It includes provisions that would legalise the status of undocumented Irish people and provide a path to permanent residency.  It also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US via the proposed E-3 visa.<\/p><p>  The Bill is a very positive development.  Its provisions, if adopted, would help to end the great hardship and uncertainty faced by undocumented Irish in the US and their families here in Ireland.  The inclusion of a new provision to allow several thousand Irish citizens to legally avail of employment opportunities in the US every year is also particularly welcome.<\/p><p>  The focus has now shifted to the House of Representatives for its consideration of the issues.  It remains to be seen whether a consolidated Bill can be agreed between the Senate and the House of Representatives.  It is generally accepted that securing overall agreement will remain a complex and challenging process, particularly at a time when Congress is preoccupied by budgetary and debt issues.  This was clear from my discussions last week and I believe the challenge to secure agreement has become even greater in recent times.  I am determined to continue to deploy all our resources at political, diplomatic and Irish community level to make progress on this vital issue.<\/p><p>  In addition to my contacts last week in New York, I visited Washington DC on 11-12 July and held a series of meetings on Capitol Hill, including with key members of the House of Representatives and Senate, with the US Administration and with Irish-American community representatives.  I reiterated throughout all these contacts the Government&rsquo;s interest in all aspects of immigration reform and in particular our interest in seeing an overall agreement reached which provides relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and a facility for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US.<\/p><p>  I wish to acknowledge the critically important role being played by a number of Irish community organisations, including the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform and the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform.  I also want to acknowledge the role played by Ambassador Collins and more recently by Ambassador Anderson and staff at the Embassy in Washington who have been steadily building support for our objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100060#WRG02900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regulatory Impact Assessment Data","counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100060#WRG03000"},{"type":"question","counter":312,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[41595\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100060#WRG03100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide an update on all regulatory impact statements carried out on Bills in his Department since this Government took office to date; if he will list these Bills in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It reflects the current mortgage arrears situation and seeks to deliver on the following principles, to:<\/p><p>  - ensure appropriate resolution of each borrower's arrears situation;<\/p><p>  - ensure that lenders deal with borrowers in a fair and transparent manner;<\/p><p>  - support and facilitate meaningful engagement between lenders and borrowers; and<\/p><p>  - ensure borrower awareness of the benefits of co-operating with their lender, and the consequences of not co-operating.<\/p><p>  All regulated firms are also required to comply with the statutory Code of Conduct for Business Lending to SMEs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100061#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Languages Act 2003 Compliance","counter":340,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100061#WRH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":341,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[40546\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100061#WRH01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the arrangements put in place by his Department to ensure compliance with the Official Languages Act, specifically requirements for signage in departmental offices, schools, third level institutions; details of any assessments undertaken by departmental staff to assess requirements; the number of signs assessed; when any corrective actions were put in place; if any or all of the actions taken by his Department were within the designated timeframes set out in legislation, and if, not the reasoning for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I have issued two Statutory Instruments (&lsquo;SIs&rsquo;) in relation to the timing and content of the Statement of Affairs to be prepared by the directors of IBRC. The first SI issued on 6th August 2013 (SI 304 of 2013) and a second SI issued on 18th September 2013 (SI 358 of 2013). Both of these SIs were necessary to facilitate requests made on behalf of the directors of IBRC in relation to the timing and content of the Statement of Affairs which they were required to produce. The effect of the two SIs was to extend the date of submission of the Statement of Affairs out to the 30th September 2013 and also to waive the requirement to include the personal details of debtors and depositors of the bank as at 7th February 2013 in the Statement of Affairs. <\/p><p>  I am advised that it was not feasible for the directors of IBRC to prepare a Statement of Affairs for IBRC within 21 days of the appointment of the special liquidators due to the complexity of the balance sheet of IBRC on liquidation and due to the amount of work required to be completed by the directors in preparing the Statement of Affairs. The liquidation of IBRC is arguably the largest and most complex liquidation of a company in the history of the State and I am satisfied that it was simply not feasible for the directors to complete the Statement of Affairs within the period specified in the Companies Act and for that reason I agreed to extend the submission date of the Statement of Affairs to the 30th September 2013. <\/p><p>  I also agreed that it would not be appropriate or necessary for the purposes of the orderly winding-up of IBRC for the directors to disclose personal details of the bank&rsquo;s approximately 2,500 depositors in the Statement of Affairs, as there would be a risk that such details, if they were included in the Statement of Affairs, could quite possibly make their way into the public domain. I further agreed that it would be inappropriate and unnecessary for the purposes of the orderly winding-up of IBRC to require the disclosure of personal information of the approximately 17,000 mortgage holders as well as other debtors of the bank as part of the Statement of Affairs. There is a risk that such information, if disclosed in the Statement of Affairs, could become publicly available and in my view this would not be in the interests of the orderly winding up of IBRC or the maximisation of the value IBRC&rsquo;s assets. <\/p><p>  The directors of IBRC remain obliged to produce a Statement of Affairs which will provide a detailed list of the assets and liabilities of the bank at the time of liquidation and the directors remain required to clearly set out the amounts owing by IBRC to secured, preferential and unsecured creditors at the time of liquidation. Information on aggregate amounts owing by debtors of the bank, and owing by the bank to depositors, upon liquidation will still be included in the Statement of Affairs along with estimates of the recoverable value of the assets.<\/p><p>  It is also important to note that the personal information concerning depositors and debtors which will not now be included in the Statement of Affairs is information which is already fully available to the Special Liquidators of the bank.  I made the decision to issue both the SIs following discussions and consultations between my officials and the directors of IBRC and the Special Liquidators of IBRC, who had no objection to the terms of the SIs.  The exclusion of personal information concerning depositors and debtors of the bank from the Statement of Affairs will not therefore have any adverse impact on the orderly winding-up of the bank&rsquo;s affairs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100061#WRH05800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection Forecasts","counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100062#WRJ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":387,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[40688\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100062#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the projected yield in a full year, over current rates, if stamp duty on residential property sales was increased so that it was levied at 2% on the value of sale between &euro;500,000 and &euro;999,999.99 and 4% on the balance over &euro;1 million; if such a forecast uses 2013 sales as a base; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":388,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield to the Exchequer, in terms of the estimated outturn in 2013 from Stamp Duty on residential property, if the 1% rate of Stamp Duty on considerations of over &euro;500,000 was increased to 2% would be &euro;8.7 million; and if the 2% rate of Stamp Duty on considerations in excess of &euro;1 million was increased to 4% would be &euro;3.6 million.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100062#WRJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":389,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100062#WRJ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":390,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[40771\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100062#WRJ00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider reversing excise duty increases on wine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":391,"content":"<p>The issue of excise rates on alcohol will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Budget. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100062#WRJ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Social Charge Application","counter":392,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100062#WRJ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":393,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[40850\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100062#WRJ01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on a matter regarding universal social charge rates for those over 70 years of age (details supplied).

The measure was designed to boost tourism and create additional jobs in that sector. The measure was estimated to cost &euro;120 million in 2011, &euro;350 million in 2012, &euro;350 million in 2013, and &euro;60 million in 2014. The cost of the VAT reduction was offset by the 0.6% levy on pension fund, a measure which is due to expire next year. As the rate was introduced as a temporary, targeted measure, failure to revert the 9% rate to 13.5% would give rise to a significant annual Budget shortfall that would have to be found elsewhere.<\/p><p>  After a sharp fall in activity in the years to 2011, some of the sectors impacted by the reduced VAT measure have experienced growth in employment. This is down to a number of factors, including the overall stabilisation in domestic demand over the period. The attractiveness of Ireland as a tourist destination has also been positively impacted by the improvement in price competitiveness due to inflation at or below the euro area average for the last five and a half years. It should be stressed that all factors, including the economic impact and the cost of the measure, are taken into consideration when analysing possible tax changes.  Any proposal to maintain reduce the VAT rate from the 13.5% rate will be considered in the context of the Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100062#WRJ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Exemptions","counter":417,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100062#WRJ02750"},{"type":"question","counter":418,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[41089\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100062#WRJ02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in relation to capital gains liability the exemptions available to a farmer (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This measure followed on from measures in the previous year&rsquo;s Budget which also supported farm expansion and the transfer of land.  Section 48 of Finance Act 2013 provides for relief from capital gains tax on disposals of farm land for farm restructuring, subject to a Commencement Order, which I made on 6 June 2013.  The terms of the relief are set out in Section 604B, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.     <\/p><p>  The relief applies to a sale, purchase or exchange of agricultural land in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 where Teagasc has certified that a sale and purchase or an exchange of agricultural land was made for farm restructuring purposes. The initial sale or purchase, or the exchange, must occur in the relevant period and the subsequent sale or purchase must occur within 24 months of that sale or purchase.  Full relief from capital gains tax will be given where the consideration for the purchase or the exchange is equal to or exceeds the consideration for the sale or the other land that is exchanged. Where the consideration for the purchase or the exchange is less than the consideration for the land that is sold or the other land that is exchanged, relief will be given in the same proportion that the consideration for the land that is purchased or exchanged bears to the consideration for the land that is sold or the other land that is exchanged. <\/p><p>  Provision is made for the clawback of the relief where qualifying land in respect of which relief has been given is disposed of within 5 years of the date of the purchase or exchange of that land. A clawback does not apply where the disposal arises under a compulsory purchase order.  It will be noted that this farm restructuring relief is subject to certain conditions being satisfied - including the land in question being &ldquo;qualifying land&rdquo; (insofar as Teagasc has issued a farm restructuring certificate in respect of the lands in question, that has not been withdrawn).  Guidelines relating to the application for, and the issue of, a Farm Restructuring Certificate are available on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s website. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100062#WRJ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vehicle Registration Issues","counter":420,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100062#WRJ02950"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[41108\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100062#WRJ03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration will be given to the revision of the current licence plate registration system for vehicles to enable the purchaser of a pre-owned vehicle to have that vehicle re-designated to that person's county of residence for an appropriate and reasonable fee; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Since September 2012 guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. In this way principals have discretion to balance guidance needs with the pressures to provide subject choice. A framework document was published jointly by the Post Primary Management bodies and the NAPD (National Association of Principals &amp;amp; Deputies) in September, 2012 to provide guidance for school management in the allocation of teaching hours to guidance counselling in post-primary schools in the context of the decision in Budget 2012 to withdraw the provision of ex-quota guidance hours to schools.

Pupils with Down Syndrome may therefore be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability.  Regardless of the manner in which the resource hours are allocated to schools, resource teaching\/learning support is available for pupils with Down syndrome. <\/p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down Syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools. <\/p><p>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild General Learning Disability (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD.  The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for children with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild GLD range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.<\/p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down Syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100063#WRK02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Appeals","counter":460,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100063#WRK02400"},{"type":"question","counter":461,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[40476\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100063#WRK02500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will expedite and award a student grant appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":462,"content":"<p>An appeal from the student referred to by the Deputy was received by the independent Student Grants Appeals Board and the Appeals Board have requested SUSI to review the application.

Special schools and classes therefore do not receive an annual block funding grant, or an annual allocation of funding.

My Department provides funding to primary schools by way of per capita grants, subject to a minimum grant equivalent to 60 pupils.  The funding arrangements made by my Department for post primary schools reflect the sectoral division of our second-level system. At the core of all arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.

The Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Act 2003 (Sections 19, 20 and 21) made similar provision for SFI to assume the role of employer. These sections have not been commenced.<\/p><p>  The following Sections of the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Act 2003 have not been commenced: Section 19, which concerns the powers of Science Foundation Ireland to employ its own staff; Section 20, which concerns arrangements for when  are seconded to Science Foundation Ireland; and Section 21, which concerns arrangements for superannuation being administered by Science Foundation Ireland for its employees. As  continues to be the legal employer of all staff in a number of agencies under the aegis of my Department, including those of Science Foundation Ireland, it has not been appropriate or necessary to commence these three sections in the 2003 Act. <\/p><p>  With the proposed integration of Forf&aacute;s into my Department, it will be necessary to establish these agencies as employers of their own staff on the dissolution of Forf&aacute;s.

It is proposed that the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001 will be repealed by the Companies Bill. Following enactment of this Bill, consideration will be given as to the timing of the commencement of the provisions in the Act.  <\/p><p>  Section 31 of the Investment Funds, Company and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005 has been partially commenced.

The initiative is intended to complement IDA&rsquo;s efforts to attract more fast-growing emerging companies to Ireland and focuses on generating projects from Small and Medium Sized Enterprises.  The Government recognises that, while IDA Ireland does excellent work in attracting large companies to invest, establish operations and create jobs in Ireland, any measures that can extend the reach of IDA, particularly to smaller companies who would consider investing and creating jobs in regional locations, is very positive for Ireland.  Many of the projects delivered so far by the initiative will be located in regional towns which would not ordinarily be considered by large companies of the type usually attracted by IDA, and the same is true of many of the projects currently in the pipeline.  The initiative is managed by Connect Ireland under a contract with IDA Ireland.  The cost of administering the scheme is covered by Connect Ireland and that includes web-site development costs.<\/p><p>  Under the Succeed in Ireland initiative, IDA Ireland will pay a finder&rsquo;s fee of up to a maximum of &euro;4,000 excluding VAT on the creation of a sustainable job i.e. a job that has been in place for 2 years.  As the initiative has been in existence since March 2012, no such fees have yet been paid by IDA Ireland.  To date 10 projects, with the potential to create 292 jobs, have been approved with the majority of these being outside of Dublin.

I am pleased with the success of the initiative to date and look forward to future announcements and continuing success of the initiative in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRO02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Employment","counter":677,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRO02850"},{"type":"question","counter":678,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[41022\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRO02900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the steps he is taking to ensure that trained Irish chefs are provided with opportunities to work in this country (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These courses have been developed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland working in conjunction with educational providers such as the Institutes of Technology and most recently with Colleges of Further Education. They include craft based training (Chefs \/ Bar and Restaurant Skills, etc) courses as well as a range of other courses designed to prepare individuals for a career in the Tourism and Hospitality industry across a wide range of disciplines<\/p><p>  There are currently 1,600 job seeker chefs registered with the Department of Social Protection. Over the period January to September 2013, there were 2,250 vacancies for chefs advertised through the public employment services. The vacancy data from the National Skills Bulletin produced by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in F&Aacute;S on behalf of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs indicates that there are no shortages for chefs but that there are potential retention issues within the sector. <\/p><p>  Follow up surveys to track the labour market outcomes for trainees completing craft based training courses are commissioned on a recurrent basis by F&aacute;ilte Ireland. In the most recent of these surveys, a minority of persons not working as chefs cited the absence of employment opportunities to work as a chef as their main reason for not working as a chef. Among persons not working as chefs, the findings of the most recent survey point to a combination of four job-related factors as influencing their decision to not work as chefs, namely, unsuitable working hours, low pay, temporary work,  and a lack of promotion opportunities.<\/p><p>  The authors of the 2012 study prepared for F&aacute;ilte Ireland concluded that measures to address the disinclination of a substantial minority of trainees completing courses in professional cookery to seek employment as a chef fall largely within the remit of the sector since measures to improve pay and conditions are relevant to addressing recruitment difficulties where these arise and to ensuring more broadly that the supply of trained personnel is fully retained in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRO03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Numbers","counter":680,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRO03050"},{"type":"question","counter":681,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[41043\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRO03100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide in tabular form, on a county basis for 2011 &amp; 2012, each Industrial Development Agency supported jobs announcement; the number of jobs announced at the time of announcement; the number of jobs actually created at each site as at 30 August 2013; an explanation for any disparity between the jobs announced and the jobs created; and his views on the practice of job announcements.

Where a client company wishes to publicly announce new jobs created, Enterprise Ireland can facilitate this announcement by issuing a press release in conjunction with the company.  While the number of jobs created at each site can be commercially sensitive and therefore not published individually, Enterprise Ireland tracks all jobs created, by reference to the commitment given in the legal agreement entered into between the Agency and the company at the time of support approval.

This initiative has been a very long time in gestation and progress was stalled on so many occasions over the past four decades so it is timely to bring this work to finality and make it a reality for the business community.  Concerns around the cost of patenting an invention in Europe and protecting that patent from infringement relative to other major competitor countries have driven this initiative and it is one of the outstanding objectives necessary to complete the single market and allow for growth in innovation by making patent protection more accessible and patent enforcement more cost effective.<\/p><p>  Since the signing of the Unified Patent Court Agreement in February of this year, work on the modalities of the Court is being undertaken by a Preparatory Committee composed of representatives of the twenty five signatory States, including Ireland.  One aspect of the Committee's work involves development of a set of standardised rules of Court to apply in all instances of the Court regardless of geographic location.  This is pivotal in ensuring that judgements and decisions are taken on the basis of standard applicable rules in all instances of the Unified Patent Court and will be important in trying to rule out the activities of patent assertion entities referred to by the Deputy.  Under the Agreement setting up the Unified Patent Court, the central Court is to be located in Paris, Munich and London.  In addition, Member States may set up a regional Court in which a number of Member States will participate or, certain Member States may opt to set up a local instance of the Court in their own jurisdictions.<\/p><p>  A draft text of the Rules of the Court is currently the subject of public consultation as well as the procedures applicable to all instances of the Court.  The submissions received as part of this consultation, which is open until 1 October 2013, will further inform the development of the Court Rules.  I understand that a number of companies have made submissions to the Committee already and I am confident that any concerns raised during this process, including rules to prevent the activities of patent assertion entities, will be considered in full by the Committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRP00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regulatory Impact Assessment Data","counter":696,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRP00550"},{"type":"question","counter":697,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[41597\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRP00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide an update on all regulatory impact statements carried out on Bills in his Department since this Government took office to date; and if he will list these Bills in tabular form.

It empowers the Minister to pay monies provided by the Oireachtas into the fund and to accept gifts of moneys for allocation to the Fund. The objective of the fund is to provide loans to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises, thereby facilitating job creation and retention across the economy in all<br \/>microenterprises with commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.<br \/><br \/>The Microenterprise Loan Fund is not intended to replace any current bank.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Credit Guarantee Bill 2012<\/td><td>This RIA was carried out in October, 2011.

The purpose of the scheme is to encourage additional lending to SMEs, not to substitute for conventional lending. It is not a grant, nor is it support for ailing businesses. The Scheme is intended to address specific market failures that prevent bank lending to some commercially viable businesses by providing a level of guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to job-creating firms.

The procedures governing the registration of deaths are provided for under Part 5 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004.  When a death occurs it is registered on foot of a certificate of cause of death supplied by a registered medical practitioner.  Where a death is referred to a coroner, the death is registered by a registrar on foot of a coroner&rsquo;s certificate.  These are the only circumstances under which a death can be registered.  <\/p><p>  Section 28 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 provides for the registration of stillbirths.  A still born child is defined under the Act as &ldquo;a child who, at birth, weighs not less than 500 grammes or has a gestational age of not less than 24 weeks and shows no sign of life and &lsquo;&lsquo;stillbirth&rsquo;&rsquo; shall be construed accordingly&rdquo;.  Section 28 (7) of the Act provides that, if a coroner ascertains that a body is that of a stillborn child, he or she shall notify a registrar in the functional area of the authority in which the body is located of the stillbirth and shall give to the registrar, in as far as he or she can ascertain them, the required particulars in relation to the stillbirth, and the registrar shall register the stillbirth in such manner as an tArd-Chlaraitheoir may direct. <\/p><p>  While acknowledging that the loss of an unborn child is very sad for the family concerned it would not be practical or feasible to establish and maintain a register of deaths in such cases.

Given the large number of people on the live register and the requirement to priorities the allocation of scarce exchequer resources the  Department does not allow for any exceptions in relation to the eligibility. <\/p><p>  JobBridge is a voluntary scheme. Jobseekers are free to choose to participate or not,  and to choose the type of internship and host organisation for which they wish to apply.  The success of the scheme is entirely dependent upon host organisations offering internships and jobseekers making themselves available to take-up internships.  As a voluntary scheme, JobBridge is not designed to be elitist or to cater only for the needs of specific types of jobseeker and in this respect the wide range of internships available ensures that the needs of people on the Live Register who wish to gain work experience and prove their abilities with an employer, including people with relatively little in the way of formal skills or experience, are met.  Accordingly, if all scheme criteria are met, internships in petrol station forecourts can provide such opportunities.  <\/p><p>  In order to protect the intern and to ensure the integrity of JobBridge, a variety of control measures and criteria have been introduced. These ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position; that it provides appropriate training and development experience; and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the intern. In addition to the initial vetting of advertisements and the requirement for the host organisation to participate in monthly compliance reporting, the Department conducts site visits to facilitate discussions with both parties to the internship.  These monitoring visits comprise a combination of randomised visits\/inspections with host organisations and of the investigation of complaints received from interns or concerned individuals.  The Department treats such complaints very seriously.  In this regard, over 3,000 monitoring visits have been conducted to-date with encouragingly 98% of these visits of a satisfactory nature.  Remedial action is taken in cases of non-compliance.<\/p><p>  Any allegations of abuse are investigated by the Department as a matter of priority and, where such allegations are substantiated those organisations are disqualified from any future participation in JobBridge.  The overwhelming majority of host organisations are abiding by the terms and conditions of the JobBridge scheme. Over 9,000 host organisations have commenced interns and as at September 2013, only 26 host organisations have been excluded from further participation in JobBridge for breaches of the terms and conditions of the Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRQ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":763,"content":"<p>Question No. 344 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Status","counter":764,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRQ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":765,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[40524\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRQ01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question 561 of 18 September 2013, if an oral hearing can be arranged in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":766,"content":"<p>Further to my response to Parliamentary Questions Ref.

Following the motion, I immediately secured the agreement of Environment Commissioner Poto&amp;#269;nik to the development of a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan.  The plan will set out the approach to the future restoration and management of each of the SACs, and may unlock some flexibility, within the terms of the Habitats Directive, to address the most difficult of sites, where relocation alternatives for turf-cutters may be limited. <\/p><p>  To progress the preparation of the plan, my Department engaged a team of specialists (RPS) to provide the scientific basis for raised bog conservation in Ireland.  RPS has been working with my Department and the Peatlands Council to prepare a Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, a draft of which I hope to make available for consultation before the end of the year.  Further information on the work of RPS can be found at .<\/p><p>  The draft plan will include a number of case studies to illustrate the scientific approach that will be needed for the restoration of all 53 raised bog SACs, as called for in the motion proposed in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in March 2012.  5 sites have been selected for this purpose.  The sites, which represent a broad geographic spread of SACs, were identified as a preliminary list to help illustrate the approach that could be taken for all SACs in the Raised Bog SAC National Plan.  The 5 sites have therefore only been selected for a scientific survey.  This list may change depending on the practicalities of undertaking the required scientific surveys.  <\/p><p>  In order to provide an informed basis for discussions with property owners and stakeholders, a preliminary survey of each of the 5 sites is required.  The surveys will involve site visits to verify drainage systems and to take other scientific measurements.  I would like to make it clear that this is a scientific survey and that no restoration work is to take place during this survey.  I would also like to make it clear that no future restoration work will be carried out on any raised bog SAC without full consultation and engagement with stakeholders.  This is set out clearly in the documentation which has been produced to guide this process, and which is available to the public on .  The Raised Bog Conservation Study SEA Scoping Report states: &quot;The development of a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan was recommended by Mr. Justice John Quirke in his report following the 2012 Peatland Forum.  A national plan was also called for in a unanimous D&aacute;il vote in 2012.  The purpose of the plan is to provide the ability to explore whether there are any other options available for those sites where relocation is genuinely not possible.  It also indicates how the 53 SACs are to be restored and managed into the future, which will be done in full consultation and partnership with those who own the bogs and surrounding land owners.&quot;<\/p><p>  For the avoidance of all doubt, what is being conducted at the moment is a scientific survey.  Comments in the local media from some parties about a risk of flooding arising from this simple scientific survey are unfounded.  I am happy to reassure all partners in this process that this is a scientific survey and any future actions that might be proposed arising from it will only be considered in consultation with the local community and landowners.  I would therefore encourage all turf cutting committees, property owners and stakeholders to engage with this very preliminary assessment, so that an informed discussion can begin on the future management options for each site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRU00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commemorative Events","counter":915,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRU00650"},{"type":"question","counter":916,"qnumday":416,"qnumall":"[40461\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRU00700","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the funding that has been made available to the decades committee in relation to the celebration of historic events; the procedures for groups to apply for this funding; to whom funding has already been allocated and on what basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Responsibility for enforcing the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department. <\/p><p>  The primary responsibility for the management of any waste, including costs for removal or disposal, lies with the holder of the waste; the holder of the waste is the natural or legal person in possession of the waste or the producer of the waste. The Waste Management Act 1996 imposes a general duty of care on holders of waste. A person may not hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution.

However, the presentation of refuse for collection, the manner in which it is presented and any charges imposed for collection are the responsibility of the tenant, who is the holder of the waste. Any incidents of illegal waste activity should be reported to the relevant local authorities, who have significant enforcement powers available to them under the Waste Management Act 1996 including the power to make bye-laws regarding the presentation and collection of waste.   <\/p><p>Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, local authorities have a strengthened, updated legislative and regulatory framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices where landlords are in breach of their obligations under the Regulations.

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial system in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation.     <\/p><p>Accommodation for Travellers is provided across a range of options including standard local authority housing which is financed from my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Invest ment Programme (SHIP) , Traveller-specific accommodation such as group housing and halting site bays and funded by means of 100% capital grant , private housing assisted by local auth ority or voluntary housing bodies , private rented accommodation and through their own resources. It is open to Travellers to op t for any form of accommodation, including Traveller-specific accommodation ,   and local authority programmes are intended to reflect these preferences. <\/p><p>Local Authorities are statutorily required to prepare and adopt multi-annual Traveller Accommodation Programme s for their areas. The current round of Traveller Accommodation Programmes for the period 2009   -   2013 are due to be completed in Decem ber and   authorities are currently making arrangements for the next round of prog rammes which will run from 2014 to 2018. Since the adoption of the third round of progr ammes in 2009 , it is estimated that over 450 units of Traveller- specific acc ommodation had been provided by end 2012 , supported by the provision of approximately &euro;50   m illion in capital funding from my Department. My Department also provides funding for accommodation related supports which operate in tandem with the capital programme. In total, o ver &euro;7   m illion   is being provided for Traveller accommodation purposes this year.     <\/p><p>My Department closely monitors progress by housing authorities in relation to the implementation of their annual work programmes for the supply and improvement of social housing funded under SHIP, including Traveller accommodation. Capital allocations issue annually to housing au thorities for each of the principal measures under SHIP, including Traveller accommodation. H   ousing authorities are required to submit quarterly profiles of expenditure under each of these measures. Expenditure is being closely monitored against the projected spend figures and the matter is also the subject of discussions between my Department and the authorities at meetings to review housing work programmes. <\/p><p>  Local authorities are required to produce annual progress reports which measure the provision of Traveller accommodation in a given year against the target figure contained in their Traveller Accommodation Programme. As part of this process, housing authorities are requested to provide an explanation for any variations between targets and outputs. Local authorities cite various reasons for failing to meet targets and these include Traveller families refusing offers of accommodation, families only willing to live in certain areas where housing availability may be an issue, difficulties in obtaining Traveller agreement locally, planning and legal problems, difficulties in obtaining site access and anti-social behavior by Traveler families which can delay development of projects. This information is circulated to, and discussed by, the statutory National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee at its meetings during the year and which advises me on a range of issues in relation to Traveller accommodation. <\/p><p>My Department monitors progress and expenditure on an ongoing basis. In the last two weeks, letters issued to all local authorities requesting them to furnish details of their projected expenditure on approved projects to end 2013. This information will allow the timely review and adjustment of budgets and any necessary reallocation of funding between local authorities.   <\/p><p>  Having regard to the robust monitoring procedures already in place, I have no proposals to introduce further regulations in relation to the drawdown of allocations by local authorities in respect of their Traveller accommodation programmes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRX00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leader Programmes Funding","counter":1058,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRX00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1059,"qnumday":473,"qnumall":"[40710\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRX00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will expedite an application for a project (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1060,"content":"<p>In the context of the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme (RDP), projects that request funding of &euro;150,000 or more require final approval from my Department after Local Development Company (LDC) Board approval.

Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 27th February, 2009, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making written representations to the then Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for subsidiary protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.<\/p><p>  The person concerned initiated judicial review proceedings in the High Court, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in her case. Her judicial review leave application was refused by the High Court   on 11th April, 2013 meaning that the earlier decisions of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the then Minister stood.  The person concerned has submitted an application for subsidiary protection. However, this application could not be determined while the judicial review proceedings were before the High Court. Now that those proceedings have been disposed of, consideration can be given to the subsidiary protection application. When this consideration has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for subsidiary protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a final decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the principal reason for the delay in having the case of the person concerned processed to completion was owing to the existence of judicial review proceedings before the High Court. Now that those proceedings have been disposed of, the case of the person concerned can be further considered.

The establishment of the Court of Appeal will require the enactment of an &ldquo;Implementation Bill&rdquo; that will deal with many practical issues in regard to the new Court of Appeal, such as the formal establishment and membership of the Court of Appeal; the appointment of judges, the organisation of the Court and provision for the office of Registrar of the Court; among other issues.  The existing requirements for appointment to the Superior Courts are set out in Section 5 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961, as amended by section 28 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 and further amended by section 4 and section 6 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002. Judges are appointed by the President on the advice of the Government.  Such appointments are dealt with by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which was established pursuant to the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995.  It should be noted that section 17 of the same Act provides that the Board's procedures shall not apply where the Government propose to advise the President to appoint a serving judge.<\/p><p>  The costs of the proposed Court of Appeal continue to be analysed but the current estimate is that the Court of Appeal would have an annual cost of &euro;2.5 to &euro;3m.  This includes judicial salaries plus the cost of overheads, support staff, etc.  These are, however, preliminary figures and the ultimate costs will depend on the number of judges required.  The current assessment is that the new Court will require 10 judges (9 ordinary and a President) but the final decision on this aspect can only be made when we have a clearer picture of the Supreme Court backlog which will exist when the implementation bill is being finalised.  It is expected that the appointment of two additional Supreme Court judges in the autumn will allow the Supreme Court to sit regularly in two Divisions which should have a positive impact reasonably quickly.<\/p><p>  Of course, there would be a significant personal and business cost of not providing a solution to this structural problem. The current level of delay in the Supreme Court of over four years is unsustainable for individuals and businesses seeking to pursue their Constitutional right of appeal. The establishment of a Court of Appeal provides a long-needed reform of our courts system. It will have significant benefit for individual citizens, but will also maintain the internationally recognised standing of Ireland as a competitive economy in which to do business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRZ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bench Warrants","counter":1156,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRZ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1157,"qnumday":509,"qnumall":"[41047\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of bench warrants currently outstanding in Dublin; if he will provide a breakdown of these bench warrants on a Division and District basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1158,"content":"<p>In the time available it has not been possible for the Garda authorities to supply the information requested by the Deputy.

","asker":"1073","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1172,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 513 to 515, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  As I have publicly stated on a number of occasions, there has been a change in approach to the regulation of solicitors&rsquo; accounts since the publication of the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011. I have been persuaded by the view that the regulation of accounts, including the investigation of possible acts of fraud and dishonesty which could lead to a claim on the Solicitors' Compensation Fund, should continue to done by the Law Society and its Financial Regulation Section. This decision has been based on the fact that it is not desirable that the State should assume responsibility or potential future liability for the breach of financial regulations by practising solicitors. This would involve the State assuming a very substantial burden which would, in the process, lessen the very serious incentive for compliance which results from the solicitors' profession being liable for claims on the Fund themselves. It would also substantially increase the staffing requirements and running costs of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority which is to be self-financing.<\/p><p>  The annual report of the Independent Adjudicator of the Law Society of Ireland for the year ending 30 September 2012 notes that the net assets of the Solicitors' Compensation Fund were valued at &euro;16 million in 2012 and the annual contribution by each solicitor to the Fund during that period was &euro;700. In 2011 244 claims were received by the Compensation Fund in the amount of &euro;7.6 million and &euro;2.5 million was paid out in that same period. In the six months up to the end of June 2012 162 claims were received amounting to &euro;1.9 million with &euro;0.7 million paid out in claims. A number of these recent claims have attracted public and media attention. The Law Society is, therefore, able to respond immediately to serious financial complaints and reserves the right to carry out investigations, without notification, where justified by the circumstances. The Society can also apply to the High Court for orders to protect clients' funds when serious irregularities arise. It should also be borne in mind that, following the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, the Law Society is  required to investigate compliance with anti-laundering regulations. The proposed retention of the Law Society&rsquo;s functions with regard to the Compensation Fund is, therefore, a recognition of the fact that the Society has an established and rigorous financial regulation regime which, of its nature, strongly incentivises financial compliance by solicitors in the public interest while simultaneously avoiding the imposition of an undesirable burden on the State.  I will, therefore, be proposing amendments to Part 3 of the Legal Services Regulation Bill to reflect this policy position.<\/p><p>  While the Law Society will continue to exercise responsibility for the financial regulation of solicitors it will no longer deal with complaints from members of the public or misconduct proceedings, including those that may arise from fraud and dishonesty. In tandem with the establishment of a new Legal Services Regulatory Authority that will be independent of the Government and the two legal professions in its appointment and in the discharge of its functions, the Bill will establish an independent complaints framework to deal with allegations of professional misconduct by both solicitors and barristers. The public will have direct access to this new framework - at present such complaints are made through the Law Society or the Bar Council. There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal to deal with allegations of serious misconduct by both solicitors and barristers - they have two parallel disciplinary and tribunal structures at present. In relation to possible complaints by legal practitioners about the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, the Bill contains an array of provisions which would provide redress in such circumstances including, where appropriate, access to the High Court for judicial review. The Legal Services Regulatory Authority, which will have a lay majority and chair to be appointed by nominating bodies, will also include representatives of the legal professions in its membership.<\/p><p>  Some elements of regulation are set to remain with the Law Society and the Bar Council under the new Bill. For example, they will be able to continue to set rules, regulations, practice notes and codes of conduct for their members subject to the provisions of the new Bill. They will retain certain of their own committees, working groups and task forces. They will maintain a role in the field of legal vocational education and training, though this area will be subject to a review by the new Regulatory Authority. However, there will be a far clearer distinction between their representative and regulatory functions by virtue of the fact that complaints from members of the public will be dealt with independently thereby avoiding any perceived conflicts of interest and enhancing public confidence in the new regulatory regime. These changes are being augmented by a more modern, consumer friendly and transparent legal costs regime under the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator that will take over the duties of the existing Taxing-Master. The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a set of Legal Costs Principles and the determinations of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, who may also issue legal costs guidelines, will be made public. The Bill will also open the legal services sector to new business models that will provide new opportunities for legal services providers while also providing greater choice and competition for the benefit of consumers.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Committee Stage of the Bill commenced on 17 July and I can confirm that detailed work on the Bill, including in relation to some of the issues raised, continues in my Department in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel. Committee Stage is to resume as soon as possible in the current session with a view to achieving the earliest possible enactment of the Bill and the timely implementation of its reforms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRZ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":1173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRZ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1174,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[41146\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRZ01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"in relation to the Coroners Bill 2007, if he will enact the legislation in its present format; when the bill will be progressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Bill, as published, provides for the comprehensive reform of the existing legislation and structures relating to coroners and provides for the establishment of a new Coroner Service. The Bill incorporates many of the recommendations made by the Coroners Review Group in 2000 and the Coroners Rules Committee in 2003. It will permit the State to better provide for the fulfilment of its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and, in particular, in regard to the Article 2 requirement to ensure an effective investigation of deaths of persons where the circumstances of the death may involve the State. <\/p><p>  The key elements of the Bill include-- <\/p><p>  - enhancing inquiry and inquest processes,<\/p><p>  - establishing the office of Chief Coroner to provide leadership and direction in all coronial matters; <\/p><p>  - providing the necessary legal framework for the establishment of a new Coroner Service;<\/p><p>  - moving to a smaller number of full-time coroners; <\/p><p>  - statutory requirement to ensure that family members are notified at significant steps of the coronial process;<\/p><p>  - clarifying a specific regime for coroner post-mortem examinations, including provision for retention and release of body parts and bodily samples, and <\/p><p>  - promoting cooperation between coroners and other agencies also involved in investigations of deaths.<\/p><p>  The Bill is in the course of being reviewed within my Department. Demands on this important service have  grown significantly in recent years. The numbers of deaths reported to coroners increased from 12,124 in 2007 to 15,403 in 2012.

It is also necessary to examine the proposed administrative structures in regard to the future provision of an improved coronial service to determine whether they remain appropriate and cost effective. <\/p><p>  While it would be my wish to be in a position to progress this important Bill, it is not possible to indicate with any certainty at this point, the likely time table in that regard.

All of these measures hold the potential to substantially increase catches by Irish fishermen in the short and medium term.

In 2011, in recognition of the increasing rates of STIs and the concerns expressed by professionals both within the HSE and in the wider community, the Programme re-developed its <i>Think Contraception<\/i>   campaign to focus on condom use specifically with the tagline &ldquo;Johnny&rsquo;s Got You Covered&rdquo;, as research has shown that condoms are the most commonly used method of contraception among young people and are effective in preventing unplanned pregnancy and STI infection.<\/p><p>Campaign elements include television advertising, poster advertising, online advertising, an information leaflet in addition to a Facebook page and Twitter account.  There is an accompanying promotional campaign that involves the distribution of a &ldquo;Protection pack&rdquo; that includes a condom and sexual health material to young people in colleges, at music events and outside pubs and clubs.  Approximately 100,000 protection packs are distributed annually.<\/p><p>The campaign website www.thinkcontraception.ie has information on all STIs and a video on how to use condoms correctly.  It also has a comprehensive list of STI testing services.  The website receives approximately 80,000 visits per year.  The Think Contraception Leaflet is distributed through a national network of GP surgeries and through pharmacies.  Think Contraception information resources are freely available via www.healthpromotion.ie  .<\/p><p>The Programme has worked with the Department of Education and Skills on the production of a set of lesson plans to support the implementation of the Relationships and Sexuality Education programme at senior cycle level.  The TRUST Resource, available to schools and youth workers since 2009, contains a 40 minute DVD, and a set of 21 lesson plans.  Two lesson plans focus on how STIs are transmitted and how young people can act responsibly to reduce the risks of contracting an STI.  It also contains a list of STI testing services that teachers can photocopy for young people.<\/p><p>The Programme also developed a website for teenagers, their parents, teachers and youth workers, www.b4udecide.ie   which aims to encourage young people to delay early sex and to make healthy, responsible decisions about relationships and sexual health.<\/p><p>In addition testing for Chlamydia and other STIs are available free of charge to all through the public health system.  These are provided in consultant led settings in the major urban centres in Ireland (see table below) as well as a number of GP-led clinics targeting specific risk groups such as men who have sex with men and sex workers.<\/p><p>Surveillance data of STIs are collected by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC).  The most recent year for which annual figures are available is 2011.  Annual figures for 2012 are currently being compiled and will be published within the coming weeks.  There were 13,259 STI notifications in 2011, an increase of 12.2% compared with 2010.  As in previous years, Chlamydia was the most common STI in Ireland in 2011, accounting for 48.3% of all STI notifications.  Chlamydia was more frequently reported among women (53.8%) than men (43.1%), continuing the trend seen in previous years.  Chlamydia is most frequently reported in those aged 20-29 years (65.1%).  There has been a slight increase in notifications in those aged 30 years and older since 2009.  In recent years, rates of STIs appear to be increasing.  Some of the increases may, however, be a reflection of better surveillance and more effective detection.<\/p><p>STI screening is provided free of charge in the following sites:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>Address<\/th><th>Target Population<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>GUIDE Clinic, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8<br \/>(Young Persons Only clinic on Thursdays)<br \/>Mater Hospital, Dublin 7<br \/>Women's Health Project<br \/>Gay Men's Health Service (GMHS) <\/td><td>General<br \/>(Young People)<br \/>General<br \/>Women in prostitution<br \/>MSM\/Transgender<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>Outpatients Department, Louth County Hospital, Dundalk<br \/>Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda<\/td><td>General<br \/><br \/>General<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>Outpatients Department, Monaghan Hospital<\/td><td>General<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, Co.   <br \/>    Westmeath<\/td><td>General<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>St. Fintan's Hospital, Portlaoise, Co.

This Group has been working closely with hospitals and there has been progress in relation to a number of interim targets, relating to the number of doctors working more than 24 hours in a single shift and instances of doctors working more than 68 hours a week. I am confident that progress will continue to be made towards the objective of full compliance.<\/p><p>  Ireland must have sustainable arrangements to train and develop the medical workforce we need in order to provide safe and effective services to our population. I am therefore committed to retaining doctors who are educated and trained in Ireland within our health service, by providing them with clear career pathways and appropriate working conditions. In July this year, I set up a working group chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, President of DCU, to carry out a strategic review of the medical training and career structure of NCHDs with a view to improving retention of graduates in the public health system. In particular, I want the group to set out a clear pathway for training at every level from Intern to Specialist, and to examine the potential for reducing the length of specialist training. I see this as a modernising initiative which is needed urgently. I have asked Professor MacCraith to provide an interim report to me by end-November 2013 and a final report by end-June 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRCC02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Ambulance Service Provision","counter":1347,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRCC02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1348,"qnumday":576,"qnumall":"[40444\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRCC02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current position regarding the air ambulance service operating from Custume Barracks Athlone; if the service will continue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1349,"content":"<p>The Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) service was established as a joint 12 month pilot project between the National Ambulance Service (NAS) and the Air Corps, providing dedicated aeromedical support to the NAS in the west, specifically where land ambulance transit times would not be clinically appropriate.

An effective and robust Risk Equalisation Scheme, RES, is required  in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2012 introduced a new permanent RES for the private health insurance market, effective from 1 January, 2013.  I assume that the Deputy is referring to the stamp duty applicable under RES 2013.<\/p><p>  The Risk Equalisation Scheme provides that health insurers receive higher premiums in respect of insuring older people, but that older people receive RE credits equal to the amount of the additional premium, so that all people continue to pay the same amount for a given health insurance product.  These credits are funded by a stamp duty payable by open market insurers in respect of each insured life covered.  Each year, the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, prepares the Report of The Health Insurance Authority to the Minister for Health, in accordance with Section 7E (1)(b) of the Health Insurance Acts, 1994 &ndash; 2012.  These reports set out the HIA&rsquo;s evaluation and analysis of information returns supplied by insurers, together with its recommendations for Risk Equalisation Credits and associated Stamp Duty to apply for the following year.  The most recent report was produced in November 2012 in advance of the introduction of the current permanent scheme.<\/p><p>  The rates that apply are not percentage based.  Instead a flat rate of &euro;290 for lower cover or non-advanced plans and &euro;350 for higher cover or advanced plans applies to all policies.  It is important to note that the measures contained in the RES are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums paid in the market.  Its purpose is to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, as well as the old and the young and to target credits where they are needed most, i.e. to the older and less healthy members.  It should also be noted that the levy is placed on private health insurance providers for each insured individual, and not on the customers themselves.  Later this month, the HIA will submit its report to the Minister with recommendations in respect of revised Risk Equalisation Credits to apply from 1 January 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WREE02900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":1471,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WREE02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1472,"qnumday":617,"qnumall":"[41092\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WREE03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current waiting list and estimate of costs for medical and surgical appliances in County Kerry; if he will itemise the various categories and the approximate waiting time for the various items; and the total amount of funding available for 2013 for these appliances.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1473,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WREE03100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff Recruitment","counter":1474,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WREE03150"},{"type":"question","counter":1475,"qnumday":618,"qnumall":"[41107\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WREE03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on the progress on filling the diabetic nursing posts to serve the area under the remit of the Galway-Roscommon Hospitals group, the establishment of which is vital for the introduction of insulin pump therapy, particularly for paediatric patients; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1476,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WREE03300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Obesity Strategy","counter":1477,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WREE03350"},{"type":"question","counter":1478,"qnumday":619,"qnumall":"[41110\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WREE03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if, despite the opposition to such a measure which is driven by commercial interests and a complete unwillingness to accept the growing scientific and medical evidence which demonstrates that sugar, in various processed forms, is responsible for the substantial increase in obesity-related health problems, he is committed to introducing measures to encourage healthier eating and encourage business to reduce such harmful ingredients in products; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1479,"content":"<p>Comprehensive, multi-level approaches are required to address the obesity epidemic.

Three pieces of information were provided to them: the prescribing frequency standardised for gender\/panel profile of benzodiazepines and z-drugs; the number of patients who were presenting prescriptions for periods of more than 3, 6 and 12 months; and a pictorial representation of their individual prescribing against the national profile.<\/p><p>  Where a GP asked for further information on receipt of details in February 2012, the HSE provided to that GP a &ldquo;pharmacist reported&rdquo; dispensing history over six months.  Some 74 GPs were over two standard deviations from the mean.  Separate communication was dispatched in May 2012 to four GPs who had not reverted previously to the HSE and who were over four standard deviations above the mean.  In relation to the snapshot of March 2012 provided to all GMS GPs by letter in early July 2012, the HSE also wrote separately to 16 GPs whose prescribing rate was over 3 standard deviations from the mean enclosing the dispensing records for the four months up to the end of May 2012.<\/p><p>  In its most recent communication to GPs in April 2013, the HSE drew attention of the GPs to the value of comparing the November 2012 and 2011 snapshots, anticipating that this would allow individual GPs to self-audit their practice effectively in the coming months and, where appropriate, make practise adjustments.  The HSE also drew attention to the number of patients who were newly initiated and who should be closely monitored to avoid inadvertent dependence.  The HSE is considering now whether it is appropriate to engage in more targeted &ldquo;face to face intervention&rdquo; and how such primary care intervention can be effectively introduced within the Medicines Management Programme <\/p><p>  Since the initiative undertaken by the HSE, both the mean and standard deviation have reduced meaning that prescribers are coming increasingly in line with each other.  While there is a small increase in the number of individual outliers, this is possibly because a reduced mean and standard deviation tend to highlight individual outliers.  It is also important to note that some of these GPs have communicated to the HSE valid and reasonable rationales for their higher prescribing than their peers.<\/p><p>  A comparison of the level of prescribing of benzodiazepines and z-drugs between November 2011 (when GPs were first written to) and November 2012 shows a reduction in items dispensed by community pharmacists of 1,427 items per quarter million patients, from 15,970 to 14,543 items.

The\u00a0overall target\u00a0is to attract at least 325,000 extra overseas visits to Ireland in 2013. If this target is achieved, it will generate an additional &euro;170 million in revenue this year, based on historic spending patterns. Recent figures from the CSO show\u00a0that we are well on target to surpass this target. For the eight month period between January and August, there was a 6.5% increase in the number of overseas visits to Ireland compared with the corresponding period of 2012. All of our main overseas markets grew in this period with visit numbers from Great Britain up by 3.7%; visits from Mainland Europe up 4.8%; visits from North America up 16.5% and visits from other long-haul markets up by 11.3%.<\/p><p>  The general response from the public and tourism stakeholders has been overwhelmingly positive. There are now almost 5,000 individual events\u00a0confirmed on the Gathering website. These include clan gatherings, festivals, special sporting events and concerts taking place all across the country.<\/p><p>  Obviously the ambitious targets for overseas visits and associated revenue could\u00a0only be achieved if people in our main source tourism markets were aware of the initiative. Tourism Ireland undertook\u00a0a major consumer campaign to promote The Gathering to the people across the world that feel linked by family, friends or otherwise with Ireland. The agency also\u00a0undertook co-operative activity with the major airlines and ferry operators to highlight the value fares\u00a0on offer.<\/p><p>  While we have very much targeted this year, I have no doubt that the pay-off for participation will have longer term positive consequences with many of the\u00a0events\u00a0developing into annual traditions and\u00a0creating on-going connections with other parts of the world. The Gathering 2013 project advisory board has been working with the Gathering 2013 team and the\u00a0tourism agencies on securing the legacy of the Gathering 2013, to ensure the good work being achieved is continued, and that the outcome of the Gathering continues to have lasting positive benefits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRGG02300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1548,"content":"<p>Question No. 643 answered with Question No. 64.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme Applications","counter":1549,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRGG02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1550,"qnumday":644,"qnumall":"[40964\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRGG02500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his attention has been drawn to any possible funding opportunities for a project (details supplied) in County Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"973","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1551,"content":"<p>Funding for capital projects in sport is made through the Sports Capital Programme.

In that regard I am happy to say that Ireland is very well served by both air and sea links. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, this was a particularly important year for Irish tourism with The Gathering Ireland 2013 still underway. Improved value for money across all sectors, better air access and The Gathering have all combined to give us an excellent year for inbound tourism. Latest figures published by the CSO show a 6.5% rise in overseas visits to Ireland for the first eight months of 2013<\/p><p>  In terms of air transport there\u00a0is a competitive market for air services in and out of the country. Ireland\u00a0benefits from a wide range of air connections, both short and long haul. In addition to the two main Irish airlines, Ryanair and Aer Lingus, the country is also served by the big three European network carriers, all four of the big US international airlines, both Emirates and Etihad from the UAE and many other smaller airlines. New routes are being announced on a regular basis by both Irish and international airlines.  Passengers also benefit from the EU passenger rights legislation, which is currently in the process of being updated and improved.<\/p><p>  In terms of economic benefits the aviation sector contributes approximately &euro;4.1 billion to Ireland's GDP\u00a0and\u00a0supports over 26,000 jobs. Despite the challenges of recent years the\u00a0industry continues to perform strongly but it is important that there is a clear policy framework in place to facilitate its continued development and optimise the contribution the sector can make to the economy.\u00a0To that end\u00a0aviation policy review is currently underway with a view to the publication of a new aviation policy next year.<\/p><p>  In relation to sea transport the market offers a diverse range of viable maritime links in and out of the State. There are currently\u00a0six shipping lines providing passenger services,\u00a0with approximately 500 sailings\u00a0weekly between Ireland and Britain and continental Europe, depending on the time of year. All ferry companies servicing these routes are commercial companies and, as such, their services are market driven.\u00a0<\/p><p>  The Irish ferry market is a very\u00a0important element of the Irish tourism transport network. While the vast majority of our overseas visitors arrive in Ireland by air, research has shown that visitors coming to Ireland by car are very important to\u00a0our\u00a0tourism industry as they tend to stay longer, they tend to tour around more (with consequential benefits for regional tourism) and they tend to spend more\u00a0than those arriving by air. Accordingly, the state tourism agencies have continually targeted this segment. Figures from the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) for the first quarter of 2013 show that\u00a0 ferry passenger numbers travelling to and from Ireland increased by 4%\u00a0 when compared to the corresponding period last year and tourist car numbers increased by 1%.<\/p><p>  Competition in the ferry sector is encouraged and I expect services to develop and expand to meet any\u00a0increased market demands in the future.\u00a0 In the past, operators have responded to market developments and increased capacity, when required. My Department through its agency, the IMDO, works closely with all existing operators and continues to promote Ireland as a location for new services. <\/p><p>  Ireland is also heavily dependent on ports for trade. Most of Ireland&rsquo;s merchandise imports and exports of goods are still transported by sea. It is important to ensure that competition in the Irish ports sector is working well because competition drives efficiency and service quality, both of which are key determinants of national competitiveness. The Competition Authority are currently finalising their market study of competition within the ports sector and they estimate that sea-borne freight accounts for 84% of Ireland&rsquo;s trade in volume and 62% in value terms. Many of Ireland&rsquo;s major exporting sectors - for example, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and food - are heavily reliant on sea transport. Irish shipping and port activity rose by 11% in the second quarter of 2012, according to the latest figures published by the IMDO.<\/p><p>  Additionally our new National Ports Policy, published in March, clearly identifies Ireland&rsquo;s Ports of National Significance. It is the Government&rsquo;s expectation that these ports will lead the response of the Irish ports sector to future national port capacity requirements and continue to play an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRHH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":1590,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[41137\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRHH01400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which discussions continue to take place in regard to the future structure of commercial and air passenger transport; the respective roles for Ryanair and Aer Lingus in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":1591,"qnumday":664,"qnumall":"[41138\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100067#WRHH01500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his preferred options for the future operation of Ryanair and Aer Lingus with particular reference to their respective shareholding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1592,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 663 and 664 together.<\/p><p>  The aviation industry is a key enabler of economic growth\u00a0and Government policy\u00a0is aimed at facilitating\u00a0the industry's\u00a0continued development .

This initiative has been a very long time in gestation and progress was stalled on so many occasions over the past four decades so it is timely to bring this work to finality and make it a reality for the business community.  Concerns around the cost of patenting an invention in Europe and protecting that patent from infringement relative to other major competitor countries have driven this initiative and it is one of the outstanding objectives necessary to complete the single market and allow for growth in innovation by making patent protection more accessible and patent enforcement more cost effective.<\/p><p>  Since the signing of the Unified Patent Court Agreement in February of this year, work on the modalities of the Court is being undertaken by a Preparatory Committee composed of representatives of the twenty five signatory States, including Ireland.  One aspect of the Committee's work involves development of a set of standardised rules of Court to apply in all instances of the Court regardless of geographic location.  This is pivotal in ensuring that judgements and decisions are taken on the basis of standard applicable rules in all instances of the Unified Patent Court and will be important in trying to rule out the activities of patent assertion entities referred to by the Deputy.  Under the Agreement setting up the Unified Patent Court, the central Court is to be located in Paris, Munich and London.

The RIA concluded that the proposed Bill is the appropriate way to give legal certainty to the Government Decision.  The CEB (Dissolution) Bill was published on 31 July, 2013, and the RIA is available on my Department's website.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill 2012<\/td><td>This RIA was prepared by my Department in April, 2012.  The objective of this legislation is to establish a Microenterprise Loan Fund and to provide for Social Finance Foundation to manage and control the Microenterprise Loan Fund on behalf of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It empowers the Minister to pay monies provided by the Oireachtas into the fund and to accept gifts of moneys for allocation to the Fund. The objective of the fund is to provide loans to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises, thereby facilitating job creation and retention across the economy in all<br \/>microenterprises with commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.<br \/><br \/>The Microenterprise Loan Fund is not intended to replace any current bank.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Credit Guarantee Bill 2012<\/td><td>This RIA was carried out in October, 2011.  The ultimate objective of this regulatory proposal is to empower the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to establish a targeted Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme.<br \/><br \/>The legislation will empower the Minister to give a loan guarantee, designate a lending institution as a participating lending institution, set eligibility criteria for borrowers in such lending institutions, set loan conditions, set out requirements in respect of liability of the Minister regarding payment of<br \/>guarantees, to require adequate monitoring arrangements and evaluation, to review and revoke the scheme and to assign a contractor to oversee the operation of the Scheme.<br \/>The objective of the Scheme is to provide a Government guarantee to the lender of 75 per cent on eligible individual loans to viable businesses, which is paid to the lender on the unrecovered outstanding balance on a loan in the event of an SME defaulting on the loan repayments. The purpose of the scheme is to encourage additional lending to SMEs, not to substitute for conventional lending. It is not a grant, nor is it support for ailing businesses. The Scheme is intended to address specific market failures that prevent bank lending to some commercially viable businesses by providing a level of guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to job-creating firms. All decision making at the level of the individual loan will be fully devolved to the participating lenders.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Companies Bill 2012<\/td><td>A RIA was published with the Company Law Review Group's General Scheme of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill in 2007.

The procedures governing the registration of deaths are provided for under Part 5 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004.  When a death occurs it is registered on foot of a certificate of cause of death supplied by a registered medical practitioner.  Where a death is referred to a coroner, the death is registered by a registrar on foot of a coroner&rsquo;s certificate.  These are the only circumstances under which a death can be registered.  <\/p><p>  Section 28 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 provides for the registration of stillbirths.  A still born child is defined under the Act as &ldquo;a child who, at birth, weighs not less than 500 grammes or has a gestational age of not less than 24 weeks and shows no sign of life and &lsquo;&lsquo;stillbirth&rsquo;&rsquo; shall be construed accordingly&rdquo;.  Section 28 (7) of the Act provides that, if a coroner ascertains that a body is that of a stillborn child, he or she shall notify a registrar in the functional area of the authority in which the body is located of the stillbirth and shall give to the registrar, in as far as he or she can ascertain them, the required particulars in relation to the stillbirth, and the registrar shall register the stillbirth in such manner as an tArd-Chlaraitheoir may direct. <\/p><p>  While acknowledging that the loss of an unborn child is very sad for the family concerned it would not be practical or feasible to establish and maintain a register of deaths in such cases.

Given the large number of people on the live register and the requirement to priorities the allocation of scarce exchequer resources the  Department does not allow for any exceptions in relation to the eligibility. <\/p><p>  JobBridge is a voluntary scheme. Jobseekers are free to choose to participate or not,  and to choose the type of internship and host organisation for which they wish to apply.  The success of the scheme is entirely dependent upon host organisations offering internships and jobseekers making themselves available to take-up internships.  As a voluntary scheme, JobBridge is not designed to be elitist or to cater only for the needs of specific types of jobseeker and in this respect the wide range of internships available ensures that the needs of people on the Live Register who wish to gain work experience and prove their abilities with an employer, including people with relatively little in the way of formal skills or experience, are met.  Accordingly, if all scheme criteria are met, internships in petrol station forecourts can provide such opportunities.  <\/p><p>  In order to protect the intern and to ensure the integrity of JobBridge, a variety of control measures and criteria have been introduced. These ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position; that it provides appropriate training and development experience; and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the intern. In addition to the initial vetting of advertisements and the requirement for the host organisation to participate in monthly compliance reporting, the Department conducts site visits to facilitate discussions with both parties to the internship.  These monitoring visits comprise a combination of randomised visits\/inspections with host organisations and of the investigation of complaints received from interns or concerned individuals.  The Department treats such complaints very seriously.  In this regard, over 3,000 monitoring visits have been conducted to-date with encouragingly 98% of these visits of a satisfactory nature.  Remedial action is taken in cases of non-compliance.<\/p><p>  Any allegations of abuse are investigated by the Department as a matter of priority and, where such allegations are substantiated those organisations are disqualified from any future participation in JobBridge.  The overwhelming majority of host organisations are abiding by the terms and conditions of the JobBridge scheme. Over 9,000 host organisations have commenced interns and as at September 2013, only 26 host organisations have been excluded from further participation in JobBridge for breaches of the terms and conditions of the Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100069#WRQ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1675,"content":"<p>Question No. 344 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Status","counter":1676,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100069#WRQ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1677,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[40524\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100069#WRQ01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question 561 of 18 September 2013, if an oral hearing can be arranged in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1678,"content":"<p>Further to my response to Parliamentary Questions Ref.

Notwithstanding the recent changes over the last number of years, those with lower earnings and those with shorter contributions histories will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund.   <\/p><p>  The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system and reforms such as these are essential to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability.

Following the motion, I immediately secured the agreement of Environment Commissioner Poto&amp;#269;nik to the development of a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan.  The plan will set out the approach to the future restoration and management of each of the SACs, and may unlock some flexibility, within the terms of the Habitats Directive, to address the most difficult of sites, where relocation alternatives for turf-cutters may be limited. <\/p><p>  To progress the preparation of the plan, my Department engaged a team of specialists (RPS) to provide the scientific basis for raised bog conservation in Ireland.  RPS has been working with my Department and the Peatlands Council to prepare a Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, a draft of which I hope to make available for consultation before the end of the year.  Further information on the work of RPS can be found at .<\/p><p>  The draft plan will include a number of case studies to illustrate the scientific approach that will be needed for the restoration of all 53 raised bog SACs, as called for in the motion proposed in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in March 2012.  5 sites have been selected for this purpose.  The sites, which represent a broad geographic spread of SACs, were identified as a preliminary list to help illustrate the approach that could be taken for all SACs in the Raised Bog SAC National Plan.  The 5 sites have therefore only been selected for a scientific survey.  This list may change depending on the practicalities of undertaking the required scientific surveys.  <\/p><p>  In order to provide an informed basis for discussions with property owners and stakeholders, a preliminary survey of each of the 5 sites is required.  The surveys will involve site visits to verify drainage systems and to take other scientific measurements.  I would like to make it clear that this is a scientific survey and that no restoration work is to take place during this survey.  I would also like to make it clear that no future restoration work will be carried out on any raised bog SAC without full consultation and engagement with stakeholders.  This is set out clearly in the documentation which has been produced to guide this process, and which is available to the public on .  The Raised Bog Conservation Study SEA Scoping Report states: &quot;The development of a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan was recommended by Mr. Justice John Quirke in his report following the 2012 Peatland Forum.  A national plan was also called for in a unanimous D&aacute;il vote in 2012.  The purpose of the plan is to provide the ability to explore whether there are any other options available for those sites where relocation is genuinely not possible.  It also indicates how the 53 SACs are to be restored and managed into the future, which will be done in full consultation and partnership with those who own the bogs and surrounding land owners.&quot;<\/p><p>  For the avoidance of all doubt, what is being conducted at the moment is a scientific survey.  Comments in the local media from some parties about a risk of flooding arising from this simple scientific survey are unfounded.  I am happy to reassure all partners in this process that this is a scientific survey and any future actions that might be proposed arising from it will only be considered in consultation with the local community and landowners.  I would therefore encourage all turf cutting committees, property owners and stakeholders to engage with this very preliminary assessment, so that an informed discussion can begin on the future management options for each site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100073#WRU00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commemorative Events","counter":1827,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100073#WRU00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1828,"qnumday":416,"qnumall":"[40461\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100073#WRU00700","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the funding that has been made available to the decades committee in relation to the celebration of historic events; the procedures for groups to apply for this funding; to whom funding has already been allocated and on what basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Economic Social Research Institute (ESRI) published a working paper last year, based on the callcosts data, which compared median broadband speeds marketed by county across Ireland. The report concluded that the number of broadband plans, download speeds and prices were relatively comparable across all counties in Ireland, whilst concluding that there were variations in speed within counties, especially in more rural areas of the country. <\/p><p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published last Autumn, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in the South-East. This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>-a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and <\/p><p>-a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years. The results of this mapping exercise will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100074#WRV00300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Petroleum and Gas Exploration","counter":1879,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100074#WRV00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1880,"qnumday":433,"qnumall":"[40797\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100074#WRV00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will discuss the expert advice on offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production and their tax and fiscal terms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1881,"content":"<p>In the context of the conclusion on 9 July 2013 of the D&aacute;il debate on the findings of the Report of the former Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture on Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration, I stated that I intended seeking independent expert advice on the &#8220;fitness-for-purpose&#8221; of Ireland's fiscal terms for oil and gas exploration, development and production.

Responsibility for enforcing the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department. <\/p><p>  The primary responsibility for the management of any waste, including costs for removal or disposal, lies with the holder of the waste; the holder of the waste is the natural or legal person in possession of the waste or the producer of the waste.

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial system in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation.     <\/p><p>Accommodation for Travellers is provided across a range of options including standard local authority housing which is financed from my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Invest ment Programme (SHIP) , Traveller-specific accommodation such as group housing and halting site bays and funded by means of 100% capital grant , private housing assisted by local auth ority or voluntary housing bodies , private rented accommodation and through their own resources. It is open to Travellers to op t for any form of accommodation, including Traveller-specific accommodation ,   and local authority programmes are intended to reflect these preferences. <\/p><p>Local Authorities are statutorily required to prepare and adopt multi-annual Traveller Accommodation Programme s for their areas. The current round of Traveller Accommodation Programmes for the period 2009   -   2013 are due to be completed in Decem ber and   authorities are currently making arrangements for the next round of prog rammes which will run from 2014 to 2018. Since the adoption of the third round of progr ammes in 2009 , it is estimated that over 450 units of Traveller- specific acc ommodation had been provided by end 2012 , supported by the provision of approximately &euro;50   m illion in capital funding from my Department. My Department also provides funding for accommodation related supports which operate in tandem with the capital programme. In total, o ver &euro;7   m illion   is being provided for Traveller accommodation purposes this year.     <\/p><p>My Department closely monitors progress by housing authorities in relation to the implementation of their annual work programmes for the supply and improvement of social housing funded under SHIP, including Traveller accommodation. Capital allocations issue annually to housing au thorities for each of the principal measures under SHIP, including Traveller accommodation. H   ousing authorities are required to submit quarterly profiles of expenditure under each of these measures. Expenditure is being closely monitored against the projected spend figures and the matter is also the subject of discussions between my Department and the authorities at meetings to review housing work programmes. <\/p><p>  Local authorities are required to produce annual progress reports which measure the provision of Traveller accommodation in a given year against the target figure contained in their Traveller Accommodation Programme. As part of this process, housing authorities are requested to provide an explanation for any variations between targets and outputs. Local authorities cite various reasons for failing to meet targets and these include Traveller families refusing offers of accommodation, families only willing to live in certain areas where housing availability may be an issue, difficulties in obtaining Traveller agreement locally, planning and legal problems, difficulties in obtaining site access and anti-social behavior by Traveler families which can delay development of projects. This information is circulated to, and discussed by, the statutory National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee at its meetings during the year and which advises me on a range of issues in relation to Traveller accommodation. <\/p><p>My Department monitors progress and expenditure on an ongoing basis. In the last two weeks, letters issued to all local authorities requesting them to furnish details of their projected expenditure on approved projects to end 2013. This information will allow the timely review and adjustment of budgets and any necessary reallocation of funding between local authorities.   <\/p><p>  Having regard to the robust monitoring procedures already in place, I have no proposals to introduce further regulations in relation to the drawdown of allocations by local authorities in respect of their Traveller accommodation programmes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100076#WRX00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leader Programmes Funding","counter":1970,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100076#WRX00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1971,"qnumday":473,"qnumall":"[40710\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100076#WRX00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will expedite an application for a project (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1972,"content":"<p>In the context of the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme (RDP), projects that request funding of &euro;150,000 or more require final approval from my Department after Local Development Company (LDC) Board approval.

Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 27th February, 2009, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making written representations to the then Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for subsidiary protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.<\/p><p>  The person concerned initiated judicial review proceedings in the High Court, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in her case. Her judicial review leave application was refused by the High Court   on 11th April, 2013 meaning that the earlier decisions of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the then Minister stood.  The person concerned has submitted an application for subsidiary protection. However, this application could not be determined while the judicial review proceedings were before the High Court. Now that those proceedings have been disposed of, consideration can be given to the subsidiary protection application. When this consideration has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for subsidiary protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a final decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the principal reason for the delay in having the case of the person concerned processed to completion was owing to the existence of judicial review proceedings before the High Court. Now that those proceedings have been disposed of, the case of the person concerned can be further considered.

The establishment of the Court of Appeal will require the enactment of an &ldquo;Implementation Bill&rdquo; that will deal with many practical issues in regard to the new Court of Appeal, such as the formal establishment and membership of the Court of Appeal; the appointment of judges, the organisation of the Court and provision for the office of Registrar of the Court; among other issues.  The existing requirements for appointment to the Superior Courts are set out in Section 5 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961, as amended by section 28 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 and further amended by section 4 and section 6 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002. Judges are appointed by the President on the advice of the Government.  Such appointments are dealt with by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which was established pursuant to the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995.  It should be noted that section 17 of the same Act provides that the Board's procedures shall not apply where the Government propose to advise the President to appoint a serving judge.<\/p><p>  The costs of the proposed Court of Appeal continue to be analysed but the current estimate is that the Court of Appeal would have an annual cost of &euro;2.5 to &euro;3m.  This includes judicial salaries plus the cost of overheads, support staff, etc.  These are, however, preliminary figures and the ultimate costs will depend on the number of judges required.  The current assessment is that the new Court will require 10 judges (9 ordinary and a President) but the final decision on this aspect can only be made when we have a clearer picture of the Supreme Court backlog which will exist when the implementation bill is being finalised.  It is expected that the appointment of two additional Supreme Court judges in the autumn will allow the Supreme Court to sit regularly in two Divisions which should have a positive impact reasonably quickly.<\/p><p>  Of course, there would be a significant personal and business cost of not providing a solution to this structural problem. The current level of delay in the Supreme Court of over four years is unsustainable for individuals and businesses seeking to pursue their Constitutional right of appeal. The establishment of a Court of Appeal provides a long-needed reform of our courts system. It will have significant benefit for individual citizens, but will also maintain the internationally recognised standing of Ireland as a competitive economy in which to do business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100078#WRZ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bench Warrants","counter":2068,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100078#WRZ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":2069,"qnumday":509,"qnumall":"[41047\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100078#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of bench warrants currently outstanding in Dublin; if he will provide a breakdown of these bench warrants on a Division and District basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2070,"content":"<p>In the time available it has not been possible for the Garda authorities to supply the information requested by the Deputy.

","asker":"1073","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2084,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 513 to 515, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  As I have publicly stated on a number of occasions, there has been a change in approach to the regulation of solicitors&rsquo; accounts since the publication of the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011. I have been persuaded by the view that the regulation of accounts, including the investigation of possible acts of fraud and dishonesty which could lead to a claim on the Solicitors' Compensation Fund, should continue to done by the Law Society and its Financial Regulation Section. This decision has been based on the fact that it is not desirable that the State should assume responsibility or potential future liability for the breach of financial regulations by practising solicitors. This would involve the State assuming a very substantial burden which would, in the process, lessen the very serious incentive for compliance which results from the solicitors' profession being liable for claims on the Fund themselves. It would also substantially increase the staffing requirements and running costs of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority which is to be self-financing.<\/p><p>  The annual report of the Independent Adjudicator of the Law Society of Ireland for the year ending 30 September 2012 notes that the net assets of the Solicitors' Compensation Fund were valued at &euro;16 million in 2012 and the annual contribution by each solicitor to the Fund during that period was &euro;700. In 2011 244 claims were received by the Compensation Fund in the amount of &euro;7.6 million and &euro;2.5 million was paid out in that same period. In the six months up to the end of June 2012 162 claims were received amounting to &euro;1.9 million with &euro;0.7 million paid out in claims. A number of these recent claims have attracted public and media attention. The Law Society is, therefore, able to respond immediately to serious financial complaints and reserves the right to carry out investigations, without notification, where justified by the circumstances. The Society can also apply to the High Court for orders to protect clients' funds when serious irregularities arise. It should also be borne in mind that, following the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, the Law Society is  required to investigate compliance with anti-laundering regulations. The proposed retention of the Law Society&rsquo;s functions with regard to the Compensation Fund is, therefore, a recognition of the fact that the Society has an established and rigorous financial regulation regime which, of its nature, strongly incentivises financial compliance by solicitors in the public interest while simultaneously avoiding the imposition of an undesirable burden on the State.  I will, therefore, be proposing amendments to Part 3 of the Legal Services Regulation Bill to reflect this policy position.<\/p><p>  While the Law Society will continue to exercise responsibility for the financial regulation of solicitors it will no longer deal with complaints from members of the public or misconduct proceedings, including those that may arise from fraud and dishonesty. In tandem with the establishment of a new Legal Services Regulatory Authority that will be independent of the Government and the two legal professions in its appointment and in the discharge of its functions, the Bill will establish an independent complaints framework to deal with allegations of professional misconduct by both solicitors and barristers. The public will have direct access to this new framework - at present such complaints are made through the Law Society or the Bar Council. There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal to deal with allegations of serious misconduct by both solicitors and barristers - they have two parallel disciplinary and tribunal structures at present. In relation to possible complaints by legal practitioners about the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, the Bill contains an array of provisions which would provide redress in such circumstances including, where appropriate, access to the High Court for judicial review. The Legal Services Regulatory Authority, which will have a lay majority and chair to be appointed by nominating bodies, will also include representatives of the legal professions in its membership.<\/p><p>  Some elements of regulation are set to remain with the Law Society and the Bar Council under the new Bill. For example, they will be able to continue to set rules, regulations, practice notes and codes of conduct for their members subject to the provisions of the new Bill. They will retain certain of their own committees, working groups and task forces. They will maintain a role in the field of legal vocational education and training, though this area will be subject to a review by the new Regulatory Authority. However, there will be a far clearer distinction between their representative and regulatory functions by virtue of the fact that complaints from members of the public will be dealt with independently thereby avoiding any perceived conflicts of interest and enhancing public confidence in the new regulatory regime. These changes are being augmented by a more modern, consumer friendly and transparent legal costs regime under the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator that will take over the duties of the existing Taxing-Master. The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a set of Legal Costs Principles and the determinations of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, who may also issue legal costs guidelines, will be made public. The Bill will also open the legal services sector to new business models that will provide new opportunities for legal services providers while also providing greater choice and competition for the benefit of consumers.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Committee Stage of the Bill commenced on 17 July and I can confirm that detailed work on the Bill, including in relation to some of the issues raised, continues in my Department in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel. Committee Stage is to resume as soon as possible in the current session with a view to achieving the earliest possible enactment of the Bill and the timely implementation of its reforms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100078#WRZ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":2085,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100078#WRZ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":2086,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[41146\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100078#WRZ01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"in relation to the Coroners Bill 2007, if he will enact the legislation in its present format; when the bill will be progressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Bill, as published, provides for the comprehensive reform of the existing legislation and structures relating to coroners and provides for the establishment of a new Coroner Service. The Bill incorporates many of the recommendations made by the Coroners Review Group in 2000 and the Coroners Rules Committee in 2003. It will permit the State to better provide for the fulfilment of its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and, in particular, in regard to the Article 2 requirement to ensure an effective investigation of deaths of persons where the circumstances of the death may involve the State. <\/p><p>  The key elements of the Bill include-- <\/p><p>  - enhancing inquiry and inquest processes,<\/p><p>  - establishing the office of Chief Coroner to provide leadership and direction in all coronial matters; <\/p><p>  - providing the necessary legal framework for the establishment of a new Coroner Service;<\/p><p>  - moving to a smaller number of full-time coroners; <\/p><p>  - statutory requirement to ensure that family members are notified at significant steps of the coronial process;<\/p><p>  - clarifying a specific regime for coroner post-mortem examinations, including provision for retention and release of body parts and bodily samples, and <\/p><p>  - promoting cooperation between coroners and other agencies also involved in investigations of deaths.<\/p><p>  The Bill is in the course of being reviewed within my Department. Demands on this important service have  grown significantly in recent years. The numbers of deaths reported to coroners increased from 12,124 in 2007 to 15,403 in 2012.

It is also necessary to examine the proposed administrative structures in regard to the future provision of an improved coronial service to determine whether they remain appropriate and cost effective. <\/p><p>  While it would be my wish to be in a position to progress this important Bill, it is not possible to indicate with any certainty at this point, the likely time table in that regard.

All of these measures hold the potential to substantially increase catches by Irish fishermen in the short and medium term.

In 2011, in recognition of the increasing rates of STIs and the concerns expressed by professionals both within the HSE and in the wider community, the Programme re-developed its <i>Think Contraception<\/i>   campaign to focus on condom use specifically with the tagline &ldquo;Johnny&rsquo;s Got You Covered&rdquo;, as research has shown that condoms are the most commonly used method of contraception among young people and are effective in preventing unplanned pregnancy and STI infection.<\/p><p>Campaign elements include television advertising, poster advertising, online advertising, an information leaflet in addition to a Facebook page and Twitter account.  There is an accompanying promotional campaign that involves the distribution of a &ldquo;Protection pack&rdquo; that includes a condom and sexual health material to young people in colleges, at music events and outside pubs and clubs.  Approximately 100,000 protection packs are distributed annually.<\/p><p>The campaign website www.thinkcontraception.ie has information on all STIs and a video on how to use condoms correctly.  It also has a comprehensive list of STI testing services.  The website receives approximately 80,000 visits per year.  The Think Contraception Leaflet is distributed through a national network of GP surgeries and through pharmacies.  Think Contraception information resources are freely available via www.healthpromotion.ie  .<\/p><p>The Programme has worked with the Department of Education and Skills on the production of a set of lesson plans to support the implementation of the Relationships and Sexuality Education programme at senior cycle level.  The TRUST Resource, available to schools and youth workers since 2009, contains a 40 minute DVD, and a set of 21 lesson plans.  Two lesson plans focus on how STIs are transmitted and how young people can act responsibly to reduce the risks of contracting an STI.  It also contains a list of STI testing services that teachers can photocopy for young people.<\/p><p>The Programme also developed a website for teenagers, their parents, teachers and youth workers, www.b4udecide.ie   which aims to encourage young people to delay early sex and to make healthy, responsible decisions about relationships and sexual health.<\/p><p>In addition testing for Chlamydia and other STIs are available free of charge to all through the public health system.  These are provided in consultant led settings in the major urban centres in Ireland (see table below) as well as a number of GP-led clinics targeting specific risk groups such as men who have sex with men and sex workers.<\/p><p>Surveillance data of STIs are collected by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC).  The most recent year for which annual figures are available is 2011.  Annual figures for 2012 are currently being compiled and will be published within the coming weeks.  There were 13,259 STI notifications in 2011, an increase of 12.2% compared with 2010.  As in previous years, Chlamydia was the most common STI in Ireland in 2011, accounting for 48.3% of all STI notifications.  Chlamydia was more frequently reported among women (53.8%) than men (43.1%), continuing the trend seen in previous years.  Chlamydia is most frequently reported in those aged 20-29 years (65.1%).  There has been a slight increase in notifications in those aged 30 years and older since 2009.  In recent years, rates of STIs appear to be increasing.  Some of the increases may, however, be a reflection of better surveillance and more effective detection.<\/p><p>STI screening is provided free of charge in the following sites:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>Address<\/th><th>Target Population<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>GUIDE Clinic, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8<br \/>(Young Persons Only clinic on Thursdays)<br \/>Mater Hospital, Dublin 7<br \/>Women's Health Project<br \/>Gay Men's Health Service (GMHS) <\/td><td>General<br \/>(Young People)<br \/>General<br \/>Women in prostitution<br \/>MSM\/Transgender<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>Outpatients Department, Louth County Hospital, Dundalk<br \/>Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda<\/td><td>General<br \/><br \/>General<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>Outpatients Department, Monaghan Hospital<\/td><td>General<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, Co.   <br \/>    Westmeath<\/td><td>General<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>St. Fintan's Hospital, Portlaoise, Co.

This Group has been working closely with hospitals and there has been progress in relation to a number of interim targets, relating to the number of doctors working more than 24 hours in a single shift and instances of doctors working more than 68 hours a week. I am confident that progress will continue to be made towards the objective of full compliance.<\/p><p>  Ireland must have sustainable arrangements to train and develop the medical workforce we need in order to provide safe and effective services to our population. I am therefore committed to retaining doctors who are educated and trained in Ireland within our health service, by providing them with clear career pathways and appropriate working conditions. In July this year, I set up a working group chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, President of DCU, to carry out a strategic review of the medical training and career structure of NCHDs with a view to improving retention of graduates in the public health system. In particular, I want the group to set out a clear pathway for training at every level from Intern to Specialist, and to examine the potential for reducing the length of specialist training. I see this as a modernising initiative which is needed urgently. I have asked Professor MacCraith to provide an interim report to me by end-November 2013 and a final report by end-June 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100081#WRCC02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Ambulance Service Provision","counter":2259,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100081#WRCC02050"},{"type":"question","counter":2260,"qnumday":576,"qnumall":"[40444\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100081#WRCC02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current position regarding the air ambulance service operating from Custume Barracks Athlone; if the service will continue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2261,"content":"<p>The Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) service was established as a joint 12 month pilot project between the National Ambulance Service (NAS) and the Air Corps, providing dedicated aeromedical support to the NAS in the west, specifically where land ambulance transit times would not be clinically appropriate.

An effective and robust Risk Equalisation Scheme, RES, is required  in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2012 introduced a new permanent RES for the private health insurance market, effective from 1 January, 2013.  I assume that the Deputy is referring to the stamp duty applicable under RES 2013.<\/p><p>  The Risk Equalisation Scheme provides that health insurers receive higher premiums in respect of insuring older people, but that older people receive RE credits equal to the amount of the additional premium, so that all people continue to pay the same amount for a given health insurance product.  These credits are funded by a stamp duty payable by open market insurers in respect of each insured life covered.  Each year, the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, prepares the Report of The Health Insurance Authority to the Minister for Health, in accordance with Section 7E (1)(b) of the Health Insurance Acts, 1994 &ndash; 2012.  These reports set out the HIA&rsquo;s evaluation and analysis of information returns supplied by insurers, together with its recommendations for Risk Equalisation Credits and associated Stamp Duty to apply for the following year.  The most recent report was produced in November 2012 in advance of the introduction of the current permanent scheme.<\/p><p>  The rates that apply are not percentage based.  Instead a flat rate of &euro;290 for lower cover or non-advanced plans and &euro;350 for higher cover or advanced plans applies to all policies.  It is important to note that the measures contained in the RES are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums paid in the market.  Its purpose is to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, as well as the old and the young and to target credits where they are needed most, i.e. to the older and less healthy members.  It should also be noted that the levy is placed on private health insurance providers for each insured individual, and not on the customers themselves.  Later this month, the HIA will submit its report to the Minister with recommendations in respect of revised Risk Equalisation Credits to apply from 1 January 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100083#WREE02900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":2383,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100083#WREE02950"},{"type":"question","counter":2384,"qnumday":617,"qnumall":"[41092\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100083#WREE03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current waiting list and estimate of costs for medical and surgical appliances in County Kerry; if he will itemise the various categories and the approximate waiting time for the various items; and the total amount of funding available for 2013 for these appliances.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2385,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100083#WREE03100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff Recruitment","counter":2386,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100083#WREE03150"},{"type":"question","counter":2387,"qnumday":618,"qnumall":"[41107\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100083#WREE03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on the progress on filling the diabetic nursing posts to serve the area under the remit of the Galway-Roscommon Hospitals group, the establishment of which is vital for the introduction of insulin pump therapy, particularly for paediatric patients; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2388,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100083#WREE03300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Obesity Strategy","counter":2389,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100083#WREE03350"},{"type":"question","counter":2390,"qnumday":619,"qnumall":"[41110\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100083#WREE03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if, despite the opposition to such a measure which is driven by commercial interests and a complete unwillingness to accept the growing scientific and medical evidence which demonstrates that sugar, in various processed forms, is responsible for the substantial increase in obesity-related health problems, he is committed to introducing measures to encourage healthier eating and encourage business to reduce such harmful ingredients in products; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2391,"content":"<p>Comprehensive, multi-level approaches are required to address the obesity epidemic.

Three pieces of information were provided to them: the prescribing frequency standardised for gender\/panel profile of benzodiazepines and z-drugs; the number of patients who were presenting prescriptions for periods of more than 3, 6 and 12 months; and a pictorial representation of their individual prescribing against the national profile.<\/p><p>  Where a GP asked for further information on receipt of details in February 2012, the HSE provided to that GP a &ldquo;pharmacist reported&rdquo; dispensing history over six months.  Some 74 GPs were over two standard deviations from the mean.  Separate communication was dispatched in May 2012 to four GPs who had not reverted previously to the HSE and who were over four standard deviations above the mean.  In relation to the snapshot of March 2012 provided to all GMS GPs by letter in early July 2012, the HSE also wrote separately to 16 GPs whose prescribing rate was over 3 standard deviations from the mean enclosing the dispensing records for the four months up to the end of May 2012.<\/p><p>  In its most recent communication to GPs in April 2013, the HSE drew attention of the GPs to the value of comparing the November 2012 and 2011 snapshots, anticipating that this would allow individual GPs to self-audit their practice effectively in the coming months and, where appropriate, make practise adjustments.  The HSE also drew attention to the number of patients who were newly initiated and who should be closely monitored to avoid inadvertent dependence.  The HSE is considering now whether it is appropriate to engage in more targeted &ldquo;face to face intervention&rdquo; and how such primary care intervention can be effectively introduced within the Medicines Management Programme <\/p><p>  Since the initiative undertaken by the HSE, both the mean and standard deviation have reduced meaning that prescribers are coming increasingly in line with each other.  While there is a small increase in the number of individual outliers, this is possibly because a reduced mean and standard deviation tend to highlight individual outliers.  It is also important to note that some of these GPs have communicated to the HSE valid and reasonable rationales for their higher prescribing than their peers.<\/p><p>  A comparison of the level of prescribing of benzodiazepines and z-drugs between November 2011 (when GPs were first written to) and November 2012 shows a reduction in items dispensed by community pharmacists of 1,427 items per quarter million patients, from 15,970 to 14,543 items.

The\u00a0overall target\u00a0is to attract at least 325,000 extra overseas visits to Ireland in 2013. If this target is achieved, it will generate an additional &euro;170 million in revenue this year, based on historic spending patterns. Recent figures from the CSO show\u00a0that we are well on target to surpass this target. For the eight month period between January and August, there was a 6.5% increase in the number of overseas visits to Ireland compared with the corresponding period of 2012. All of our main overseas markets grew in this period with visit numbers from Great Britain up by 3.7%; visits from Mainland Europe up 4.8%; visits from North America up 16.5% and visits from other long-haul markets up by 11.3%.<\/p><p>  The general response from the public and tourism stakeholders has been overwhelmingly positive. There are now almost 5,000 individual events\u00a0confirmed on the Gathering website. These include clan gatherings, festivals, special sporting events and concerts taking place all across the country.<\/p><p>  Obviously the ambitious targets for overseas visits and associated revenue could\u00a0only be achieved if people in our main source tourism markets were aware of the initiative. Tourism Ireland undertook\u00a0a major consumer campaign to promote The Gathering to the people across the world that feel linked by family, friends or otherwise with Ireland. The agency also\u00a0undertook co-operative activity with the major airlines and ferry operators to highlight the value fares\u00a0on offer.<\/p><p>  While we have very much targeted this year, I have no doubt that the pay-off for participation will have longer term positive consequences with many of the\u00a0events\u00a0developing into annual traditions and\u00a0creating on-going connections with other parts of the world. The Gathering 2013 project advisory board has been working with the Gathering 2013 team and the\u00a0tourism agencies on securing the legacy of the Gathering 2013, to ensure the good work being achieved is continued, and that the outcome of the Gathering continues to have lasting positive benefits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100085#WRGG02300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2460,"content":"<p>Question No. 643 answered with Question No. 64.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme Applications","counter":2461,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100085#WRGG02450"},{"type":"question","counter":2462,"qnumday":644,"qnumall":"[40964\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100085#WRGG02500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his attention has been drawn to any possible funding opportunities for a project (details supplied) in County Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"973","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2463,"content":"<p>Funding for capital projects in sport is made through the Sports Capital Programme.

In that regard I am happy to say that Ireland is very well served by both air and sea links. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, this was a particularly important year for Irish tourism with The Gathering Ireland 2013 still underway. Improved value for money across all sectors, better air access and The Gathering have all combined to give us an excellent year for inbound tourism. Latest figures published by the CSO show a 6.5% rise in overseas visits to Ireland for the first eight months of 2013<\/p><p>  In terms of air transport there\u00a0is a competitive market for air services in and out of the country. Ireland\u00a0benefits from a wide range of air connections, both short and long haul. In addition to the two main Irish airlines, Ryanair and Aer Lingus, the country is also served by the big three European network carriers, all four of the big US international airlines, both Emirates and Etihad from the UAE and many other smaller airlines. New routes are being announced on a regular basis by both Irish and international airlines.  Passengers also benefit from the EU passenger rights legislation, which is currently in the process of being updated and improved.<\/p><p>  In terms of economic benefits the aviation sector contributes approximately &euro;4.1 billion to Ireland's GDP\u00a0and\u00a0supports over 26,000 jobs. Despite the challenges of recent years the\u00a0industry continues to perform strongly but it is important that there is a clear policy framework in place to facilitate its continued development and optimise the contribution the sector can make to the economy.\u00a0To that end\u00a0aviation policy review is currently underway with a view to the publication of a new aviation policy next year.<\/p><p>  In relation to sea transport the market offers a diverse range of viable maritime links in and out of the State. There are currently\u00a0six shipping lines providing passenger services,\u00a0with approximately 500 sailings\u00a0weekly between Ireland and Britain and continental Europe, depending on the time of year. All ferry companies servicing these routes are commercial companies and, as such, their services are market driven.\u00a0<\/p><p>  The Irish ferry market is a very\u00a0important element of the Irish tourism transport network. While the vast majority of our overseas visitors arrive in Ireland by air, research has shown that visitors coming to Ireland by car are very important to\u00a0our\u00a0tourism industry as they tend to stay longer, they tend to tour around more (with consequential benefits for regional tourism) and they tend to spend more\u00a0than those arriving by air. Accordingly, the state tourism agencies have continually targeted this segment. Figures from the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) for the first quarter of 2013 show that\u00a0 ferry passenger numbers travelling to and from Ireland increased by 4%\u00a0 when compared to the corresponding period last year and tourist car numbers increased by 1%.<\/p><p>  Competition in the ferry sector is encouraged and I expect services to develop and expand to meet any\u00a0increased market demands in the future.\u00a0 In the past, operators have responded to market developments and increased capacity, when required. My Department through its agency, the IMDO, works closely with all existing operators and continues to promote Ireland as a location for new services. <\/p><p>  Ireland is also heavily dependent on ports for trade. Most of Ireland&rsquo;s merchandise imports and exports of goods are still transported by sea. It is important to ensure that competition in the Irish ports sector is working well because competition drives efficiency and service quality, both of which are key determinants of national competitiveness. The Competition Authority are currently finalising their market study of competition within the ports sector and they estimate that sea-borne freight accounts for 84% of Ireland&rsquo;s trade in volume and 62% in value terms. Many of Ireland&rsquo;s major exporting sectors - for example, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and food - are heavily reliant on sea transport. Irish shipping and port activity rose by 11% in the second quarter of 2012, according to the latest figures published by the IMDO.<\/p><p>  Additionally our new National Ports Policy, published in March, clearly identifies Ireland&rsquo;s Ports of National Significance. It is the Government&rsquo;s expectation that these ports will lead the response of the Irish ports sector to future national port capacity requirements and continue to play an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100086#WRHH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":2502,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[41137\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100086#WRHH01400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which discussions continue to take place in regard to the future structure of commercial and air passenger transport; the respective roles for Ryanair and Aer Lingus in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":2503,"qnumday":664,"qnumall":"[41138\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100100086#WRHH01500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his preferred options for the future operation of Ryanair and Aer Lingus with particular reference to their respective shareholding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2504,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 663 and 664 together.<\/p><p>  The aviation industry is a key enabler of economic growth\u00a0and Government policy\u00a0is aimed at facilitating\u00a0the industry's\u00a0continued development .
