The question I raise is in regard to homecare providers.  A presentation was given recently to a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health that I chaired on 29 May last at which homecare providers advised that they are finding it difficult to recruit people because of full employment and the fact that people now have jobs and are working full time.  There is a cohort of people who are prepared to provide homecare for three hours per day but the problem is that if they do so five days a week, they are precluded from claiming a social welfare allowance of any description.  One proposal is that the calculation be based on the number of hours worked rather than the number of days.  For example, a person working three hours a day, five days a week would amass a total of 15 hours.  That is the proposal and amendment which people are now seeking.<\/p> <p>We will need between 10,000 and 15,000 additional homecare providers in this country over the next few years.  As the Minister of State is aware, the number of people aged over 65 will increase from its current level of 637,000 to more than 1 million over the next ten years.  We want to keep more people out of hospitals and nursing homes and the only way to do that is through the provision of adequate homecare services.  Such homecare services can be provided by people who are prepared to work part time.  It is in that context that I set out my proposal that a person be permitted to work for three hours a day, five days a week without losing all of his or her social welfare allowance as he or she would under the current system whereas a person who works for two days a week is still able to get his or her social welfare allowance for three days a week.  The Department should take that proposal on board in planning the social welfare requirements in the coming budget and it should be given very serious consideration at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#A00400","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Burke.  The first part of my answer on behalf of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, will deal with the Senator's question as tabled.  I will also address the second part of his question, regarding the day-based system versus the hour-based system.<\/p> <p>The main social welfare schemes for jobseekers are the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit schemes.  Both schemes provide significant support such that individuals who are casually employed or working part-time can work up to three days a week and retain access to a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  For instance, an individual can earn a little over &euro;20,190 per year and retain a small jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment, while the equivalent threshold for an individual with a qualified adult is almost &euro;4,700 if they are both working.<\/p> <p>In addition to the two jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes, the Department&rsquo;s main in-work support is the working family payment, formerly known as the family income supplement, which supports families who have children and where the parents are on low incomes and work at least 19 hours per week.  The back to work family dividend scheme allows recipients of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit who have been jobseekers for 12 months or recipients of the one-parent family payment to retain their full increase for qualified children for the first year in employment, tapering to 50% in the second year.<\/p> <p>A long-term unemployed jobseeker who is offered employment of more than three days but less than 24 hours a week may be eligible for the part-time job incentive scheme.  Under this scheme a jobseeker can receive a weekly payment of &euro;124.40 per week if he or she is single or &euro;204.50 if he or she has an adult dependant.  The combination of schemes available provides considerable income support for individuals in part-time employment by allowing them to retain access to a social welfare payment.<\/p> <p>Reflecting the impact of Government policy and the overall improvement in the labour market, long-term unemployment continues to fall. The most recent data show that unemployment has fallen from a peak of 15% to 5.8% in May 2018.<\/p> <p>As regards the second part of the Senator's question, it is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from traditional work patterns.  Any changes to the current criteria, however, such as moving to an hours-based system, could result in a significant additional number of individuals becoming eligible for a jobseeker's payment, with substantial corresponding cost implications for the Exchequer.  In addition, if there were a change from the day-based system to an hours-based system, existing part-time workers would lose out if their current hours of work over three days exceeded the new hours threshold, thereby creating a disincentive to working more.<\/p> <p>Other schemes to support families on low incomes include the working family payment and the back to work family dividend.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2284\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2284&amp;amp;pid=MaryMitchellOConnor&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The part-time job incentive scheme can provide assistance to long-term unemployed persons who can only part-time employment for fewer than 24 hours per week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#A00500","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

This matter relates to Caranua.  We need to rehearse how Caranua come about.  It came about as a follow-on from the indemnity agreement formally agreed between the then Government, not a Fine Gael Government, and the Conference of Religious of Ireland, CORI.  That indemnity scheme was entered into by the State with the Catholic Church against all legal claims for compensation arising from past child abuse in church-run residential institutions.  I took the time this morning to read the debates in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad at the time.  Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall described it as a cheap insurance policy for religious institutions that had no effective State oversight.  There is no point in rehearsing all that but that is the reality.  It was a bad deal for everyone and we know it cannot be renegotiated.  We also know that many of the people who were part of that deal did not deliver and simply did not honour what they were meant to do in terms of giving over lands or funding.  Again, that is history and we must move on.<\/p> <p>What came out of it was this Caranua scheme which was to assist victims, or survivors, of abuse, because that is what they were, who had either come through the redress scheme or through some sort of court or settlement agreement by either arbitration or litigation.  A large advertisement appeared in a number of Sunday newspapers - I do not know why it needed to be that size - telling people that they have until 1 August to put in a claim.  This advertisement refers to funds, with the implication that it is running out of funds.  I put it to the Minister that Caranua should not be scaled down.  It needs to be reformed and there are issues about its governance about which the Minister knows.  There needs to be a review of it but it would be wholly wrong to wind down an organisation that was set up to support and assist victims of abuse - abuse in its widest form, including sexual abuse, emotional abuse and physical abuse.  Even in the past few days, we have heard so much about the Magdalen laundries.  We have heard so much from men who have come out of the Army with serious mental health issues as a result of them being victims and survivors.  We have heard so much about many organisations.<\/p> <p>Let us not this week confirm that we are winding down an organisation that was meant to be funded, or co-funded, by Government and by the redress scheme to help victims of abuse.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#B00400","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for raising this matter.  I will put this into context before I come to the script I have provided.  There was an indemnity deal, which the Senator referred to.  That meant the Residential Institutions Redress Board awarded &euro;1.5 billion to the victims of abuse in residential institutions, although this figure would need to be checked with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The State funded that, bar &euro;125 million which was the contribution by the religious orders under the indemnity deal.<\/p> <p>After the Ryan report, however, a further undertaking was made by the religious orders to contribute additional money.  Of that additional money, part was to recompense the redress payments that were ongoing but &euro;110 million was set aside which was money from the religious orders to fund the institution, Caranua, which would provide additional support over and above the residential institutions payments.  This was confined to people who had received payments under the redress scheme.<\/p> <p>Caranua was established by an Act of the Oireachtas and solely distributes money provided to it by the religious orders.  There is no co-funding arrangement for Caranua and it is funded entirely from those contributions made after the Ryan report.<\/p> <p>When that legislation was going through the Houses, the then Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, undertook that a review would take place to see whether the coverage of the scheme could be extended.  This was one of the issues and that was the backdrop to the review, which was to see if the &euro;110 million which was there would leave scope for some additional inclusions over and above the people already provided for.  To date, &euro;72.5 million has been paid predominantly for housing - 71% - but also for health and education and a small amount for exceptional needs.  The review that was undertaken did a number of things.  It highlighted that while &euro;30 million remained to be spent at the end of last year, if one looked ahead at the expected drawdown from existing clients - clients who might come from repeat applications - the anticipation was that that money would be fully used and the idea of extending it to relatives or others was not something that should be contemplated.<\/p> <p>As adverted to by the Senator, given that it is a fixed amount of money, and there is still a small flow of new applicants coming through, the board, which is independent, decided that it would be prudent to announce a date beyond which new applications would not be received.  This is a decision clearly by the board, acting within its own statutory remit, but it is being prudent in the context of commitments it has made and so on that it would be only fair to indicate that there would be such a closing point.<\/p> <p>It has distributed posters to organisations that work with people and used other local offices, including social welfare offices, GPs, post offices and libraries, to spread this information.  I have also specifically asked Caranua that where exceptional circumstances are brought to its notice beyond the date, it would allow for additional applications.  As one will see, the amount of money currently paid for exceptional needs is small - it less than 1% of its fund.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Richard Bruton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We should use the exceptional need provision to have reserve funds to ensure that even if there is a cut off date there is the capacity to deal with cases that come to attention after that on a hardship basis.<\/p><p>The relevant legislation I have referred to describes a number of services they can cover and over the years they have also sought to extend those services as new needs came to their attention.  One of the things Caranua has come under pressure for is that when it first opened it took time to build up its staffing and resources.  A backlog grew and there were complaints from some users.  Caranua has worked hard to improve service delivery, to clear backlogs, speed up appeals, expand face-to-face meetings and to adapt its supports to better meet those needs and it has extended it to areas like cookers, fridges, floors and home decoration to recognise the needs that were coming to its attention.  In order to ensure that the money available was spread fairly, it also introduced a cap of &euro;15,000.  That met with some complaints but it felt that was only fair in trying to make sure that money available was equitably distributed.<\/p><p>While this review has been published and Caranua has decided to set a final date for receiving new applications, there are a number of issues and we have worked with survivors who sought the holding of a series of meetings which would serve as a forum for former residents and others with close personal involvement to reflect on their experience, the State's response to the issue of institutional abuse and to make recommendations.  I support this proposal and intend to facilitate consultation with survivors, built around their experiences of the measures the State put in place following the realisation of the systematic abuse that occurred in residential institutions.  This consultation will be managed by an external facilitator and my Department has sought the views of survivors on how that consultation process should proceed.  An online survey form may be accessed via the Department's website.  A freefone service operated by Barnardos is also available and allows people to give their views on consultations over the phone.<\/p><p>I also plan to convene an interdepartmental committee to examine how existing mainstream State services can best meet the needs of survivors into the future.  This committee will include representatives from the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Health.  It will hold its first meeting in the near future because we need to ensure that there is a strong level of support from the State services for people who have been the victims of such appalling abuse.  That is the backdrop to the review and I hope that answers some of the Senator's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#B00500","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I know the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, is engaged in the Oireachtas justice committee at the moment so I appreciate the Minister staying on to answer this question.  I want to talk about the drugs unit in Balbriggan.  The Garda district which is known as district Y covers most of north Fingal and includes the towns of Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Lusk and the rural areas of Naul and Garristown as well as a number of other areas.<\/p> <p>Fingal is the fastest growing and youngest county in Ireland.  North Fingal has seen significant increases in population in recent years and this is set to continue.  Garda resources in Fingal were decimated over the period from 2010 to 2016 and were down 20% on what they should have been at that time.  While I acknowledge that some extra garda&iacute; have been allocated to the area in recent months, this does not go anywhere near the levels that would be considered adequate for the population size.<\/p> <p>I also fear that Dublin city is being prioritised in terms of Garda resources ahead of Fingal when allocations are being considered.  I am aware from my attendance at the justice committee before coming to the Chamber that an extra 200 garda&iacute; are coming on stream this Friday.  I would like to know if any of these are being allocated to district Y.  In their recent report on crime figures to the Fingal joint policing committee, garda&iacute; in Balbriggan have stated that the district's drug unit needs more resources and I am asking the Minister to ask the acting Garda Commissioner to give the Garda in Balbriggan the extra resources that are needed urgently.  Instances of drug possession for sale or supply have risen by 20% in the first four months of this year compared with the same period last year.  This is significant but detection rates have dropped.  By detection rates I mean crimes that are either solved or went to court.  They have fallen from 100% to 90% and this is a cause of serious concern.  The Garda report to the joint policing committee blamed this fall in detection rates on the lack of adequate resources in the district which requires members of the drugs unit to go and assist other units to cover the policing service.  It is clear that policing resources are stretched in the area.<\/p> <p>There are a number of drugs gangs operating in north Fingal and communities need to be assured that the Garda can adequately tackle this type of crime.  Rush Garda station was closed by the last Government and while this is earmarked for reopening there is no clear timeline for that and no clear commitment that extra garda&iacute; will be allocated to the station if and when it eventually reopens.  Some towns in north Fingal have no community garda who would prevent a lot of young people getting involved in drug crime in the first place.  I call on the Minister to make it Government policy that Garda resources are allocated in terms of the population spread of the country and rapidly expanding populations like we have in north County Dublin would get priority when the extra resources are being allocated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#C00600","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Clifford-Lee for raising this issue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Richard Bruton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, apologises for not being able to attend.

The Minister has also provided information that shows that the divisional drugs unit has a strength of 224, of whom 19 are allocated to the Dublin metropolitan region, north division.<\/p><p>All garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity, whether it be in the area of drug offences, crime or otherwise.  The Minister wishes to assure the Senator that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to proactively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in the jurisdiction.  In 2015 the Garda Commissioner established the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau which brought together the organised crime unit and the Garda national drugs unit.  The bureau leads the policing strategy for tackling drugs by way of demand and supply reduction strategies.  In that regard, the bureau continues its policy of working with Garda divisional drugs units nationwide in tackling supply reduction at local level.  This work is further supported by other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.  The Minister has been informed that this approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.<\/p><p>We have seen unprecedented international co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing services in other jurisdictions and this has led to important arrests and drug seizures.  Underpinning all of these measures is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensure a strong and visible police presence throughout the country.  There have been 1,800 new recruits since the Garda College reopened, 140 of whom have been assigned to the Dublin metropolitan region, north division.  Therefore, a significant allocation has come from the new recruits.  The expansion is continuing and the target is to bring the overall Garda workforce up to 21,000, a net increase of 2,000.  Apart from this, there is additional planning on the capital side to invest in technologies, the fleet and other modern, effective policing facilities.<\/p><p>The allocation to an individual station or division is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner, not the Minister.  The Garda Commissioner will have to decide the respective strength requirements in different parts of the Dublin metropolitan area.  While I will bring the Senator's comments to the Minister's attention, I understand the Garda has to look in a broad sense at the needs of different Garda districts to ensure effective policing.  Nonetheless, it is not a decision made by the Minister; ultimately, it is one made by the Garda Commissioners for operational reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#C00700","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the response.

I raised this issue yesterday and it is with regret that I raise it again today.  It was a shock this morning to listen to Dr. Gabriel Scally on the radio.  He complained that he had not received documents in the manner and format he would have liked.  It means that Dr. Scally cannot search through the documents he has been furnished with.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, was also on the radio and he described as pathetic the format of the documents as presented to Dr. Scally.  The Minister indicated that he would write to the HSE about it.  Clearly, at this stage the scoping inquiry is being treated very much like a legally charged inquiry.  Documents are being printed, scanned, reprinted and only then handed to Dr. Scally in a format one would generally see in very contentious litigation after a discovery order has been made.  It is imperative that Dr. Scally has the documents he needs in a format that is searchable, electronic and that we know will work.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Ardagh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Department of Health is obfuscating the material to make it more difficult for Dr. Scally to decipher and use it.

Surely he is in charge of the Department of Health and was responsible for the serious incident team going into CervicalCheck and the Department.  He should be able to get the information to Dr. Scally in a more practical and expedient fashion.  At this stage it seems the Minister has a complete lack of control over the Department.  There is pure chaos in terms of the documents supplied to Dr. Scally.  I believe a commission of inquiry must be set up as soon as possible so that we can get to the truth of the matter and that all the information is laid out properly and not held back.<br\/><br\/>The third issue I wish to raise today relates to the cancellation of sailings by Irish Ferries.  Due to delays in the building of the new <i>WB Yeats<\/i>vessel Irish Ferries has had to cancel many sailings.  That has left consumers, including families with young children, in serious limbo in terms of their holiday arrangements.  Yesterday, phone lines were not answered and there is a serious lack of clarity on the compensation that will be offered to the families affected.  The situation has caused considerable inconvenience with many families having to make new arrangements at significant expense.

When the Minister makes his announcement at the passing out ceremony on Friday it is important for him to provide greater clarity in terms of what stations are to reopen.  The Leader might check that out.  There is a big debate about certain Garda stations around the country that were due to reopen but have not reopened.  I know it is an operational matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but given that the issue keeps entering the political arena and that certain politicians in Cabinet and in the Lower House keep advocating for it and promoting it, we need clarity on exactly what stations will be reopened and what stations will not be reopened.

I received calls from a number of councillors across the country today requesting information from me, which I do not have.  It is not information I should have either because this is an independent report and we need to be told when it will be published and available.  The convention always is that both Houses of the Oireachtas accept such reports.  That is the case with all boundary reports, as it should be.  I look forward to reading the report.  Those individuals who elect most Members of this House are particularly anxious to see copies of the report very soon.<\/p><p>Could the Leader request an update on the commencement of sections 2, 3 and 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act?  I know that is an issue of concern to the Leader as well, as we have discussed it.  As he and Members of the House are aware, certain measures contained in the Act which was passed in 2015 have yet to be commenced.  Those measures relate in essence to equal parenting rights for married, same-sex couples.  The failure to date to commence those provisions is causing great anxiety in the LGBT community.  When we talk about equal marriage rights we should talk too about equal parenting rights.<\/p><p>This year the theme of the Pride festival is &quot;We Are Family&quot;.  I ask the Leader to clarify when those particular provisions, which are so important for same-sex couples and their children, will be commenced to provide for the kind of equal parenting rights for married same-sex couples in this country should be and are entitled to.  We are merely waiting for those sections to be commenced.<\/p><p>One of the reasons I heard given by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection recently on the delay in registration of two female parents in a same-sex marriage is the fact that training had not been made available to registrars.  That seems to be a particularly bogus reason as to why those sections cannot commence.  I read that recently in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>, a newspaper I know the Leader reads from cover to cover every morning for obvious reasons.  Could the Leader clarify when those particularly important provisions of the Children and Family Relationships Act will be commenced?  It would be a very happy coincidence if a particular effort could be made to ensure that they are commenced in time for that great celebration in Dublin and across the country at the end of June, namely, the festival known as Pride.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#H00800","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I also extend my condolences to the family of the former Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Rory Kiely.

It is absolutely shocking.  When are those people going to wake up and smell the coffee?  The Secretary General of the Department resigned.  He was pushed out due to a popular revolt because people are sick and tired of people in leadership in this country who fail in their responsibilities and who are never held to account.  One would have thought that the remaining leadership of that Department and the HSE would have said they would not fail to co-operate with Dr. Scally in the important work he is doing in the scoping inquiry.  It is stunning to learn that this morning.<\/p> <p>I trust that the Minister will get a grip on the situation.  He has called on the Department of Health and the HSE to fully co-operate but we need to see a complete change in culture.  We talked about the Department of Justice and Equality and all the scandals that engulfed it.  A full review was carried out on the organisation.  The failures we witnessed in that regard were stunning.  We see what is happening now in the Department of Health.  There must be a change at the higher level of Departments, which are failing and letting down the vast majority of public and civil servants who are honourable, decent, hardworking people.<\/p> <p>The Leader will be aware that the State will be allocated two additional seats in the next European elections.  Will the Government seriously consider allocating those two seats to the North of Ireland, the Six Counties?  The majority of people in the North of Ireland rejected the proposition of Brexit.  Increasing numbers in the North are seeing the absolute folly of that proposition, the impact it will have on the island, and how it undermines the Good Friday Agreement.  The people of the North voted against Brexit.  They voted to remain in the European Union.  They voted to continue to have a voice in the European Parliament and they are being denied that.  They are being denied their democratic choice.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the position taken by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Taoiseach in terms of the North and the Brexit negotiations at this point has been the right one by all of the people on this island of Ireland, but it would be wrong to not at least examine every possibility of allocating those two seats to the North of Ireland.  It would be the clearest signal yet that we defend the interests of the people of the North of Ireland and that we reject the folly, arguably the lunacy, of Brexit, certainly in terms of the implications for this island and that we defend and stand by the democratic decision of the people of the North.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask that the Leader seriously consider and pursue that option.

A great Limerick man, a great Senator and a great Fianna F&aacute;il person, he was a Member of the House for almost 30 years, bar a few months in 1982.  He was also a former Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  I met him in the car park only two or three weeks ago.  He was with former Deputy John Cregan and we had a bit of a chat.

All of us who cycle or who drive and take account of cyclists should try and embrace it as much as we can.<\/p><p>I raise the issue mentioned in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today that Ireland is the world's greatest tax haven.  I refute that.  The report from a certain group of academics needs to be challenged.  I have not yet read the report.  I do not know if it has been published but <i>The Irish Times<\/i>has been reporting on it.  The definition of tax haven they were using dates from 1993 and the world has changed a lot since then.  The report focuses particularly on 2015, which is the year when much intellectual property, IP, was transferred to Ireland.  That was done for many sensible reasons, however, including the fact that most of the intellectual property was transferred here because most intellectual property is being generated here and is being used here.  Microsoft has more than 2,000 staff here.  Apple has in excess of 7,000 staff in the Leader's area in Cork.  Large companies such as eBay, Facebook, PayPal and Uber are all in Ireland.<\/p><p>I will put on the record some of what Ireland has done in recent years.  We have done a breathtaking amount of work on corporation tax reform.  We have had a general anti-avoidance rule since 1989.  This is one of the first countries in the world to have one.  It has only been introduced in most EU countries as part of anti-tax avoidance directive.  We introduced mandatory disclosure domestically in 2011, and the UK and Portugal were the only countries in the EU which had done so before us.  We will be exchanging mandatory reporting disclosures with other countries across the EU from 2020.  We participate in EU code of conduct groups and the OECD forum on harmful tax practice.  I, as a member of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, have been at OECD meetings representing Ireland and putting Ireland's case forward at the OECD.  It is a bit rich to be calling the OECD a &quot;club for rich countries&quot; when, in fact, more than 100 countries are involved in the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process that is being administered by the OECD.  We were the first EU country to adopt country-by-country reporting in 2016 - well ahead of everybody else.  We were an early adopter of the FatCow, which is an exchange of information with the US tax authorities, and the fourth country to adopt it in 2011.  We have adopted all the amendments to the EU directive on administrative co-operation.  We have adopted the OECD common reporting standards.  We have engaged in automatic exchange of information country-by-country reporting.  We were awarded the highest rating for transparency by the OECD peer review last year.  We signed the EU anti-tax avoidance directive.  As part of that, we will be introducing controlled foreign company, CFC, rules from January 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#J00500","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Is Senator Horkan calling for a debate on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#J00600","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I will call for a debate on it.

First, I had a meeting on Monday in the Department of Health with grieving parents of a young Irish boy, Gavin Coyne, who passed away in Newcastle last year with a heart complaint.  The care that we provide for children with heart issues needs to be examined and the way that we care for parents who have to deal with this situation and who have to seek treatment abroad needs to be further investigated because the treatment that this family and their son got left much to be desired.  We made progress at the meeting with high-ranking officials but a political discussion needs to take place in this Chamber as to how we invest in that area, how we can support children with heart complaints and how we can support families because there is still a discussion to be had in that way.  A young Irish child died, not in Ireland but abroad, and we need to have a conversation about that.  I hope the Leader can facilitate a conversation with the Minister for Health on how we send children abroad for certain operational procedures.<\/p> <p>The second issue I want to raise is the issue of mental health.  I note the comments of the Ombudsman for Children who is quite critical of the State's response to children's mental health issues.  We had some quite disgusting comments over the course of the most recent referendum where Members of this House stated that mental health was not real health.  In my constituency, in the past month we have had two instances at two DART stations where young people have lost their lives.  I witnessed a vigil in Harmonstown DART station attended by young people who were traumatised by their friend, the person whom they loved and knew, who had taken his own life at Harmonstown DART station.  Flowers and candles were left.  This is an epidemic that we in this House all know far too well.  As public representatives, we must have a response to this.  I ask the Leader to facilitate a conversation with the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for mental health because where I live, the area that I care passionately about, at local DART stations people are literally ending their lives.  This cannot be a situation that is normalised.  What is most worrying about it is that it has not seemed to have got any traction or much comment.

Currently, when a farmer registers calves he knows will be sold within a fortnight, he can apply for a certificate of compliance to move and can then sell to the open market.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2464\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2464&amp;amp;pid=PaulDaly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->He could maybe have two or three different suppliers and then not know which calf will end up with what customer.  Now the Department has changed the regulations so that when he applies for that certificate of compliance he has to put the herd number of the herd of destination on the application for the certificate of compliance.  It is impossible for him to know in certain situations in whose herd the animal will end up.  We hear all the time about CAP reform and simplification.  Every change we make and propose is supposed to be simplifying the burden of paperwork, red tape and bureaucracy for farmers, yet at the same time every change we make seems to make it more complicated, involves more paperwork, makes it more strenuous on farmers and complicates their day to day living and activities.  I would like the Leader to put that on the list for discussion the next time the Minister is in for statements, to ask why there is the necessity for that change.  I know we need compliance and traceability for animal health and welfare issues but this makes no sense.  It seems like a change because somebody somewhere has seen some small issue and changed the whole system, which will affect everybody across the board and will complicate the issue, slow it down and tie the farmers' hands that little bit tighter behind their backs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#J00900","speaker":"1383","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":56,"content":"<p>It might be an appropriate issue for Senator Paul Daly to table a Commencement matter on, rather than wait for a debate on agriculture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#K00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>The Cathaoirleach has pre-empted the Leader.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#K00300","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>That is a great reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#K00400","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Maybe.

It is still in the mindset of circling the wagons and protecting its own interests.  It seems oblivious to the need for change agents.<\/p> <p>I also want to bring up the public service pay and stability agreement.  Commitments were given that findings would issue in June but seem now to be put off until July if not later.  I am talking about health service staff.  The HSE is failing to meet the targeted staffing needs for the funding of an agreed workforce plan for the year 2017.  It has not got a plan yet for this year.  We know about the chaos in our health system because of a lack of caring staff.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, is warning of a winter of discontent because we need clarity from the pay and stability agreement.  We need clarity that there will be action on the pay, conditions and recruitment of staff which is vital to our health service and which is getting seriously worse each and every day.  The burnout is large scale.  The HSE is double counting student nurses and adding them to the numbers to cover up the shortage.  There has been industrial action in Waterford.  Some 98% of nurses in Tipperary voted for industrial action yesterday.  This is not about pay, it is about the risk to patients and staff within the hospital.  Nurses are still working one day per month for free.  This was brought in under emergency terms in the period of the crash but that is still going on and highly resented by nursing staff.  I understand winter initiatives have not worked in the past.  They have been too little too late and it will be a winter of discontent unless we hear back from the Minister on this public service agreement soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#K00600","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I too heard the Minister for Health, Deputy Coveney on RT&Eacute; Radio One about the CervicalCheck scoping inquiry and I have to say I was so disappointed with him when he said that he would write to the Department of Health for information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#K00700","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>He did not say that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#K00800","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":63,"content":"<p>He is the Minister for Health.

What the Minister said on RT&Eacute; Radio One this morning was unacceptable.<\/p> <p>This week is national carers week and there are events going on around the country to highlight the incredible work that families do and as we know family carers do not get the proper support and acknowledgement they deserve.  I know from personal experience that we should be honouring these selfless family members who give of themselves to look after our loved ones in their homes.  I also want to mention that on Thursday, 21 June, Family Carers Ireland will be selling heart shaped pins for &euro;2 to raise awareness and much needed funds for family carers in Ireland.  It is appropriate that on the longest day of the year we would shine a light on the contribution of our carers.  While I encourage everyone to get out and support this worthy cause, we need to look at how the State recognises the hard work they do, the savings they provide to the State and the hours of work they put in without correct reward.  Currently, carer's allowance is a payment made by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for carers who are looking after someone who is in need of support because of age, physical or learning disability or illness including mental illness.  It is a means-tested payment and mainly paid to carers on low incomes who look after a person full-time.  The person needing care must require continuous supervision and have a requirement for help throughout the day with their personal needs such as walking, dressing, washing, eating and drinking or continuous supervision to avoid danger to themselves and full-time care attention for at least 12 months must be needed.  This amounts to &euro;214 per week but people often face months of scrutiny to qualify for the payment.  They cannot take a second job over 15 hours per week yet they are on call 24-7.  This is unacceptable.  We need to take a look at introducing a proper salary for these carers that comes from the health budget, not the social welfare budget.  The timescale could be up to 12 months for payment whether it is through appeals or further information being sought.  We need to start recognising what these people are doing - they are working for the State not themselves.  They are looking after our family members<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#K00900","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Is the Senator calling for a debate on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#K01000","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I have called and am calling for a debate and I will request that the Minister come to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#K01100","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":66,"content":"<p>A debate on what?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#K01200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Today I had the privilege of launching &quot;a connected island, an Ireland free from loneliness&quot;.

It truly shows how important this problem is and how it traverses all demographics.  I also want to particularly thank Minister of State, Deputy Kyne for attending the launch of the report today.  I founded the task force on loneliness in March to help combat the silent epidemic of loneliness which is prevalent in our society.  Loneliness is corrosive and has major health, social and economic impacts.  It is corrosive to personal health and to society as a whole.  I believe we need to turbo charge the debate on loneliness and create awareness of the issue.  This change needs to occur from Government down.  In the report there are many recommendations and it can be found on <i><i>lonelinesstaskforce.com<\/i><\/i><i><\/i>and will be distributed to all Oireachtas Members.  Some of the recommendations highlighted in the report include an awareness campaign, the adequate funding of NGOs and Ireland-based research.  Much of the research surrounding loneliness is based in the UK so we are using UK figures.  We need our own Ireland-specific research and we need accountability.  I am not calling for a dedicated Minister for loneliness as exists in the UK; Members will be familiar with the fact that Ms Tracey Crouch was nominated as Minister for Loneliness in the UK by Theresa May.

I have made it quite clear since this scandal unfolded that Government, the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach have only one objective - to get all the information out to the public, the women and their families.  It is imperative that there is co-operation with the inquiry.  The Minister for Health, despite what Senator Murnane O'Connor said, has said he will instruct and write to the HSE.  The phrase he used this morning was \"unacceptable and pathetic\".  We all agree with the Minister for Health.  The manner in which the transmission of 4,000 pieces of information is being undertaken is unacceptable.<\/p> <p>Senator Colm Burke is right, though.  Those of us who have worked with medical records and know what it is like understand that we need to have IT systems based on one unique patient identifier, transferable from one health entity to another so that notes can be transferred.  It is critical that the information is transferred in a manner that is swift, readable and searchable to Dr. Scally.  The Minister has also said that anything he requires will be given to him.<\/p> <p>The language we use as Members of the Oireachtas is critical as well.  The inquiry is under way and an interim report has been delivered on time.  As I said yesterday, all six recommendations have been accepted by the Minister.  There is no obstruction or obfuscation by the Government - anything but.  I agree with Senator Mac Lochlainn completely that it is about time people who are involved in the transmission of this information recognise that it is about the lives of people who deserve and want justice and to have the information given to them.<\/p> <p>Senator Ardagh also raised the issue of Irish Ferries.  It is distressing and disappointing that Irish Ferries has cancelled the holiday plans of 19,000 people.  It is important that they receive information and that the director of consumer protection be involved.

It is an operational matter over which I have no jurisdiction, as Members will know.  I would love to be able to tell the House there were 200 extra garda&iacute; going to Cork but I cannot do that.  It is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to decide where they go. <\/p> <p>Senators Nash and Boyhan raised the boundary commission.  I do not have the information as to what the boundaries are, when the report will be released or how it will be released.  All I know is that there is an independent boundary review commission established.  The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, asked that the report come back to him after no more than six months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#M00400","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>It is tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#M00500","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I am told by Senator Mac Lochlainn that it is going to be tomorrow.

Senator Warfield has also raised the matter previously as I have myself.  The delay is unacceptable and I thank Senator Nash for raising the matter in the context of the forthcoming Dublin Pride celebration, which is about ensuring that equal parenting rights are given to all families in our country.  \"We Are Family\" is the theme this year and we are all now of different diverse families.<\/p> <p>I am told that there are a number of technical drafting issues regarding Parts 2 and 3 of the Act.  The implications of these issues are being discussed and explored by officials in the Department and in the Office of the Attorney General.  The discussions are ongoing and detailed and the Department is not in a position to pre-empt the outcome by citing specific details.  To be fair to Senators Nash and Warfield, I did ask for a meeting on behalf of Senator Warfield but the Department declined on the basis that the negotiations were ongoing.  I will make it aware again because it is important that we end the uncertainty.  There is a lacuna that needs to be addressed immediately rather than being prolonged.  I fully concur with Senator Nash's remarks and will endeavour to work with all Members of the House to ensure that we get that piece of the legislation enacted as soon as possible.  However, I do not think it will be in time for Dublin Pride.<\/p> <p>Senator Mac Lochlainn also raised the issue of the extra seats for the North.

Unfortunately, the North will be leaving the European Union because of the vote in the UK, which means the Republic will increase its number of seats from 11 to 13.  As such, it is not possible to do what the Senator suggests.  However, it is an independent commission.  It is worth stating that if members want to come down and run in the South, they can come down and do so.  For example, Mr. John Cushnahan did it very successfully for Fine Gael in the Munster constituency.  Senator Marshall ran for election to the Seanad.  As the Senator said, however, we need to hear the voice of the island as a whole articulated and heard in Europe.  It is an idea to which I subscribe fully.<\/p><p>Senator Coghlan referred to the visit of Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, to Killarney and Cork tomorrow.  I welcome Prince Charles to Cork.  I do not agree with Senator Coghlan that it is about the equal importance of Killarney; it is about the south being feted as the gateway to Ireland.  Cork and Kerry are coming together tomorrow to give a royal welcome to the royal visitors and I hope the day goes well.  It is important to showcase our country and for the people of Ireland, Cork and Kerry are seen in the best possible light.  In the debate on tourism in the House last night, the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Griffin, made the point that the number of visitors from the UK declined in 2016 but we saw an increase last year.  In a post-Brexit era, it is important to welcome UK visitors to our country and to promote, sell and market Ireland as a tourist destination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#M00800","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#N00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I welcome warmly the visit tomorrow and am sure Senator Coghlan will be in Killarney to welcome Prince Charles to his beloved Muckross.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#N00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Please God.

We have had debates in the House in the context of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee report.  The matter raised is about ensuring that there is investment in mental health and that young people receive out-of-hours treatment, as Senator Mulherin said, for eating disorders.  The Government is committed to developing mental health services, which is why we have seen an increase in funding in 2018 to &euro;910 million, including &euro;35 million in the budget for 2018, representing an increase since 2012 of &euro;200 million.  We have also seen an improvement in counselling services through Jigsaw in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  It is important to recognise that we have seen the recruitment to different psychologist and assistant psychologist posts.  The point made by the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services, Deputy Jim Daly, is one on which we must continue to maintain our focus in CAMHS.  It is about intervention.  We must fix the system.  As the Minister of State has said repeatedly, it is often the case that a lower level of intervention is needed, which can be provided, rather than an intervention from a clinical psychologist.  The Minister of State is committed to fixing the system and there has been an increase in investment.  It is a matter on which we need to continue to work.<\/p> <p>I congratulate Senator Horkan on his intervention on the Order of Business this morning on the publication of certain allegations that Ireland is a tax haven.  There are some academics, political commentators and politicians who would love to see us closed down for business completely.  They do not want to see any foreign direct investment or any jobs created.  The Senator is right and I commend every word he said.  It is important to have a realistic debate on this subject which reflects the importance of foreign direct investment here.  The IDA published a report yesterday and should be commended for the work it undertakes on our behalf.  I welcome also the Senator's comment on national bike week and his comment on men's health week, which is very important.  As an eminent GP, Senator Swanick will concur with Senator Horkan's view that men's health week is important.  Men need to talk about their health, need to be checked out and need to get themselves looked after.  I concur with the Senator on that.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in also referred to the late Gavin Coyne and treatment abroad.  It is important to continue to review the issue of treatment abroad which is a very important part of our health system.  I agree completely with the Senator that mental health is a real health issue.<\/p> <p>Senator Paul Daly raised the very important matter of farm-to-farm movement certificates.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss that issue.  The advice of the Cathaoirleach that it might be more appropriate to raise the issue as a Commencement matter was very helpful.<\/p> <p>Senator Devine referred to the public service pay stability agreement, which is an important matter for the Government.  The Minister is committed to ensuring with the unions that there is a growth in wages.  We have seen public service recruitment in a variety of areas, including education, health and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I will get the information for the Senator, albeit she sometimes does not want to hear good news.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#N00500","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I referred to health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#N00600","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>There has been recruitment in the health sector with 11,000 new posts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#N00700","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Senator Devine loves good news.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#N00800","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>She does not, but I want to give it to her because it is important to hear it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#N00900","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":98,"content":"<p>The Leader should not be condescending.

The Act requires that public authorities have regard to this objective.  Unfortunately, &quot;have regard to&quot; has been found in practice to mean very little.  It is a test which is met by simply discussing climate issues in a vague manner.  Therefore, I am proposing that the test be one which actually has an impact on the decisions made in the planning system.<\/p><p>The concept of requiring consistency with other plans runs throughout the planning system.  For example, city and county development plans are required to be consistent with the regional, spatial and economic strategies.

The Bill as drafted ensures that the office of the planning regulator shall have regard to the policies and objectives of the Government, planning authorities and any other public authorities whose functions have a bearing on proper planning and development.  Furthermore, section 10 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, already provides that local authorities must take account of many of the directives and plans identified in these amendments in preparing development plans.  Section 23 of the 2000 Act has similar provisions with regard to the preparation of regional, spatial and economic strategies.  By extension, the planning regulator will be required to have regard to all of these matters when evaluating and assessing development plans and regional strategies.<\/p> <p>The Bill as drafted further provides that when the planning regulator is assessing and evaluating development plans, she or he shall address the relevant legislative and policy matters relating to the development plans but also take account of the national planning framework and all relevant ministerial planning guidelines and policy directives.

The Act currently provides that the initiation of a variation is an executive function of the council's chief executive.  Therefore, although councillors have the ultimate power to make a variation, they cannot initiate the process to exercise that power.  On Committee Stage, Senator Boyhan and I argued for the power to initiate a variation to be made a reserved function of councillors.  The Minister of State understood our concerns but he was concerned that the full shift of function might go too far.  Taking that into account, I propose that we enable the use of a special, important power in section 140 of the Local Government Act, which allows councillors to direct the chief executive of a local authority to exercise an executive function in a particular instance.  That power does not generally apply to functions under the Planning and Development Act.  I propose that the function of initiating a variation should be the only planning power where the section 140 procedure could be used.<\/p><p>The Minister of State is aware of some of the circumstances in which such a variation would be initiated by local councillors if my amendment is agreed.  For example, in the case of St. Catherine's Park in County Kildare, the Fingal county development plan contains an objective for a major road leading straight into the park.  The development plan objective is in the plan because Fingal councillors did not realise where the road led.  As soon as they understood the implications of the plan, they set about trying to vary the plan to delete the road objective.  However, they soon found that, as councillors, they cannot initiate a variation.  For whatever reason, the chief executive has not initiated the variation and local residents and councillors on both sides of the Fingal-Kildare boundary are left with a development plan which they unanimously want to change.  My party colleagues, Councillor Roderic O'Gorman in Fingal County Council and Vincent P. Martin in Kildare have drawn this matter to my attention.  That is only one example but it is a very good one.  More information will emerge about this case on which councillors want to make a good decision.  I hope the Minister of State will agree to this amendment to ensure the democratic effectiveness of our planning system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#R01200","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#R01300","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I wish to speak to my amendment No. 27 if that is in order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#R01400","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":124,"content":"<p>That is in order as amendments Nos. 26 and 27 are being discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018061300002#R01500","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1528882200,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials who have done a great deal of background work.
