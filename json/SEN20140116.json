The Deputy Leader and those Senators who have served on local authorities will be aware of the minor works scheme, under which funding is provided annually to address flood and storm damage, such as that experienced this year.  It is worth noting that while a number of high profile cases of storm damage occurred, notably in counties Galway, Clare and Kerry, many other areas also suffered damage.  In counties Donegal and Sligo, for example, the estimated cost of the damage was in excess of &euro;1.5 million and between &euro;500,000 and &euro;1 million, respectively.  County Leitrim experienced significant road damage which will cost approximately &euro;500,000 to repair.  I hope the Deputy Leader will raise with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, the requirement to make funds available to counties which may have a lower profile in terms of news coverage of the disaster, but nonetheless experienced suffering, damage and difficulties that are worthy of being addressed through the minor works scheme.<\/p><p>Irish Water is the main issue I wish to discuss.

That company's bonus culture has sneaked into Irish Water where staff are set to receive bonuses of up to 10% of salary.  I, and I am sure many other Senators, received an e-mail this morning containing choice language which stated it was typical that Irish Water staff are receiving bonuses even though the company has not begun to trade yet.

In light of the council's findings, the Government must reassess the supports it offers to victims of racism.  The council has confirmed that, following an extensive awareness campaign it conducted, it recorded an 85% increase in incidents of racism.  However, the total number of reported cases of racism in 2013 was still only 144.  As we are aware from recent media reports, it was also confirmed that the number of reports of racism to the PSNI is 700% higher than the number of such reports to the Garda.  Even if one allows for the possible differences in legal definitions and laws, this is a substantial gap.  It is clear, therefore, that victims of racism in this jurisdiction do not have the same level of confidence in our reporting system as their counterparts in the North.  The findings of the Immigrant Council of Ireland are a wake-up call that we cannot ignore.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600003#B01300","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1389868200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600003#B01400","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1389868200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality on the supports offered to victims of racism and taking into account what steps will be taken to assure victims that they have nothing to fear in coming forward.

Following 18 hours of debate in the Seanad, we have had two days of hearings on the issue.  I compliment Deputies Michael McCarthy and John McGuinness on chairing the two committee meetings in question.  After 30 hours of parliamentary time, we still do not know what will be the price of water or the generous free allowance.  A culture has developed of ignoring what the Seanad says.  Civil servants were seated behind the Minister during the 18 hours of debate in the House.  They ignored what we said and do not want to answer parliamentary questions.  They appear to be coached in avoiding answers when they appear before committees.<\/p> <p>It seems that the electricity regulator is not the appropriate person to regulate a completely different sector, namely, water.  Members ought to be aware that this week the water regulator in the United Kingdom has pointed out that the combination of high spending engineers and irresponsible bankers who will lend on the ability to tax people because everyone needs water has led to massive over-investment and serious financial difficulties in the water sector in the United Kingdom.  I attended the first day of hearings and watched them on television last night and it is essential that Senators on the Government side seek the necessary intervention of the Comptroller and Auditor General in this area, that is, in the affairs of Irish Water and the manner in which the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has been conducting itself in respect of both this and the other House.  Old-fashioned public finances must be restored and Government Senators should pursue this because hauling in people at regular intervals and listening to deliberately obfuscatory answers from those concerned is not good enough.  This organisation, the manner in which the Department has conducted itself, as well as the secret funds for county managers that emerged yesterday and were mentioned by Senator Marc MacSharry should all be placed under the control of the Comptroller and Auditor General because this, in turn, makes it responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Ever since it was set up, this has been an area in which there has been gross irresponsibility, as well as the manner in which Parliament is being treated.  Members' electorates will not thank them unless they move on this issue now and I suggest it is time to bring in the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Should such a move be made by the Government, I certainly would support it from these benches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600003#B01600","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389868800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I welcome the announcement made yesterday by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, on the turf cutting issue.  Because of the great work the Minister has done, the number of planned designated natural heritage area, NHA, bogs havs been reduced from 3,000 to 500.  In other words, 2,500 bogs have been de-designated.  In my native county of Roscommon 435 plots were to be designated as NHAs; turf cutting will now be allowed on 376 of them.  Another point on NHAs is that those who had been affected by a special area of conservation, SAC, designation and could no longer cut turf can also transfer to an NHA bog, if it is suitable.  Alternatively, they can continue to claim compensation.  In addition, the Minister also announced that in the event of someone not being able to cut turf in an SAC and for whom an NHA is not available and no alternative is available but who wishes to cut turf, the Minister can revert to the European Union and present a case to the authorities there on such person's behalf.  He is quite prepared to do this.<\/p><p>I also addressed the Minister yesterday on the issue of contractors, who have a large investment in this business and are affected as a result of it.  He stated he was offering them an olive branch, in that there would be a job of work to be done in repairing the damage done to SACs and NHAs, and that they could play their part in that regard.  I hope people can recall the major row that took place over this issue, involving confrontation and stand-offs.  One should be mindful of the fact that this issue is very similar to those in respect of pylons and wind turbines.  I hope the Government has learned from this and that we need never go down this road again or spend years arguing and fighting before it eventually is obliged to row back.

In the debate promised for next week, apart from the security of supply of water which is of critical importance to all citizens, the quality of the water coming through taps is an issue that has not been addressed fully.  During the Second Stage debate in this Chamber I raised the issue of the fluoridation of water, which is endemic in Ireland.  I understand we have the worst record in Europe.  This issue should not be dropped.  The answer provided at the time - that it was a matter for the Minister for Health - is not satisfactory.  <\/p><p>I will outline my primary purpose in speaking today and note I do not intend to seek a vote on the subject of CAP reform and single farm payments.  As Members seldom have a full and proper debate on the subject of farming and CAP reform and as the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, is due to come io the House next week, I ask the Deputy Leader to ensure this debate will be sufficiently long to enable Senators to speak in it.  I accept that probably only 20% of Members from all sides have a particular interest in farming or its future.  I ask, for example, that Opposition spokespeople be given at least 15 minutes to outline their case.  This will not happen each month, as Members rarely have a proper and full debate on farming in this House.  This proposal, with which the Minister has agreed in the European Union, will affect farming until 2020 and possibly beyond.  Consequently, those Members who wish to contribute to the debate should be given full time.  My suggestion to the Deputy Leader is that spokespersons be given 15 minutes and anyone else who wishes to speak be given ten minutes, if he or she so requires, and that the sharing of time be allowed.  I do not want to have an hour and a half long debate, half of which will be taken up by the Minister.  Many Members wish to contribute and have an interest in farming, rural Ireland and its protection and they should receive fair play in this regard.<\/p><p>I refer to the matter I raised yesterday and on which I forced a vote, namely, the single farm payment debacle and crisis that has been hitting rural Ireland.  It has been affecting counties Cork and Kerry, in particular, and I am sure it will affect other parts.  That is a separate issue and people should understand the reason I pushed it to a vote yesterday.  The cuts with which these farmers have been hit for the past three or four months are a completely separate issue.  In the course of the debate next week I hope the Minister can address it and will see to it that the farmers concerned will receive their payments and that some moratorium will be put in place in order that they will be able to get their farms and houses in order in the next 12 months.

Her mother had been nominated as the baby's next of kin and the family, including the biological father, agreed and were content that life support should be withdrawn to end the suffering of this poor unfortunate infant, yet the hospital was obliged to go before the High Court to get a judgment from Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns.

I agree with Senator Conway that Irish Water as an entity will work.  It is a whole new structure and utility being established.  However, there are serious questions to be asked.  We need to tease out the issue of bonuses, which, I think, are obscene.  Having said that, if the employees of Irish Water exceed the significant savings to the Exchequer in the region of &euro;2 billion we are being told will be made, which is another issue we need to examine to see whether that figure is for real, I would not have an issue with a bonus system.  That would form the basis of a significant debate in the House.  I support the call for a debate on all aspects of Irish Water here next week.<\/p><p>Another issue on which I seek a debate in this House in the coming weeks with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, is the increase in road deaths in 2013, which is the first increase since 2005.  The figures are still well below the peak of 1997, but the graph is going in the wrong direction.  It is worrying that a significant number of the road deaths involved motorcyclists, an increase of almost 70% on the 2012 figure.  Of drivers killed, 80% were male and half of them were aged between 16 and 35.  Over half of the driver deaths were single-vehicle collisions.  Obviously, complacency has got into the system.  We are beginning to take it for granted that the graph is going in the right direction, as it had been for the past number of years.  We need to refocus on highlighting the issue of road safety.  Vehicular condition and drivers possibly not maintaining their vehicles to the standards that they would have in the past because of the economic situation may be an issue and we need to look at the drink-driving and drug-driving areas.  A debate in this House on road safety would be appropriate as we start the new year because we want to get back to a position where we start to reduce such deaths significantly again.  Any death is a death too many but 190 is an unacceptably high figure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600005#D00200","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1389869400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom aird a tharraingt ar dh&aacute; cheist an-t&aacute;bhachtach ar maidin.<\/p><p>I am sure the Leader will be aware of the detention yesterday of Ms Margaretta D'Arcy who is a member of Aosd&aacute;na.  She is a well-known film maker and a peace activist.  She was arrested a number of months ago in an incident at a protest at Shannon Airport on the use of Shannon for stopovers by rendition flights.  I believe she was taken from her home yesterday on foot of that because she refused to sign a bond to keep the peace and she has been put into Limerick Prison.  The reason I raise the issue is a serious one.  Ms D'Arcy is a well-known peace activist.  She is 79 years old.  She has a serious ongoing health condition and her friends and supporters are concerned about the conditions around her incarceration.  I appreciate there is a separation between the Government and the garda&iacute;.  I have discussed this and I have got the facts.  The issue I raise is around her health and welfare.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify the position, that her health and welfare are being properly attended to, because people are gravely concerned as she has been somebody over the years who has drawn attention to what she sees as violations of human rights regulations internationally.<\/p><p>The other issue is there is impending industrial action in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, which is to start on Monday.  Yesterday I met members of IMPACT who told me that they are concerned about the lack of negotiation between the officials in the Department and themselves over job grades being changed, etc., in the Department where there was a competition where staff in the technical grades were not allowed to apply for certain positions.  Potentially, this has a significant impact in that it would affect farmers who were receiving payments.  The technical grade officers would be the ones who visit the farms and work with farmers on much of the paperwork, and they are disgruntled.  The issue is not money.  They are not looking for more money.  They are merely looking to sit down, to be able to negotiate with the Department.  The Department has stood off on the issue, it tells us, up to now.  I call on the Deputy Leader to use the vestige of the Leader's office to intervene with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and, perhaps, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to have this issue resolved so that there is not industrial action by 600 agriculture officers in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine starting on Monday next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600005#D00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1389869400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>There is a report highlighted in Ms Mary Regan's article in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i> today, where a letter from the HSE to the Committee of Public Accounts shows that the administrator appointed by the executive has found significant issues related to the final salary payment and retirement packages approved for the former executive of the CRC.  No doubt further issues will arise today at the committee with regard to the former chief's appearance there.  The furthering of the scandal continues to erode the people's confidence in the charity sector.  I believe that we need something to bolster this confidence and would call for the establishment of a charity quality standard to help restore confidence in the sector.  A mark such as this could be awarded to charities that adhere to certain standards, such as publishing annual accounts and using a fixed amount of donations to pay for administration.  No doubt we need the Charities Bill to be implemented but in the interim, a measure such as this would go a long way towards bolstering the damaged reputation of charities.  Charitable donations have slumped over the Christmas and have continued to be below expectation.  In fact, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has suffered a massive 25% drop in donations and there is little doubt that other voluntary organisations are experiencing a similar drop-off in charitable giving.  Public confidence in the charity sector is understandably shaken and we need to conduct an urgent reappraisal of how we can benchmark and grade the charities.  Establishing a quality standard for charities would help people that they are donating with confidence, safe in the knowledge that their money will be spent on services for the vulnerable or needy.  I would urge the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, on the charities sector in general and the Bill in particular.  It would afford me the opportunity to raise with him the possibility of an interim measure, such as a quality standard mark for charities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600005#D00400","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1389869400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I would ask the Deputy Leader to clarify to the House the position on the human tissue Bill.  She might recall that during the summer we sat for a day to debate the issue of organ donation and in the course of that debate, a number of statements were made including the following - by the acting Minister of Health, because, apparently, the Minister was on holidays - that the heads of the human tissue Bill were being drafted by the Department and that, in addition to the area of organ donation and transplantation, the Bill will cover a large range of issues.  I believe Members made these statements in good faith because they were told that the human tissue Bill was due to come before the Oireachtas in the following parliamentary session, that is, the one just gone.  That statement was made by a Senator on the opposite side of the House.  It was stated that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy White, were working on the human tissue Bill that was out for public consultation.  Another Member opposite stated that the human tissue Bill would continue the Government's work in this area in the autumn.  What is happening the human tissue Bill?  According to the legislative programme for the coming session, as to the status of the Bill, the date on which publication is expected cannot be indicated at this stage.  Those are only some of the statements made by Members opposite in the debate on organ transplantation and donation held in August last.  Perhaps the whip of the Fine Gael Party could get clarification as to why his members were misled.  They did not mislead the House; they were given information that the human tissue Bill would be published in the autumn session last year and that did not happen.<\/p> <p>One would expect the Whip to demand that the human tissue Bill be dealt with in this session, yet the legislative programme shows that the heads of the Bill have yet to be approved despite the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, stated the legislation would be ready last session.  Will the Whip or acting Whip let us know when the Bill will arrive in this House?  Perhaps he will seek clarification as to why the members of Fine Gael and Labour were misled and given information that the Bill, which according to the Minister of State was to solve all the organ donation and transplantation problems, did not appear when they were told it would appear.  It is not going to appear this session either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600005#D00500","speaker":"1159","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389870000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I think the Senator has scored another wide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600006#E00200","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1389870000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>The Senator should keep looking after NAMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600006#E00300","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1389870000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>We will have no Kerry chitchat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600006#E00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1389870000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>The Senator for NAMA speaks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600006#E00500","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1389870000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I have two issues to raise with the Deputy Leader.

The second of my Bills, co-sponsored by my good colleagues Senators van Turnhout and Daly and which is to ban the practice of smoking in cars when children are present, seems to be terminally glued up.

On 19 December, a statement was issued on behalf of the St. Vincent's hospital group concerning matters that had arisen in respect of an episode in which it dishonestly billed the VHI and other insurers for a large amount of money in respect of drugs that had been provided for free.  The statement was made by an official of the hospital on 19 December and it was widely disseminated that what occurred was a genuine error.  I need to bring to the attention of anyone who is interested that there is an ample number of documents that show it was not an error but known at multiple levels through the administration of the private hospital at the time.  While it can be argued that 2002 was a different time, that standards then were different and more lax, and that there was, perhaps, a cowboy mentality at play in various parts of the public service, the administrative reaction to the occurrence then and since has been extremely unsatisfactory and constitutes a cover-up.  In this regard, I would like to clarify a speech I made on Thursday, 18 December before Christmas.  I should have been more precise when I dissociated myself and my activities from the board of St. Vincent's Hospital, not from the hospital itself.  I have nothing but respect for the sterling work done by my nursing and medical colleagues in St. Vincent's.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600006#E00700","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1389870000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600006#E00800","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1389870000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>However, one realises there has not been since the First World War a better example of lions led by donkeys than the situation that applied in this case.

I agree with him that it is important that this matter be tackled wherever there was storm damage.  People were enduring terrible conditions as a result of the damage from severe weather between 13 December and 6 January.  The initial estimate for cleaning up and restoring pubilc infrastructure caused by the damage nationally is &euro;65 million.  Almost two thirds of this pertains to counties Clare and Galway.  As the Senator said, other counties may not have reported the same amount of damage.  Clearly, however, there is damage elsewhere.  I will certainly apprise Minister of State Deputy Brian Hayes of the need to ensure the minor works scheme will apply wherever damage has occurred.<\/p><p>Senator MacSharry also raised the issue of Irish Water.  The majority of Senators raised that issue today.  I remind colleagues that the Leader said yesterday he has arranged for a debate on Irish Water next week.  I pointed out yesterday that it would be useful for us to have that debate when we have heard all the responses from both the management of Irish Water and the Minister on their having appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  We are now in possession of more information.  The Senator asked a very pertinent question on how many former local authority staff in receipt of lump sums are now employed by Irish Water.  I have not gone through the transcripts from yesterday.  I just looked at the reports to see whether the question was asked.  One would have expected it to have been asked at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts yesterday.  I do not see a response in that regard.  I do see a response in which the management of Irish Water says all those in senior management positions were appointed following open competition.  Irish Water told the Minister that and he accepted it.  It is certainly one of the issues that may be raised in the debate next week in the House.<\/p><p>Senator Coghlan raised the issue of the Liebherr plant in Killarney.  We all share his concern about the news of difficulties at the plant.  We sympathise with those whose jobs are uncertain.  We all agree with the Senator on the need to ensure a resolution to the matter and on his suggestion that the Labour Relations Commission should be involved.<\/p><p>Senator Zappone spoke in appreciation of the moment of silence.  I share her view.  I find a moment of silence to be a very good way to start a day in the Legislature.  I hope that other Houses, including the D&aacute;il, will follow suit.  It was a good compromise that we reached at the CPP to allow for a moment of silence before the prayer to reflect the fact that not everyone here is a practising Christian.<\/p><p>Senator Zappone also raised the issue of the Immigrant Council of Ireland and its report on racism.  I saw the report and agree it is a matter of real concern to see the rise in reported incidents of racism.  It would be good to have the Minister for Justice and Equality present in the House to have a debate on the supports for victims of racism.  I will ask the Leader to arrange that.  A particular issue we might all pursue with the Minister is the need to have legislation introduced providing aggravated sentencing for crimes motivated by racism, which are often referred to as hate crimes.  We have seen such legislation enacted in other jurisdictions.  It has a powerful deterrent and symbolic effect as well as a practical effect.<\/p><p>Senator Sean Barrett raised the issue of Irish Water and pointed out that, between debates in the Houses and committees, 30 hours of parliamentary time have been devoted to it.  It would certainly have been helpful if the relevant information had been furnished in the first instance; we would all agree on that.  There are still matters we do not know about but there is more information available following very detailed and forensic questioning at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The point the Senator made on the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General is one I am sure will be made to the Minister during next week's debate, including by the Senator in a very eloquent manner.  We all like the fact that the Freedom of Information Act will be extended to Irish Water.  This is an important and positive development arising from the controversy.<\/p><p>Senator Kelly welcomed the announcements of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on turf-cutting and the redesignation of bogs.  We would all agree with that.<\/p><p>Senator O'Donovan referred to Irish Water and mentioned the slightly different issue of fluoridation.  Senator Norris organised a debate on that during which Minister of State Deputy Alex White spoke.  I am sure this issue will arise in the House again.  Senator O'Donovan also referred to the debate on rural development.  The Leader promised to arrange a debate on this with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine next week.  I will certainly request an extension of speaking time during that debate.<\/p><p>Senator Conway referred to Irish Water and expressed concern over bonuses.  We have addressed that.  The debate will be held next week.<\/p><p>Senator Norris referred to the plight of single fathers.  He raised this based on the very tragic circumstances of the case reported in today's papers arising from the judgment of Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns in the High Court arising from a Dublin maternity hospital's application.<\/p> <p>It is an utterly tragic case and none of knows the full circumstances but I think everyone will want to join in offering sympathy to the grandmother and the father, in particular, and the family of both the young woman and the baby who lost their lives.

Certainly, the Labour Party group set aside Private Members' time to debate this issue.

The Seanad is determined to modernise its procedures and actively engage with civic society.  To begin this process, we have changed Standing Orders to allow persons and representatives in public and civic life to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  As we strive to reform our procedures to make this House more accessible, it is appropriate that we should hear from Mr. Arnold in his role as chairperson of the Convention on the Constitution which, essentially, is a forum in which Irish citizens can have a say on possible changes to the Constitution and how we could adapt and develop it to make it more relevant to the Ireland of the 21st century.  It is fair to describe the convention as a new venture in participative democracy in Ireland.  <\/p><p>As Members are aware, the Convention on the Constitution is a forum of 100 people representative of Irish society and parliamentarians from the island of Ireland.  It was established to consider and make recommendations on a number of matters, including the reduction of the presidential term of office to five years and its alignment with local and European elections; the reduction of the voting age to 17 years; a review of the D&aacute;il electoral system; Irish citizens' right to vote at Irish embassies in presidential elections; provisions for same sex marriage; an amendment to the clause on the role of women in the home and encouraging the greater participation of women in public life and politics; and the removal of the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.<\/p><p>It is just over one year since the convention held its first meeting.  Therefore, it is fitting that we get Mr. Arnold's perspective on the work of the convention to date and how he sees our political, administrative and social structures adapting and changing in the modern world.  Before he became chairperson of the convention, he had extensive experience of chairing and serving in governmental and non-governmental boards in Ireland and internationally.  He worked as chief executive of Concern worldwide from October 2001, prior to which he worked as assistant Secretary General in the then Department of Agriculture and Food.  He worked as chief economist with ACOT, the farm advisory and training body, and the European Commission.<\/p><p>We thank Mr. Arnold for agreeing to appear before the Seanad and welcome him to the Chamber.

This is a very welcome initiative.  I will use the opportunity to speak on the Convention of the Constitution and will not only update Members on our work but also offer some reflections on what we have learned in the past year, lessons which may have some relevance for our wider democracy.<\/p><p>The first formal meeting of the Convention on the Constitution took place in Dublin Castle on 1 December 2012.  Resolutions in the Houses of the Oireachtas in July 2012 had defined our task as follows: to examine and make recommendations on eight specific aspects of the Constitution and, having completed these eight issues, &quot;such other relevant constitutional amendments that the Convention might recommend&quot;.  The presence of the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the leaders of all political parties and groupings, as well as the location, lent a sense of history to our first meeting.  For convention members, it represented the start of an uncertain journey, but there was also a quiet awareness that, potentially, our work could be historic.  In my opening address I stated, &quot;We owe it to the current generation, and our children's generation, to have a Constitution which reflects the values and aspirations of the Irish people, and to which they are prepared to vote allegiance.&quot;  As citizens and convention members, we would have the rare privilege of helping to shape the Constitution and, thereby, the future of the country.<\/p><p>I was conscious that the convention was not the first body tasked with recommending changes to the Constitution.  I acknowledged the work of the Oireachtas committee chaired by George Colley in the late 1960s, the Constitution review group chaired by Dr. T.K. Whitaker in the mid-1990s and the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution which was chaired by the Leas-Chathaoirleach and produced 11 reports from 1997 to 2006.  I committed that the recommendations and insights from that earlier work would be taken into account during our deliberations.<\/p><p>The Government's decision to establish a convention of this kind was an innovative approach to constitutional reform.  It represented a leap of faith that 100 citizens, 66 chosen as representative of the electoral register, 33 from politics and an independent chairman, could make informed recommendations about what was best for the country and its future.<\/p><p>The invitation to the political parties in Northern Ireland to participate in the convention reflected the new political reality on the island, shaped by the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrew's Agreement and the political structures and possibilities which have emerged from these Agreements.  It was gratifying that four of the Northern parties, the Alliance Party, the Green Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP, accepted the invitation to participate.<\/p><p>Whatever about the positive feeling at our opening meeting, it is fair to say we set about our task against the background of scepticism from a number of politicians and commentators.  There was scepticism about the agenda of issues we had been given, judged by some to be too narrow.  Others questioned if this model of deliberative democracy, involving citizens and politicians, would work at all.  There were very few examples of similar initiatives internationally and, therefore, we would be working through uncharted territory.  Other voices questioned whether the Government would take the exercise seriously, notwithstanding the fact that the Oireachtas resolutions contained the clear commitment that, within four months of the convention producing a report on an issue, &quot;the Government would provide a response to each recommendation of the Convention and, if accepting the recommendation, will indicate the timeframe it envisages for the holding of any related referendum&quot;.  Today is an opportunity to update Members on our work thus far and how we have gone about it and to reflect on some of the lessons we can draw from this experience.  I will start with what we have done and the response of the Oireachtas and the Government to our reports.<\/p><p>We started in January 2013 and held seven formal meetings of the convention during 2013.  Over these seven meetings we dealt with the eight specific issues set out in the Oireachtas resolutions.  We have produced five reports which cover seven of the eight issues and a sixth report dealing with the eighth issue, blasphemy, will issue shortly.  Arising from the first five reports we made 22 recommendations, some of which would require constitutional change and, therefore, referendums, but others could be implemented through legislation.  In order to efficiently use my time today and in the interests of the Seanad and the public record, I have a complete listing of the convention's recommendations and the Government's response to them in an annexe to my speech.  In summary, the first three of our reports have already been debated in the D&aacute;il.  Members of the D&aacute;il, particularly those who participated in the work of the convention, have, in general, been positive about the process.  The Government has committed to holding three referendums on the voting age, the age of candidacy for presidential candidates and same sex marriage.  A number of the convention's recommendations have been referred to the relevant Oireachtas committees or task forces for further consideration.<\/p><p>The remaining issue in our terms of reference, &quot;such other relevant constitutional amendments that the Convention might recommend&quot;, evoked considerable interest among many citizens and civil society groups.  We received over 700 submissions giving views on what should be covered under this element of our work programme.  Because of this interest, we held nine meetings around the country during October and November which were attended by about 1,000 people.  Having read the submissions and listened to what had been said at the public meetings, the convention members voted to select two issues to be dealt with in the remaining two plenary meetings to be held in February.  These issues are D&aacute;il reform and economic, social and cultural rights.<\/p><p>I have given Members the main facts about our work and the output arising from it; however I will use my remaining time to talk about how we did our work.  This could be of relevance for any future convention which may be established.<\/p><p>At the first working meeting of the convention in January 2013 I proposed five operational principles which should underpin our work.  I would like to reflect both on these principles and how they were operated in practice.<\/p><p>The first principle was openness: that the convention would operate with complete transparency, with all plenary sessions being broadcast live on our website and all documentation being freely available.  We would be open to hearing from all sections of society on any issue.  All sections of society took us at our word.  We received 2,500 submissions.  There were 350,000 visits to our website from 144 countries.  There was 100 hours of televised live streaming of the seven meetings held.<\/p> <p>In September, when we discussed possible voting rights in presidential elections for citizens living outside the State, we hosted a global conversation involving representatives of Irish communities in Australia, Germany, France, the UK, the US and Canada.  We made a conscious effort to reach out not only to Irish citizens living on this island but to the global Irish wherever they were.<\/p><p> The second principle was fairness, as it was important that the full spectrum of views was heard on every issue and that the briefing materials for convention members were of the highest quality.  For each of our seven meetings, we were fortunate to have access to the best minds and most eminent experts in the country.  Our academic and legal team, led by Professor David Farrell of UCD, played a critical role working with these experts to deliver the highest quality impartial material to our members.  We were asked to deal with a number of sensitive and complex issues such as same-sex marriage and blasphemy.  We tried very hard to ensure both sides of the argument were fairly represented to the convention members through our choice of independent experts who provided briefings and through the various advocacy groups who presented to the convention.<\/p><p> The third principle was equality of voice.  There were some initial concerns that politicians, with their greater expertise in public affairs and public speaking than most of the citizen members, would dominate proceedings.  Therefore, the principle that there should be equality of voice among all convention members, including citizens, Oireachtas Members and members of the Northern Ireland Assembly, was of critical importance.  As it turned out, this was not a problem.  The citizen members proved more than capable of holding their own in the discussions and the interaction between citizens and politicians has been a particular highlight of the way in which debates have been conducted.<\/p><p> The fourth principle was efficiency.  Our meetings took place at weekends over a day and a half, during which expert presentations were made, advocacy groups were listened to and convention members engaged in round-table discussions.  People absorbed a lot of information, weighed up arguments and eventually made up their minds to vote on an issue at the end of Sunday morning.  This all required detailed planning of the agenda for meetings.  We made effective use of a steering group of citizens and politicians in planning agendas and agreeing on experts and advocacy groups.  This involved tight timekeeping, strict chairing, and convention members being disciplined in their interventions.<\/p><p> The final principle was collegiality.  It was clear from the beginning that if our group of 100 people was to succeed in its task we would have to operate in a spirit of collegiality, friendship and common purpose.  We worked hard to create a warm and cheerful atmosphere and an environment where we could consider sensitive issues in a respectful manner.  Many close friendships were formed over these weekends and, for quite a few members, the experience of being part of the convention has been an immensely enriching personal experience.   This has all contributed to the commitment and seriousness of purpose with which the citizen and politician members of the convention have carried out their work.<\/p><p> I must also pay tribute to the convention secretariat, who are here with us today, who have provided tremendous service to the convention members and made all the practical arrangements for the working of the convention with great efficiency.  Richard Holland, Nason Fallon and Amy Brennan have each contributed substantially to the work of the convention.  The secretariat has been led with imagination and effectiveness by Art O'Leary, who has been a tremendous support to me in my role as chairman and who is one of the finest public servants with whom I have ever worked.<\/p><p> The facilities provided by the manager and staff of the Grand Hotel in Malahide played their part in creating a good work environment for the convention.  Pi Communications did an exceptional job broadcasting our sessions and the Escher Group provided us with an outstanding website, both of which helped the convention communicate our message and our work.<\/p><p> As we come close to the conclusion of our work, what lessons do I draw from the work of the convention over the past year?  As chairman of the convention I venture these views to the Members of the Seanad as initial reflections rather than hard-formed conclusions.  It will be for others to make a rounded judgement on the value of the convention, on whether this model of deliberative democracy, or a variant of it, is worth trying again, and, more generally, on what role citizen participation models should play in our democracy.  My initial reflection is that the convention model we have operated has been perceived as a success.  We have secured a significant level of public engagement, as evidenced by the number of submissions, the number of people who followed our proceedings and the range of individuals and civil society groups who wished to engage with the convention.<\/p><p> The fact that citizens and politicians were involved in the process has been positive.  Over our year's work, the level of mutual respect between the two groups clearly increased.  A major benefit of the engagement of politicians in the process is that they contribute to the recommendations the convention makes and, in consequence, are more likely to be supportive of these recommendations when the convention reports are debated in the Oireachtas.  The lack of political involvement has been highlighted as a disadvantage in other countries which attempted to deliver other models of citizens' assembly.<\/p><p> One area which may require some further thought if a future convention is established is that the timeframe of debating an issue and arriving at conclusions and recommendations over a weekend may be too ambitious for certain complex issues.  We must remember that many of these issues are new to citizen members and we must allow them develop a sufficient depth of knowledge on the subject matter and a period of reflection to consider the implications of constitutional change.<\/p><p> My second comment relates to the role the convention plays in the broader task of constitutional reform.  Its role, as assigned, was to examine issues and make recommendations.  It is the first link in a chain between the recommendations of the convention and a decision by the sovereign people to change our Constitution.  The convention has done what it was asked to do and we have made our recommendations through our reports.  The D&aacute;il has debated three reports and the Government has responded through a set of decisions either to bring issues to a referendum or to assign them for further work to relevant committees or task forces.  I believe the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas have treated the convention's work with seriousness and respect.<\/p><p> The last link in the decision chain will be to bring a number of different issues to decision by the people through referendum, and it is here that there will be a real challenge.  In recent referendums many of the voting public did not engage adequately with the issue before them, with the result that turnout was low.  If the solemn process of constitutional reform is to be carried out, our political system, in association with our wider society, will to have to find improvements in the way we organise referendums.<\/p><p> My final comment relates to what I have learned from the people who have engaged with the convention over the past year.  These people value and care for their Constitution.  Many people would like various changes and are willing to advocate for change.  It is clear people want to see political reform.  When the convention discussed D&aacute;il electoral reform in May and June, it voted to retain the electoral system we have but recommended a series of other reforms which would facilitate greater political engagement and other measures to improve voter turnout.<\/p><p> In my opening address to the convention in Dublin Castle I noted that<blockquote>[T]rust in the political system has diminished.  In some of our public discourse, there is a cynicism and a sense of alienation which is unhealthy for our society and, ultimately, dangerous for our democracy.<\/blockquote>As we approach the end of the convention, I am heartened by the fact that, notwithstanding this cynicism, many people still care deeply about what is written in our Constitution, about political values and standards, and about investing in the health of our democracy as a means of creating a better future for this country.  It is been a real privilege to have played a part in starting this important public conversation about our Constitution and its role in an evolving Irish society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600008#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Arnold","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389871800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I remind the principal speakers that they have five minutes each.

I was very impressed with that.  The debates can cover so many issues under any heading and he showed a great ability to keep matters under control.  As a member of the Constitutional Convention I have been present during the consideration of areas that have come before it and these have been important issues, many of which Mr. Arnold has referred to.<\/p><p>The issues considered include the reduction of the presidential term of office to five years and the alignment with local and European elections; reduction of the voting age to 16; review of the D&aacute;il electoral system; Irish citizens' right to vote at Irish embassies in presidential elections; provisions for same-sex marriage; amendment to the clause on the role of women in the home; encouraging greater participation of women in public life; increasing women's participation in politics; and the removal of the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.  This is the sixth report, now in draft and awaiting publication.<\/p><p>These matters were all worth considering and debating.  While I and others would not necessarily have fully agreed with the results and recommendations on all issues, for example I did not fully agree with the reduction of the voting age to 16, the debates on all these issues were extremely worthwhile.  I join with Mr. Arnold's comments on the scepticism and cynicism that existed in advance.  Long before I knew I would be appointed to it, I was somewhat sceptical of the creation of such a convention.  It has been widely accepted, as Mr. Arnold said, that is has been a great success.  Even journalists who attended the convention and who had been cynical or sceptical about its creation have accepted it has been a worthwhile pursuit.<\/p><p>From the outside I was curious about how such a citizens' assembly would work, having seen the We the Citizens initiative come before and the Canadian citizens' assembly.  In both cases politicians did not have such a direct role.  The make-up of the convention, with two thirds randomly selected citizens and one third parliamentarians, proved to be one of its greatest strengths.  It opened up real debate and allowed the politicians to explain the practicalities of certain ideas from a legislative perspective without being too imposing or steering the convention too much.  That was a fear at the beginning.  In the first few meetings the politicians spoke more than the lay members.  As Mr. Arnold said, many of the citizens showed themselves well capable of voicing their views and opinions throughout the process.  I greatly agree with the inclusion of the Northern Ireland members.  I thought that was very positive and the certainly added to the debate.<\/p><p>As Mr. Arnold said, the convention has published five reports with the sixth due shortly, and the D&aacute;il has already debated three of them.  The Government has committed to holding referenda in 2015 on same-sex marriage, a reduction in the voting age and the need to amend the language in Article 41.2 on the role of women in the in home.  Although there has been much talk about referendum fatigue, I hope we will address this during this Government.  There were many interesting debates.  One of particular interest to many of us women was on female participation in politics.  We heard that Ireland has one of the lowest levels of female representation in the EU with just 15% of D&aacute;il Deputies being female.  Almost 50% of the members of the Constitutional Convention were female.  During a discussion I said at times I felt there was an inherent sexism in politics and remarked on the comments that are regularly made that many men do not even realise are inherently sexist.  While this fight will have to be fought for many years, the debate was very useful and sparked a wider debate in the public that is welcome and needs to be discussed.<\/p><p>The Constitutional Convention was a major success and I hope to see it repeated in years to come.  Holding it every three years would be a practical timeframe and that should be considered.  I thank Mr. Arnold for his confident stewardship as he chaired the convention and to the Oireachtas Members who participated and the members of the public, who were tremendously engaged throughout the process.  As Mr. Arnold said, the engagement from the public at large was excellent and social media and the website facilitated this.  I commend Mr. Arnold, Mr. Art O'Leary and the rest of the team on their work.  As well as everything else they were extremely nice and courteous to work with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600009#J00300","speaker":"1153","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389872400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>It might be a good omen for the role of women in the Constitution that six of our seven first speakers are all ladies.

As a member of the Constitutional Convention I have been very impressed by how Mr. Arnold has chaired it and the efficient way his team organised all our meetings, communicating with us before the event, ensuring things worked well on the day, as has been mentioned ensuring everybody got an opportunity to speak.  The role of the facilitators at each table has been crucial.  If people, particularly some of the citizens at our first meeting, were a little nervous about speaking up the facilitators reached out, asked people if they wanted to add anything, whether they agreed, and ensured everybody was heard and that conversations were not dominated by politicians or by the more vocal citizens.  They ensured everybody had an equal say.  That has been crucial.<\/p><p>As has already been stated, the Constitutional Convention has been a new venture in this country and is not a common way of deliberating on political issues internationally.  It has been tried only in a couple of countries.  There was a lot of cynicism at the beginning.  As Senator Noone mentioned, there was cynicism from some of the members about whether it would work and from the media that it would be dominated by politicians and people pushing particular agendas.  There was a debate on marriage equality, which is a sensitive issue and which in media debates often just results in people shouting each other down, not often in the most sensible articulation of the issues.  More journalists attended that session because it is such a politically hot topic and several of them said at the end that they were incredibly impressed by how it worked and that that debate alone had got rid of any cynicism they had about the process.<\/p><p>Overall the Constitutional Convention has worked extremely well.  The expert presentations ensured the members were well-informed and that we heard from both sides of the debate.  The engagement, particularly from citizen members, has been very impressive.  We debated a number of issues including the voting age, length of the presidential term, women's role in the home, participation of women in politics, marriage equality, the D&aacute;il electoral system, votes for Irish citizens abroad and whether the offence of blasphemy should be removed from the Constitution.  On each of these we have seen real engagement, not just with the specific questions the Government put to us but also willingness by members to go beyond that.<\/p><p>At our first meeting we discussed the voting age and the presidential term and within ten minutes most members had decided they were not particularly interested in the length of the presidential term.  Probably only one person in the country cares a lot about the length of the term, whether it is five or seven years - maybe two people, maybe the President's wife - but there was great engagement around the nomination process in particular, reflecting the controversy that took place during the last presidential election and the difficulty some candidates had.<\/p> <p>I am sure Senator Norris will refer in his contribution to the problems that non-party candidates face in getting onto the presidential ballot. \u00a0He spoke strongly about it at the\u00a0meeting. \u00a0In respect of the electoral system for the D&aacute;il, the issues arising in changing the system were considered and people also wanted us to investigate how the Houses of the Oireachtas operate. \u00a0It was suggested that elections may not be as key as a properly functioning Parliament which prevents excessive Executive control.\u00a0 It is heartening that the Government has accepted most of the convention's recommendations. \u00a0We are still awaiting a response on some of our reports, however.<\/p><p>We had a particularly positive debate on the issue of marriage equality. \u00a0Once citizens and members of the convention had heard both sides of the debate, there was overwhelming support - 80% - for equality not only for same-sex couples but also for their families. \u00a0I welcome the fact that the Government is committed to holding a referendum on this issue and it is sensible to deal with some of the family issues first given that they do not require constitutional change. \u00a0It is essential that the legislation is not delayed, however. \u00a0The family relationship and children Bill is on the A list for the Minister for Justice and Equality but we need to bring it through the Houses at the earliest opportunity so that we can then prepare for a referendum. \u00a0Concern has been expressed by some civil society groups that there may be delays and that the referendum will not be held next year as promised. \u00a0That is an issue I will continue to press.<\/p><p>It is essential that the Government does more than accept recommendations on matters it had intended to address in any event.  It must also consider those with which it is not comfortable. \u00a0The recommendation on the presidential nomination process was kicked to a committee for consideration. \u00a0I hope it has not been sent there to die. \u00a0The same applies to other recommendations with which the Government does not agree. \u00a0It is only when these recommendations have been taken seriously and put to the people that the convention will regarded as a truly worthwhile exercise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600010#K00400","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389873000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I am delighted to welcome Mr. Tom Arnold to the House in his capacity as chairperson of the Constitutional Convention. \u00a0Many of us had asked for the opportunity to invite him to address us, and this is a good moment to do so as the convention moves to the final stage of its deliberations. \u00a0It has completed the original tasks set for it with two sessions still to be held.<\/p><p>  I am privileged to be the leader of the Labour Party delegation at the convention and have actively engaged with its work. \u00a0I join other speakers in paying tribute to the excellent chairing by Mr. Arnold and the work of the secretariat, led by the highly effective Mr. Art O'Leary, Mr. Richard Holland, Mr. Nason Fallon and Ms Amy Brennan, along with the experts, Professor David Farrell, Dr. Jane Suiter and Ms Lia O'Hegarty, and the facilitators and note takers.  This has been a positive experience for most of us, whether political or citizen members. \u00a0Several citizen members have told me how much they will personally miss the experience of partaking in such an important task in a collegiate and positive atmosphere in the Grand Hotel. \u00a0The round-table discussions have been instructive and stimulating for all of us, and it was all done on what Mr. O'Leary memorably described as a very low budget of &quot;about a fiver&quot;.<\/p><p>  The first of two personal highlights for me was the result on the vote on marriage equality, with a majority of 79% voting in favour of a referendum to allow the definition of marriage to be opened to include gay couples as well as straight couples.  This had an enormous impact on civil society and provided a boost to LGBT groups around Ireland. \u00a0The second highlight was a moving moment at the convention when we were debating voting rights for citizens residing outside this jurisdiction.  We had a video link-up with citizens resident in other countries, who spoke powerfully about their attachment to Ireland and their desire to continue engaging with the Irish State through voting rights.<\/p><p>  It would be useful to use the short time available to us to reflect on the work of the convention and its potential for future work. \u00a0A book edited by Theo Dorgan,\u00a0<i>Foundation Stone: Notes towards a Constitution for a 21st Century Republic<\/i>, was prompted by the work of the convention. \u00a0I must point out that I am a contributor to that book. \u00a0Many of the articles in the book reflect on the convention, while recognising that there will be time for further reflection once its work is complete.<\/p><p>  The establishment of the convention shortly after the celebration of the 75th birthday of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann in 1937 is timely. \u00a0At the time of the 75th anniversary, many of us on the academic legal side were engaged in an assessment of its current status and future direction. \u00a0There was a strongly held academic view that the Constitution did not need substantial change and that it remained an adequate reflection of the core principles of our nation's governance. \u00a0An alternative view, which I shared, was that the Constitution required radical amendment on a number of grounds. \u00a0The convention has contributed to these radical amendments in a positive way.\u00a0 The Constitution is outdated in a number of ways. \u00a0While I agree that it has served us very well as a foundational document, in terms of the governance of the State we need to re-examine the provisions on political structures. \u00a0An obvious point that the convention has not addressed - perhaps it is not appropriate for it to do so - is that the word &quot;republic&quot; is not used in the text of the Constitution. \u00a0Our legal status as a Republic is not recognised constitutionally. \u00a0More substantively, there is a major need for D&aacute;il reform. \u00a0I am glad we will be assessing this on 1 February.<\/p><p>  Issues arise in respect of the theocratic nature of the Irish State in the past. \u00a0While this longer holds for the State, it is reflected in the text of the Constitution. \u00a0We have made a number of recommendations to change that, including, notably, the recommendation on changing the definition of marriage to ensure equality for gay couples and the recommendation on the role of women, which reflects the reality of Ireland today. \u00a0There should be a gender-neutral provision recognising the role of carers and we should eliminate any specific reference to women's role in the home. \u00a0I am glad we have made a recommendation on the removal of blasphemy as an offence under the Constitution. \u00a0That will provide us with an opportunity to fundamentally alter the theocratic or religious aspects of the text.\u00a0 I would like a future convention to investigate other Articles in more depth, such as the religious oath and the preamble, and to consider removing religious references more completely. \u00a0That may be work for a future convention.\u00a0 We have seen immense passion from the hundreds of people who made submissions and attended our public meetings. \u00a0Many of them hoped that a future convention would examine other issues in more depth.<\/p><p>  We also need to revise the Constitution to ensure the Articles on our fundamental rights reflect a communitarian ethos. \u00a0They currently reflect the civil-political approach of liberal philosophy. \u00a0For this reason, I welcome the fact that the second issue we will be considering at our final meeting of 22 February will be economic, social and cultural rights. \u00a0Whatever recommendations we make in this regard, I hope we recommend the inclusion of these as enforceable rights in the Constitution. \u00a0That would represent a move for the Constitution away from the ideologies of the 1930s and towards a more communitarian and pluralist vision of a Republic for the 21st century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600011#L00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1389873000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I join my colleagues in welcoming Mr. Tom Arnold and hail his leadership in the operation of the convention, with the support of his very able right-hand man, Mr. Art O'Leary, and his team.  Others have mentioned Professor David Farrell, Dr. Jane Suiter and Lia O'Hegarty.  I commend these and all the other experts who support our deliberations.  I speak as a Member of the Independent group of Taoiseach's nominees.  As all of us wanted to participate, we decided that each of us would bring different topics to the convention.  That appears to have worked very well.  I have attended only one session but I look forward to attending the meeting on economic, social and cultural rights.  I and others in my group were able to engage in the debates even though we did not have the ongoing relationship enjoyed by some of our colleagues who had attended all of the weekends.<\/p> <p>In that regard I congratulate Mr. Arnold on behalf of all of my colleagues.  I did not attend the first opening.<\/p><p> I compliment Mr. Arnold on his opening statement, particularly the way he outlined the operational principles that provided conceptual and practical leadership.  It was important that the five principles of openness, fairness, equality of voice, efficiency and collegiality were outlined, and I now understand why the convention has been such a success.  That was my experience of that one weekend, where I saw the principles in operation.  It was also the weekend of the recommendation about marriage equality, and I experienced an extraordinarily personal joy in participating.  There were great celebrations throughout the country as a result of that particular meeting.  <\/p><p> I commend the Government on its establishment and resourcing of the Constitutional Convention.  I also commend it on its support for the convention's consideration of the two additional themes.  We did not know there would be two themes and presumed there would just be one.  The themes came from the people and the politicians.  My view is that the original scope of topics was disappointingly narrow.  I ask Mr. Arnold to give his analysis of the scope of topics, particularly the significance of adding other topics suggested by citizens and politicians.<\/p><p> I wish to refer to another point that Mr. Arnold mentioned.  The convention is, was and continues to be a civic forum and model of deliberative democracy for politicians and citizens.  It is deliberative as distinct from participative.  Being deliberative makes it more authoritative and means there is more opportunity not just to deeply reflect but also to have a real exchange of views based on the expertise offered prior to and during the event.  Other colleagues, as politicians, have commented on the experience.  It was an extraordinary experience for me and, initially, I had to make an effort to listen to the citizens.  We had to step back, stop speaking and listen, and, through doing so, I imagined myself to be a mutual partner with citizens in the analysis of constitutional change.  Mr. Arnold has spoken about and others have mentioned the mix of citizens and politicians and its advantages.  I have reflected on the social partnership model and have often thought that one of its great disadvantages was that politicians did not deliberate with citizens or representative groups.  A mix has extraordinary advantages but also challenges.<\/p><p> I wish to make a final comment which is also a question for Mr. Arnold.  All of us are well aware of the legal theory that the Constitution is a living document and stays alive.  That is especially true when citizens, politicians, Government, the courts and the President reinterpret the Constitution from the perspective of the insights and truths that are emerging from our current socioeconomic and ethical contexts.  I ask Mr. Arnold to comment on how or if the Constitutional Convention has supported the notion that the Constitution is a living document.  Which of the following is the most important?  Is it the process of the Constitutional Convention?  Is it the ultimate outcomes that put change to the people when recommended or is it maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>?  Finally, I congratulate Mr. Arnold on his innovative and principled leadership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600011#L00300","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389873600,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

I have always greatly admired his work on behalf of international charities, particularly Concern.  He has always been a gentlemanly, affable and generally fair-minded chairman of the convention. <\/p><p>So far we have had almost unalloyed emollients in the speeches.  I intend to break the pattern as there are a number of elephants in the room.  First, if we wish to carry out the business of a Constitutional Convention again we must make sure it is much more democratic.  The current convention was not fully democratic because the Government had us hog-tied from the beginning.  It set the terms of reference so that there was no room to manoeuvre and no possibility for us, as a democratic assembly, to attempt to set elements of our own interests and so on.<\/p><p>There is no point in avoiding the fact that while some of the issues addressed were highly significant and important, others were utterly trivial.  The Government stacked it up and managed, at one remove, to micro-manage the convention extremely efficiently in its own interest and not necessarily in the interest of the participation of people.  I was one of those who were a little cynical.  I was not sure what kinds of contribution we would receive from the other members at the table - the randomly selected people.  However, I was vastly impressed by the interest they took in the Constitution, by their devotion and the time they dedicated to thinking about it and by the quality of their contributions.  That, to me, was the single most inspiring thing about the entire convention.<\/p><p>I was prevented from attending the meeting on same-sex marriage.  On reflection, I am very glad I was because it cannot be said that I used rhetoric to sway views.  It was the people who spoke.  I gather that one of my colleagues spoke very strongly against the matter, yet the people in their wisdom were supportive.  Sometimes the people have a hell of a lot more sense than the Government or either House of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600012#M00300","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1389873600,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600012#M00400","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1389873600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>An example is the blasphemy business, which was complete nonsense.  I remember saying, when the Bill on blasphemy was debated in the House, that within a matter of weeks some of the Muslim countries would point to Ireland as an example.  Within a month Pakistan did so, but both Houses pushed the legislation through on the instruction of the Government.  That is another example of why we should not have democratic institutions micro-managed by the Government.<\/p><p>Mr. Arnold, in a very good and wide-ranging report and speech, said that the convention examined various matters, including the reports prepared by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, which produced 11 reports from 1997 to 2006.  I did my best to open up the convention to things such as Seanad reform, but that was prevented.  Before the convention got wise to my ways, however, I managed to raise the question of the Presidency - in a real way, not fluting around on the margins, which is basically what we did.  Nobody gives much of a damn about the term of office of the President.  However, I raised the matter at the convention because the chairman kindly allowed me to do so and gave latitude for it.  There was a discussion on it.  As many as 96% of the people - by far the largest vote ever in the convention - voted in favour of the role being opened up to citizen nomination.  Where is that stated in the report and recommendations that will be considered by the Government?  The one thing on which there was almost 100% agreement has been omitted.  It is not only that.  I have in my hand a Bill that was produced by the present Government parties in 1997 in which they suggested, among other things, that 20,000 citizens should be able to nominate.  Where is that stated in the report?<\/p><p>With regard to Seanad reform - I know I am going over old ground - we were very timid and the people were intimidated, quite deliberately in my opinion, because it was said from the platform that if we dared to write a letter to the Taoiseach, the whole convention would collapse.  That was the amount of pressure that was applied to prevent the discussion of the single most important change in the Constitution, but the people decided, thank God, at the last moment, when it ceased being a vanity competition, although we all managed to get involved in it.  We won, and we changed the result from 60:40 in favour of the Government in just ten days.  I received correspondence just yesterday asking what had happened to the issue of presidential nominations.  We are lucky to have an excellent President who was elected through a situation that should be addressed in other ways.<\/p> <p>Well done, and I extend that to the distinguished visitors from the administration, although sometimes they were too close to the Government position.  It is an experiment well worth repeating but there should be provision, if we are going to be really democratic, for the citizens to have some role in selecting the items and in setting the agenda.  When the brief is determined by a Government with specific aims, it will make damn sure that is all that is considered.  The two items, including the question of the Seanad, are a blot.  The other blot is that the matter that got the most overwhelming support has been effectively buried, as is the constitutional habit of most Governments.  I would like Mr. Arnold to refer to that and see if we can advance it.  I intend to reintroduce the Government's Bill and see if we can do it through Parliament.

It was a breath of fresh air for the democratic process.  It has been such a success that there should be another convention with an extended remit to consider the myriad of constitutional matters that require consideration and reform.  I was privileged to have attended some of the meetings and in years to come I will look back at a historic shift in the deliberative democratic process that started with the convention.  I will be proud that I was part of it.<\/p><p>What struck me about the proceedings was the respectful way convention members - citizens and elected representatives - engaged with each other.  Concerns regarding a vast range of issues were listened to and discussed.  In many instances, real anxieties were dispelled and put to rest.  The convention was successful because of the professional, calm and efficient way in which the work was carried out.  I lend my support and thanks to the secretariat that undertook this work in an innovative way.  The engagement of citizen members and political leaders under the chairmanship of Mr. Arnold contributed to the efficient work and everyone acknowledges that the balance of speakers and presentations and the time allocated for each aspect of the topic ensured a wide spectrum of views were heard.<\/p><p>The Government is responding to each of the recommendations within three months but the next step is to follow through on actions.  As chairman of this historical and important group, how does Mr. Arnold feel about the action following the recommendations?  Are the actions moving quickly enough?  With regard to recommendations on the clause on the role of women, the greater participation by women in public life and the increase in the participation of women in politics, the Minister for Justice and Equality has established a task force to investigate the issues further with the response expected by October 2014.  That is included in the annexe.  Is there a need for another expert group to consider the matter given that much work has been done on these issues?  What is Mr. Arnold's opinion on that, especially in terms of the convention's work on thrashing out previous reports on the issue and expert opinion?  Is there a need for this task force report?<\/p><p>Given the breath of issues that arose during the Constitutional Convention, the vast array of subjects listed in the section on any other amendments and the powerful lobbying by citizens, NGOs and groups across the island and abroad, does Mr. Arnold think a fresh mandate is required for the convention?  As part of that, will Mr. Arnold have talks with the Taoiseach on how he feels any new convention may be shaped or managed and on the terms of reference required for it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600013#N00500","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1389874200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Senators may ask questions for one minute before we put them all to Mr. Arnold.

I am proud of the fact that the convention started as a Labour Party initiative arising from the speech of the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, to the Labour Party conference in 2010.  It was then adopted in the programme for Government and it is important to recognise the contribution of the Labour Party.<\/p><p>I am also proud to be a member elected by the parliamentary Labour Party to the convention.  I enjoyed it.  I would like to pay tribute to members of civil society who have engaged with convention.  They deserve a special mention.<\/p><p>The Constitution has been a living document and in previous decades it was down to the Supreme Court to push the envelope in establishing rights under the Constitution.  I was most struck at the Constitutional Convention by the extent to which Irish people have moved beyond where they were.  As an example, the proposal was to reduce the voting age to 17 and the convention went further and said it should be 16.  Excellent debate took place on the role of women, the importance of gender neutrality, the importance of wider society and the role of carers.  My question arises from the significant issues that arose.  The most exciting work of the convention is still to come and I am excited by the idea of the economic, social and cultural rights.  In various aspects of debate, the role of the family in modern day Irish society arose and how we must go beyond the traditional definition of family.  A number of matters were put to us and we had to vote on which matters should go forward.  Arising from the debate, it is difficult to see how we could not have a debate on the definition of the family in the Constitution.  Does Mr. Arnold favour extending the terms of the convention to discuss all matters that came through, including the role of the family, the issue of church and state as referred to by Senator Bacik and wider discussion on the environment?  Does Mr. Arnold favour extending the convention to focus on those issues that arose through the convention's discussions and in respect of which it might be possible to say we could not holistically look at the convention's work without discussing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600013#N00700","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1389874200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Arnold, who has such a distinguished record in agriculture, public service, research and media in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  His humanitarian record is celebrated in the Ellis Island medal for humanitarian activities.  Mr. Horace Plunkett was the person I had in mind as a former Member of the House.  Mr. Arnold comes here in his tradition.  I was interested in 66 members of the public.  When Senator Quinn and I went to see the Taoiseach at his request, we asked how someone from Belmullet could get to the convention and suggested it would be all people from Dublin 4 and Dublin 6.  That is why we suggested the use of the electoral register.  Part of the response was that one person lived up the mountain, had not been for years and would not go to a meeting on the constitution in Malahide.  How far beyond 66 people did the convention have to go to get 66 members?  We hoped the kind of excellent results our colleagues reported would happen.<\/p><p>  Some of the Northern Ireland parties participated.  Before Mr. Arnold finishes his term as chairman, I suggest he holds a meeting in Enniskillen or Belfast.  I am 90% of the way through Mr. Mark Carruthers book on Ulster identity which includes a large number of interviews.  No one in Northern Ireland regards themselves as British; they regard themselves as Irish or Northern Irish, and that includes people of a strong Unionist background.<\/p> <p>In the Trinity College Dublin constituency, in particular, there are people with Irish passports who support the Irish rugby team and are very loyal to the college.  A new definition of Irishness is needed by people in Northern Ireland.  NI21 represents such ideas.  The Alliance Party appeared to do some work in that regard, too.  I suggest a Constitution which reflects this.<\/p><p>A third point relates to economic, social and cultural rights.  I will speak briefly about the economic element.  Since 2008, in particular, this country has needed protection for citizens' property rights.  We have been bankrupted by banks, insurance companies, credit unions, accountants and the water industry and because of medical negligence.  Do we need a part in the Constitution to insure society and protect it from rapacious conduct such as this which has brought us to bankruptcy?  The Comptroller and Auditor General is an officer under the Constitution and I wonder if he should consider such issues.  There should be economic rights to protect us from what happened in the past few years.<\/p><p>I see a new Northern Ireland evolving very rapidly.  After the Seanad referendum, the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party asked me at Dublin Castle why County Donegal had voted &quot;No&quot;.

I will start, naturally enough, with the common theme.  <\/p><p>I thank Senators for their kind remarks about the manner in which the convention was run and my colleagues in the secretariat, which are absolutely deserved.  Senator Averil Power made an important comment on the role of facilitators, as they have been completely indispensable in how we have worked.  There is a process by which they assist in capturing the essence of the conversations that take place in the round-table discussions and feeding it back to the plenary sessions.  That has been very worthwhile.  From an organisation management perspective, what we have achieved in getting through work efficiently and arriving at conclusions within the available timeframes has been useful, if we are to consider this maturely.<\/p><p>Senator Susan O'Keeffe asked whether the papers had been overly academic.  We gave instructions from the very beginning to all of the academics that they had to present their material in clear language and concepts.  They largely succeeded in doing this, with much owed to the leadership of the academic and legal team.  Some of them have been mentioned, but I will name some of those who have not, including Dr. Clodagh Harris of University College, Cork, and Dr. Eoin O'Malley from Dublin City University, in addition to Dr. Jane Suiter, Ms Lia O'Hegarty  and Mr. David Farrell.  They have played a very important role.  There were other perspectives needed in addition to academic viewpoints.  This is where some of the advocacy groups came in with passion and arguments; they have been an equally indispensable part of the process.<\/p><p>Senator David Norris made a comment that the agenda had been set.  That was done by the Government following discussion with Opposition parties and the process of setting the agenda started some time in February 2012.  There were at least two formal interactions with Opposition parties and it was the outcome of these discussions that led to what was put before the Oireachtas and agreed to by resolution in July 2012.<\/p> <p>While it is debatable whether those issues were substantive or important enough to form part of the agenda, even the issues that might have appeared not to be as substantial as some people felt were quite substantive when we got down to discussing them.  We were not asked to debate any frivolous matters.<\/p><p>What was also built in, if one likes, was an item relating to any other business.  It was No. 9 on the agenda.  It is remarkable the level of seriousness with which that was taken by civil society groups and individuals.  When we went around the country we found that 100 people often showed up and in one case there were 200 people.  They really advocated for their issues.  It showed that there was a degree of flexibility in the basic agenda that was set and a degree of freedom for the convention itself to make choices.  Those choices are made in favour of D&aacute;il reform and economic, social and cultural rights.  I am happy to acknowledge that the issue that ran D&aacute;il reform a very close second for consideration by the convention was Seanad reform.  D&aacute;il reform was ahead of Seanad reform by a very small margin.  We discussed the matter at a meeting of the steering committee last evening.<\/p><p>A question arises in terms of all of those issues.  It is not just Seanad reform but issues such as the environment, the family and other issues of morality, church and State.  The point is that the convention will not have the opportunity to deal with them because we will have run out of time.  The question arises whether there should be or will be an extension of the convention.  That is not for me to pronounce on.  In so far as there are opinions on the matter, we will discuss it during the last two meetings of the convention on the first and third weekends in February.  It might well be that the convention will arrive at a view on the matter and might wish to offer an opinion on it.  At the end of the day I would say it would be for the Government plus the Opposition to talk about the following: whether another convention should be established; if it should be broadly similar to the one we have; what sort of agenda it should have; whether it should be three years down the road as Senator Noone suggested or if it should be sooner than that; or if it should happen at all.  That is not an issue on which I would feel competent to pronounce at the moment.<\/p><p>In response to the question on the longer term significance of the convention - Senator Zappone raised the matter in a very good way - I refer to how I concluded my speech.  I said it has been a privilege to have played a part in starting an important public conversation about the Constitution and its role in evolving Irish society.  Leaving aside all the issues we were asked to deal with, which we have dealt with, that has been part of our contribution.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik also spoke about the appropriateness of such a process 75 years on from the introduction of the 1937 Constitution and asked what should be the nature of a constitution in the early part of the 21st century.  We have started that conversation and I expect it will continue.<\/p><p>Senator Keane raised the nomination process for presidential elections.

In response to Senator Barrett&rsquo;s question on how many people it took to get the 66 representatives, I am told that it took about 3,000.  This happened through a polling company.  It was given four criteria to find a representative group and it had to find people who were representative.  When asked if one would be willing to give up eight weekends for nothing in the coming year, quite a few people might have felt they did not want to do that.  Out of the 66 who agreed &ndash; there was a substitute list as well of another 66 who could come in where necessary.  To the best of my knowledge all of those people are very happy they said \"Yes\".  I think they feel they have really been part of something special and important.<\/p><p>It was a wise and appropriate idea that there should be participation by people from Northern Ireland.  If one were to attempt to have something substantial in Northern Ireland it could raise significant political sensitivities for a constitutional body in the Republic of Ireland to have meetings there.  I am not certain about that.  What we have tried to do is to ensure that, where possible, there has been significant outreach to Northern Ireland.  For example, when we discussed the possibility of citizens having votes in presidential elections we had a specific substantial part of our debate on that dealing with people from Northern Ireland.  We had representatives from the Assembly in Northern Ireland.  In addition, in June of last year I went up at the request of one of the Northern Ireland members of the convention to speak at an event in Stormont, to talk about the possibility of whether something analogous to the organisational form of the Constitutional Convention might have some relevance in Northern Ireland in terms of community engagement.<\/p><p>I am probably coming to the end of the questions that have been raised.  I hope I have not forgotten anything.  The comment by Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe on the importance of cake is a profound one.  It connects back to the issue of collegiality.  First, we recognised the importance of the matter.  In any group of people if one is to achieve anything, good personal relations must be at the basis of it.  I can see some evidence of that in the House today.  I refer to the importance of meeting on the Friday evenings in advance of the meetings and of the dinner on the Saturday evening.  Such things oil the wheels of relationships and ultimately help to have respectful conversations and to reach agreement about particular issues.<\/p><p>On the question of whether the process has relevance to other countries or what we learned from other countries, I do not think we in the convention can take any credit for that.  In advance of the construction of the convention some account was taken of experiences in other countries.  I refer to such places as Canada and the Netherlands among others.<\/p><p>On the critical issue of whether it should be just a citizens' assembly or an assembly of citizens and politicians, it was a profoundly correct decision to have both citizens and politicians involved in the process.  The main lesson from a substantial exercise in British Colombia was that after a lot of very good work by citizens' assemblies, following their conclusions, which on the face of it sounded sensible and well reasoned but because the politicians had not been involved in the process, it made it very difficult for the recommendations to be taken with the level of seriousness they perhaps otherwise would have been.  I hope I have covered everything that has been raised.  I thank the House for the honour of being present and for the chance to have the dialogue with Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600015#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Arnold"},{"type":"speech","time":1389875400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Does Senator Barrett wish to clarify an issue?

It is a small but important Bill and I am grateful to my colleagues for giving me permission to table it on Private Members' time.<\/p><p>There is general recognition across all sides of this House that one of the most attractive elements of Irish community, commercial and social life is the fact that we have managed to retain vibrant and attractive town centres.  Towns and villages have suffered the negative impact of the downturn of recent years but town centre businesses have worked hard to stay in operation through a difficult climate.  However, in addition to dealing with the effects of the recession, traders are increasingly being hit by the triple blow of reduced consumer spending, the advent of local authority imposed street parking charges and new out-of-town retailers offering large free surface carparks.  The competitiveness and openness of the Irish retail sector has allowed for a massive increase in retailers starting or expanding operations here.  For example, the two German discounters have attained a significant market share over a relatively short period.  We have also seen the development of retail parks and large retail supermarkets located on edge-of-town and out-of-town sites.<\/p><p>Competition is good for the economy and for consumer choice because it allows consumers to shop around for the best value and to make the family budget stretch further.  Nothing in this Bill seeks to impact negatively on competition, choice or services for consumers nor does it propose to impose new costs on consumers.  However, it is critical that we examine the way in which the development of new out-of-town retail operations with large surface carparks are treated from a rates perspective in light of the social and economic costs they impose on town centres.  Under current Irish law there is a glaring inequity in the governance of commercial rates which negatively impacts on the vitality and viability of Irish towns.  If left unchecked, this inequity will contribute to the erosion of the social, economic and community functions performed by Irish town centres and increase dereliction, urban decay and the associated costs they impose on the wider society.<\/p><p>Most major town centres are subject to local authority imposed parking charges.  Income from parking charges has become a significant source of revenue for local authorities, accounting for 28% of all income received by councils annually.  Parking regimes are enforced rigorously through parking fines and clamping.  At the same time, however, small retail businesses in urban areas contribute significant rates and other municipal charges, such as licence fees for street furniture, to local authorities.  The advent of paid parking in town centres has also forced retailers with parking spaces in these areas to impose charges for parking on their properties to prevent people from avoiding parking charges by occupying the spaces.  In simple terms, it costs money to park in town centres and local authorities are significant beneficiaries.  By contrast, there has been major expansion in edge-of-town and out-of-town shopping facilities which depend almost entirely on car driving customers.  These new retail outlets come in various forms.  Some are large shopping centres, almost always with a major grocer as anchor tenant.  Others are smaller discount retailers which operate as a single unit or as part of a neighbourhood centre.  Regardless of their form, they typically share two features.  The first is that they are located outside the town centre and the second is that they offer free parking to their customers.<\/p><p>Planning and transport policy affords priority to town centres rather than out-of-town retailers on the grounds of sustainability and the social and economic functions of town centres.  However, the legal basis for the levying of rates by local authorities goes in the opposite direction.  If anything, the current structure introduces a disincentive for out-of-town retailers to charge customers for parking.  Under the current law, a retailer which does not charge for parking is not liable for rates in respect of car parking spaces.  Typically it is only where retailers charge for parking that parking spaces are subject to rates.  The current system makes no sense in terms of consistency between planning and transport policy.  The existence of free car parking and out-of-town retail outlets acts to draw car-based customers away from town centres, where they would be obliged to pay for parking and could face fines or clamping if they stay beyond the time for which they have paid.  A decline in the level of trading impacts on the vitality and viability of town centres and reduced customer footfall in town centres impacts on the viability of retailers, particularly those trading in convenience goods which depend on higher numbers of low spending customers.  Less viable retailers mean less viable town centres, increased dereliction and urban decay, which in turn create additional societal costs that are often borne by the Government and the taxpayer.  The reduced footfall also impacts negatively on the local authority revenue stream through reduced parking receipts and, ultimately, lower yields from rates because of failing town centre businesses.  This decrease in revenue is not replaced by alternative revenue streams from out-of-town centres.  Ultimately, the current situation will lead to enhanced market power for out-of-town and edge-of-town retailers, reduced choice and opportunity for customers and a deterioration in retail diversity.  It is also the case that many out-of-town retailers operate low cost and low employment models which militate against new employment creation.<\/p><p>To take an example, retailer A is a grocer based in a 7,000 sq. m store in the main street of a town centre and employs 30 full-time staff.  The local council has introduced pay parking in the town, with the consequence that retailer A charges for parking in the small 50 space carpark attached to the store.  Consequently, retailer A pays rates to the local authority on the shop and the carpark.  In addition, customers must pay for their parking, either to the local authority or to retailer A.  Trade has suffered as a consequence of the downturn and the arrival of the new out-of-town retailer B which offers free car parking.  Retailer B is a branch of an international chain which operates out of a 10,000 sq m store and employs 50 full-time staff.  The store is located on the outskirts of the town centre on one of the main entrance routes to the town.  Retailer B does not charge customers for the large surface carpark attached to the store, which means it pays rates on the store but not on the carpark.<\/p><p>Several different measures could be taken to address the challenges that free out-of-town parking provision create for the vitality and viability of town centres.  A step that should be taken immediately is to address the inequity that commercial rates are not charged for the provision of out-of-town retail carparks.  The current legal provision contains no incentive for operators of out-of-town retail centres to impose charges on their customers and, indeed, acts as a disincentive from applying charges.  As such, it is counter-productive and inconsistent with Government planning and transport policy.  To address this inequity, the Bill proposes to amend section 51 of the Valuation Act 2001 to stipulate that the space reserved for car parking associated or attached to a retail outlet should be separately valued in the calculation of the rateable valuation of a property.  The rateable valuation should be based on the revenue that would be generated from the space if it was charged at the current value of street parking rates applied by the local authority in the adjacent urban area.  Unless the retail centre operator charges a higher hourly rate, some mechanism could be inserted to ensure that free parking spaces attract a higher rateable valuation.  In addition, a measure would be required to ensure this new valuation is imposed with effect from 12 months after the date of enactment and with a facility for self-assessment to expedite the process of valuation.<\/p> <p>The effect of this amendment would be to generate additional income for local authorities from the application of rates to car parking spaces and encourage operators of retail centres with free parking to make some contribution to the broader social and economic costs of using their parking facilities.  It would impose a cost on a facility which, while currently free of charge, generates overall societal costs.  <\/p><p> Section 2(1) amends section 51 of the Valuation Act by providing that where a property is a shop or retail outlet, the parking spaces for customers should be taken into account in assessing the rateable valuation.  Section 2(2) introduces a mechanism to calculate the rateable valuation by reference to either the amount charged by the centre operator for parking spaces or, where no charge is imposed, the equivalent parking charges imposed by the local authority for car parking within the local authority area, whichever is the highest.  This imposes a <i>de facto<\/i>valuation of the space involved with no less a cost than that charged for town centre parking.  While the operator may absorb this cost, it will be a factor in the rates that are paid for car parking spaces, in other words, the commercial value of parking spaces will be calculated at a reasonable rate. <\/p><p> Section 3(3) provides for the valuation of properties covered by the Act within 12 months of its commencement. <\/p><p> This is a fair, proportionate and necessary measure which will address an inequity in the current legal position and ensure greater coherence and consistency in transport and planning policy.  It will also introduce certainty to an area that is currently confusing and unclear and do so in a way that delivers broader societal benefits.  Local authorities will welcome the additional revenue generated by the measure and ensure the additional funds generated are used to improve town centres as places to visit, frequent and shop.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600017#S00400","speaker":"1151","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389876900,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I take pleasure in seconding the Bill and compliment my colleague, Senator Coghlan, on bringing it before the House.  Too often, we hear Senators complain about the decline of town centres and cities and suggest means of revitalising them.  This small Bill could go some way towards addressing the current imbalance.  A glaring inequity in the law governing the imposition of commercial rates is negatively impacting on the vitality and viability of towns and cities and conferring a competitive advantage on out-of-town retailers.

Senator Paul Coghlan has given us much food for thought.  The Valuation Bill is due to come before the House shortly.

The issue is one of providing balance and ensuring town centres are not placed at a disadvantage.  This Bill could play an important role in maintaining activity in town centres.  I recall a couple of visits to Albany in New York.  It was frightening to note that the centre of the city had nothing to offer that would attract retail customers, although it had a fabulous shopping centre on its outskirts.  Many cities in the United States have taken a similar route and it would be a shame if this were to occur in this country.  This trend is already evident, however, particularly in locations where there are out-of-town shopping centres.  Many town centres in counties Meath, Kildare and Louth are under pressure as a result of shopping centres located outside the town.  Out-of-town shopping centres, including on the outskirts of Dublin, are doing well.  <\/p> <p>Further down the country, I have also noticed that some towns are doing quite well, including, from appearances, Ballina.  I visited Buncrana as long ago as the Seanad election and I thought those two towns were quite vibrant, probably because they are quite far away from everywhere else and there is no alternative but to shop in them.  Consequently, they have quite nice and vibrant town centres.  While I am sure the aforementioned two places have their own problems, they did not appear to be as acute as some of the town centres I have seen, which are almost at risk of closing down.  In 2013 Fianna F&aacute;il published a policy document called Streets Ahead in which we outlined a range of measures, of which this is an important part.  It would help town centres to deal with the problems of rising vacancy rates and abandoned shop-fronts, which would bring greater footfall into the centres.<\/p><p>While I am not trying to nitpick or anything like that, I will raise a couple of small issues I have with the Bill.  It applies to shops or retail outlets, but am I to believe it does not apply to suburban restaurants or pubs?  If that is the intent of the Bill, then so be it.  When Senator Paul Coghlan is concluding, he should indicate whether there is a minimum size to which this would not apply.  I am thinking of a local Centra shop with four or five car-parking spaces.

In referring to such places, I do not believe they pose a direct threat to town centres and in fact are necessary.  However, I understand the Senator has dealt with this issue and I will accept that.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to comment on the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012.  While Senator Cummins stated that it was due shortly, that Bill was before the House on Second Stage in autumn 2012 or perhaps even earlier.  Members on this side, as well as some on the Government side, raised serious constitutional issues about that Bill and, as a result, it has not been heard from since.  In fact, it arose during the course of the Seanad referendum campaign as an example in which the Seanad had done its job - that is, not to knock down a Bill but to point out flaws and to get them corrected.  I presume this is the process that is going on.  The Minister of State might provide Members with an update in this regard, because there are a range of issues pertaining to valuations that must be dealt with and are being dealt with in the aforementioned Bill, together with the important, albeit radical, point being made by Senator Coghlan.  Were this Bill to be enacted, as I hope, it would make a big change.  It would be big and would be really helpful.  While it would unquestionably disadvantage some people, it would help the small local retailer and town centres.<\/p><p>I reiterate that I wish to know when the aforementioned Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 will return to the House.  During the Seanad referendum campaign, someone by coincidence asked the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il about the status of the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, and he replied that the Bill was in the Seanad, which was dealing with it, and that, as the questioner was aware, they would take their time.  The Taoiseach did not appear to be aware that the Seanad had raised serious constitutional issues.  As far as I can ascertain, Members of this House were being blamed at that time for delaying the Bill when, in fact, I believe it is somewhere in the Government machinery.  However, that Bill is really urgent and includes a range of provisions that will help.  While I believe it could go further and other changes could be made, people are waiting for the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 to come through.  They are waiting for the radical reform of the rates system that they were promised and I certainly seek comment on that issue.  I congratulate Senator Paul Coghlan on his introduction of this Bill.  It is very useful and helpful and Fianna F&aacute;il Members hope it will be enacted.  I look forward to hearing Senator Coghlan's conclusions, when he will address a couple of minor points I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600019#U00300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1389877500,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to the House and wish her all the best for 2014.  I also commend Senator Paul Coghlan and his colleagues, Senators Cummins and Mullins, on bringing forward this legislation.  It is an important and topical issue that surfaces regularly.  A number of months ago my colleagues in the Labour Party group, including Senator Whelan and me, together with many others, tabled a full Private Members' motion on this very issue of rural retailing, which the Minister of State took at the time.  During the discussion, she indicated to Members that an interdepartmental task force was sitting in respect of the issue of rural retailing and that she hoped its findings would come to fruition shortly.  As an aside, she might indicate whether this has happened.  At the time, I also called for a task force on rural retailing to be set up, towards which the Minister of State was highly positive.  I hope she may be able to respond to these two issues in her reply today.<\/p><p>  This Bill aims to alleviate some of the pressure on the small to medium-sized enterprise, SME, sector and on artisan retailers in main streets and town centres nationwide by levelling the playing field to a degree from a competitive perspective.  Unfortunately, however, much as all Members, including the Bill's mover, Senator Coghlan, would wish to find some way to redress the imbalance and the misguided planning decisions that have brought us to this position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> out-of-town shopping developments, the horse has bolted on that issue.  I do not believe it will be possible to address this problem in the fashion one would wish at this time.  Independent family-owned shops in Ireland employ 90,000 people and contribute &euro;3.5 billion to the national Exchequer.  A total of 75% of what they sell is produced in Ireland or sold through Irish suppliers.  The money people spend in these shops stays in local communities and more initiatives like this Bill are needed to protect that particular part of the market.  I did some research on this issue in the lead-up to my party's own retailing motion with a view to levelling the playing field for Irish-owned businesses with respect to those multinationals with which they are trying to compete.  In my home town of Carrick-on-Suir, for example, 24% of all retail units on the high street are lying vacant.  Subventions are needed by the Government to allow local authorities greater flexibility to pursue policies that promote businesses in town centres, such as the promotion of pop-up shops and once-off-type shopping.<\/p><p>  An Taisce drew up a report recently on acquiring some funding for this area through the charging of a 50-cent-per-hour parking fee on all out-of-town shopping spaces nationwide.  This would amass &euro;16 million per year, which could be put back into the very issue this Bill is trying to address.  It also is clear from my research that this Bill may encounter some obstacles, although I sincerely hope it will not.  However, I clearly discern a difficulty in respect of retrospectively attempting to implement this type of legislation.  The Minister of State may respond to that point.  There is no doubt, however, that were the Bill passed, it would lead to a significant redistribution of profits from cash-rich multinationals back into local communities and local town centres to address the pre-existing imbalance.  While I have conducted some limited research on this area since Members have had sight of the Bill, I am led to believe, however, that the valuation of properties in shopping centres and shopping malls works on the basis of the rent these units pay.  Moreover, the rent is based on the availability of free parking, which is factored into the rental.  Whether this Bill can be implemented on top of that type of valuation is a matter the Minister of State also might address.<\/p><p>  I sincerely hope something can be done in this regard but it comes back to Senator Byrne's observation - I believe Senator Cummins also mentioned it - that it all hinges on the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012, which was introduced into this House in September 2012.  One must wait for the new valuation system to be implemented and set across the country to ascertain how that Bill will make a difference between what is being charged for town centre retail shops and what is being charged for out-of-town multi-storey and multinational-type shopping arcades.  In addition, we must ensure that where greater amounts of money are collected on a <i>pro rata <\/i>basis from the shopping centres, which I am led to believe will happen on foot of this Bill, this generated money is used by the local authorities to provide incentives to give a better opportunity and a better chance to retailers in town centres.<\/p> <p> I am interested to hear the Minister of State's response to this important Bill.  As Senator Paul Coghlan stated, it is limited to a specific purpose.  It is a short Bill.  If it can be implemented, it will be very effective.  In saying that, I am cognisant from my research that there are potential difficulties and I would like to hear the Minister of State's response to them.<\/p><p>I support the work that Senator Coghlan has done with his colleagues in order for us, as Members of the Oireachtas, to show that we are listening to people with small shops and business in rural areas who are struggling to keep their doors open on a daily basis, and that we can provide some hope to them that through the legislative system we can do something that will make it a little easier for them.

As for filling stations on the periphery of towns, a certain number of grocery stores have moved out there and I do not know whether such business will ever go back into towns.  Can one see petrol pumps being set up in the main streets?  These and related businesses have naturally moved outside.  The Cork city park-and-ride system is an interesting way of trying to get motorists to leave cars outside but come into the town centre themselves, and there are substantial successes in areas such as the English Market.  The same operates in Belfast.<\/p><p>I note the proposals to open up 10% of bus routes to new entrants.  Waterford, Senator Cummins's constituency, is one of the places where that will be implemented in the strongest way because it already has independent bus companies.  If one can get people in by public transport, maybe they can revive the shops that Senator Paul Coghlan and I wish to see doing well.<\/p><p>In the Minister of State's Department, there was a Living Over the Shop initiative to get people into towns.  It seemed a relatively cheap way of doing so.  I have not heard much of it of late, but perhaps when the Minister of State is introducing her own Bill we might see how that is doing.  There may be persons in their late teens and early 20s who want to live in town, without gardens, suburban responsibilities, etc.  Can we do more on derelict sites themselves?  The upward-only rent review measures should be looked at.<\/p><p>Can we reform transport?  I wonder whether in towns where there are no bus services park-and-ride systems should be exempt from any kind of restriction by the National Transport Authority.  If anybody wants to set up such a system, it would get people into towns.<\/p><p>Some of the problems with which Senator Paul Coghlan's Bill deals are inevitable.  Land prices are cheaper outside towns than in them.  That is how Aldi and Lidl have been able to acquire those sites.  Presumably there were development levies that went with that, but it is an economic reality.  Whether the section of the Bill under which a price is charged for parking outside the town based on the charge inside the town would be allowed to operate or would be an infringement of those persons' property rights would have to be considered.<\/p><p>The rationale for commercial rates must be looked at.  We have moved away from it in the domestic model.  No poor law valuations are used anymore; it is a market valuation.  Maybe that is a direction in which the Minister of State might be moving in her own valuation.<\/p><p>What do town centres do if we reduce the cost of parking and somebody parks all day and buys nothing?  Do we need a different regime for short-term and long-term parking in those circumstances?  I am with Senator Paul Coghlan, but I am merely wondering.  In fact, some shopkeeper might say that a guy had parked outside his shop all day and nobody else could get in there because he had gone off somewhere else - for instance, he had got the train to Dublin - and that this had been a cost to him or her.  That is an aspect that must be considered.<\/p><p>Of course, in the wider macroeconomic context, it would be difficult to exempt town centres from what has happened to the entire economy, such as the massive decline in the retail sales index and the massive emigration of young people who might have been living in some of those towns.  That is why the House must always come together to ensure that what happened to us in 2008 and subsequently is never allowed to happen again.  One cannot take so many people and so much purchasing power out of an economy and not have the signs of it all around.<\/p><p>In addition to this initiative, on which I wish Senator Paul Coghlan well, in all such initiatives, such as ways in which town centres can attract people back in - sometimes without their cars - through park-and-ride bus systems and the Living Over the Shop scheme, we are at one with Senator and the Minister of State in what can be done, because some of our towns look quite down-at-heel and intervention is urgently needed.  I compliment Senators Paul Coghlan, Cummins and Landy on their introduction of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600020#V00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1389878100,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I also thank Senators Paul Coghlan, Maurice Cummins and Michael Mullins for introducing this Bill and raising important issues with regard to the treatment of car-parking spaces in the valuation of retail centres.<\/p><p>This Bill addresses a real concern that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and I share with Senators on all sides of the House - that retailers in town centres are losing out to the large out-of-town shopping centres and retail parks.  Indeed, we had an interesting discussion on Senator Landy and his colleagues' Private Members' motion in the Seanad at the end of last year.  Many of the issues that are being raised here in the Seanad are important ones, particularly for towns around the country.  From the point of view of my own brief - because this is largely the area of responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin - we have been able to address some of the issues raised with regard to planning guidelines and guidelines for development contributions.  Indeed, I will introduce a planning Bill later in the year.  We will take on board some of the suggestions that arose both in the previous debate and in this one in so far as we can under my remit, but valuation is a matter that is under Deputy Howlin's remit.<\/p> <p>Many feel it is the availability of a plentiful supply of parking, which is sometimes though not always free of charge, in these out-of-town locations that is attracting shoppers away from town centres where parking is restricted and sometimes costly.  There may be a perception that businesses in the retail parks enjoy an advantage over their town-centre competitors and that this parking advantage is not reflected in their costs or rates.  The provisions in this Bill aim to redress this to some extent, at least, by increasing the rateable value of retail properties with parking for customers.<\/p><p>The Commissioner of Valuation is completely independent in the exercise of his functions under the Valuation Act 2001.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been in contact with the commissioner to clarify existing principles and practice and has confirmed with the commissioner the practical application of the Valuation Act in this area.  Car parks are rateable properties under the Act.  Many car parks charge for parking and many exist as a stand-alone enterprise not linked to any shopping centre or place of work.  Where a charge is made for parking, the car park is valued and rateable in its own right, as Senator Coghlan said in his contribution.  Some car parking facilities, whether multistorey or at ground level, carry significant valuations and rates liabilities.<\/p><p>In those shopping centres where there is no charge, the arrangement is often reflected in the terms of the retailers&rsquo; lease and the value of the car parking is subsumed into the rateable value of the retail units in that centre.  This was stated by Senator Landy.  The availability of parking will be reflected in a premium on the rent paid.  Higher rents are reflected in higher valuations and rates payable.  The availability of parking can be looked on in a similar way to any other amenity in an area.  The location of a restaurant in an attractive part of a town or city will attract a higher rent than one in a less attractive area.  Therefore, a retailer in an area with plentiful parking will more likely be paying a rent and rates that reflect the parking amenity.  The fact that there are extra costs is outweighed by the attractiveness of the whole package available in one location versus another.  The increased custom is most likely justifying any additional cost.  This is a generalisation but the point is that any imbalance between locations will be reflected in the rental market for retail units.  It is also reflected in the valuation of the property and, in turn, the rates liability on those units.  The rateable value is dictated to a large extent by the rent paid, so market forces influence the rental and rates costs incurred in different locations.  Over time, town centre locations should see a relative cost advantage.  The point is that market forces are already influencing costs, and if costs can redress an imbalance these shifts in rental and rates costs are already a part of the system.  I understand that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, does not believe we can or should try to redesign a valuation system which already reflects market changes to achieve specific objectives.<\/p><p>Valuation is a very specialised area.  Valuation principles are tried and tested, in many cases in the courts.  Any change that is made to valuation practice has to be carefully considered to ensure it is does not have wider implications for the valuation and rating systems.  While conscious of the objectives of this Bill, the Minister is satisfied that the valuation system as it stands is fully cognisant of the value of car parking.  He will consider the points being made in the debate today.  I will relay to him what I have heard here.  He will be reading Senators&rsquo; contributions.<\/p><p>While the valuation system reflects the value of car parking and the changes in the rental market, the policy is to ensure that valuations are as up to date as possible and reflect current market conditions.  Senators will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as the responsible Minister, is currently in the process of bringing forward the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012.  Senator Byrne asked when it would proceed.  I will raise that with the Minister.<\/p><p>The primary purpose of the Bill is to accelerate the national programme of revaluing every commercial and industrial property in the country that is being undertaken by the Valuation Office.  The Bill amends several provisions contained in the Valuation Act 2001.  These amendments include a number of technical changes to Part 5 of the 2001 Act, which deals with how valuations, including the revaluation of entire rating authority areas, are carried out.  The Bill also proposes to amend Part 6, which deals with the carrying out of revisions of the rateable valuation of individual properties within rating authority areas between revaluations.  Provision is also made for the commissioner to enter into an arrangement with a person or persons to assist in the performance of the revaluation function.  The effect of this provision is to enable the commissioner to contract out some of the revaluation work in order to augment the in-house capacity of the Valuation Office.  This is one of the express provisions intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme.  I understand that following enactment of the Bill, the commissioner intends running a pilot revaluation project which will utilise such external resources.<\/p><p>Following enactment of the Bill, it is envisaged that revaluation projects can continue to be conducted through the normal direct assessment methodology.  However, the Bill also provides for the commissioner to conduct a revaluation using elements of self-assessment by ratepayers.  This provision is also intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme, and I understand that, following enactment of the Bill, the commissioner intends running a pilot project which will utilise self-assessment principles.  The Bill proposes to amend the 2001 Act by providing for the use of general market data or aggregated data, including statistical and computer-aided techniques, in determining valuations where the commissioner considers it appropriate to do so.  <\/p><p>The Bill provides for streamlining of the appeals process.  Under the Valuation Act, there is an opportunity to make representations before the final certificate is issued.  There can be an appeal to the commissioner after the final certificate is issued and his decision can be appealed to the Valuation Tribunal and the High Court.  The Bill will extend the period for representations to the commissioner and remove the appeal to the commissioner, which will streamline the representation and appeals process.  Preparations for the return of this Bill to this House for Committee Stage are well advanced.  I will try to obtain something more specific on that for Senators.<\/p><p>The national revaluation programme will be advanced as quickly as possible, and this is a priority for the Government and part of its Action Plan for Jobs.  It will provide up-to-date valuations on which to base rates and greater equity and uniformity to commercial ratepayers.  Not every business will see a reduction in its liability as a result of the revaluation because the shift in value is dependent on relative movements of property values.  Local authorities will still have to raise the money they need for the services they provide.<\/p><p>Significant progress has been made on the national revaluation programme.  The Valuation Office issued over 26,000 final valuation certificates for Dublin city and the three local authorities in Waterford in December 2013.  Certification for South Dublin, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown authorities was completed previously, while that for Limerick city and county will be completed in 2014.  When the revaluation of the Limerick authorities is completed, 55,700 properties will have been revalued.  This equals one third of commercial properties numerically and 55% in terms of value.  While there has been good progress recently on the revaluation programme, this momentum needs to be maintained.  These revaluations mean that rates bills reflect modern values and relativities.  Ratepayers in areas that have not been revalued are paying rates on valuations and relativities that existed in 1988.  Once a local authority area has been revalued, the Valuation Act 2001 provides that the area will be valued again within ten years, at worst, but progressively revaluations will be repeated in a timeframe closer to five years rather than ten.  Up-to-date valuations that reflect current market values and inherently include the value of amenities available, including car parking, comprise the best contribution that the valuation system can make to ensure a level playing field between town centres and out-of-town retail parks.  If an imbalance continues to exist and if there is a need to support town centres, the policy solution will have to be found elsewhere.<\/p><p>The enactment of the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 will assist the Commissioner of Valuation with the acceleration of the revaluation programme.  Any issues arising from deliberations on this Private Members&rsquo; Bill that are consistent with sound valuation principles and practice can be considered further in the context of that Bill.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Bill will greatly improve the valuation process and address many of the concerns expressed by Senators.  However, the Minister does not oppose the Bill before the House.  As I stated, I will bring the points raised in this debate to his attention.  I thank the Senators for introducing this Bill and raising the important valuation issues we have been able to explore today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600020#V00300","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1389878700,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State very much for attending today.  It is always a pleasure to listen to her.  I compliment my colleagues who introduced the Bill.<\/p><p>I would like to address directly the issue of out-of-town retail areas and superstores, such as Lidl and Aldi, which are incentivising shoppers to shop out of town, in many cases with free car parking that is often on land on which rates do not have to be paid.<\/p><p>I probably have a more strident view than others on the state of many towns and villages around the country.  The town centres are absolutely decimated.  There are many derelict shops, houses and other buildings and a sense that towns are bordering on death.  There is absolutely no question about it.  The Minister of State's language is not firm enough.  Circumstances in Limerick are probably different from elsewhere but there are many towns and villages around the country that have been totally decimated.<\/p> <p>The town centres are gone.  They are subject to pressure of high rates, an issue to which I will return later, and consumers are not spending.  That is the tragedy.  The Germany economy grew by only 0.4% last year.  The growth came not through manufacturing but through consumers actually spending.  Our consumers are not spending.  They are buying more but they are not spending any more money and if they are spending it is very erratic.  There is no consistent pattern of how they are spending as the level of spend is up one week and down the next week. <\/p><p>I have a problem, as I said many times previously, with the lack of commercial understanding by bureaucrats in local authorities who decide what the rates will be.  They do not give a damn as to whether the retailers survive.  Retailers can be found the length and breadth of the country in every town and village and provide employment nationally whereas the multinationals and the large companies are engaged in urban areas.  I am very passionate about this issue.  I co-hosted a conference led by Sir Terry Leahy, former chief executive of Tesco, on 12 December in Dundrum town centre.  He spoke very passionately about the issue.  The Government should keep its nose out of business and out of retailers' business as it does not have a clue how to do business.

For example, when I got involved in starting up Lir Chocolates my passion was to create employment, given that the national unemployment rate was 17% at that time.  The people in retail work morning, noon and night and if the shop is not open they are still on the job.  For example, Tesco employs 15,000 people all over the island.  So far as I am concerned, there is no understanding by the majority of the people, the majority of elected representatives, and the majority of Departments, particularly those which deal with trade, of the reality of the retail business.  My experience is that they do not have a clue and increasingly I am getting more frustrated by the lack of understanding.<\/p><p>Towns and villages are reeling from the loss of critical local services such as Garda stations and the loss of many post offices willy-nilly around the country.  It does not seem to matter a damn.  I support the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, on his general philosophy on rationalising the Garda stations but not enough thought was put into it.  It should have been done in consultation with local communities in a more European democracy style rather than the way it is done here.<\/p><p>The local government grant has been reduced and as a result local authorities are leaning more on poor retailers as a source of their income.  How dare they?  It has not been a strategic issue in the main.  The whole focus in the budget was about maintaining the VAT rate in the restaurant and tourism area.  We made a big fight for it and were part of the lobby group which sought to retain it.  However, it was not covered on radio.  I was not familiar with the issue of reintroducing PRSI which is having a awful effect on many retailers.  They do not know how they will pay their staff as the increased PRSI rate for employers starts again.  <\/p><p>The idea of a level playing field is important.  This morning I had a meeting with two retailers, from the south of the city, two convenient store owners.  The issue of the flexible parking charge in town centres was raised.  At Dundrum town centre one pays for one hour and get three hours parking for &euro;2.  People are crowding into it from all over Ireland because car parking is so cheap.  If one goes into town or to Grafton Street the parking fee could be &euro;10 or &euro;11 on one's return.  What is happening is madness.  I blame local authorities, county managers and assistant county managers as they do not devote enough time to thinking about the jobs and retailers.  Retailers have very demanding careers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600022#X00300","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1389879300,"counter":128,"content":"<p>The Senator has less than a minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600022#X00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1389879300,"counter":129,"content":"<p>Local authorities cannot rely on retailers to increase the rates.

She is a very good business person but consumer spending in the retail area has practically come to a halt.<\/p><p>In out-of-town centres appropriate rates should be charged to large companies with mega backup supports.  These are not ordinary small retailers, they are colossal companies.  I do not say I do not want competition.  I love competition, it is the spice of life and I believe in it.  What is happening at present is very unequal.  The banks are disastrous and are not giving money to companies they consider might be vulnerable.  For example, Danske Bank fled the country and would not have anything to do with this person.  There is also the high cost of energy.  I make the point that local authorities do not look at the issue in terms of employment created by retailers in all the towns and villages.  They give first hand opportunities to local manufacturers to display their products, thus creating employment .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600022#X00500","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1389879300,"counter":130,"content":"<p>The Senator's time has expired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600022#X00600","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1389879300,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I apologise.

Since I became a member I have heard many raise the issue of what the large, out-of-town shopping centres are doing to local cities, and the urban and neighbourhood communities.  We have seen the different policies of each local authority around the country.  There are inconsistencies on the part of local authorities in respect of how they implement the charges.  Therefore, a national policy would be good.<\/p><p>Senator Mary White mentioned the responsibility of local authorities and co-operation with retail outlets.  It is not only the retail outlets that have to provide parking.  I live in Dublin South West where there is one shopping centre that pays rates on its parking area.  A revaluation process was finalised in Dublin last year.  In that revaluation, parking spaces were valued out of all proportion but were reduced on appeal and, thankfully, that appeal system is working.  It is worth bearing in mind that a case study could be done on the issue where shopping centres are suffering.  I speak from experience of living in Dublin South West which has an out-of-town shopping centre.  I commend Senator Paul Coghlan for bringing forward the Bill because towns are being denuded.    We must define &quot;out-of-town&quot;.  When we look at Dublin and Tallaght, clearly Tallaght should be a city.  Perhaps this is an opportunity to put down a marker again to say Tallaght is a city.<\/p> <p>Tallaght is a lot more than a town - it is larger than Limerick - yet it is still defined as a town.  There are also towns in other urban areas in the same situation.  We must protect the local neighbourhood shopping centres that exist in towns and in places such as Templeogue, Rathfarnham, villages in Cork and places in Cork city.  I am sure Senator Paul Coghlan had that in mind when drafting the Bill and that the matter will be addressed in detail in his legislation.  On many occasions it has been mentioned that something must be done about out-of-town locations.  His Bill has shown the way and given a lead on the matter.  All the details must be ironed out.  I wish to put on the record the view that we must protect local neighbourhood shopping centres.<\/p><p>We must also bring VAT rates into line.  A lot of people use their cars to shop locally.  VAT on bicycles is 25%, but if it was reduced to 0%, people might buy bicycles and use them to go shopping.<\/p><p>As another Senator has mentioned, rents are based on free parking at present, because every charge introduced has an impact on the shopkeeper and the customer who avails of the facility.  How can we balance the needs of the retailer with the needs of local authorities?  We do not want to infringe on a local authority's right to raise moneys through parking fees.  Fair pricing, more flexible parking fees that do not erode the finances of local authorities, low off-peak rates and special day rates for parking could be introduced.  All of the issues should be examined. <\/p><p>RGDATA conducted a survey on all of the shopping centres nationwide and made good recommendations.  I am sure the Minister will take its recommendations into consideration.  An Taisce has also made recommendations on the matter.  I will not say any more.<\/p><p>I commend Senators Paul Coghlan, Cummins and Mullins on their introduction of the Bill.  We should consider what is meant by the term &quot;out of town&quot;, particularly when one lives in a town that is not a town or a town that is not a city but has many towns surrounding it.  We also need to define who pays what and what is flexible, because policies differ nationally.  How will consistency be introduced and policies be brought into line?  What about deprived areas that have shopping centres where there is no charge for parking at present?  We must ensure that free parking remains, although I shall not mention the locations.  All of these matters must be taken into consideration.  As Senator Paul Coghlan said in his speech, the details will be dealt with in future legislation.

Obviously one can find examples around the country, but let me give my county of Galway as an example.  Without question the towns of Clifden, Oughterard, Spiddal, Moycullen, Loughrea and Ballinasloe are dying on their feet.  However, the spirit of the Bill is to rejuvenate all of those rural towns.<\/p><p>It was amusing to listen to Senator White talk about a lack of spending in the local community when the economics of austerity is the main culprit.  The policy was spawned by Fianna F&aacute;il and is being followed through by the Government.  The fact that people do not have money in their pockets is a major factor in the demise of local towns and businesses.  <\/p><p>The Bill is important because it examines another issue, that of commercial rates.  It is a major issue for business but local authorities rely on such rates for funding.  In some instances businesses claim that the rates levied on them make it difficult for them to remain in operation.  I am not certain of the full truth of that or the extent to which businesses that cease to operate would claim that the level of rates alone was the key factor in making them unprofitable.  Obviously there are other issues involved.  My party believes that rates should be based on a business&rsquo;s profitability rather than the valuation of the property, which to some extent is an historical value.  During the debate we have heard examples of multiples selling vegetables cheaply.  They have leverage over suppliers and some are located next door to grocers who try to sell vegetables sourced from a local market.  It is not a level playing field for both enterprises.  One way to level the playing field would be to take a company's profitability into consideration when making a rates valuation.  My party would like to see that policy put forward. <\/p><p>We would also like the same situation apply here that currently pertains in the other part of the island - that is, that the rate should be revised downwards when a new business moves into an unoccupied building.  That would allow new start-up businesses some leeway as they find their feet.  As I said, a fairer way to assess a tax, which is what rates are, would be to base it on the level of income generated rather than on the ostensible value of the property, which may bear little relation to the profitability of a business - no more than it does for a farm, for example. <\/p><p>The Bill seeks to allow businesses to basically offset the value of parking spaces provided their rates are reduced.  It can be argued that the provision of parking spaces helps to bring more people into a town centre and, therefore, boosts the local economy and, by extension, the local authority.  An argument in favour of the measure can be made, which I presume is the objective of the framers of the Bill, if the parking spaces are provided free of charge.  If the businesses charge for parking then it is a source of profit and, therefore, is deemed to be an integral part of their income which should not be written off.<\/p><p>There is also the argument that if one allows some of the larger retailers to obtain lower rates because they provide free parking on hard surfaces that are part of their property, one is in effect allowing a substantial part of their property to be rate-free.  All of these issues need to be considered as we debate the Bill.

There has been significant investment in shop frontage, paving and piping in towns.  The multiplicity of out-of-town centres is a setback to towns from Letterkenny to Wexford, and is a case of bad planning during the so-called Celtic tiger era.  Senator Barrett gave examples of the towns that have suffered and made some interesting points about long-term parking in towns.  As he said, a regime would have to be devised to overcome the issue of people leaving their cars parked in town free of charge for the day.  Unfortunately, as he highlighted, many of our towns have a down-at-heel look.  Senator White is correct in stating that many of our towns are decimated, and I agree with her on the need to concentrate on creating employment to ensure the viability of our towns.  Senator Keane referred to Tallaght, which may be considered a satellite of Dublin but is respected as a town in its own right and has its own town centre.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke about how bad business is in many of the towns of County Galway.  He suggests that valuations should be based on the profitability of the business, but as we know there are ways of hiding profitability.  I do not think that would be a fair way to proceed.

The recent storms and associated floods have caused huge difficulty and hardship for many people residing in these areas.  I spoke to a number of affected people who expressed to me they cannot remember any storm as significant as the one experienced in the past two weeks.  Only for the fact that some people put measures in place when advised of weather predictions, things could have been much worse in the area.<\/p><p>This week, farmers and householders throughout south and east Galway areas are trying to deal with the fallout of the storms and the deluge of rain which fell over the past two weeks.  They are genuinely fearful of the capacity of the weather to cause flood waters similar to the disastrous levels seen in south Galway in particular in November 2009, which destroyed parts of the county and caused much pain and anguish for families living in the affected areas.  It was so bad last week that thousands of acres of farmland were under water in the Shannon Callows area because the Shannon rose 6 ft. above navigation level in the second half of December and the early days of January as a result of the storm.  In the south Galway areas of Ardrahan, Ballinderreen and Kilcolgan, up to ten local roads were impassable and ten houses came under pressure as a result of rising water levels.<\/p><p>The Office of Public Works has written to city and county managers in coastal counties indicating that it will accept applications under its minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection schemes to repair and build flood defences and coastal protection structures, but this is not enough.  The people living along the Shannon Callows and in Ardrahan, Ballinderreen and Kilcolgan need more funding for the repair of flood defences.  They need further provision of flood defences and funding now to clean and maintain the Ballinderreen and Kilternan water channel.  The problem is that water is not getting to the sea with ease, and without funding for clearing and maintaining this channel the Office of Public Works will not address the problem.  Flooding in the area will continue while the Department chooses to ignore it.<\/p><p>People in east and south Galway feel very let down by the Department and are bitterly disappointed.  This is understandable, because without taking the measures I have indicated we will not be able to protect family farms or homes in the area and stop the hardship being caused for these people.  We need uniformity within the various agencies, such as the National Parks and Wildlife Services, fisheries agencies, the ESB and Waterways Ireland, when it comes to these issues so that somebody is in control and coming up with solutions for the people in the areas I mentioned.  We need basic remedial action now and a proactive approach so that we act responsibly as a Government in helping the people living in these areas whose quality of life is dictated by the weather.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600025#AA00200","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1389880800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, I thank Senator Higgins for giving me the opportunity to address the issue of flood relief measures with regard to flooding problems in the Shannon Callows and south Galway.  The Government is addressing the flooding issues at both locations and has made significant funding available to Galway County Council to implement localised measures in south Galway.<\/p><p>Due to the history of flooding in south Galway, and because of its particular geological formations such as karst limestone, the Office of Public Works commissioned a major flood study of the region in 1998.  The outcome of the overall study was that while a number of engineering solutions would alleviate some of the flooding problems in the area, none of the proposals were found to be economically viable on the basis of standard cost benefit analysis.  In addition, the environmental impacts of some of the proposals were unacceptable, and the OPW could not recommend proceeding with any of the proposals without further investigation.  The south Galway steering committee was established to consider what works could be carried out.  A review of the south Galway flood study report was completed in 2011 and recommended structural and non-structural proposals.  Non-structural measures included planning controls, the monitoring of flows at key locations and refining of the calibration models.  Structural proposals included engineering solutions at various locations in the area.<\/p><p>Since the introduction of the Office of Public Works minor flood mitigation and coastal protection scheme in 2009, the OPW has approved funding of &euro;5.8 million to Galway County Council under the scheme, more than a quarter of which, or approximately &euro;1.5 million, has been allocated to projects in the south Galway area.  These include projects in Oranmore, Kiltartan, Gort, Loughrea and Kinvara.<\/p><p>With regard to flood relief in the Dunkellin area, Galway County Council, in consultation with the OPW, has appointed engineering and environmental consultants to design a flood relief scheme.  The council is being funded by the OPW and will progress the scheme through An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the strategic infrastructure legislation.  It is envisaged that if a viable scheme can be identified, and on completion of the required environmental impact statement, the proposals will be submitted formally to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for consideration.  The environmental issues associated with the scheme works are extremely complex, due in part to the geology of the area, and the local authority and its consultants are continuing in their efforts to resolve these issues in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  It is anticipated that the scheme will be submitted by Galway County Council to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for approval in the next month or so.<\/p><p>With regard to the Shannon Callows, I assure the Senator the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, is very conscious of the serious impact on farming and the environment in the Callows area due to flooding.  He recognises that the Shannon Callows is a very important asset to the farming community and the traditional farming practices are recognised as contributing to the economic, social and environmental management of this unique area.  In general, flooding arises from the restricted capacity of the River Shannon at this location.  Flooding can occur as a result of large flows from either the River Suck or the Upper Shannon from Lough Ree, or a combination of both.  The inflow from the River Brosna also contributes to flooding in this area.<\/p><p>The ongoing catchment flood risk assessment and management study, CFRAMS, for the River Shannon involves a comprehensive examination of all the main factors affecting flood risk in the Shannon area and incorporates a full consultation with all of the main stakeholders who have a role in the management of the Shannon, including the ESB, Waterways Ireland and relevant local authorities.  Last year, following consultation between the OPW, Waterways Ireland and the ESB, the ESB began a trial reduction of existing target water levels on Lough Ree.  This decision was taken to try to help alleviate seasonal flooding in the Callows.  This will remain in place until the publication of the flood risk management plan for the Shannon catchment.  It will provide for a lowering of the spring to early summer target levels in Lough Ree.  By increasing the storage capacity in Lough Ree, this change may somewhat reduce the risk of summer flooding in the Callows.<\/p><p>In addition, and also with the co-operation of the ESB and Waterways Ireland, the OPW has facilitated a water level monitoring exercise as part of the CFRAMS process, which will allow for analysis of water flows and levels at key points around the Lough Ree and Callows areas.  I assure the Senator that the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, is fully aware of the flooding issues in the Shannon Callows and south Galway and I assure her that both issues are being comprehensively addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600025#AA00300","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1389880800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

His speech mentioned funding for repair of flood defences.  That is not the answer in this case.  The answer is cleaning and maintaining the channels in the river to ensure the water can flow to the sea and not cause any further flooding problems.  There was also mention of a cost-benefit analysis and talk about consultants.  These are all arguments for doing nothing.  These people need action from the Department immediately and there is an onus on the Department and a duty to expedite this.

I note that the estate concerned is at the edge of Kenmare.  My Department has provided a range of best practice guidance documents and manuals to local authorities to assist and guide them in the selection of sites for housing developments, the design and layout of such developments and important issues such as sustainability, safety, security, accessibility and vehicular and pedestrian circulation.  Last year, along with my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, I jointly launched the design manual for urban roads and streets.  This manual provides detailed guidance on the design and layout of streets, roads, footpaths and cycle facilities.  The use of the manual is now mandatory for all roads and streets within the 60 km\/h speed limit zone.  The manual states that the creation of vibrant and attractive places requires pedestrian activity which, in turn, requires walkable street networks that can be easily navigated and are well connected.<\/p><p>My Department's best practice guidelines, Quality Housing for Sustainable Developments, focuses on key planning and design issues aimed at creating places that are safe and which can facilitate pedestrians and cyclists while minimising, as far as possible, the need for the use of private cars.  Design and layout should provide safe and convenient access to all dwellings within the development and to adjacent facilities and services.  The guidelines promote the idea of the walkable neighbourhood, where the ordinary needs of households can be met within walking distance, consistent with national policies on sustainability and the promotion of walking and cycling.  The development of peripheral lands at some remove from services and facilities would not immediately appear consistent with that ambition.<\/p><p>In compiling their statutory development plans, local authorities are obliged to take on board general Government policy and to specifically implement all relevant guidelines.  The Department's guidelines on development plans, Development Plans Guidelines for Planning Authorities, state that in order to maximise the utility of existing and future infrastructure provision and promote the achievement of sustainability, a logical, sequential approach should be taken to the zoning of land for development.  This would allow zoning and any subsequent housing developments to extend outwards from the centre of an urban area, with undeveloped lands closest to the core and public transport routes being given preference.  This would avoid any &quot;leapfrogging&quot; to more peripheral areas.<\/p><p>Regarding a footpath surrounding an estate, there is no legal requirement for this.  The design and layout of individual housing developments will address access issues and must take account of the requirements set out in the Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets.  It is a matter for the relevant planning authority to ensure compliance with these requirements and that adequate provision is made for pedestrians, consistent with policy to promote pedestrian movement and reduce demand on car use.  The motion was a general one and Senator Daly has indicated a particular estate about which he is concerned and we can follow up on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600026#BB00500","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1389881400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the reply.  I will follow this up with the Minister because there are more than 50 children in the estate and there are no public lighting or footpaths.  It is on the main Ring of Kerry Road from Kenmare to Killarney and it beggars belief that a footpath does not extend from a public housing estate into a town.  Child safety is probably the most important issue when one builds a new housing estate knowing there will be families.  Yet this housing estate has not provided for the most basic element of child safety and security by ensuring the estate is linked properly to the town.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600026#BB00600","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1389881400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I presume Senator Daly has been in touch with the local authority about this but if we can assist in any way in the Department we will do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014011600026#BB00700","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1389881400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 3.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 21 January 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
