The Bill amends existing legislation and its aim is to preserve the records of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the Residential Institutions Review Committee so that we never forget the wrong which was done to children and that we remain constantly vigilant to protect the rights of children.  Specifically, the intention is that these records will be deposited with the National Archives where they will be preserved and sealed for a period of 75 years.  At the end of this period, the records will be available for public inspection, subject to conditions which will be determined by the director of the National Archives.<\/p> <p>  I will now say a few words about the bodies whose records will be covered by this Bill.  The first of these is the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, which was established by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000.  Its main functions were to report on the abuse of children in certain types of institutions and to give those who suffered this abuse an opportunity to describe what happened to them.  Under the Act, the types of institutions covered included \"a school, an industrial school, a reformatory school, an orphanage, a hospital, a children's home and any other place where children are cared for other than as members of their families.\"<\/p> <p>  The commission comprised two separate and distinct committees, namely, the confidential committee and the investigation committee, which were required to report separately to the commission as a whole.  The confidential committee heard the uncontested evidence of those who did not wish to have the alleged abuse investigated further.  The investigation committee inquired into the manner in which children were placed in institutions, the abuse they suffered while in these institutions and related matters.  Investigations were conducted into all institutions where the number of complainants was more than 20.  Between the two committees, the commission received the evidence of over 1,500 witnesses who attended or were resident as children in schools and care facilities in the State, including particularly industrial and reformatory schools.  The commission produced its final report, also known as the Ryan report, in May 2009.  The commission has almost completed its work and is expected to be dissolved later this year.<\/p> <p>  The other two bodies covered by the Bill are the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the Residential Institutions Review Committee.  These bodies were established by the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002.  The redress board was established to make awards to residents of certain residential institutions who suffered abuse in childhood.  To qualify for an award from the redress board, applicants were required to establish to the board&rsquo;s satisfaction that they suffered injuries consistent with abuse while resident in one of the 139 specified institutions.  Abuse is defined in the legislation to include physical, sexual and emotional abuse, and neglect.  The legislation made it clear that the making of an award to an applicant does not constitute a finding of fact relating to fault or negligence on the part of an alleged abuser or the person responsible for the management, administration, operation, supervision, inspection and regulation of the specified institutions.  At end December 2014, the redress board had made 15,547 awards, with an overall average award value of &euro;62,240.  The review committee was established to provide for appeals from decisions of the redress board.  The Residential Institutions Redress Board and the review committee have also almost completed their work and it is expected that they will be dissolved this year.  The overall expenditure on the redress scheme is some &euro;1.2 billion. <\/p> <p>  I will now describe the current legislative provisions, which have imposed strict confidentiality requirements on all three bodies.  As far as the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the review committee are concerned, section 28 of the 2002 redress Act prohibits the disclosure of information provided to those bodies other than to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or to an appropriate person in relation to prevention of child abuse.<\/p><p>It also provides for any unauthorised disclosure to be a criminal offence.  Section 28(6) prohibits publication of any information concerning an application or an award that could reasonably lead to the identification of an applicant, an alleged abuser or a residential institution.  Any such publication is also a criminal offence.  <br\/><br\/>Section 28 of the 2000 Act also provides that the commission cannot be required to disclose information provided to it, other than to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent a serious offence or to an appropriate person to prevent child abuse.<br\/><br\/>Section 27 prohibits the disclosure of information provided to the confidential committee, other than in limited circumstances, with any unauthorised disclosure constituting a criminal offence.<br\/><br\/>While section 5(3) of the 2000 Act provides that the commission&rsquo;s report could contain findings that the abuse of children occurred in a particular institution, the person who committed the abuse could only be identified where they had been the subject of a criminal conviction in relation to it.  Under the Act, the commission report could not identify or contain information that could lead to the identification of those who were the subject of abuse in childhood and could not contain findings in relation to particular instances of the alleged abuse of children.<br\/><br\/>Under the existing legislation, it is a matter for each of the three bodies concerned to dispose of their records.  Section 7(6) of the 2000 Act provides that the commission shall make such arrangements as it considers appropriate in relation to the custody and disposal of its documents and copies of documents given to it.  In this regard, the records of the confidential committee are expressly deemed by section 27(5) not to constitute departmental records within the meaning of the National Archives Act 1986 and every witness to the committee was given an assurance of complete confidentiality.  Similarly, the records of the redress board and review committee do not constitute departmental records within the meaning of the National Archives Act 1986 and under sections 28(6) and 28(7) of the 2002 Act, it is a matter for the board or committee respectively to determine the disposal of its documents.<br\/><br\/>If there were no change to the legislation then the board and review committee would be required to destroy their records on dissolution.  The commission would also be required to destroy its confidential committee records.  The commission considered that the retention of investigation committee records which identify individual survivors and alleged abusers would be in breach of the 2000 Act.<br\/><br\/>I will now explain the rationale for the retention of the records.  The Oireachtas has previously considered the issue of the retention of the commission&rsquo;s records.  The Government sponsored motion on the Ryan report on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, which was adopted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on Friday, 12 June 2009, noted &ldquo;the desirability that, in so far as possible, all of the documentation received by and in the possession of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse is preserved for posterity and not destroyed&rdquo;. <i><\/i>The Labour Party's Private Members&rsquo; Institutional Child Abuse Bill 2009 also addressed this issue.  In July 2013, the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, announced that he had secured Government agreement in principle to bring forward legislative proposals to allow for the retention of the records of these three redress bodies.  In the press release of Tuesday, 10<sup><\/sup>March 2015, announcing the publication of the general scheme of the Bill,  Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan announced:<blockquote>In keeping with the motion adopted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann following the publication of the Ryan report, these proposals will allow the documentation received by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse to be preserved for posterity and not destroyed.  They will also preserve the documentation of the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the Review Committee.  These records are highly sensitive and contain the personal stories of victims of institutional child abuse.  I believe that it is very important that these records are not destroyed, both to ensure that future generations will understand what happened and out of respect to the victims who came forward.  By sealing the records for 75 years and ensuring appropriate safeguards on the release of the records thereafter, we are in a position to preserve these sensitive records.<\/blockquote>The retention of these records therefore represents a significant departure from the position provided for in the existing legislation and it is recognised that this is a very sensitive issue.  There is a need for the legislation to balance the rights to privacy of those who gave evidence to the commission and redress bodies against the need to ensure that as a society we never forget the harm that was done to children and the need to ensure that the protection of children is always to the forefront of our minds.  The heads of this Bill attempt to strike this balance.The legal advice is that this balance is achieved if access to the records is prohibited for a lengthy period, of the order of 75 years, having regard to the rights of the parties who engaged with the bodies.<\/p><p>The intention is that after this period the records will be available for public inspection in accordance with conditions stipulated by the director of the National Archives.  It is expected that the individuals involved will be deceased at that stage.<\/p><p> The draft general scheme was circulated to the 18 congregations that are party to the 2002 indemnity agreement and to the various groups representing survivors of residential institutional child abuse.<\/p><p> The Department and the Minister would be happy to consider any views of the committee arising out of its consideration of the Bill.  It would be the Minister&rsquo;s intention to proceed as quickly as possible with the drafting of the Bill after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015041500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429099800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee and updating us on the Department's position on the proposed Bill.  The balance struck is reasonable.  However, when the committees, boards and inquiries were set up, one would have expected the issue to be addressed then, as those who contributed to the inquiries, the redress board and the review committee would have done so on the basis of the 2002 legislation.  Why was that not the case?  It can only have been to try to reassure those coming forward that their contributions would be confidential.  Now we are changing the terms, although I accept it is for valid reasons.  I would be interested to hear any feedback the Department has had arising from its engagement with those who contributed and whose testimony informed those documents.  I would like to hear their views on the issue and whether they would have been as comfortable coming forward in the first place had what we may regard as a reasonable balance been included in the initial legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015041500002#J00300","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1429099800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions.  If we go down the road of new legislation, I would not want to compound the hurt inflicted on children and particularly on those who have given evidence.  I have read some of their submissions, some of which concern reputational damage to organisations.  We are stuck in this difficult situation.  This is a significant departure.  Perhaps Mr. Mulligan would explain where the demand for this has come from.  He mentioned an announcement made by the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, in the D&aacute;il.  Has the demand come from academics, historians or the survivors themselves?  What is the scale of the records being dealt with?  How many records are involved?  What are the criteria for keeping and not keeping records?  How many individuals' records are involved?  Why did the Minister decide not to have a consultation process on the issue?  That is a significant matter.  The complaint throughout has been that people have not been involved in the process.  The next step for the committee is whether it will allow those individuals to give their views, or perhaps that is a discussion for later on.  Is there a concern about legal action, given that testimony was given on the basis of confidentiality which is now being breached, or is that provided for in the new legislation?<\/p> <p>  What will happen to the records held by the Education Finance Board?  Why are they not being included in the legislation?  In one of the submissions, Irish Survivors of Child Abuse, Irish SOCA, complained bitterly about institutional vandalism.  I am conscious that the witnesses may not be able to answer some of these questions.  Why were those records destroyed if we are concerned about keeping records?  Will the Minister make a commitment that there will be no exemptions in the sealing of the records as per the concerns of Irish SOCA?  That is an issue the witnesses may not be able to address, but the Minister needs to return to the committee with that information.  Will the Minister listen to the concerns of survivors who do not agree with this initiative?<\/p><p>There needs to be a consultation process so that this is not just landed on people.  Many people who went through the process said it opened old wounds and was the worst thing they had done.  They had wanted to tell their story but were left devastated as individuals.  What are the implications of any legal actions being taken?  Have any of these records been accessed to assist with the prosecution of individuals or are they kept separate?<\/p><p> The 75-year limit confuses me.  Why is it 75 years?  Is it just a ballpark figure?  The witnesses said there was a legal recommendation but why was it not 50 years?  I presume a lot of the people affected would be dead within 50 years.   Why is it 75 years?  Why is it not 100 years?  When the data are handed over to the National Archives who will be legally responsible for the records?  Does the Department of Education and Skills lose its responsibility for them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015041500002#J00500","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429099800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>My input will be very short.  A number of the victims that came forward to the various redress boards did so on the basis of the legislation that was there at the time.  As Deputy McConalogue has already pointed out, what is very reasonable today was not available to the people who came forward.  I have personal knowledge of one individual who did not come forward because he did not want his name to come out.  The man, who has since died, never sought compensation and this was for two reasons.  One, he did not want to relive what had happened in the institution and, two, he wanted total privacy with respect to what happened to him in his early life.  If we now decide to retain the records - I do not care whether it is for 75 years or 175 years - is there a breach of trust here?<\/p> <p>  Some people will not have mentioned what happened to them to their extended family, such as their in-laws, and will never have mentioned that they were in an institution.  The idea that the information would come out 50 years after they died would cause them pain and suffering right now.  Are we opening the door to possible litigation?  A colleague asked about litigation on behalf of the good names of institutions but what about the good names of individuals?<\/p> <p>  On the subject of consultation, are we going to have to go back to every individual to get a signature from them to say they agree to retaining their records?  Some 15,547 came forward to the redress board having suffered great pain in their younger lives.  Are we now going to force them to go into their old age wondering who is going to find out their secrets?

As Deputy McConalogue said, there is an element of changing the goalposts for both alleged abusers and, in particular, survivors who would have entered into a process in good faith and, with a certain knowledge of the legislation, assured that their identities would be preserved.  Any legislation which attempts to balance rights is difficult because somebody's rights are bound to be chipped away in some respects.  There is a necessity to preserve these records, not for posterity but to ensure this never happens again.  Human nature has collective amnesia and intergenerational amnesia is quite prevalent.  Society is inclined to forget things.<\/p><p>That is why we should preserve the records.  However, we are lighting a 75 year fuse here that could explode in a different context and society.  Take the example of the 1911 census records.  If one trawls through those records, one can identify people who were described as lunatics and one might know their grandsons, grand-daughters or relations.  The term was quite acceptable at that time but it is now unacceptable.  It is just a description, and it is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the sensitivity of these files.  How do we, in 2015, protect something, even in the language, that could be opened in 2080?  It is not the identity of the people who will be deceased, but there is a bigger consideration in terms of their families.  This is still a small country.  It is based on townlands, the parish, the street and the neighbourhood, so we must be very mindful of the dangers of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015041500002#K00300","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429099800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I wish to take up something Deputy Crowe said.  Why is the Department doing it?  I do not understand; perhaps there is something wrong.  They are protected in section 28 of the 2002 redress Act.  That section prohibits the disclosure and publication.  Why are we doing it?  It is after the fact here.<\/p> <p>  Have the witnesses read the submission from the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity and their argument against it?  Have they read the contribution of the Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd?  They make extraordinary arguments as to why it should not be done.  The Oireachtas Library &amp;amp; Research Service has done us a great service.  The questions on pages 9 and 10 of its research ask the question that all of the Senators and Deputies here are asking, namely, where is the expectation of confidentiality which people began with and that is now turned into something else?  Where is the expectation of one's good name, which again people began with and has now become something else?  Where is the expectation of privacy?  In fact, 75 years is not a long time because some of them were infants.  My mother is 93 and she is fine.  The idea appears to be that 75 years is somewhere in the jurassic past.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the witnesses would answer some of these questions because it appears as if we have changed A to B and I am wondering about the reason for that.  If I organise myself, in situation A, from a confidentiality, good name and right to privacy perspective and that is how I got involved, and then it becomes something else, there are legitimate questions to be asked.

It is important that those records are retained and that the State gives a reasonable time, in so far as it can, in terms of protecting people's identity.  Regarding the passage of time and 75 years, one can never copperfasten that.  However, the availability of the data as a standing reminder of the dreadful things that happened must be retained, so we are not left after whatever number of years have passed guessing what happened, using hearsay or trying to interpret something that is almost a lost memory.  The actual data is the basic requirement that society needs.<\/p> <p>  The general point is that there is an overriding and over-arching obligation on the State.

We must respect those concerns; this involves some people who participated in the cruelty and others who did not, and they have very real concerns.  I am not sure whether keeping records will make any difference as nobody will forget what has happened in this country.  We cannot be allowed to forget it and it lives in everybody's memory.  It is a generational issue and it will not go away.<\/p> <p>  The people in question want assurances with respect to confidentiality about what will be kept on file, whether it is for 75 years or longer.  We need to take into account what has been said by these organisations and particularly by individuals.  It is their life that has been destroyed.  There were good and bad ways.  There were many decent religious orders with good priests, nuns and lay people but, unfortunately, a small group of individuals has destroyed their reputation.  Unfortunately for the people who have been left scarred, although they may now be older, they and their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren will always remember the scars.

We are very conscious of how sensitive this area is for individuals and organisations.  There are different points of view and different rights involved.  Reference was made to the difficulty of balancing those rights.  I would not underestimate the difficulty.  I will try to address the questions.  If I miss any, the members may remind me of them.<\/p> <p>  One of the core questions concerns why a change is being advocated now.  Why was this not thought about back in 2000 and 2002, when the legislation was brought in originally?  A watershed moment in the past 15 years was the publication of the Ryan report in 2009.  It established, without any shadow of a doubt, the scale and systematic nature of the abuse that took place and the hurt done to so many children.  That was not known about in 2000 and 2002.  The question of why we are changing now is a fair one.  What I have described is the key in this regard.<\/p> <p>  If we do not do something, the records will be destroyed, as the Chairman said.  The need to remember and to retain the documentation that indicates exactly what happened, the people to whom it happened and the wrong that was done to them is the real reason this Bill is being proposed.  Some commentators have talked about the power of personal testimony.  As the Chairman said, nothing has the same impact as an individual's story about what happened to him or her.  The more we anonymise, sanitise or summarise exactly what happened to individuals, the greater the risk that we will forget what happened.  Perhaps that is the key point.<\/p><p>Our legal advice is approximately 75 years is appropriate.  Fifty years is probably too short because of the points made on life expectancy.  It may be, and I hope it is the case, that average life expectancy will become longer than this.  It is a difficult call to make as to how soon to allow access.  We are balancing the various rights.  I take the point it may be different in 75 years' time and there will be an opportunity to revisit this then.<\/p><p> With regard to the scale, we are speaking about 1 million to 2 million records so it is significant.  These records relate to more than 16,000 applicants to the redress board, more than 1,000 applicants to the review committee and approximately 2,500 individuals who engaged with the commission.  We have been in intensive discussions with the National Archives about this and the intention is not that all of these records will be retained.  Many of them deal with administrative issues such as arranging meetings, which are probably not of archival value.  This is certainly the view of the National Archives.<\/p><p> With regard to the change to the provisions on confidentiality under which people made submissions and applied and whether this is a breach of trust, there is a difficulty with balancing where we thought we were as a society in the period from 2000 to 2002 and where we are now, knowing what happened and what the Ryan report clearly states happened, and the imperative that nothing like it can happen again and the protection of the rights of children are paramount.  How to do this and where to draw the line is a difficult question.  It is one of the issues we have carefully considered with legal advisers, and the outcome of this is that sealing the records for 75 years gets the balance right.<\/p><p> In terms of consultations, what we planned in this area was the subject of a D&aacute;il motion in 2009 and announcements were made in 2013.  When it was published, we circulated the general scheme to congregations and survivor groups for comment.  We have not received as many written submissions as the committee has.  We received two written submissions from congregation groups, we have had some contact with representatives from survivor groups and have received submissions from two individuals.  If the groups which have made submissions to the committee want to send them to the Department, we would be interested in their content and would be willing to meet them to discuss the points raised.  This is an important and sensitive issue and we want to consult and engage with the various groups and individuals who have a view on it.<\/p><p>In regard to who will be legally responsible for the records, currently this is the responsibility of various bodies.  We are working with the National Audit Office on who will bear legal responsibility for them when they move to the National Archives office.<\/p><p> In regard to the education and finance board records, following establishment of the residential institutions statutory fund the property rights and liabilities of the education and finance board were transferred to the residential institutions statutory fund board, which took the decision to destroy those records.  The Minister had no particular role in that regard.  This may in the future lead to some administrative problems in terms of new applications for services to be funded by Caranua but it is not considered to be an impossible thing to overcome.  From the point of view of retention of those records, they were not at that stage considered to be of any particular archival value.<\/p><p> I hope I have answered members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015041500002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429099800,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I am still not satisfied in my mind.

Did somebody say to them that they would be confidential up to a point or not confidential?  I thought they gave these testimonies confidentially.  Is that not the point?  If they are confidential then they should remain so.  Whether people thought that meant they would be held in an archive or destroyed I do not know.

I believe there will be a historical value in these testimonies being available for future generations.<\/p><p>However, I do not think that is the point.  The key point is that these people told their stories on the basis that they would be confidential.  Historically, they were very much failed by the State and by the authorities responsible for looking after them.  I have no doubt it took a hell of a lot for these people to come forward and tell their stories and personal experiences in very intimate detail to the commission, but this was on the basis that it would be confidential.  I now have grave reservations about any decision to change those terms, allowing their stories to be told in 75 years' time whether they like it or not.  As a State, we have an obligation to them on the basis on which they engaged with the State and the inquiries that were established.<\/p><p> Some of the people who gave testimonies are now deceased and there is no basis on which we can inquire retrospectively what their view would have been.  However, they certainly would have departed this world believing that their engagement with the State under law was confidential and would not go any further.  As we know, one of the things that is hardest to come across in life is discretion, and if you want to keep a secret, you keep it to yourself.  People would think that if their engagement was based on law it would be pretty watertight and that it was unlikely that the State would then breach the terms of its engagement and commitment to them.<\/p><p> For those who are deceased, there is certainly a big issue.  For those who, thankfully, are in good health and continue to be with us, I would imagine there is, at a minimum, a responsibility on the State to engage with them.  We should put to them the rationale for the State's seeking to change the terms of its engagement with the commission and why it feels this would be valuable, and ask for their response and consent.  As I said, I do not think it should be the case that we are going to do this whether people like it or not.  We have an obligation to all citizens to respect their wishes, particularly those we have failed in the past.<\/p><p> Mr. Mulligan made the point that the more we anonymise, the more the value of the testimony diminishes.  Names are very important because they continue on and, in 75 years, it will be difficult without names to trace who the person was.  Where a name is given, it will be very straightforward and easy, but much of the impact of these stories could be protected and preserved without the name being there.  It is more tricky in regard to the deceased members but, at a minimum, for those members who are willing to engage with the State at this stage, I would have thought their consent would be an important factor and that they should be consulted.  Has the Department given consideration to this?  What are its considerations and is it something to which it is still open?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015041500002#P00400","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429099800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>To add one sentence to what Deputy McConalogue has said, some of the stories are about familial abuse, parental neglect, psychiatric and learning difficulties and drug and alcohol abuse, so it is not just about abuses by institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015041500002#Q00200","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1429099800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Arising from the discussion, I believe there is huge merit in the retention of the information.

The way that the general scheme has been prepared is that the conditions on the release of records would be stipulated by the director of the National Archives office at the time, in 75 years or whenever.  It is open to consider whether there would be other restrictions or guarantees on that, and maybe that is what some of those who have expressed opinions on it might be interested in.

Mr. Owens is the chief executive of the Cork Business Association, which represents more than 150 businesses in Cork city.  The city of Cork is prone to flooding and many of the businesses represented by the Cork Business Association have serious concerns regarding the level of flood insurance cover on offer at present and in the immediate future.

Rather than going through the entire submission in detail, I will summarise some of its aspects.  As the Chairman noted, the Cork Business Association, which is a not-for-profit organisation, represents more than 150 members across diverse sectors of business within the city.  I will drill down to the association's concern in this regard.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, scheme for flood defence for Cork has been identified as a viable flood risk management option in respect of riverine, fluvial and tidal sources in the Lee catchment flood risk management plan.  As current estimates of the cost of this work are approximately &euro;50 million to &euro;60 million, it is a significant investment of taxpayers' money in the Cork area to provide flood relief.  As a business organisation, the association has visited Fermoy, Clonmel, Waterford and other locations to see the standard and quality of work of the OPW, as well as its effectiveness.  Cork is a different situation in that work has not started and the finance value has not yet been set in absolute terms.  The projected dates for commencement of the work are 2016 or 2017 and the completion date will be up to 2020 and beyond.  Naturally, the expectation among business owners is that once the OPW flood relief scheme is completed, realistic flood insurance cover then will follow.  However, the commentary from the representative body for insurance companies, namely, Insurance Ireland, is somewhat different and this is a major concern.  In its opinion, based on the plans it has seen for the flood relief scheme in Cork, the proposed work will not reduce the risk of flooding sufficiently to allow the industry to provide flood cover for businesses and householders in Cork city.  Consequently, the ongoing difficulties faced by businesses and property owners in Cork city in respect of the lack of flood insurance are set to continue.<\/p><p>Therefore, it begs the question as to what investing in Cork's flood defences will achieve in terms of achieving a reasonable level of insurance cover and what the implications are for similar investment in flood defence schemes nationally.<br\/><br\/>The announcement in March 2014 of a memorandum of understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland allows for the exchange of flood defence data, which we welcome.  Rather than any commitment to provide insurance cover, however, is this really the best we can expect from the insurance industry in light of significant State investment?  We are very determined on one point, namely, that the Government must ensure that the investment in which the State is included delivers more than just an understanding.<br\/><br\/>I again stress that this is a national issue, but I am giving the Cork perspective.  What does the future hold for our members who cannot currently get flood insurance?  What do the next six years hold for our members while the flood defence works are underway, during which there is a very real possibility of being flooded again?  The lack of clarity on this issue has massive implications for the future development of the city.  How do we in the Cork Business Association encourage businesses affected by the lack of insurance cover to invest in their premises and to upgrade same if they cannot protect them?  How do we encourage domestic and foreign inward investment if we cannot guarantee such investment is protected?  <br\/><br\/>It is imperative that homes and businesses in Cork city and nationally can access flood insurance at a reasonable cost without delay.  The <i>status quo<\/i>is unsustainable, with many businesses and homeowners exposed to massive risk.  We fully understand that insurance is not for inevitable loss.  However, being able to transfer risk, which has been done traditionally through insurance, is critical to the economic success of any region as commercial operations simply will not start, develop and thrive without this mechanism.  The concept of the premiums of the many paying for the losses of the few is one of the foundation stones of insurance when one considers the advances being made in the UK.  For further clarification, I can provide information on the flood relief scheme in the UK.  It is not in place just yet, but the insurance industry has taken some degree of ownership and has involved itself in developing a scheme which seems to have some potential.  I respect that it will operate within the private sector in terms of domestic, and not commercial, insurance, but the framework has significant logic which could be examined.  Essentially, it is a reinsurance scheme with a certain fund.  Claims and policies are dealt with as normal, but if there is a fund claim, the insurance company can claim against the fund as a backup.<br\/><br\/>The nub of the question is the investment that is included for Cork, which is &euro;50 million or &euro;60 million.  The soundbites from the insurance industry indicate that it is not good enough.  The OPW, which has a superb standard and quality of work and has proved effective, is involved in a one in 100 year flood defence system.  Is it the OPW or the insurance industry that decides on the quality of the work?  If there is a question to be asked, it needs to be clarified before we invest a significant amount of ratepayers' money in a flood defence scheme and end up without any flood cover.  We would then again be in a situation whereby we have a flood defence scheme, but no way to protect businesses and households in the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lawrence Owens","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429095600,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for inviting me.  It is a pleasure to share what I hope will be some useful insights.  In terms of my background, as the Chairman mentioned I worked in the insurance industry and have seen it from the private sector side in terms of arranging flood insurance and working with flood victims, a point which is important to consider.  There is a human side and a business angle, in terms of an insurance company making a commercial decision on whether to provide insurance.  There is a public finance aspect which is probably where this committee comes in.  There is also a climate and flood risk dimension, which is important to clarify at the outset.  It is a multidimensional issue and the stakeholders involved all come from very different angles and follow very different premises, which is what makes it so difficult to find a solution.<\/p> <p>  There is no silver bullet for arranging flood insurance.  In my submission I highlighted the fact that there are a large variety of insurance concepts around the world.<\/p><p>I have had the dubious pleasure of being involved in discussions in some EU countries, in the US and in developing countries where efforts are being made to design flood insurance.  Closer to home, I have been involved in the Flood Re discussion.  It is important to highlight that various concepts are floating around and that almost every single concept has its flaws.  Almost every country is discussing the possibility of reforming or redesigning it.  I say that just as a statement.  I know it is not very helpful because the committee would probably have loved to be given an example of something that is working very well.  It is a particular challenge in light of the need to bridge the gap between current risk - what is of concern to stakeholders such as businesses - and future risk in terms of climate change and rising flood risk.  I think that is the first aspect of the matter.<\/p><p> My key message is that when we talk about insurance, we need to consider both of its dimensions - the risk side, which relates to issues like information, prevention and planning, and the compensation side, which relates to how it is organised.  In most of the existing schemes across the world, these sides are not really closely integrated.  My observation is that it is really important for us to tie them together as we go forward.  We need to make sure the compensation side is closely linked to our understanding of risks.  This reflects on the previous speaker's comments about who decides, judges or takes a stance in terms of risk levels.  It is important to consider that aspect of the matter.  It is of fundamental importance that the risk side and the compensation side are closely linked into the future.<\/p><p> The next point I would like to make relates to the design of insurance that is fit for the future.  I would say three key principles usually need to be borne in mind.  The first of those principles, affordability, relates to the requirement for home owners and businesses to be able to pay for insurance.  The second principle, availability, is provided for through the private sector, is provided for publicly, or is provided for through a mix - usually in the form of a public private partnership.  The third principle, financial sustainability or solvency, is quite an important aspect of the matter.  I refer to whether the scheme is actually solvent in terms of paying out claims and is likely to be around not just for the next year but for the next five to ten years, at least.<\/p><p> I would add the issue of vulnerability and exposure as a further factor on the risk side.  Obviously, one faces certain trade-offs when one is designing an insurance scheme.  For example, one must make a decision on whether the scheme is affordable for everyone.  One must consider the affordability of insurance for newer properties by comparison with insurance for older properties.  One must look at whether it is affordable for people who are extremely vulnerable and for small and big businesses.  Many decisions that are almost normative need to be made.  A decision needs to be made on who decides what is affordable, for example.  I was involved in a survey of small businesses across England.  When we asked them about the affordability of flood insurance, we got a wide spread of responses.  It is important for us to recognise that when we are considering who should decide how much an affordable insurance policy should cost and who should set the rate system.<\/p><p> The issue of availability is related to the question of how much the public is expected to intervene and be involved.  As I said, there are schemes in which the public is basically providing all the funding and is reinsuring the schemes.  For example, flood insurance is the second largest public liability on the public budget in the US.<\/p><p>That is one extreme and then there is the case of completely privately arranged flood insurance in other countries, such as in Scandinavia.  That deals with the question of to what extent is there a degree of intervention.<\/p><p> Financial stability is obviously a question for the regulator and it is important to recognise that the regulator has certain parameters in terms of setting risk levels beyond which an insurance company cannot go.  For example, if an insurance company underwrites flood insurance risk up to a certain level, it needs to prove that it is able to manage and respond to those claims and that is often in conflict with the local decision of accepting a certain level of flood risk.  For an insurance company, that decision is driven by regulatory settings and then facing the local demand for insurance cover.  It is important to recognise what potential the role of the regulator could play in this.<\/p><p> The final issue is vulnerability and exposure and the risk aspects.  I often think that going forward an insurance system, flood risk management and planning are important but what is probably needed most is a resilience broker.  It is almost like an independent body that shares the information, ensures transparency in risk data and co-ordinates prevention while also having a role in ensuring access to insurance and providing case-by-case advice.  That is often missing.  Going forward, that is an interesting aspect in order that there is not just a focus on an insurance broker but potentially a resilience broker who could fill that role.<\/p><p> There are couple of issues I could highlight in the context of the advantages and disadvantages of certain systems but they could be picked up in the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Swenja Surminski","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429095600,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Owens and Dr. Surminski and I thank them both for their time and opening statements.

The vast majority of our members on that island do not have flood insurance.  Some may have had their last flood insurance before the last episode but that get out of jail card is gone and they are now without insurance cover.  I will give an example of one trader who was flooded in 2014.  She had flood insurance and the premises was devastated.  A &euro;250,000 investment was put into the premises.  It was built in with huge resilience in the premises in terms of what can be done.  There are certain mechanisms that can be applied at a business level to make a premises somewhat robust in terms of flood prevention and flood defences.  However, with regard to her insurance going forward, she has a &euro;20,000 excess only.  That is not an excess on the bottom down.  That is the most she can ever get if her business is flooded again and, therefore, traders either have no flood insurance or it is so negligible that it is not worth it.<\/p> <p>  The economy is on an upturn and businesses are starting to reopen.  Flood insurance is a basic requirement for loan approval from a bank.  If one does not have it, the loan is gone.<\/p><p>Local and multinational investment will continue to be affected because whereas flood insurance is a given in most locations, unfortunately in Cork, particularly on the island, businesses do not have it.  It is extremely difficult to run a business in the knowledge that flooding, which is inevitable unless defences are installed in the coming years, will probably wipe out one's business.  It is very difficult to trade in this type of environment.  Statistics show that &euro;500 million has been spent nationally on flood defences and it is forecast that a further &euro;210 million will be spent for this purpose.  Our concern, as I intimated, is that the large sums spent by taxpayers on flood defences surely deserve some degree of recognition.  The defences established by the Office of Public Works in Cork function and are sufficiently resilient to provide some level of defence.  The insurance industry should re-examine its position.  While I agree with Dr. Surminski that there is no silver bullet that will resolve this issue, the problem will get worse if we ignore it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lawrence Owens","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429095600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Would another flood event in Cork wipe out certain businesses that do not have insurance cover?

In that sense, under the climate change agenda, one of the measures we are taking is retrofitting houses with insulation to improve their energy efficiency.  In response to rising sea levels and the increased likelihood of flood risk, is there a case for areas that are subject to recurrent flooding to have a programme of retrofitting premises with the optimum level of flood defence mechanisms available?  Mr. Owens made reference to new builds, but is there a level of retrofitting on individual premises that can mitigate problems, and what kind of costs would this involve?  On that basis, could the State enter into partnership with the insurance sector to work along those lines?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#H00600","speaker":"986","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429095600,"counter":95,"content":"<p>There are a number of questions and I will go back to the initial one in terms of Fermoy and Clonmel.  We do not have empirical data from those areas in terms of the cover of flood insurance but I am aware anecdotally that it has not changed the goalposts.  There are certain businesses there that did not have insurance prior to the work being completed and they are still in the same position.  It has not changed.  In terms of the one in 100 years timeframe, it is early days in respect of towns such as Fermoy and Clonmel.<\/p> <p>  In the second part of Deputy Creed's question on the standard and quality of work, the OPW has the hydrologists.  They have the expertise and the track record historically of doing this type of work.  Their analysis, and the levels and quality of their work so far, has proved effective.  A comprehensive study was carried out by the OPW where 300 locations in Ireland were identified as particularly prone to flooding.  All of that data is now shared with the insurance sector.  There is total transparency in terms of the data.  I am assured that the insurance sector itself has comprehensive data on the country's insurance issues.  There is quite a benchmark level of data out there for the insurance sector.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Creed on retrofitting.  Retrofitting could be done, certainly on a local basis, to build in resilience to one's premises, whether through non-returnable valves for the pipe networks coming into the buildings or defence mechanisms on the side walls because, where one defends one's premises and makes it as resilient and robust as possible, if one's neighbour next door does not, it comes through the walls.  In terms of flooding, the weakest link in the chain will result in the domino effect.  However, at an individual level, there could be such initiatives, whether through a rate reduction or a local authority initiative in that area to assist businesses.  While that can help and would be beneficial, the local work on the individual premises coupled with the significant work on a macro scale by the OPW would deliver a much more resilient area, including individual premises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lawrence Owens"},{"type":"speech","time":1429095600,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Dr. Surminski probably wishes to comment on what sort of retrofitting can be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#J00300","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429095600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>The retrofitting aspect is important, although there is still a lack of clarity in terms of assessing and evaluating the impact that process can have on the outcome of a flood.

There is also a human dimension.  Some of these measures require a person to be present in the facility to operate them and sometimes that is the weak link in making it in time for the flood.

I was watching the proceedings on the monitor in the office and feel there are some points we may need to clarify.<\/p> <p>  Unless one knows Cork very well &ndash; a few of us around this table do &ndash; one might think the entire city was under water all at once.  That is actually not true.  Although there were floods in Blackpool, the city centre and Douglas, these were three separate events, even though the Blackpool area flooded several times.  It is important to understand how the city floods.  The water does not always come over the quay walls.  The water rises because it is a tidal city and is between two rivers, which is important to realise.<\/p> <p>  When young people were experiencing difficulty getting insurance for their cars a number of years ago, we set out a mechanism to address this and to put in place an appeals system.  This was to ensure they could get insurance and it had the dramatic effect of lowering the cost.<\/p> <p>  I understand fully that insurance companies would be reluctant to include flood abatement measures after a premises has been flooded.  Mr. Owens will know that when people start to reinstate their premises after a flood, particularly if that premises is a food outlet, such as a restaurant or delicatessen, they protect against the possibility of a recurrence themselves, where they can.  What happens once might not necessarily happen the next time round.  On the last occasion, a particular premises was very badly hit because sewage came up.  As it was a food outlet, one can imagine the consequences.  What I have described happens anyway in that retailers bear the cost of the additional measures, which is important to realise.<\/p> <p>  Although the OPW is doing what it needs to do, including engaging in ongoing consultation, creating flood plains and taking other measures, I am never certain how a tidal river can be controlled.  I am never certain about it because, as has been said, the two causes of flooding can sometimes come into play at the same time.  However, greater minds than mine will tackle that.<\/p> <p>  People clearly cannot continue to operate their businesses without insurance, although I know many do.  It must be a cause of constant worry to them.  A sinking fund or the type of mechanism we put in place for young drivers refused by three insurance companies should come into play in this instance.  It needs to happen while the project is being worked on.  I am not certain whether that makes any sense or whether it would be one of the suggestions the delegation would make, but we must consider it.<\/p><p>It was not just the city centre.  It involved the two major commercial areas in the city that were flooded, and they are a distance apart.  One did not necessarily affect the other at that time.<\/p><p> There is another issue in terms of who controls and manages the waterways.  That is not clear.  The city council will come out and throw the grappling hooks under the bridges and try to get out as much as it can.  Waterways Ireland manages the waterways to a certain point within the city.  That clarity must come about.  Who exactly is responsible and what is the plan for the management of the waterways?  As a result of high tides, heavy rainfall and the release of water, there will be times when there will be flooding no matter how clear are the waterways.  That can be managed and explained, and people understand those circumstances.  They may not accept them but they understand them.<\/p><p> With respect to solutions, how do we manage to remove risk from people while work is ongoing?  When the work is completed, how can we force insurance companies to insure people who have done all in their power to ensure the damage does not happen again?  Senator Barrett is quite right.  I can have five crashes on the road up and back from Dublin but no one would ever refuse to give insurance because of that.  There is a significant difference and it must be about how we ensure people can get cover to continue trading.  If this is not done, there will be an impact on the commercial life of the city, and it will suffer as a result.  I would like to hear the views on the solution.  We can examine the problem from now until Christmas but what are the solutions?  How will they come into play?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#Q00500","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429095600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I compliment the Minister of State's knowledge of the potential areas for flooding and she is absolutely correct.  With respect to inbuilt resilience, she is correct that businesses would have placed an onus to invest an extra portion, but that must be controlled with some degree of logic.  Even if businesses do the work, they may not get the credit with an insurance spin-off.  There should be an agreement to put this in place from a legislative perspective, so if someone does A or B, there will be recognition of that from the insurance company.  A voluntary process is still not good enough.  The Minister of State is correct that the process has begun.  Food businesses have a particular difficulty as the water that comes up is sewage water and it is polluted, so the entire building must be reinstated to a certain specification.  There must be an agreed guideline and benchmark that the insurance industry can live with and which is in line with best practice in terms of the Government's understanding.  It must be managed in this way.  That would be a help but currently the process is just blowing in the wind with respect to what particular businesses do.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State is correct about flooding in Cork.  Blackpool is a particular area subject to flooding.  One of the reasons is a lack of maintenance and she was quite right to highlight the waterways coming to Blackpool.  Much of the water was cleared by local businesses to ensure water flows back to the Lee rather than flooding Blackpool.  A combination must involve better management of waterways but the Minister of State is also correct in stating there is a lack of clarity about who controls the waterways.  It is a case of it being one party or another but nothing happening, leading to it being someone else's problem.  There must be understanding as to whether Waterways Ireland or the local council is responsible.  If no one is responsible, no one does anything.  That is a concern that we must clarify.<\/p> <p>  Some of the solutions are already there in plans, particularly for Cork, and they are on the conveyor belt to be rolled out.

That is particularly so in Tralee, Ballylongford and the Cashin, which are prone not only to river flooding but also to tidal flooding.  The enormity of the infrastructure that is required to protect it is such that it is probably beyond comprehension both financially and geographically.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a number of points.  One is the inability of people to access insurance due to the OPW maps which point out areas that are open to risk and areas that have potential under the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, which is the study undertaken to identify areas that are potentially open to more flooding in the future with the increasing levels of tides and sea levels.  Insurance companies have identified these and are not allowing any insurance in these areas at all.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Owens referred to France and Belgium, where people cannot be denied insurance.  I am of the opinion that there should be not so much a sinking fund as that everyone should have access to insurance.  However, people can be denied insurance by the fact that the price of the insurance can be too onerous.  It can be extortionate in nature and essentially push a person away from taking it on.  Will Dr. Surminski say whether there is a cap and collar mechanism in place whereby there is a percentage insurance companies can make on individual homes, more so than businesses?  We have given a great deal of time to discussing businesses.  However, business has the ability to trade its way out of the problem at some level, but individuals do not have that ability.  The valuation on a house, especially for the fair deal scheme, access to houses, the ability to re-sell individual homes and the ability to trade up and trade down, which the Government is trying to encourage, are all enormously affected by whether one's house is in such an area.  Are there tax incentives in other countries as well?  Dr. Surminski referred to a Swiss scheme earlier, whereby there was state involvement in the protection and in the payment thereafter.  Will she explain a little further how that works?<\/p> <p>  Currently, there are people in this country who do not have access to insurance and their homes are increasingly prone to flooding.  The industry as a whole appears to be socialised when it goes into a default position of collapsing, as we notice from the levies imposed here, but when an insurance company is in a position to privatise and alleviate higher risk, it does so to the detriment of society.  Cork has been mentioned a great deal at this meeting, but the problem is getting worse in my area.  I know the witnesses do not wish to cite an example, but we will have to do something about this.  If Dr. Surminski could give us some type of roadmap, we could diverge from that along the way.  What does she think is the best thing for Ireland to do at this point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#S00300","speaker":"1048"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429095600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>On the specific questions about Cork and what could be done about the immediate situation of businesses not being able to access insurance, I refer to my earlier comment.  In the case of Cork I have not followed the discussions and my suggestion might have already happened.<\/p><p>The first suggestion would be to get the insurance industry, business, counsel and local stakeholders around a table and for everyone to be transparent about flood risk.  Do we all share the same information about flood risk?  If we do not, it could be one of the reasons there are different levels of flood risk information.  In certain cases in England, Members of Parliament got involved because some of their constituencies received conflicting flood risk information and public flood risk maps showed something different from what the insurance flood risk maps showed.  The question arose of how to manage that.  I would suggest an open discussion to ask if everyone agreed on the level of flood risk and whether everyone agreed on what was in the pipeline in terms of defence work and flood risk management work.  On that basis it should be fairly logical to establish what insurers would deem acceptable in terms of flood risk at a business level.  We could then build on that.  It might have already happened but it seems to me to be the logical first step.<\/p><p> We also need to be careful not to jump to the conclusion that more State intervention is what is needed.  My rule is that there is a justification for state intervention if access to insurance is blocked and if that has a detrimental impact on home owners, business owners and the like.  After the 9\/11 attacks, terrorism cover was not available and a lot of businesses ceased to be able to trade so a state solution was put in place immediately.  Before we in Ireland can say we are at such a moment, we need to ask what the blockages are which prevent insurance from being available.  I get the impression it is not the lack of flood risk management and investment, though usually the first thing one hears from the community and from insurers is that not enough is being done to manage flood risk.  This meeting gives me the impression that this is not the problem but we do need to investigate the blockages before we draw the conclusion that there is a case for the State to intervene.<\/p><p> I was asked for certain examples.  One thing that came to mind is that Germany, after its floods of two years ago, put in place a mechanism in which local businesses and home owners could only access public compensation money if they could prove that they were not able to insure themselves.  In a way, Germany faces almost the opposite problem to us in that the insurance take-up is very low.  A point was made about the car scheme for young drivers who were not able to get insurance and one could imagine something similar being put in place as an immediate backstop.  First, though, we need to understand what the real blockages are because I am not convinced we really understand them as yet.  <\/p><p> Deputy Spring asked what we could do to influence the price or availability of insurance.  There are examples of schemes whereby subsidies are given to people facing higher flood risk and flood insurance bills because they live in higher-risk areas.  In the US they have such subsidies and one can claim support which goes straight into one's flood insurance premium.  It is a linked system whereby the state subsidises a person's flood insurance bill.<\/p><p>Rate controls could be set by setting a cap.  In that way one could say flood insurance is capped.  There is an overall rate that could be linked to flood risk levels.  For example, if one lives in a one in 100 year flood zone, the price is X.  That is what is being tried with Flood Re in England, but it is being linked to council tax levels.  Basically, one's council tax determines what one pays for flood insurance.  The problem that creates is that it is not linked to the flood risk issue.  I think there needs to be at least some way of linking it back to the flood risk, not just the council tax band.  There are some examples and options as to what one can do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Swenja Surminski","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429095600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I agree with many of the contributions made.  We have a particular problem in Cork with OPW maps, as stated earlier.  Consultation is taking place.  A private company is doing the mapping and people are giving their observations.  Many of these flood plains have been viewed from the sky and are computer generated models but are completely inaccurate on the ground.  Funds have not been put in place to determine whether the map is correct.  Once the map is generated, it creates problems.  In my own locality many people were unable to get insurance cover.  On these maps, the flood plain finishes in the centre of a hill.  Water has never travelled uphill before and will not in the future, unless something odd happens.  It is embarrassing trying to defend such a map.  Certainly for people looking for insurance it is major concern as their biggest asset is their house.<\/p> <p>  I am well aware of the position in Cork city, having been a member of the council at the time it flooded.  It was a shocking situation.  The library was due to open on the day of the flooding.  The university was completely damaged.

Great damage was done.  We cannot put our finger on it and point out the chain of events but we need to look at how each person in each section could modify their behaviour to make sure this does not happen.  We heard all kinds of stories about the dam being opened and cascades of water coming down.  I am not sure how one gets people to take responsibility but public engagement is very interesting.  Perhaps we should have a sinking fund - pardon the pun - similar to the fund for uninsured drivers where if one is unlucky to have a crash, there is a way of getting compensation.  I agree there are blockages in terms of ownership.  How does one get compensation?  If a person looks for insurance cover and cannot get it, there should be a place to send that person before the event, rather than the person saying afterwards that he or she was looking for it and is now looking for compensation.   That person is already in the middle of a traumatic event without them having to look for paperwork they may not have.<\/p> <p>  There are now many apartment blocks very close to the Rive Lee in Cork city.  The car park can get flooded and possibly the first floor of the apartment block.  While those on the second, third and fourth floors are not flooded, they have a responsibility, through their management agency, to provide for the structure of the building.  They will get insurance cover by virtue of being on the higher levels but there must be some way of involving the owners who have a responsibility for flooding.  It is a complex issue.  I thought we in Cork were the only people dealing with this situation but there are others involved.<\/p><p>Unless we put some structure in place, this is going to be a talking shop for a long time to come.  I agree with the principle that insurance should be widely available.  The witness says in point five that it has to be practical and deliverable.  If it is not practical, this will continue and I do not believe anybody wants to see it continue, but we do not want to create a situation where the State takes on all or undue risk and it is offloaded by insurers who think the State is an easy touch.  We can all see the problems but I wonder if some Department will take it up.  Maybe it is for the local authority to take it up in the first instance and try to become the effective people to change this and get it correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#U00300","speaker":"980","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429095600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>The OPW is making a presentation at 2.15 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#V00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1429095600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I am aware of that but we have been having this battle with the OPW for years.

It was to have given the insurance companies more data with which to make informed decisions on whether they can say \"yes\", but ironically it has given the insurance companies a bigger argument with which to say \"no\".  The answer cannot be achieved without the insurance industry being absolutely involved in the decision-making process, but we must look at agreed standards of internal construction or defence mechanisms within each building, which should be part of the insurance companies' pitch for customers' policies.  That should be agreed with Government involvement.

The Office of Public Works has a specific role in the exchange of information with the insurance industry on flood risk and flood defence matters.  The OPW has no responsibility for the oversight or regulation of the insurance industry, insurance matters generally or for issues of subsidence.<\/p> <p>  I will outline for committee members the OPW's responsibilities in the area of flood risk management to be helpful.  Following the strategic review of flood risk policy in 2004, the OPW was assigned the lead co-ordinating role for flood risk management in Ireland.  At the core of the OPW's work is the objective of reducing, to the greatest extent possible, the level of flood risk to people, property, infrastructure and the environment.  In the context of its role and responsibilities in respect of flood risk management, the OPW delivers services through the following four key areas: strategic planning to manage flood risk in future under the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, which also ensures that Ireland is in compliance with the EU floods directive; a programme of capital investment to address existing flood risk to properties and infrastructure through major and minor flood relief projects, which are delivered largely in partnership with local authorities; programmed maintenance of arterial drainage and urban flood relief schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts; and an advisory role to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government as well as assisting the public to prepare and recover from flooding.  In carrying out its functions, the OPW works in close co-operation with other State bodies, principally the local authorities, which have key responsibilities in the area of flood risk management in the country as well.<\/p> <p>  I am keen to discuss the memorandum of understanding with Insurance Ireland as part of the agenda for today's meeting.  The Government has agreed that the current strategy of the OPW investing in flood defences and flood defence schemes in the worst-affected areas as well as the CFRAM programme represent the most cost-effective solution to the difficulties faced by people from flood risk, including the difficulty of obtaining insurance cover.  To support the regular exchange of information between the insurance industry and the OPW in respect of flood defence works, a memorandum of understanding between Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance companies in Ireland, and the Office of Public Works was signed on 24 March 2014 following some 14 months of work, including detailed technical work on the format of the data to be provided by the OPW to Insurance Ireland.<\/p><p> As I indicated earlier, the OPW has no role or responsibility regarding the oversight or regulation of the insurance industry.  The memorandum of understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland has a specific focus to agree a basis on which information can be provided to the insurance industry on flood relief schemes completed by the OPW and the standard of protection offered by those schemes.  While it is accepted that the provision of cover, the level of premiums charged, and the policy terms applied are a matter for individual insurers, the memorandum notes the OPW requirement that, when assessing exposure to flood risk, insurers take full account of information provided by the OPW on completed flood defence schemes.<\/p><p> The memorandum is also focused on the provision of data by Insurance Ireland to the OPW about areas impacted by flood loss.  The memorandum of understanding will not guarantee the availability of flood risk cover in the locations concerned.  The memorandum came into effect on 1 June 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the OPW to Insurance Ireland in respect of 12 completed flood defence schemes, showing the design, extent and nature of the protections offered by these works.  A list of these schemes has been provided to the committee.<\/p><p> Insurance Ireland in early 2015 provided some general and provisional data to the OPW about current levels of flood cover for households and businesses affected by these 12 schemes.  The provisional data provide early indications that flood risk insurance is widely available in areas where flood relief schemes have been completed by the OPW.  A more definitive breakdown on the provision of flood insurance risk will not be available from Insurance Ireland until after June, when a full renewal cycle has been completed following the coming into effect of the memorandum.<\/p><p> Following receipt of these provisional data, the Insurance Ireland-OPW flood working group met, with the Department of Finance joining the group for that meeting.  A meeting took place on 3 March 2015 and the next meeting is scheduled for later this month.  The OPW expects metrics on the additional insurance coverage that results from the construction of flood defence works will become available as part of the ongoing exchange of information with Insurance Ireland.  Since the last meeting, the OPW and the Department of Finance have been in consultation on the subject of required clarification in relation to these initial data and further information we wish to have included in the data gathering work undertaken by Insurance Ireland.  We will write to Insurance Ireland to set out some of those issues.<\/p><p> The arrangements set out in the memorandum represent an ongoing process.  In January 2015, data on a further four flood relief schemes, provided to the committee in an appendix to the statement, was communicated by the OPW to Insurance Ireland in the agreed format and data on further completed schemes will be provided in due course.<\/p><p> Ultimately, it is a matter for the insurance companies to decide how they will use the information provided on completed flood defence schemes.  As part of the process, they are committed to taking the information into account in their assessment of risk and it is hoped that this will facilitate the provision of flood insurance cover in areas that are protected by completed schemes.<\/p><p> In conclusion, the OPW is committed to doing all it can across its four key areas of activity within available resources to identify and prioritise the measures necessary to manage the risks from significant floods.  Our work is towards the core objective of reducing, to the greatest extent possible, the level of flood risk to people, property, infrastructure and the environment.  The data exchange between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, through the memorandum, is a means of measuring the outcome and the impact of the Government's current policy and investment in this area.  I am happy to take any questions from committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#EE00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Smyth","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429095600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>The next contributor is Mr. Thompson.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#FF00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429095600,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Insurance Ireland prepared the following brief statement.  On behalf of the members of Insurance Ireland, I welcome the opportunity to address the joint committee on the provision of insurance in areas at risk of flooding and subsidence.  Insurance Ireland, the leading voice of insurance, represents 95% of the domestic insurance and 85% of the international life insurance market.<\/p> <p>  Insurance Ireland members pay out more than &euro;5.4 billion in claims each year to Irish customers and contribute over &euro;1.6 billion in tax to the Exchequer per annum.  Property claims costs exceeded &euro;400 million in 2013.  There were over 100,000 property claims in 2013 when one adds up the cost of claims arising from all insured perils.  Household and small business policies are package policies covering a range of perils such as fire, storm, flood, theft, subsidence, and escape of water, such as burst pipes following a freeze.  We have experienced 14 major weather events since 2000.  The claims cost of these events are highlighted in the submission to the committee, with the largest for flooding costing &euro;244 million in November 2009.<\/p><p>The total cost of claims for the period since 2000 is &euro;1.445 billion.  <\/p><p> The winter storms of December 2013 to February 2014 were the most recent major weather events.  Taken together, claims costs resulting from these storms amounted to approximately &euro;157 million.  There were just over 30,000 claims, predominantly storm but also some flood claims, arising from these storms, with approximately 70% by number and cost resulting from the storms in February 2014, which climaxed with Storm Darwin on 12 February.  Insurers rose to the logistical challenge of dealing with more than 30,000 claims in such a short period of time and worked hard to ensure that policyholders' claims were handled quickly.<\/p><p> Of the above 14 major weather events, eight were floods.  The total cost of these flood events was &euro;697 million.  There are, in addition, many smaller, localised pluvial, fluvial and tidal flooding events on an ongoing basis.  Flooding can arise from a number of sources &ndash; pluvial, fluvial, coastal inundation, blocked drains, burst water mains and dam failure.<\/p><p> Capital expenditure on flood risk management over the years 2001 to 2014 averaged &euro;28 million per annum.  This is far short of what is needed.  To put this in context, the cost of the 2006 Kilkenny flood defence scheme alone was &euro;48 million.  Adequate investment in flood defences is vital.  The increased frequency of flooding in recent years highlights the need for action to be taken now in the affected areas so that flood defences are constructed to the desired standard of 1 in 100 as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> Flood insurance is widely available in Ireland and the household insurance market is very competitive.  Flood is a standard peril in household insurance policies.  All policyholders pay a contribution - low-risk areas subsidise high-risk areas.  Some people pay a higher premium or have a higher flood excess because the flood risk is higher.  Exclusion of cover is a last resort.  Insurance offers protection against a risk but not a certainty.  It is not tenable to ask policyholders in general to absorb the cost of inevitable losses.<\/p><p> Insurance Ireland's goals are, as far as possible, to preserve the widespread availability and affordability of insurance and to partner with Government and the OPW in particular to achieve this.  The elements necessary for the sustainable provision of insurance are investment by Government in structural and non-structural measures, flood mapping and accurate data to facilitate risk assessment, high penetration levels to prevent adverse risk selection, continued availability of re-insurance and the addressing of deficiencies in the planning guidelines.<\/p><p> Insurance Ireland has constructive engagement with the OPW on flooding through our joint working group.  In addition, the memorandum of understanding, MOU, which we have with the OPW involves the OPW sharing flood defence data on previously completed schemes with Insurance Ireland so that insurance companies can take this into account when assessing flood risk.  The MOU is the start of a process which will help our members make flood insurance more widely available in areas benefitting from flood defences built to the desired standard of 1 in 100.<\/p><p> Finally, there are small pockets of the country which are prone to subsidence, but the problems on the south side of Cork city are the most long-standing and well known.  These areas are prone to subsidence due to the effect of naturally occurring water or leakage from underground pipes on the limestone which is characteristic of these areas.  The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the underground pipes are clay pipes which are susceptible to cracking when, for example, development takes place.  In effect, the resulting underground erosion causes downward movement of the ground supporting properties.<\/p><p> Individual insurers make their own underwriting decisions on subsidence based on their own company claims experience.  They also consider the claims history of individual properties and the relevant geographical and geological features of the area when deciding what premium to charge and what terms and conditions to apply.  Insurers may charge a higher premium or impose a higher subsidence excess on the policy or, in some cases, may have to withdraw cover.  Subsidence claims are by their nature very costly and insurers take these actions in the interests of policyholders in general to keep premiums affordable.  Insurance is about covering people against the risk of something happening rather than against inevitable events.  Subsidence in some parts of Cork city is, unfortunately, inevitable due to the prevailing ground conditions exacerbated by the presence of underground clay pipes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#FF00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429095600,"counter":186,"content":"<p>The witnesses are very welcome.

The OPW has done catchment flood risk assessment and management reports.  I have raised this question before but what level of feed-in does the OPW have with local authorities in terms of their county development plans regarding flood risk in identified areas?  Apart from the CFRAM reports, what level of communication is there?  While it is right to map areas for flood risk, once an area is put on the map, it frightens the daylights out of most people, including those who thought the area was safe to build on, the banks which might be asked to provide loans and finance and the insurance companies providing cover in an area that might not have been considered a flood risk five years previously.  Could the OPW representatives talk about this?<\/p> <p>  The OPW presentation stated the OPW works with the local authorities under the Arterial Drainage Acts.  However, the remaining joint drainage boards were abolished last year.  In regard to the large rivers in Ireland, I am from Leinster so I know the Barrow and the Nore.  It was right that there was a joint drainage board for rivers that traversed Counties Offaly, Laois, Kildare and Carlow, for example.  However, they have been abolished and each council will do its own little bit.  Each council will focus only up to its county boundary and will not care what happens in the next county.  Has it had an impact?  The witnesses will probably have to tell me it has not.  The joint drainage boards must have been doing some good work and I am concerned that their abolition could result in increased flooding.  At least when these rivers came under a drainage board, there was a dedicated budget and staff.  While the functions of the boards have been transferred back to the local authorities, the staff who were doing the river drainage have probably ended up filling potholes or repairing footpaths.  Does the OPW have any concerns?  Maybe it is too early for it to have a view.<\/p> <p>  The OPW's report mentioned no figures.  Given what the witnesses know about what it takes to solve the known risks of flooding, could they give us a figure?  I am sure it would be billions of euro.  Is it planned to do this over 20 years, 30 years, or two generations?  What do they have each year and what would they like to have?<\/p> <p>  I mentioned the River Barrow.  I am pleased that the 12 schemes the OPW handed over under the memorandum have been assessed and that in January 2015, that and four further ones were handed over to the OPW for consideration.  The Kildare scheme was completed in 2000.  Why has it taken five years for the scheme's information to be handed over?  The Carlow scheme was completed in 2012.  Why was the information not handed over before now, so it could have been assessed?  The insurance industry has not been able to take on board work that was done more than three years ago.  While my questions are mainly for the OPW, I will would like to hear comments from Insurance Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#HH00500","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429095600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Absolutely.  To deal first with the development issue, which the Deputy touched on, the production of maps is identifying a risk that already exists but may not be known.  Therefore, there will be a point where, while people will say they never experienced a flood, the floods, particularly extreme floods, will be mapping and showing.  The importance of doing this is that we can build that into the planning and development decision-making process through the local authorities and the planning authorities.  With our colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, we developed guidelines for flood risk and the planning system.  Taken together with the flood maps, these should improve the decision-making about building in areas at risk from flooding, and that should not happen from now on because we now have that information.<\/p> <p>  A feature of the 2009 flood was the number of people who said they had never experienced a flood and did not expect a flood.  Now, with the finalising of the flood maps in the next number of weeks, we will know the extent of the risk.  The maps have been out for public consultation in recent months so that piece of work is now drawing to an end.  The maps have been available in draft form to the local authorities and will be formally made available to everybody to consult in order to avoid building in areas that are at risk.  We also run workshops for planning authority staff to help them understand the maps and understand how they might use them in conjunction with the guidelines.  That is an outline of our support to the planning and development decision-making process.<\/p> <p>  There was a question on the drainage boards.  Drainage boards are a feature of the 1925 Act, which did work on what were called drainage districts, of which there are 178 still extant in the country.  There were a number of drainage boards, one on the Suck and one on the Barrow, although I am not sure if there were others.  They were a co-ordinating mechanism for, I think, elected members, and I am not aware they had a particular staff or budgets of their own as they were drawn from the county councils.  As the Deputy rightly said, the responsibility for the maintenance of those rivers remains with the county councils.  I am not yet in a position to comment on whether the abolition of the board, as such, has had an effect on the maintenance but I would not expect it to have had because that is unchanged in the way it is delivered.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy had a question on the finances.  We are currently getting &euro;45 million capital a year, which was agreed with Government for the period 2011 to 2016.

They were to be based on available data or readily derivable data and, therefore, they were very rough and ready.  Their purpose was so that we would focus our attention in the more detailed studies that followed on the areas most at risk.  It was a screening exercise.  We were at pains to point out that they were not site specific or site valid and they should not have been used for those purposes either by councils for planning decisions or by the insurance industry for insurance decisions.  However, they gave a guide as to where there were issues that needed further study.<\/p> <p>  We have gone on to do a significant volume of surveying.  We have surveyed in detail almost 6,700 km of channel throughout the country.  We have covered about 13% of the land area of the State in the detailed surveys of those 300 areas that came out of the preliminary study.  We will produce, on the basis of the engineering hydrology and the flood hydraulics through those areas, detailed flood maps that will be made available.  The CFRAM study will complete the maps some time around now.  Approximately 40,000 maps will be produced as part of that study for those 300 areas using various flood extents such as 2%, 5%, 10% and so on, flood depths and flood velocities.  There is a great deal of information in that and these will be produced with the best available technology.

The protocols that are now in place have not been there before.  When the memorandum of understanding was originally signed, we saw it as the first step in a long process.  We had to agree on the standard of the data.  We had to be able to interpret that data correctly in order to incorporate it into the underwriting assessment models used by each of our members.  We are working through that now in respect of the work that the OPW has carried out on the schemes.  That is really the first step.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about the sinking fund.  Our view is that this is a simplistic and probably unsustainable approach to what is ultimately a very long-term problem, due to climate change and so forth.  The best model, in which we have taken the first step, involves understanding what flood defences have been put in place.  We are working with the OPW to understand better what flood defences need to be put in place.  This links with what needs to be changed in the planning guidelines.  The maintenance of drains and flood defences, which is a critical step, is an example of the simple things that are often neglected.  Returning to the issue of planning, there is a need for restrictions on the type of development in flood-prone areas that has happened previously.<\/p> <p>  It all comes down to sustainable investment that will give us the results we need.  I will try to put that into context.  Between 2001 and 2014, the average level of annual capital expenditure by the Government was approximately &euro;28 million per annum.  For the purposes of comparison, our nearest neighbour is spending approximately &euro;69 million per annum on a like-for-like basis with population being used as a leveller.  The UK Public Accounts Committee has committed &pound;2.3 billion in terms of flood risk management over the next six years.  When that is compared on a like-for-like basis with the spend in this jurisdiction, it is clear that we need to be spending approximately &euro;250 million per annum on flood defences.  As a sector, we know that may or may not be realistic in some ways.  No one thing such as a sinking fund will solve the problem, or alleviate the issue for policy holders or for people who do not have insurance.  There is a need for a combination of the factors to which I have alluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#NN00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429095600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I would like to comment on the money end.  The correct figure for that long period is &euro;28 million a year.  It must be borne in mind that this figure has been ramping up, as I pointed out earlier.  The average spend over the last three years has been &euro;47 million per annum.  We have been building it up and bringing more and more schemes to fruition.  That is just the capital expenditure.  We also do maintenance separately.  It is accounted for separately.  There are other costs.  The overall spend on flood risk management by the OPW is not &euro;45 million.  I would have to look at the Estimates volume, but I think that a more correct figure when all things are taken into account on the OPW side would be &euro;65 million per annum.  We spoke earlier about drainage districts.  There is an expenditure by local authorities on drainage districts as well.  Separately, there is an expenditure on the urban drainage network, which is the responsibility of the local authorities rather than the responsibility of the OPW.  There would be further expenditure there.  I do not have those figures.  They would be provided by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or by the local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#NN00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1429095600,"counter":251,"content":"<p>It would be nice to get the figures and data regarding the actual spend by the OPW.  I would like to compliment the OPW on the fantastic quality of the work it has done in Mallow and Fermoy.  It is working.  I wonder whether the insurance industry is reflecting that level of work by reducing the premiums it is looking for from people in Mallow and Fermoy.  I must have a word with some of the business people there to check whether they have seen 50% reductions in their premiums.  I doubt that they have.  I disliked the comment that a sinking fund is \"simplistic\".  I suggest it is simplistic to refuse someone insurance.  It is pretty digital - it is either zero or one.  I just dislike it.  We need a solution.  As I said at a previous meeting, when Cork flooded a number of years ago, everybody ran for cover and nobody claimed their share of the responsibility.<\/p><p>We all know the effects of that.  It wiped out the library, a large section of the new anatomy and biosciences building in UCC and all of its computer software.  It did colossal damage, yet very few people spoke.  The system seems to be segmented.  Everybody has a responsibility, but it is someone else's problem.  There needs to be a co-ordinating body that will come together and act, because it appears to be the weakest link.  If something is not in place we will have an event.  <\/p><p> I would not put it all down to climate change.  I farm and I am as familiar with the climate as most people here.  While we have had fluctuations, they are not as dramatic as some people would like to say.  Putting everything down to climate change is a nice way to evade the situation.  We need a solution for businesses and homeowners.  I am glad the issue is being discussed.  We discuss something when there is an event and then everybody goes away.  The one, two or three people who look for insurance in a particular village or town, such as mine, Killavullen, are very minor stakeholders and their voices are not heard.  <\/p><p> For a while the OPW was the lightening conductor when the maps came out, but I take the point that that was just a scoping exercise and it was working towards a goal.  It was unfair of the insurance industry to come in at the time.  Do the witnesses have any suggestions on co-ordinating local authorities, insurers and the OPW to get a co-ordinated and practical approach to dealing with the issue?  The problem will continue, as they know.  The situation in Cork was kicked from Billy to Jack and the current issue seems to have been kicked around like a football.  It is not possible for every party here to act as an uninterested party.  There is a responsibility on them to sort this out.  Do the witnesses have any suggestions for how we could put together a forum that would develop workable solutions?  I know there are no perfect solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#NN00300","speaker":"980","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429095600,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I will respond to some of the Deputy's comments.

The minor schemes are important for small local communities and can have a significant dividend relative to the amount of money spent.  The reality is that, notwithstanding exchange of data and everything else under the memorandum of understanding on the standard of protection, the works are generally acknowledged to be of the highest order.  However, businesses and households still cannot get insurance cover.  I may be asking the representatives of Insurance Ireland to trespass outside their comfort zone in some respects but surely the objective of having a partnership approach and data exchange between the OPW and the insurance industry is that collectively we would contribute to solving the problem for people, including businesses and homeowners.  There is a lack of good faith on the part of the insurance industry if, on foot of the works carried out, the data that have been exchanged and the standard of protection now available following the expenditure of significant amounts of State funds, it is still not living up to its side of the equation.Obviously in Cork city, the works have not been delivered yet.  However, in the case of other areas, if there has not been a restoration of access to insurance cover based on the works carried out and the relevant standard of protection, then surely it undermines the partnership approach, the memorandum of understanding and its <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>, which was, initially, to solve a problem for people, whether business people or people in residential homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015041500002#OO00700","speaker":"986","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429095600,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I can only refer back to my earlier comment.

As I said in my opening statement, insurers may have reached their capacity in terms of the level of insurance they can issue in a specific area.
