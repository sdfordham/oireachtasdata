The primary source of income for Forf&aacute;s is Oireachtas grants, which totalled &euro;51.4 million in 2012.  These were paid from Vote 32 - Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p><p>  In addition to its policy functions, Forf&aacute;s activities in 2012 also included the accreditation of laboratories, certification bodies and inspection bodies through the Irish National Accreditation Board, which is a sub-board and division of Forf&aacute;s.

Forf&aacute;s centrally manages the pension schemes for all the agencies and their predecessor organisations.

Its primary function is to advise the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the development of enterprise within the State.  Forf&aacute;s also has a co-ordination role with respect to Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland.  It is the statutory body in which the State's legal powers of industrial promotion and technology have been vested.<\/p><p>  Forf&aacute;s is also the legal employer of staff in Forf&aacute;s, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland.  It provides research and analysis and manages the work of a number of independent councils, including the National Competitiveness Council and the Export Group on Future Skills Needs.  In addition to its primary policy advisory functions, Forf&aacute;s undertakes a number of other functions.  The Irish National Accreditation Board is a sub-board and division of Forf&aacute;s.  In 2012, Forf&aacute;s provided a range of shared services to Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, including pensions management and properties and facilities management.  In 2012, Forf&aacute;s was the legal host for the Office of Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government and for the Euroscience Open Forum, which was a significant international event held in Dublin in July of last year.<\/p><p>  In September 2011, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation announced his intention to integrate the policy and research capability of Forf&aacute;s with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Government agreement was secured in April 2013 to commence drafting legislation to provide for the dissolution of Forf&aacute;s and the transfer of its staff and functions to the Department and other legal entities, as necessary.  In anticipation of the dissolution of Forf&aacute;s responsibility for certain functions previously undertaken by Forf&aacute;s and which did not require statutory adjustment have already been transferred to other bodies, including, for example, property management, the discover science and engineering programme and the Office of Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government.<\/p><p>  On the core function of Forf&aacute;s in 2012, the agency provided advice to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Government across a wide range of policy issues, including strategies for the construction, manufacturing and social enterprise sectors, a review of the cost of doing business in Ireland, a review of Ireland's competitiveness performance, an audit of the licensing requirements for business and the proposed measures to reduce the burden; identification of the key skills requirements of enterprise; the prioritisation of State investment in research and development; analysis of tax and finance issues for business and a study to identify changes in the operation of sector regulators that would enhance cost competitiveness.<\/p><p>  A significant focus of Forf&aacute;s work in 2012, as in 2011, was the development and implementation of the Government's annual action plan for jobs.  Forf&aacute;s has a number of roles in this regard.  It works closely with the Minister and his Department in developing the action plan and liaises closely with other Departments and stakeholders in identifying the key actions required to support enterprise and jobs growth.  Forf&aacute;s is a member of the committee which monitors progress on the plan on a quarterly basis.  It also has lead responsibility for implementation of a significant number of the actions in 2012 and 2013.  Forf&aacute;s is currently working on the development of the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs.  <\/p><p>  Forf&aacute;s regularly reviews enterprise and sectoral policies and, through its annual surveys, monitors Ireland's and, specifically, the enterprise agencies', performance in terms of job creation, innovation and economic impact.  In 2012, we also undertook evaluations to assess the impact of individual agency programmes, as part of the ongoing programme of evaluations across the enterprise agencies.  Forf&aacute;s operates effectively and efficiently and has delivered a substantial work programme, particularly in the context of significant decreases in staffing resources.  This is achieved through the commitment and flexibility of its staff.  Forf&aacute;s policy work cannot be undertaken without partnership engagement and the commitment of others, including Departments, the enterprise agencies and the wider community of stakeholders.  <\/p><p>  While the focus of this meeting is the annual accounts for 2012, Forf&aacute;s has a broad ranging and challenging work programme for the current year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013101700004#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin D.

The Department and Forf&aacute;s currently work together very closely, particularly in the policy area.  The ability to undertake evidence-based analysis will be protected.  The capability transferring from Forf&aacute;s will form the core of a strategic policy division within the Department.  All staff who are transferring will do so at their existing grades, which are analogous to Civil Service grades.  As such, there is a direct mapping. <\/p><p>  As to when the change will take place, the heads of the Bill have been published, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is drafting the appropriate legislation and the Bill is scheduled to be published in the autumn.

We are currently successful because we have the skills and expertise, albeit skills and expertise that have been significantly reduced since the moratorium on recruitment and promotion was introduced.  We have recruited people for specific skills, whether they be in economics, business, science and technology or education or analytical skills around evaluations and data.<\/p><p>  An important part of our current activity is our relationship with our sister agencies in developing a coherent industry policy not only on foreign direct investment and indigenous business or innovation, but also to ensure the three areas work in tandem.  Our ability to engage with enterprise directly is an extremely important part of what we do.  It will be necessary to ensure those facets of our current activity continue in so far as is practical within a Government Department in the future.  This is what we will be mindful of as part of the integration.  The process involves an implementation team chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation of which I am a member.  I assure Deputy Dowds that this issue is at the forefront of our minds as we go through the integration process.<\/p><p>  There are also some upsides.

Forf&aacute;s has a role in a number of those, including the big data analytics disruptive reform, where we are providing research and secretariat support to a group which is identifying the priority areas to take forward under that disruptive reform.

That is against the background, obviously, of a significant unemployment issue and against the background that there are other factors that come into play, like emigration.  However, it is a positive trend.<\/p><p>  If we look within that, private-sector employment has driven that increase and is, in fact, entirely responsible for that increase because it is against a background of public sector jobs continuing to decline.  So the trend directionally is absolutely right.  There is other evidence to support its working, which is that the competitiveness ratings are improving.  They are an indication of the environment for private-sector business.<\/p><p>  Skills is one of the more significant issues that we are involved in and we manage and support the work of the expert group on future skills needs.  We have detailed evidence and analysis of where we believe the shortages are currently and what the likely future shortages are.  We work very closely with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection in advising them of where we believe those skills shortages are.  That includes the educational spectrum of what we should be doing at primary and secondary level, right up to third level institutions and universities.  We also engage with those institutions directly where we can with the limited resources we have and advise them as to what courses we think are required and what curriculum is required.  We bring the combined intelligence of what we can see in the broad macro-data together with the information we get from our agencies and their clients as to what their specific needs are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013101700006#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin D.

I know there is a minor problem with Knockmaun House in Mount Street, but that is obviously much less significant in terms of the waste of money.  Is Forf&aacute;s directly responsible for those buildings, does it come under the Office of Public Works, or is there joint function in that regard?  I understand there is a particular problem with Carrisbrook House because this Israeli Embassy is there.  As that is an embassy that requires huge security it may be deterring potential tenants.

In my opinion, the OPW manages the property for the State and should have had some sort of input into the consideration being given to the disposal of the property that ended up being disposed of for &euro;16 million.  It should have done so to save the State from losing &euro;1.2 million on a seven-story property with just a single floor occupied and from possibly continuing to lose on that property until 2034.  The State is locked into a lease with an upward-only rent review until 2034 and has missed the boat in respect of reducing its exposure when the aforementioned property was sold for &euro;16 million.  Between the present and 2034, should the property not be occupied or should matters continue as they are, the State will lose double the amount for which it could have bought the property in 2008.

It appears to be the case that the OPW simply continued on to blindly ignore the fact the State was losing &euro;1.2 million per year and will continue to lose it and perhaps more, unless the properties can be rented out and I note Forf&aacute;s is having difficulties in this regard.  I ask the witnesses to submit a full report to the Committee of Public Accounts outlining what has happened since 1969 regarding the landlords, the costs and so on in order that members can explore properly how much has been lost to the State from 1969 and perhaps forecast up to 2034, because I reiterate this raises serious questions in respect of property management.

I accept that the blame for that decision does not land at the door of Mr. Shanahan and appreciate the report on the matter.  We are, as the Chairman alluded to, being sent from Billy to Jack which is frustrating.  Somebody somewhere let the ball slip when there was an opportunity to protect the taxpayer from losing even more money in 2012.  I would like to know the name of that person.

OSi has been the national mapping agency for Ireland since 1824.  We operate under the Ordnance Survey Act 2001 and we have a dual remit covering both public service obligations and commercial activities.<\/p><p>  OSi operates and is funded differently to other public sector bodies.  As part of our remit is commercial, we must design and sell products that can compete in a cutting edge marketplace.  We have been successful in carving out a significant commercial market for OSi products and services, despite the impact of the recession.  Like many organisations in the private and public sectors, large portions of OSi's revenue, particularly in the construction sector, were wiped out by the recession.  However, through proactive development of new products and markets, extensive change management and judicious cost cutting, a substantial percentage of lost revenue was restored over time.<\/p><p>  Public bodies, both national and local, and public utilities are the primary users of high quality spatial data sets and high resolution mapping.  OSi's total revenue is &euro;23 million, of which almost &euro;10 million is derived from a variety of public service customers, including Departments, State agencies and local authorities.  A further &euro;8 million comes from private and commercial sector customers.<\/p><p>  Today we are an organisation of 240 people with a focus on supporting the public service by providing it with the authoritative spatial data needed to support planning, conveyancing, construction and effective management of State assets and key national programmes.  When OSi was set up as an independent entity under the 2001 Act, we continued to operate as an aligned public service organisation.  As the national mapping agency we adhered to the Act by putting in place commercial strategies to enable the generation of revenues from the public and private sectors.  The benefit of this was two-fold, in that it provided commercial income to allow us to further invest in surveying infrastructure, technology and product development while at the same time impOSing a commercial culture in terms of how we evaluate and deliver services.<\/p><p>  As the committee is aware an issue has been identified relating to the need to build our commercial marketing ability in the context of the recession and the loss of revenue in specific market segments.  Prior to the moratorium, therefore, we recruited on a fixed-term contract a marketing expert to assist us in addressing this need.<\/p><p>  In the development of the digital economy, OSi has been an early mover in ensuring that the database infrastructure is in place to support related EU directives such as INSPIRE, and developed and maintains, <i>geoportal.ie<\/i>, the national environmental data portal, as a shared service on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We have also been intensely focused on future-proofing the management of spatial data by investing in a national spatial data infrastructure which will enable consistent and accurate referencing and management of location information.  Further developments in the use of this database will support e-Government and the wider public sector reform agenda and public service planning.<\/p><p>  The committee will be aware that the Government has decided to proceed with the merger of Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Property Registration Authority and the Valuation Office.  A project board comprising senior officials from the three parent Departments and the chief executive officers of the three organisations has been established recently to oversee the process.  As an outcome of this measure we will be pOSitioned to enhance public service reform and planning for the future by being more closely aligned with our public service clients and Civil Service colleagues to drive efficiency, value for money initiatives and transformation through the effective use of our spatial data. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013101700011#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Bray"},{"type":"speech","time":1382004600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>May we publish Mr. Bray's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013101700011#L00800","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382004600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013101700011#L00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Bray"},{"type":"speech","time":1382004600,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Bray.

If this is the case, why were they paid out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013101700012#M00600","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382005200,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  That issue was raised in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The amount refers to a payment of &euro;30,000 between four ordnance survey staff members.  As for the Comptroller and Auditor General's note, there are two separate elements to be addressed within the figure.  The first is a payment of &euro;20,000 to a marketing expert as per the terms of a contractual commitment and the second element is a payment totalling &euro;10,000, which was paid to three ordnance survey staff members.  If I may elaborate on the first point regarding the payment of &euro;20,000 and going back to my opening statement and OSi's dual remit, we are fully dependent on our commercial revenue for our funding model.  As referred to in the opening statement and given the downturn in the economy and the economic challenge we faced in respect of our commercial revenues, we were obliged to ensure that we were able to manage the commercial revenues for the running of the organisation.  It was a necessity that we were obliged to bring in external commercial acumen to the organisation on the business and marketing side to ensure we could sustain that downturn in the economy and could grow.  The sum of &euro;20,000 relates to the procurement of a marketing expert for the organisation on a fixed-term temporary contract.  That expert came into the organisation to carry out activities such as development and mentoring of business staff, the management of the development of our online business and the growth thereof and to grow the tourism and leisure product part of our business.  The remuneration in question, that is, the &euro;20,000, was part of a commercial contract for this individual.  The &euro;20,000 related to performance-related activities.  The moneys involved were aligned with the costs of such expertise on the open market.  A decision was made that a percentage of that salary would be related to performance measures, which were evaluated on a quarterly basis.  Consequently, the &euro;20,000 relates to that performance-related measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013101700012#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Bray"},{"type":"speech","time":1382005200,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Who made that decision?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013101700012#M00800","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382005200,"counter":145,"content":"<p>That decision was recorded in board minutes as a requirement to bring in the expertise and the approval was sought to go out and bring in that expert.

Members can see from the figures provided in the briefing document the significant progress that was made in reducing the operating costs of the organisation over those years.

It is a pleasure and an honour to attend.  We will discuss a group of fish that we call forage fish, small-bodied fish that we have found to have a large impact on marine ecosystems.  Often, they are schooling species and tend to be high in the pelagic water column.  They include species such as sardines, anchovies, krill, herring and eels.  They play a unique and special role in marine ecosystems, in that they are able to feed on plankton and are in turn fed upon by many other organisms, thereby transferring energy through higher trophic levels.  A simple way to think of them is as the important intermediary that helps sunlight become salmon.<\/p><p>  Many people are not aware that a large amount of the world's wild marine fish catch consists of these small fish.  A study conducted a few years ago estimated that approximately 37% of that catch consists of forage fish.  This figure has grown significantly.  In the 1950s, these fish represented only 8% or so of the global catch.  There is every reason to forecast an increase in interest in these fish.  Of the forage fish catch, approximately 90% is ground up or reduced into fish meal and fish oil.  Only 10% is directly consumed by humans.<\/p><p>  It used to be believed that these fish were so resilient, numerous and productive that nothing we could do could ever harm them.  My diagram shows a wood print from the Baltic Sea in the 1550s.  The fish were believed to be so abundant that, if one threw an axe into their midst, it would stand upright.  We now know that it is not true that these fish are not invulnerable.  In fact, they are highly sensitive and vulnerable.  Indeed, there have been spectacular collapses in forage fish populations around the world.  I have listed some of them.  Members may be familiar with the Peruvian anchovy collapse.  There have been several collapses, but the main one was in 1972.  At the time, the Peruvian anchovy species represented 10% of the world's catch but it vanished overnight.<\/p><p>  For these reasons - the large catch, the crucial role in the ecosystem, the vulnerability and the collapses - there has been more interest in getting scientific input into whether these species should be managed differently due to their crucial role.  I chaired the task force that was put together.  Our objective was to try to arrive at consensual recommendations on how to manage these fish in a way that recognised their important ecological role.  The committee has copies of our report, Little Fish, Big Impact, which we released with an executive summary last year.<\/p><p>  In putting together this report, the task force met over a period of several years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013101700004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ellen Pikitch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382005200,"counter":575,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Pikitch.

Is there a case to be made to restrict the use of fish meal in the production of animal feed, for example, as a conservation measure to reduce fishing effort on forage fish?  It might have some benefit in sustaining the stocks.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Humboldt Current slide showing the predators that depend on the forage fish, mackerel are 62% dependent.  Would the same level of dependency on forage fish apply across the world to Atlantic mackerel stocks?  Over the last years there have been very severe restrictions on herring fishing around the coast of Ireland.  It coincided with increases in TAC levels for mackerel.  Would there be a direct correlation there?

The task force decided to draw the line and give advice on the number of forage fish it was safe to take out of the sea in terms of protection of the ecosystem.  We stopped there.  On what one does with the fish after that, there are a lot of very important questions, but as a task force, we decided not to go there in terms of making recommendations.  We reiterated several times in the report that there was a food security issue because much of the fish meal was given for aquaculture and livestock production.  There is a conversion ratio - to produce 1 lb of farmed salmon it takes 3 lb to 5 lb of forage fish.  One is taking 3 lb to 5 lb of perfectly edible fish to turn it into 1 lb of edible fish; therefore, there is a net ecological loss of food as a result of the way the product is being used.

For example, one method that is used a lot in the California current region involves looking at egg production because the species concerned produce a lot of eggs which tend to float to the surface.  One can take a net and count the number of eggs produced.  That gives one a pretty good idea of how many spawning fish there are.  This method has been used a lot in the case of sardines off the Pacific coast of the United States.  With some species, one can use acoustic methodologies which is a fairly straightforward way of looking at biomass over time.  When one cannot use these methodologies, one must go with the standard fisheries assessment methods whereby one make some catches to get the age composition.  One has to have a model to put it all together.  These fish are more amenable to some of the acoustic and egg production methods than many other species.

If there is a forage fish that lives very close to shore and the species that feed upon it also live very close to shore, then it could be done within Irish waters, for example.  In the United States we tend to look at it in terms of within state waters, federal waters or the exclusive economic zone, EEZ.

That illustrates that if Ireland has species like the menhaden, although I am not familiar with the Irish species, it can take small-scale, close to shore measures and adopt a policy that would work.  In other cases, for example, with Krill in the Antarctic, one could not really do that because Krill is basically the forage species for everything in the Antarctic and the area is huge.

They must end up in the right places, where there is a good supply of plankton to feed upon.  A lot of things can go wrong in that process and there is not a lot we can do about that, unfortunately.  That is part of the problem.  The environment is fluctuating and is unpredictable.  Some years are fabulous and we get really strong recruitment while other years are not good.  By keeping more of these fish in the water, what we are doing is maintaining a safe level and a multi-aged structure.

That is good advice.  We are saying go ahead and fish the species but do it in a way that will result in more robust pelagic species which will mean the industry with be less prone to collapse.  One does not want the pelagic fisheries to go between boom and bust.  One wants people to be able to make a living and count on it year in and year out.

I hope they will recover and with the new Common Fisheries Policy coming into effect, some of the demersal fish species can recover as quickly as the pelagic stocks.  I can give examples of what happened in the US with species of fish I am familiar with.  There was a five-year moratorium on fishing striped bass in the United States and this brought the species back.  They are now as abundant as they ever have been.

I suppose naturally enough they depend on other fish, but do they all depend on other small fish to forage on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013101700009#J00900","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382007000,"counter":625,"content":"<p>The only species that do are the ones we call forage fish.

This is a major step forward in terms of progress.  That is important.  Rome was not built in a day and the Common Fisheries Policy will evolve over time.  I think one can incorporate this advice.  I do not understand all the processes, but perhaps it is possible to make an amendment specifically for forage fish.  One might want to do that.  I wonder if one can do so without having to revisit all the other questions again.  This is pretty new science with new recommendations in the report.  When the campaign to try to reform the Common Fisheries Policy started, we did not have this kind of advice.  In fact when the taskforce started, we did not have so many of the studies that I have talked about today.  It would be good if members could find a way to incorporate it in an amendment.<\/p><p>  In the United States, we have already seen one state, the State of California, adopt these recommendations almost immediately for its policy on forage fish.  It has a specific policy that applies only to forage fish and not to other species.  It had not had one before.  It was good timing.  The State of California had already decided that forage fish were so critically important that the state should have a policy specifically for that group of fish.  It had been working on it and then the report came out, which had everything it needed.  The state recognised the report had everything it needed and adopted it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013101700009#J01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ellen Pikitch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382007600,"counter":629,"content":"<p>The definition of \"forage fish\" that is used by the task force relates to fish that feed on plankton for their entire life cycles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013101700010#K00200","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382007600,"counter":630,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013101700010#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ellen Pikitch"},{"type":"speech","time":1382007600,"counter":631,"content":"<p>Is that an accepted definition of \"forage fish\" globally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013101700010#K00400","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382007600,"counter":632,"content":"<p>Yes.

It could be a good idea to try to undertake such a campaign.  The work that has been done has concentrated on the fate of the fish after they have been taken out of the water; for example, 90% of fish are being ground up rather than eaten.  The fish that are consumed directly by people are generally more valuable - a higher price per pound is paid for them than for the fish that are ground up into fish meal and fish oil.  It would be good for economics and for food security if a greater percentage of fish could be shifted to direct human consumption rather than being ground up into fish meal and fish oil.  I am aware that efforts are being made in that regard.  There has been a campaign in Peru to make people aware that it is okay to eat anchovies directly and to emphasise that anchovies are delicious.  The authorities there have found it helpful to bring in chefs to show how to prepare anchovies in delicious new ways.  The people who have been encouraged to taste this product have agreed that it tastes really good.  Some people do not want to eat anchovies directly because they think they do not taste good, but they do.

I welcome the Minister of State and his staff from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach, representatives of many of the embassies of the 28 member states in Ireland, and members of the media, who are very important to convey the message of the Minister of State's work.  The Minister of State has outlined in a very constructive and comprehensive manner the details of the meeting of the General Affairs Council and there is nothing in that with which I would disagree.  That is excellent work, particularly in respect of the digital centre and such developments, which will have marvellous benefits for job creation.<\/p><p>  I would like, however, to draw attention to matters that are not covered in the Minister of State's script or plans.  The European Union is not taking an active role on the situation in Palestine.  We are too passive.  The European Union is a major contributor to the Palestinians.  We have influence in that region but we do not exert ourselves enough.  I hope that the Minister of State will be briefed on the present position regarding the peace negotiations which are generally being de-railed.  Nevertheless, we must keep the dialogue going between Palestine and Israel.  The European Union has a major influence in that region. <\/p><p>  Turkey's accession has been delayed.  There is no tremendous enthusiasm among the 28 member states for it.  Ireland is seen to be very fair.  I know from speaking to our Turkish friends at the Council of Europe that they are well aware of how supportive Ireland is.  A key point in Turkey's joining the EU is that it is an Islamic state.  This would bring a new dimension to the working of the Union, to have a multicultural Union, with Islamic influence, which will help in respect of the growth of Islam worldwide.<\/p><p>  In respect of Turkey the Cyprus question cannot be ignored.  It must be resolved.  The division of Cyprus between Turkey and Greece is a tragedy.  Famagusta is a ghost city in the Europe of 2013 and nothing is being done about it.  Ireland should play a more important role.  We are divided and we played an important role in the peace process, which sets an example.<\/p><p>  Our country has a record for having sent many missionaries to Africa and around the world.  Europe should develop a peace corps, of young and not so young people.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a voluntary scheme but there could be a European dimension by which we joined up to work in the Third World, to show the Third World that the EU is concerned about it.  For example, approximately 1 million people live in shanty towns in Nairobi, the same is true of South Africa and so on.  The Minister of State might consider this concept.  Maybe in this committee - although it may not really be our remit - we could consider a structure to put forward an idea or come up with a new policy or idea to say we can do something.  It would create employment, even in the short term.  It would take very talented people and put them to work in areas where their skills would be appreciated.

The committee discussed stability and the disturbing circumstances during the time when we thought the country and Europe was going belly-up and there was a danger that the euro would not survive.  It is great to wake up in the morning now to hear that the euro is rated at &euro;1.35 to the dollar and seems to be climbing.  I hear it is &euro;1.35.6 at the moment, which is very encouraging as it means that the euro has stabilised and is a really attractive currency.  Those who were panicked by the near collapse and who purchased silver, gold, dollars and sterling would be advised to revert to the euro as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State informed us that the digital economy will be on the agenda of the Council meeting.  It is a fascinating subject which has been on the agenda on previous occasions.  Ireland is ideally located and suited to giving leadership to and benefitting from the digital economy.  It is very welcome that in County Kildare, after two years of research and development, Irish Intel engineers managed to design from scratch and manufacture the next-generation chip for computers.  They had to compete with other Intel plants in New Mexico, Israel, California and other countries in order to tender for its production.  The successful digital economy makes me very proud to be Irish.  Irish engineers won the contract for the manufacture of this chip, which is at the forefront of innovation.  Those of us who know Dublin are familiar with the Digital Hub, where entrepreneurs are working with mentors to produce a wide variety of digital products.  I am not very familiar with the digital world; I am still trying to learn how to use my mobile phone.<\/p><p>  It may not be politically correct to say so, but Denis O'Brien has digital facilities all over the world.  His company is in Jamaica, for example, and every Jamaican has a mobile phone.  His company is also in Haiti and in South Africa and other African countries.  He is providing digital solutions to many of the communications problems in Third World countries.  I have a question about GPS.  I understand this was originally an American military system and that GPS information can be controlled by forces in America.  Is the EU working on having its own GPS system which would be independent of the American system?  I understand that the Irish troops on UN duty in the vicinity of Israel and in the Golan Heights do not use the GPS system when on patrol because it can be manipulated by outside forces.  Instead they use regular compass readings.<\/p><p>  The issue of youth employment is very important because of the levels of youth unemployment in Europe generally.  I concur with the Minister of State that the Turkish issue is of key importance in the development of European stability.  I encourage Ireland to take a leading role.  Notwithstanding the religious composition of that country, it is a very important strategically located country which borders East and West.  Moldova and Georgia are counties which could benefit from closer association with the European Union. <\/p><p>  The Minister of State referred to the Eastern Partnership.  Turkey is one of the most strategically important countries.  In the case of Ukraine, I ask the Minister of State to use his good offices to encourage the Ukrainians to bite the bullet on Yulia Tymoshenko, and I think they have begun to release some prisoners who were imprisoned around the time that Tymoshenko was taken in.  Europe would benefit immensely if that issue could be concluded and if Tymoshenko were released to go to Germany for medical treatment for her back problems.  The Russians are applying increasing pressure.  They have already succeeded in seducing Armenia away from the European programme and they are putting great pressure on Ukraine.<\/p><p>  I am very concerned about Spain, given the regional structure of that country.  I note that in Catalonia, which is the economic engine of the country, over 1 million people marched in support of Catalan independence.  The Basque region is another issue.  I ask the Minister of State to give the Irish Government's position on Spain.  I hope that position is that under no circumstances does Ireland support the breaking-up of the regional structures.  I find it very worrying in this day and age when we are hoping to create a unified Europe that these forces are at play in Spain.  This may also be the case in Italy to some degree in the northern region.  I always compare such situations to that of Katanga in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Attempts are made to grab hold of the oil or mineral wealth or the wealthy industrial regions and other regions are regarded as being poor and not entitled to benefit from the wealth of the richer regions.  I ask for our position on the situation in northern Italy and the growth of a certain political party there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013101700005#D00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1382016000,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the meeting.

I have a few questions related to the Council meeting.  The emphasis in the agenda is correct and the issues on it are salient, those of employment, youth employment, banking union and economic and monetary union, all of which are hugely important.  Regarding the digital economy, to what extent is the European Union as a body encouraging the universal availability of high-quality technology, such as high-speed, modern, state-of-the-art broadband, throughout all regions of the Union without exception?  If the European Union is to prosper it must naturally follow that such technology is equally available in all member states without exception, otherwise a distinct advantage will rest with some member states.  We regularly hear negative comment about our alleged preferential corporation profits tax, implying that in some way we have an advantage over other member states but little emphasis is ever placed on the fact that we are a \"far-out region\", for want of a better description.  In other words, we are not in the centre of the European Union and there are costs associated with our peripherality that need to be borne in mind at all times.  In order to address those issues, it is hugely important that the modern technology we aspire to have is made readily available throughout member states.  If it not available, we should ask why can it not be made available and to what extent can the European Union assist in that respect.<\/p><p>  Another reference that was interesting, which has been discussed at this committee and other meetings on several occasions in the past, is the degree to which the modern education system is able to produce a finished product in terms of qualification for the workplace.  This issue is increasingly being raised.  I attended a seminar recently at which it was suggested that the degree to which apprenticeships are available now is not similar to the number that were available in the past and that many firms in this jurisdiction and in other areas throughout the European Union are finding it difficult to source suitable employees with the required qualifications to fit positions.  To what extent is the European Union engaged in making provisions in that area?<\/p><p>  The Single Market is interesting.  Some would claim that we do not all have the same access to the Single Market that we should have, but again the digital economy is hugely important in that area.  If we do not have state-of-the-art technology, we are not at races and neither is the European Union as a whole.  At one time the United States was many leagues ahead of the European Union in terms of its ability to provide employment in the services sector.  To what extent is the European Union focusing on that sector with a view to maximising job creation possibilities in it using innovation and technology to the extent now anticipated and required?<\/p><p>  My last point relates to a debate that I attended sometime ago during which reference was made to the fact that international employers are unable to fill their labour requirements from the European market for a series of reasons.  However, those employers have been loth to mention that in moving their operations to South East Asia there is an economic element involved in that respect.  They do not always emphasise that to the extent that they should.  The question to be borne in mind is whether it is best for the European Union for the relevant labour force to be attracted to the location in the European Union where an enterprise is based or whether it is beneficial or wise to allow such an industry to relocate to cheap labour markets.  My analysis on that is that the quality of the product is important but it is equally important that we recognise that 500 million people in the European Union, that market has huge buying power and it also can benefit from the location of manufacturing and services sectors within its own jurisdiction as opposed to relocating industries elsewhere. My apologies for talking at such length.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013101700007#F00300","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1382017200,"counter":661,"content":"<p>I will join in the spirit of having a grouping of questions from three members by making a few comments now.  I welcome the agenda and it sends out a clear message.  Europe is not in a time of crisis at the moment which gives us quite a rare opportunity to examine some of the areas on which we fall down.  I am interested in one of the messages that at last is coming strongly from Europe, that of the concept of \"think small first\".  In order words, that with regulations in place and so on that small businesses would be considered.  Having small businesses established and supporting people in becoming self-employed is the best way to tackle unemployment across the Continent because such businesses are very labour intensive.  Europe has recently focused on industry rather than smaller businesses.  I ask the Minister of State to push that message at the Council.<\/p><p>  The other area where Europe falls down badly is that of innovation.

I will begin with Senator Noone&rsquo;s question on taxation and the digital sector.  It is possible that there will be reference in the conclusions of the forthcoming European Council meeting to taxation and its role in the digital sector.  I wish to make clear this country&rsquo;s commitment to its corporation tax rate.  It is an utterly transparent principle-based agreement.  We are of the very strong view that the way in which dimensions of this issue could be addressed is by means of a multilateral process in which all countries participate.  That is why during our Presidency and since this country made very clear its commitment to participate in the OECD base erosion and profit shifting work that is taking place having been mandated to do so by the G20.  That is the forum within which we will work with our neighbours and partners on this matter.  The Minister for Finance, as members are aware, used the budget as an opportunity to restate our commitment in that regard.  He also made clear that he would introduce changes in the forthcoming finance Bill to address Irish registered companies and the concept of being stateless.  I reiterate our strong commitment to our corporation tax model and acknowledge that the reason we have it is because as a country that is physically remote from the Continent of Europe, we have developed a business model that will allow our competitiveness to be maintained, in the same way as it is open to other countries to use their sovereignty to decide what business and competitiveness model they wish to use.<\/p><p>  I agree entirely with the first point made by Deputy Durkan on the disparities in the provision of infrastructure across various member states.  The technical term is the concept of market fragmentation, which arises because we have so many different national markets and it is not possible for the level of scale to be reached to allow appropriate levels of infrastructure to be achieved.  That is one of the key issues on which the European Council will engage.<\/p><p>  A point raised by Deputy Durkan previously is that the digital sector will not be able to employ everybody; that there will be people who due to their own skill-set and inclinations will not work in it.  The February European Council meeting will specifically examine industrial policy and the strength of the manufacturing base across all of Europe because that is crucial to coming up with an economy that is capable of providing employment to all sections of society in this country and elsewhere.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s point on relocation, as he is aware, in the globalised world in which we operate there is free movement of capital and companies, large and small, decide where they want to locate.  We should acknowledge that within that framework this country has had extraordinary success.  Based on our share of global FDI compared to our share of global output, we are punching nearly three times above our weight because of the quality of the workforce and the success we have had to date in providing the skills and the environment in which business wants to locate and within which Irish people want to do business.  It is the broader job of Europe to ensure that within the framework of companies being able to locate anywhere in the world that Europe is competitive and offers workers a competitive environment within which international companies want to locate.  That goes directly back to Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s first question, which is that if we do not have the physical infrastructure in place and the type of environment provided by other large economies, then it will be difficult for us to compete.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s point about mobility and ensuring Irish and European workers have the ability to prosper within that environment, the assumption was prioritised by the Presidency and we worked very hard on the posted workers directive.  We also made strong progress on the professional qualifications dossier and another dossier on the portability of pensions.  I identify and agree with Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s point in that regard.<\/p><p>  I will now deal with the questions raised by the Vice Chairman.  I hope I have addressed labour mobility adequately in the response to Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s question.  We must also acknowledge that this is an area in which national governments still very much have the ability to decide how they want to handle particular issues.  We must respect that and accept that countries make choices, as we do, on such issues.  The point goes back to what I said in response to Deputy Durkan.  That is why progress on the professional qualifications dossier and the portability of pensions is so important.  The jewel in the crown of the European Union is the ability of workers and citizens to move across the Union either freely or with limited difficulty compared to the situation historically.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013101700008#G00200","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382018400,"counter":665,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The first is a banking union.  Small and medium-sized enterprises will benefit most from that because larger companies can access moneys everywhere.  <\/p><p>  Also, better regulation in terms of simplification of administration impacts very much on small businesses.  The area of the services directive is another issue.  The one area where we have seen most growth in Ireland has been our exporting of services.

It is worth acknowledging that the Commission and the European Investment Bank presented their report in June confirming they are working closely with the European Central Bank to develop a strategy to alleviate business funding constraints, because a well-functioning banking market is capable of meeting the needs of small and medium size companies.  Work is taking place to look at revitalising and strengthening that part of the banking sector, and I acknowledge the work of the Department of Finance in doing that.  We see Ireland as a strong pilot location for that kind of work to take place.<\/p><p>  What I was acknowledging in part of the answer I gave to the Vice Chairman is that, along with him, I will continue to acknowledge the important role of national government and the work it does to develop the type of culture about which he spoke.  I saw a fantastic example of that recently.  The amazingly successful development of the new microchip about which Deputy Byrne spoke took place in Deputy Durkan's county.  Deputy Byrne made reference to the Digital Hub, which is off Thomas Street in Dublin South Central.  Extraordinary work is taking place in each of our communities and constituencies.  The Deputy made reference to the bafflement his phone occasionally offers him.  I struggle sometimes with the difficulties that arise in technology; I see Deputy Durkan is manfully dealing with the iPad at the moment.  There are people in our country doing work that would have been unthinkable even a few years ago in terms of technological sophistication.<\/p><p>  I visited an incubation centre in the Docklands, in my constituency, last week and saw the operations of many young business there.  One business was set up less than three years ago but is already entering the third European market and employing ten people.  They are the kinds of business that will prosper the most from the issues about which Deputy Murphy spoke.<\/p><p>  A difficulty we face frequently here, and within Europe, which perhaps differs slightly from what some colleagues said, is the issue of scalability.  From a start-up point of view, many of our larger capitals are unbelievably fertile in terms of new businesses being set up.  They can increase in size from small to medium with the existing support, but how do they get from medium to very big in terms of size?  The scalability aspect is a real challenge.  That is why the work being done on having a fully functioning digital single market is so important, because it provides the scale within the market to allow that to take place.  I look forward to updating the committee on the work that will take place in future general Council meetings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013101700009#H00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1382018400,"counter":667,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013101700009#H00400","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1382018400,"counter":668,"content":"<p>Is this about my comment about his iPad?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013101700009#H00500","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1382018400,"counter":669,"content":"<p>No, but it is associated with it.

The committee will be aware there is a time conflict here with the Private Members' business motion in the D&aacute;il.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will have to leave at 12.15 p.m. to take that motion.  Perhaps when we finish our opening statements, if members have questions on her area of responsibility, the elderly and mental health, they might be taken first.<\/p><p>  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their invitation to discuss the health service issues.  As I said, I am accompanied by my fellow Ministers, Ministers of State, Deputies Kathleen Lynch and Alex White, senior Department officials and officials from the HSE.  We will do our utmost to provide the committee with as much information and clarification as possible.  I apologise that my opening statement is significantly longer than the norm.  However, as requested by the committee, I have addressed a number of substantive issues.<\/p><p>  To the forefront of all our thoughts is patient safety and the care of our citizens but we are also very conscious of the budget announced earlier this week, in particular its implications for the health services.  I am pleased the Government has provided funding for free GP care to children up to five years of age and under the age of six as the first step towards providing universal GP care in line with the development of universal health insurance as set out in the programme for Government.  I am also pleased a further &euro;20 million has been provided to continue the investment in mental health services, primarily in the area of community mental health teams.  <\/p><p>  The budget provision for the health sector is &euro;360 million less than was provided in 2013, which represents a 3% reduction in funding over past year.  As a result, 2014 will be another extremely challenging year for the health services.  The Government has had to make some very difficult decisions in regard to the health Estimates as part of the budgetary arithmetic.  The prescription charge will increase from 1 December to &euro;2.50 per item with a &euro;25 monthly cap on expenditure per household.  In addition, the income thresholds for medical cards for persons over the age of 70 will be reduced to &euro;500 per week for an individual and &euro;900 for a couple.  Legislation to give effect to this change will be enacted before the end of the year.  It is important to note, however, that all those who will come off the full medical card will migrate to a free GP card and will have the further backstop of the drugs payment scheme which limits their exposure to medical costs, in terms of pharmaceuticals, to &euro;144 per month.<\/p><p>  Very ambitious savings targets have been set in regard to medical card probity and for pay savings to be achieved under the Haddington Road agreement.  However, these challenging savings targets will be the subject of a verification exercise as to their achievability, a process which will conclude before the finalisation of the Revised Estimates Volume.  The verification exercise will be overseen by the Secretary General of my Department, along with the Secretary  General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Secretary General to the Government.<\/p><p>  The implications of the budget for the provision of health services will be set out in the HSE's national service plan which will be formally submitted to me within the next three weeks, in line with the provisions of the Health Act 2004.  The 2013 service plan required the HSE to continue to focus its delivery of services on the dual challenge of protecting patient outcomes while, at the same time, reducing costs.  Next year will be no different in this regard and measures impacting on the health system as a result of budget 2014 will again be assessed against these key criteria, with the outcomes of this consideration set out in the service plan.<\/p><p>  There is no doubt that the level of funding available for the health services in 2014 creates a significant challenge to the HSE.  In setting out the operating framework for the delivery of HSE services throughout 2014, the service plan will look to deliver the maximum level of safe quality services possible within the funding available, with prioritisation, where necessary, of certain services to meet the most urgent needs.  The plan will also set out targets in respect of each programme area to ensure that performance can be evaluated throughout the year in order to identify any emerging areas of concern and, should any concerns arise, allow for the implementation of necessary remedial measures without delay.<\/p><p>  The joint committee asked that particular attention be given to the employment conditions of non-consultant hospital doctors at today's meeting and I am more than happy to do so.  I said before that I want to create a health system that protects, nurtures and develops the people who work within it.  That is why I am determined to change the role of NCHDs within our health system.  It is essential that doctors enjoy reasonable working conditions.  I want to reassure hospital doctors that the Government is committed to achieving compliance with the European Working Time Directive in respect of NCHDs by the end of 2014.  <\/p><p>  This is a complex task and a key challenge is to ensure that we achieve compliance while maintaining essential hospital services.  I want also to emphasise that this is not primarily a matter of resource availability.  Among the range of measures to be addressed are changes to NCHD rosters and work patterns, greater use of consultant teams, introduction of electronic time and attendance systems, reallocation of tasks between health professionals and reorganisation of services.<\/p><p>  At my request, in 2013 the HSE has brought a renewed and urgent focus to compliance with the European Working Time Directive.  In particular, a senior national group has been working closely with individual hospitals, with an emphasis on eliminating shifts of more than 24 hours and instances of doctors working more than 68 hours per week.  <\/p><p>  Achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive cannot be a top-down process.  In my view, the best approach is that there be a strong joint process involving the HSE and the NCHDs themselves in working through the practical steps necessary.  Ireland must have sustainable arrangements to train and develop the medical workforce we need in order to provide safe and effective services to our population.  I am, therefore, committed to retaining doctors who are educated and trained in Ireland within our health service.<\/p><p>  In July of this year, I set up a working group chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, president of DCU, to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures, with a view to improving retention of graduates in the public health system.  This group is currently working to produce an interim report by the end of November 2013 and a final report by the end of June 2014.<\/p><p>  I would like to refer to the issue of medical cards awarded on a discretionary basis.  This issue has received a significant level of publicity since our last meeting and, as recently as last week, was the subject matter of Private Members' business in the D&aacute;il.  I was glad that, with my colleagues in the Department, I had the opportunity to again set the record straight and to reject out of hand the contention that there is a deliberate targeting of holders of discretionary medical cards.  There has been no change to the policy on discretionary medical cards in the past year and the scheme continues to operate in such a way that those who suffer financial hardship as a result of a medical condition receive the benefit of a medical card.<\/p><p>  The processing of medical cards at a national level rather than at a local level before mid-2011 ensures that all people are assessed in a similar and fair way when applying for a medical card.  At my request, the HSE put in place a process where a medical doctor would consider the assessment for discretionary medical cards. <\/p><p>  In previous years, there was a decentralised process which meant there could be inequities throughout the system.  Now the process is standardised and there is fair and equitable treatment for all.  The variation throughout the country meant people in identical circumstances were getting a discretionary medical card in one part of the country but not in another.  Sometimes people who were worse off were not getting medical cards on a discretionary basis because of the variation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700004#E00200","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382001300,"counter":684,"content":"<p>The Minister's allocation of ten minutes is almost up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700005#F00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1382001300,"counter":685,"content":"<p>I did warn the committee at the outset that my statement would take a little longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700005#F00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1382001300,"counter":686,"content":"<p>Is it agreed that we allow the Minister more time?

This is a case of investing now for the future so that in five, ten, 15, 20 or 30 years' time, we do not have the same patterns of morbidity and mortality that we have today.<\/p><p>  The most recent HSE performance report shows that 1,991,148 people have access to free GP care in July 2013, comprising some 1,868,565 people with a full medical card and another 124,925 people with a GP visit cards.  Of these 75,348 people had discretionary medical or GP visit cards.  Some 54,984 were discretionary medical cards and 20,364 were discretionary GP visit cards.  Discretionary medical cards are awarded to people who are unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their families even though their means exceed the HSE's income thresholds.  In these cases social and medical issues are taken into account when considering whether undue hardship exists for the applicant.<\/p><p>  When this Government came into power, there was no established uniform procedure for medical personnel to assess applications for medical cards on discretionary grounds.  When I became Minister for Health, I instructed the HSE to establish a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards.  This allows medical professionals to have an input into granting a medical card to people who exceed the income guidelines but who face difficult financial circumstances, such as the extra costs arising from an illness.  This procedure ensures that the specific situation of a person with a particular diagnosis can be considered on a case by case basis.<\/p><p>  Chairman and members, we must have clarity on the 1970 Act.  There never has there been an automatic entitlement to a medical card on the basis of a specific illness or a specific condition.  If we wish to change the law, then regulations will have to be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas. <\/p><p>  An assessment for a medical card must be determined primarily by the overall financial situation of an applicant and dependants in accordance with the health legislation.  There is no legal basis for the HSE to award a medical card based on a person being diagnosed with cancer or another condition.  The HSE is continuing to assess and issue discretionary medical cards to people to avoid undue hardship.  The HSE has a system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care they cannot afford and for patients who are terminally ill.  Emergency medical cards are issued by the HSE within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card.  As a result emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual with a limited eligibility of six months.  The arrangement is slightly different for persons with a terminal illness and in palliative care.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months.  Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate measures to ensure the person gets the card as quickly as possible.  There is no means test and the nature of the illness is not a factor.  <\/p><p>  I will speak very briefly on the other aspects of the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700005#F00500","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382002500,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to attend this meeting.  I am joined by Laverne McGuinness, Barry O' Brien, Dr. Philip Crowley and Mr. Patrick Burke.<\/p><p>  I will cover four issues in my opening remarks.  The first of these is the HIQA investigation into the tragic death of Ms Savita Halappanavar at University Hospital Galway on 28 October.  The HSE requested that HIQA conduct an investigation into the events surrounding Ms Halappanavar's death and on behalf of the HSE I want to express our appreciation for the considerable work undertaken by HIQA in conducting a thorough investigation and compiling a comprehensive report.  Also on behalf of the HSE, I once again wish to express our sympathy and to apologise unreservedly for the shortcomings in the level of care afforded to Ms Halappanavar that contributed to her death. <\/p><p>  I have appointed Ian Carter, our national director of acute hospital services, to oversee the implementation of the recommendations.  An implementation team had already been established by the HSE in anticipation of the findings of three reports.  This team is currently overseeing the implementation of the recommendations from the coroner and from Professor Sir Sabaratnam Arulkumaran&rsquo;s report.  I have now directed that this team&rsquo;s work be expanded to include the findings of the HIQA report to ensure that lessons from Ms Halappanavar's death are applicable nationally.<\/p><p>  On the issue of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, implementing the European working time directive, EWTD, this is a significant challenge for the health service and has been a vexed issue for some years.  I do not for a moment dispute the fact that the level of hours worked by NCHDs needs to be reduced to a sustainable level, but I would make the following important points.  The key drivers of NCHD hours are service needs and the amount of hours NCHDs work is determined by the rosters which consultants, clinical directors and service managers identify as needed to meet those service needs.  Maintaining services to the public and meeting the requirements of the directive poses a significant challenge to the health service. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700007#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1382002500,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I must interrupt as a vote has been called in the D&aacute;il.

Data based on hospital site visits indicates that as of September, 76% of NCHDs were compliant with a 24 hour shift and a further 6% worked no more than 26 hours continuously.  It underlines continuing progress when compared to the date for the first six months of 2013.<\/p><p>  As part of the ongoing engagement with the IMO, the proposals of 27 September reflect a significant level of agreement between the IMO and health service management.  They include implementation of a maximum 24 hour shift by 30 November - other than in exceptional circumstances - with full implementation by 14 January 2014, full directive compliance by 31 December 2014, a joint IMO  and management verification and implementation at national and local level and referral of a range of other items to the Labour Relations Commission.  One issue remaining between the sides was the matter of sanctions, and the HSE has put proposals to the IMO to resolve this issue.  The HSE and IMO have now concluded negotiations facilitated by the LRC, and yesterday the IMO's NCHD committee agreed to put resolution proposals to a ballot of members.  It is hoped that this will lead to a final resolution of the dispute.<\/p><p>   I would like to turn to the issue of medical cards, and I am conscious that much of the information on this has been covered in the Minister's speech.  With your permission, Chairman, I will exclude a few sections which may make things a little harder to follow.  I welcome your suggestion of a further visit by the committee to PCRS and we look forward to hosting that in due course.  In advance of today's meeting, an update report on medical cards was circulated.<\/p><p>  I must re-emphasise that the medical card scheme does not provide an automatic entitlement to a medical card for individuals with a specific illness.  It is important to clarify that there is only one medical card, as there seems to be an impression that there are two or indeed three types of medical cards.  A medical card is either approved on foot of a means assessment, which meets the current financial guidelines, or where the applicant does not meet the income guidelines but there is undue hardship as a result of the medical or social circumstances.  The Minister has already described the procedures that are in place.<\/p><p>  Earlier this year the first &euro;50 of travel to work costs became disallowed for the purposes of these calculations, as did the costs of servicing loans related to home improvements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700008#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382003400,"counter":696,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the presence of Mr. O'Brien and compliment and thank him for negotiating on behalf of the HSE on the non-consultant hospital doctors issue, on which the committee was very much involved in holding meetings.

The investigation into Savita's death highlighted the fact that only five maternity units had implemented the national guidelines issued after Tania's tragic death.  In view of that record, who will oversee full implementation of HIQA's recommendations in respect of maternity services?  Will HIQA be invited regularly to observe the ongoing implementation of these recommendations, or will this be done by an internal HSE group?<\/p><p>  Against the backdrop of the budget and cuts to the value of &euro;666 million in the health service next year, as well as the withdrawal of discretionary medical cards, I have a major difficulty with the statistics the Minister and Mr. O'Brien gave us.  I receive a huge number of e-mails from people who contact me regularly.  As I do not think I am a special Deputy, I assume they contact other Deputies, too.  There are obviously many who fall through the cracks, as the Minister said.  At this stage, the cracks have almost become a canyon.  There is an avalanche of people who are genuinely very distressed that their discretionary medical card has been withdrawn or who have been refused a discretionary medical card because they do not qualify under the guidelines for a means assessment.<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Brien has pointed out that 53,000 discretionary medical cards were issued up to 8 October.  How many discretionary medical cards have been issued this year, as opposed to previous years?  I would like to see a profile of the discretionary medical cards issued.  I suggest the number issued is reducing rapidly.  The empirical evidence is the statistics.  We must also acknowledge that the population is fluid.  People are born; they might have disabilities or other challenges; they get sick and may not qualify under the income guidelines.  I find it hard to believe there has been such a rapid reduction in the number of discretionary medical cards issued.  I just cannot reconcile this with the evidence that we receive from various organisations such as the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Children's Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society and people with liver disease.  They constantly highlight very tragic cases, yet the people concerned lose their medical cards.  We have itemised them.  This issue was also highlighted in the<i> Irish Examiner<\/i> last week, with detailed examples of people who were unable to access a discretionary medical card.<\/p><p>  If there have been no changes to the guidelines, how is it that a discretionary medical card was withdrawn from a child with intellectual and physical disabilities, who is incontinent and cannot use his limbs and whose circumstances have not changed and will get progressively worse?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700009#L00300","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382004000,"counter":699,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and Mr. O'Brien from the HSE.  I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is back at work following her recent bout of illness.  <\/p><p>  The HSE service plan for 2014 is in the process of preparation.  Was any study carried out by the Department of Health or the HSE of the likely impact of a significant reduction in the budget provision for the Department and the HSE for 2014?  When the Minister and his Ministers of State were preparing to engage with Cabinet colleagues, in particular the Mniister for Public Expenditure and Reform, were the necessary details available to them in advance of that engagement?  It has been signalled that &euro;666 million will be reduced from the budget for 2014.  I have no doubt that the significant impact of that reduction is being worked out in the preparation of the service plan.  Did the Minister and his colleagues have a sense of the effect of that reduction?  Was it part of their armoury of efforts to protect the overall health budget in their engagements with Cabinet colleagues?<\/p><p>  The budget announced the planned extension of medical cards - they are not medical cards but GP access cards only - for all children aged five years and under.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, to record that I welcomed the inclusion of this measure in the measures announced.  I have argued for this as a first step.  I emphasise that it is the first step because if it is not, it will contribute to ever increasing levels of disquiet.  There are those who are saying, \"I have a child who is seriously ill, who is over six years of age, yet my little child who is well will have a GP access card, while my older child will not.\"  If people do not understand there is a timeframe for the introduction of universal free access to GP care, it will totally undermine the notion of universality and feed into an ever growing level of disquiet.  Is there a timeframe for the extension of this measure beyond the age of five years and up to 12 to cover the primary school cohort?  Can we anticipate such an extension in 2014, or even more bolder steps?  Is it anticipated that within a reasonably short timeframe there will be universal access to free GP care?  This is essential.  <\/p><p>  From where did the figure of &euro;113 million relating to probity come?  It is a strange one.  Is it based on a specific arithmetic assessment, or just a figure that sat neatly into the proposed targets for achievement in 2014?  I ask the Minister to elaborate on where the figure of &euro;113 million comes from.  <\/p><p>  On the notion of probity, the Minister has quoted statistics that were not included in what we previously received.<\/p> <p>Those data are not included in the transcript of the Minister's address, nor in the report on medical cards as prepared for today's meeting.  The Minister indicated in his opening remarks that 17,059 people previously in possession of a medical card no longer have it.  I did not manage to note all of the figures - the detail was quite vast and I do not have shorthand skills - but I understood he indicated that more than 30% of those called to review did not respond.  A family member of mine, more than 80 years of age and with Alzheimer's disease, received two such requests for review but did not respond because it is beyond the individual's capacity to do so at this point in time.  As a result, this person's medical card was withdrawn.  Is it not likely that a significant number out of the 30% plus who failed to respond did so through no fault of their own, simply because it was beyond their capacity to understand or respond?  It is a very hard mallet indeed to apply a cessation of entitlement in such circumstances.  These are issues that come to us out of our own life experiences.  As a political representative, moreover, I know the instance I have cited is not unique to my family.  I am sure this is an experience to which all Members can attest.<\/p><p> It would be remiss of me not to refer to page 9 of the medical card report that was prepared for this meeting.  It states: \"It is incorrect to assert, as has been widely reported in the media in recent weeks, that medical cards are harder to get\".  We are not suggesting that is the case.  However, the evidence is absolutely clear that discretionary medical cards are indeed more difficult to obtain.  That is a fact of life.  It is evident from the cases referred to by Deputy Kelleher and others and from discussions we have had recently in Private Members' time and in many other fora.  There can be no denying that it is becoming ever more difficult for people to obtain and retain a medical card on a discretionary basis.  It is clear from the correspondence that is before the committee today.  One of the items of correspondence is from the chairperson of Children's Liver Disease Ireland outlining that organisation's concern at the growing evidence that medical cards for children with serious liver disease are not being renewed.  We also have a letter from a father describing the impact of the withdrawal of a discretionary medical card on his 14 year old son who has multiple disabilities and medical issues.  The evidence is in the correspondence that has been circulated to all members; it is not anecdotal.  Such is the enormity of what these people are contending with, I am confident that nobody in this room would conclude that the individuals in question are not entitled to a medical card.<\/p><p> One of the questions we raised concerned the crisis relating to junior hospital doctors.  I thank Mr. Tony O'Brien for the update on this issue in his report.  The negotiations are ostensibly concluded and members will be balloted thereon.  I wish for a good outcome to that process.  However, the issue of the absence of sanctions for hospitals which fail to comply with measures to implement the European Working Time Directive has loomed large in recent weeks.  If it is the case that this remains an issue, and knowing the situation historically whereby hospitals have been penalised by reductions in budget, it is an absolute travesty that the people who will ultimately suffer are the patients presenting in those hospitals.  It is entirely unacceptable.  Will Mr. O'Brien elaborate on what sanctions he expects to see applying in regard to non-compliance with the European Working Time Directive?<\/p><p> The last question I tabled relates to nursing home care.  There is undeniably a shortage of places, with hundreds of older people languishing in acute hospital beds as they wait for nursing home places.  Yet nowhere do I see a commitment to allocate additional funding for the provision of public nursing home bed opportunities.  I know of cases in various Dublin hospitals where elderly people who no longer need medical care but do require residential nursing home care are being left for months in critical facilities.  I can share the detail with the Minister and Mr. O'Brien after the meeting.  It is beyond belief and the dreadful term \"bed blockers\" that is applied to these people is a horrendous insult.  The fact is that the system is not providing sufficient nursing home places either in the private sector or - most important in terms of our responsibilities - in the public sector.<\/p><p> The Chairman has indicated that I am over time.  I hope he will allow me to make one final point regarding an issue that was the subject of a unanimous appeal from members at our last meeting.  It concerns the earlier signalled intent to include a programme for bilateral cochlear implantation in the budget for 2014.  We wrote to the Minister regarding this matter on 11 October but I have yet to see any indication, either in budget speeches or in any of the contributions here today, that the undertaking will be implemented.  I take this opportunity to urge once again that this provision be included in the HSE's service plan for 2014.  Can the Minister and Mr. O'Brien provide confirmation in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700010#M00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382004600,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I will now take questions from other members in blocks of three, beginning with Senator Colm Burke and Deputies Ciara Conway and Catherine Byrne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700011#N00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1382004600,"counter":702,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman.  One of my questions, No. 4 on the list, raised the issue that out of a budget of more than &euro;13 billion, &euro;3.4 billion is going to organisations and agencies that are not under the direct control of the Health Service Executive.  I have received a number of telephone calls in recent months from people inquiring about salary scales in these bodies.  I was advised, for example, that one particular organisation is paying its chief executive officer more than &euro;340,000.  We should remember that these individuals are being paid from taxpayers' money.  The response to the question states: \"This matter is currently being addressed jointly between the HSE and the Department of Health with a view to bringing the pay rates of Section 38 agencies into line with the DoH salary scales and a pay policy will issue shortly in this regard\".  Does this response indicate that a number of these organisations are paying salaries far in excess of the remuneration for an equivalent post in the HSE?<\/p><p>  Another question I tabled relates to the junior doctor dispute, an issue I have been pursuing for two years.  While I welcome the proposed agreement on this matter and hope it will bring a resolution to the recent dispute, it does not address the issue of long-term planning pertaining to junior doctors.  I am concerned that the number of such doctors coming in from abroad is declining while the number of Irish graduates leaving the country is increasing.  How will that vacuum be filled for 2014 and 2015?  We must have a new approach to the matter.  The Minister has set up a review to examine the issue whereby more than 2,000 of the 4,900 junior doctors currently working in our hospitals are on six-month contracts.  When are we likely to see decisive action in that regard?  Unless there is immediate action, a staff shortage will inevitably arise.<\/p><p>  I also tabled a question, No. 3 on the list, regarding the number of vacancies for consultant posts in hospitals.  The answer I received this morning is different from the reply given to a parliamentary question put down by Deputy Gerry Adams last December.  There is a variation of more than 200 as between the two replies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700011#N00300","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382005200,"counter":704,"content":"<p>I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, must go to the D&aacute;il and I would appreciate it, therefore, if members adhered to the time limits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700012#O00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1382005200,"counter":705,"content":"<p>The issue relating to medical cards has been well ventilated by previous speakers.  However, I wish to make a technical point with regard to the review that was carried out during the summer months.  In that regard, I refer, in particular, to those who are over 70.  The language used in the letters sent out to people as part of the review was completely impenetrable, difficult and cumbersome.  In addition, the letters frightened those over 70 years of age who received them.  I would like the HSE to adopt a policy of using plain English in its correspondence with people.  I was visited at my constituency office by numerous individuals who were quite entitled to retain their medical cards but who were petrified as a result of the tone used in the letters they received.  This has happened on previous occasions, not with the Department of Health or the HSE but with other arms of government.  If we have not already learned lessons from how the Revenue dealt with its situation, then it is time we did so.  I would like our guests to comment on this matter and indicate how we might move forward in respect of it.<\/p><p>  What is the timeline with regard to the commencement of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013?  Where do we stand in the context of the appointment of panels of doctors and dealing with the other procedural issues which must be disposed of before the legislation can be commenced?  The staff of our maternity hospitals are in limbo.  This is also the case with pregnant women who continue to find themselves in the precarious situations such as those in which Savita Halappanavar and others like her found themselves in the past.  What is the timelime for the implementation of the legislation?<\/p><p>  What is the position regarding the Higgins report and the restructuring of hospitals and the promotion of hospital groups?  When the report was published, we were informed that all the reforms being made in the area of health care are designed to ensure that patients will be seen at facilities as close as possible to their homes.  Unfortunately, the latter is not proving to be the case.  Prior to the emergence of the Higgins report, women could access maternity services in regional centres in their home towns.  I refer, for example, the to the centre in Dungarvan.  Maternity and ophthalmology services are not longer offered in county towns and women in County Waterford are obliged to travel to Waterford Regional Hospital to avail of them.  This is a complete contradiction of what we were told when the Higgins report was published.  Will our guests comment on that matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700012#O00300","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1382005200,"counter":706,"content":"<p>I will deal with the questions posed by Deputies Kelleher and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  We are continually hearing that the posts relating to mental health have not come on stream.  I wish to place on record the exact position in this regard.  We received an allocation of &euro;20 million this year.  I accept that the programme for Government contains a commitment to the effect that &euro;35 million would be provided each year.  I am convinced that we are not finished in the context of mental health and I have been provided with assurances in respect of next year.  I will not discuss all of the usual matters relating to mental health - the difficulties that arise, where we should be treating people, etc. - because these have been well ventilated.<\/p><p>  It is important to state that on 30 September last the recruitment process had been completed in respect of 378 - or 91% - of the 414 posts in this area.  There are a number of posts in respect of which there have been difficulties in identifying suitable candidates.  This is due to factors which include the availability of qualified candidates and geographic location.  The recruitment process has reached various stages in respect of the remainder of the posts.  Some &euro;35 million was allocated in respect of mental health in Budget 2013 in respect of the continued development of our mental health services across a range of headings, including the further development of forensic and community mental health teams for adults, for adults, children, older persons and mental health intellectual disability.  A total of 477 posts have been approved in the context of implementing these measures and as of 30 September, the recruitment process had been completed in respect of 19 - or 4% - of these posts.  Some 236 - or 49% - are in the final stages of recruitment process.  A further 149 - or 31% - are at various stages in the recruitment process.  This means that some 85% of the 2013 allocation are in the recruitment process, with the balance undergoing HR approval.  The HSE's national recruitment service is currently working to ensure that the remaining posts will be filled as soon as possible from the existing panels - or through competition in the absence of such panels - at the earliest opportunity.  Options to enable more local recruitment are being considered and will assist in filling specific posts.<\/p><p>  I wish to provide an example of where we currently stand in respect of posts.  As long as people keep stating that posts are not being filled, this will appear to be the truth.  It is not the truth, however.  For example, a total of 21 posts were allocated to Galway-Roscommon health services.  Some 19 of these have been filled and two remain to be filled.  There is a difficulty with regard to specific posts relating to particular areas of interest.  I refer, for example, to very specialised disciplines such as forensic psychiatry, services for older people and intellectual disability.  However, another difficulty arises.  If we continue to recruit from a general panel in respect of mental health services, those who apply will obtain posts but these may not be in either the areas in which they are interested or in the locations in which they wish to live and work.  Let us consider the example of someone who is recruited to a position in Dublin but who wishes to work in Cork, which I can understand.  When a post becomes vacant in Cork, the person in question would be entitled to fill it.  As a result, a vacancy would arise in Dublin.<\/p><p>  There is a particular problem with regard to forensic psychiatry.  People are recruited from the general panel and are obliged to undergo very intensive training in order to get up to speed in this area.  When posts then become available in disciplines in which they are interested, they tend to move on.  We are considering putting specific panels in place and advertising the fact that specific posts relate to particular services.  There are difficulties but these do not relate to the bulk of the posts we are trying to fill.  We have made great progress filling many of those posts but there are problems in respect of niche specialist areas, which is understandable in the circumstances.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in in that there will be a difficulty in the future in the context of beds.  A decision has not yet been made as to whether this issue will be dealt with in the context of the public or private sector.  However, a substantial amount of work has already been done and we are aware of the number of beds that are going to be needed.  A great deal of the work in this regard has already been done in conjunction with Atlantic Philanthropies and in the context of the The Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging, TILDA.  I will provide the Deputy with some statistics in this regard.  The target in respect of home care packages was 10,870 and in June 2013 output had reached 11,031.  The latter was 1.5% ahead of target.  The target in respect of home help packages was 50,000 or thereabouts and in June output had reached 45,739.  This was 1.8% behind target.  Of course, it must be recognised that home care and home help packages relate to different cohorts.  The target for day care was to provide 21,460 places and in June output had reached 21,460.  So we were exactly on target in this regard.  We are also on target in the context of respite, with some 600 beds being provided.  On the nursing home support - or fair deal - scheme, the target was to fund 22,761 older people and in July 22,303 had been funded and an additional 863 had been approved for funding.  We are, therefore, also on target in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700012#O00400","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382005800,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I will address the issues raised by Deputy Kelleher first and in answering the questions raised I will have to defer to some of the team present.  The Deputy mentioned the very tragic case of Tania McCabe and the lessons that do not seem to have learned by the rest of the system.  Earlier today I was at a national clinical excellence council to discuss the bringing in of new standards - not only the national early warning scheme we have already brought in for all our general hospitals, but a maternal early warning scorecard for our maternity hospitals.  There are new standards to be developed around sepsis and around the clinical handover - that is, when nurses and doctors exchange information as shifts change - because that is a time of risk in terms of information being lost.   The Deputy asked a specific question and HIQA will be monitoring that area.  I have asked it expressly to bear in mind my priorities and those of the Department in terms of patient safety when it is reporting on hospitals.  Mr. O'Brien might go into that further.  Perhaps it would be more sensible for Dr. Philip Crowley to answer that question when he is responding to other matters.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the figure of &euro;666 million in regard to the budget.

The figure of &euro;666 million in savings has been identified and &euro;113 million of that is to be achieved from a probity review of medical cards.

There was a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700013#P00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1382005800,"counter":710,"content":"<p>Yes.  The report produced by PricewaterhouseCoopers suggested that somewhere between &euro;60 million and &euro;200 million could be saved through probity in the GMS, or primary care reimbursement service, as it is now known.  That report was published 18 months ago, so obviously there has been a lot of action  since then.  None the less, a figure of  &euro;113 million in savings to be achieved was given to the Department by the Government.  I am frankly concerned about  what can be achieved here and about what can be achieved in view of the Haddington Road agreement.  That is why I asked for the Taoiseach's Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to be involved in assessing and validating these figures and the impact these savings would have on the service.  I want to reiterate - it is important that people understand this - that probity does not only relate to whether the person holding the medical card is eligible to do so, but also to the prescribing practices of doctors and out-of-hours claims made by doctors.  One doctor claimed &euro;180,000 and ended up settling for &euro;15,000.  There are issues with regard to pharmacy services as well.  Therefore, it is not all about the question of eligibility for a medical card, by any means.  I reiterate that people who are entitled to a medical card have nothing to fear.<\/p><p>  I reject the Deputy's contention that discretion has been taken from the HSE.  In fact, more discretion has been given to it, as there are now doctors to make sure that even more compassion is applied in assessing people and that every latitude is given to try to help people to qualify.  As  I said to the Deputy earlier, 49% of people who had their cards removed or failed to get a card were more than 200% over the threshold when everything was taken into account.  I must re-emphasise that the medical card scheme never operated on the basis of medical conditions or illnesses; it operates on the basis of consideration of undue financial hardship.  Clearly, medical conditions have an impact on financial hardship, and that is taken into account.  Equity and consistency have been brought into the system because in the past people in some parts of the country got discretionary medical cards based on certain criteria while people in other parts of the country could not get them based on the same criteria.  There is consistency in the system, but the rules have not changed.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the issue of tax relief on medical insurance premiums.  That is a taxation matter.  He will probably ask whether I knew about it.  I found out at the same time as all my other Cabinet colleagues.  Is that unusual?  I know of no Minister for Finance who has discussed his taxation measures with the Cabinet before deciding on them himself.  This is a challenge for us as well; of that there is no question.<\/p><p>  With regard to the increase in the prescription charge, that is not the direction in which I want to go.  I still firmly have concerns about it, but given the options with which I am faced in order to raise &euro;660 million, I would prefer, even though I do not like it one bit, to raise the prescription charge rather than to cut services.  That is the choice I am left with.  We do not like to be political here, but nobody in this room need be deluded as to why &euro;660 million is needed from the health budget to get us out of the bailout and why we are in the bailout.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked me about the role of the three Departments.  I think I have covered that already.  I sought that because I want absolute clarity around these figures with regard to their achievability.  I want absolute clarity about their impact on the service because if they are not achievable in this area of the budget, they have to achieved somewhere else in the budget.  That is the reality and I have the agreement of the Taoiseach's Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on that.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked if we had the necessary details in advance of the budget.  In no other year have so many hours been spent going over this.  There is a new chief financial officer and a new financial reform board in the HSE, and we had well over 30 hours of meetings, not including the hours of work those involved had done before they came to me and the hours we then put in with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have real information and the figures are real.  I also want to clarify another matter.  The idea of a black hole in health was something that had currency years ago.  I can tell the Deputy there is no black hole there now.  We now know where all the money is, how it is spent, where is going and how much we need.  As I said previously - not here but in other media - we had postulated an increase in demand of 1% during the year, and asked for &euro;190 million but got &euro;90 million, and then the increase in demand ended up being 2%, which involved a cost of &euro;360 million.  The Deputy can recognise the challenges faced by the health service in trying to predict the future with absolute certainty.<\/p><p>  The Deputy and the Irish people can be absolutely assured - I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy White, to elaborate on this - that the provision for the under fives is not a stand-alone initiative.  This is a part of a key step on the road to universal health insurance.  Even with full GP care available throughout the land, that will not end the inequity of the two-tier system.  The only thing that can do that is universal health insurance and the delivery of that is something to which I and Government are committed.  These are key building blocks towards that goal.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy asked where the figure of &euro;113 million had come from.  I have explained that already.  As I said, this is the figure that we were given as a consequence of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's deliberations on that report.<\/p><p>  On the issue of discretionary medical cards being harder to get, while the Minister of State, Deputy White, will want to deal with that, I have some detail on that in myriad of papers before me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700013#P00400","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382006400,"counter":712,"content":"<p>They are not months in hospital waiting to go home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700014#Q00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1382006400,"counter":713,"content":"<p>Exactly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700014#Q00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1382006400,"counter":714,"content":"<p>We will take one speaker at a time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700014#Q00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1382006400,"counter":715,"content":"<p>Home is not an option.

To date, I am told that no one has ever challenged the accuracy of that assessment.  As the members receive inquiries, and I know many members receive many inquiries, I would encourage them to ask those inquiring about the outcome of their assessment to show them that piece of information.  I say that specifically because while I hear myself and am aware of the particular challenging circumstances with which many parents and families are faced, having regard to the medical conditions of members of their family, it is the financial impact of those challenges that the HSE is obliged to take account of, not the challenge itself.

What is different is the fact that there is a centralised processing operation.  The Minister put that in context in terms of the number of reviews we conducted this year but 87% of those renewals were successful.  We assess an individual on the basis of their means, and we apply discretion.  The Minister has put on the record the fact that discretion was applied positively 36,000 times since 2011.

As for how we have managed it to this point, it is in contrast to how the death of Tania McCabe was managed, as that was dealt with as a local incident and managed locally.  The report was available but was not implemented on a national basis.  In recent years, the HSE has established a number of processes to ensure this is not the case with reports of this nature.  We have a process agreed between myself and the line division under which we will consider jointly any report that is published into safety of care.  Moreover, we will establish a committee in advance of the report arriving in order that it is ready to receive the report, and this is what has been done in respect of our own report into the care of Savita Halappanavar.  That same group that is being established with expert input and now under the leadership of Ian Carter will be asked to implement our own report and its implications, the coroner's inquest findings and now the HIQA report.  It is important to state that the recommendations that pertain to Galway will be implemented in all units and, most importantly, some of the key priorities already have been advanced, some to implementation.  In particular, the Irish maternity early warning score has been implemented in all 19 units.  Training is being done in all 19 units and patient information leaflets are being developed for patients in order that they understand the process.  I believe we are the first State internationally to have a nationally agreed and implemented maternity early warning score, which is quite different from other adult early warning scores.  There are sepsis guidelines, and there were sepsis guidelines in Galway at the time, but they were not properly followed.  We need to urgently develop national sepsis guidelines and have in place a group that is tasked with developing those.  We will ascertain what kind of resources they now need both to develop guidelines and to develop them to a level and standard that will pass the scrutiny of the national clinical effectiveness committee to which the Minister referred earlier and get the ministerial mandate this will entail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700017#U00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Philip Crowley"},{"type":"speech","time":1382007900,"counter":759,"content":"<p>I wish to make a comment on this issue, because I attended that conference this morning and wish to reiterate forcefully here a point I made there.

It is a core duty and a core concern of management, and patient safety must be at the core of what each chief executive officer does.  To draw an analogy, the airline industry is one of the safest in the world and no one in this room really believes that only pilots are involved in that, do they?  When drawing up the national service plan, we are making it clear where patient safety should be in this plan - namely, right at the top.  Moreover, we are making it plain to all new chief executive officers who take over the hospital groups, as well as to existing managers, that it is part of their core duty and core concern and that they are as responsible as anyone else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700017#U00400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382007900,"counter":760,"content":"<p>In respect of the questions of Senator Colm Burke and Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on non-consultant hospital doctors and the issue of sanctions, the only issue that divided us during the talks process was the nature of those sessions.

At one point during the discussions, an opposite view was held by the Irish Medical Organisation side.  I will ask Mr. Barry O'Brien to describe in detail what those sanctions are in a moment.<\/p><p>  As for the issue of the &euro;3.4 billion of funding to external agencies, these agencies fall into two categories, namely, section 38 agencies and section 39 agencies.  Section 38 agencies are those which essentially are wholly funded by the public sector and their employees are considered to be public sector employees.  Examples are places such as St. James's Hospital or Beaumont Hospital.  Section 39 agencies are a wide variety of voluntary sector providers, which are mostly partially funded, even though the amount may be substantial.  Senator Colm Burke made reference to a chief executive officer receiving a salary of &euro;340,000, and I can confirm this is not a section 38 agency.  The recent audit report, which we expect to be discussing with the Committee of Public Accounts next month, related to section 38 agencies.  A clear guidance note - that is, a circular and instruction - has been issued to those entities and they are required to confirm their compliance with the terms of that circular to the HSE by the end of this month.  Section 39 agencies will be subject to further audit work by HSE internal audit, supplemented by external auditors.

One key issue of debate throughout the Labour Relations Commission discussions was the issue of sanctions.  I wish to put this in the context of a structure to incentivise compliance, rather than to penalise anyone, but it has been agreed that the national director for acute hospitals will withhold an annual sum of &euro;15 million from the budgetary allocation of the public acute hospital system and this will be redistributed on the basis that we achieve full compliance right across our system.  Consequently, we have agreed with the IMO that there will be a three-band structure for hospitals.  The larger hospitals, which are eight in number, will be in band one and they can be sanctioned up to a maximum of &euro;650,000 for the year.  Band two contains 18 hospitals and they can receive a sanction of up to &euro;350,000 for the year, while band three hospitals, of which there are 15, can be sanctioned up to &euro;225,000.

I have the privilege, being a Senator, of not being in that territory.  However, the Irish Hospice Foundation has told me of those who get the medical card for six months because they have a terminal illness where the difficulty arises at the six-month point.  What happens is that those who live beyond six months and seek to renew their card then must go through the full, quite cumbersome means-test procedure.  Everybody here will be aware of the procedure.  They are no less terminally ill.  The answer I got, perhaps a little like the letters that issue about medical cards, was quite opaque.  I read it five times last night, trying to understand what was being said.  The crux of it is that while those given medical cards on terminal illness grounds, rather than on emergency or discretionary grounds, are being treated swiftly and sympathetically, there should be a system where the card needs to be renewed after six months.  Those with a problem are, not the many in this category who have a medical social worker or palliative care team, but those who fall outside of their remit.<\/p><p>  I have heard of many individual cases.  It is almost as if we are saying that if the person has lived longer than six months, we will penalise him or her for doing so.  It is a bizarre situation when one has a terminal illness.  I heard of one case of a man who does not want to face up to the fact that he has a terminal illness.  They have managed to work around it but now, after the six months, he must go through all of this procedure and the family must work with him to face up to it.  There is something wrong with the system.  I will leave the illustrations on the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Foundation to my colleague, Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, but they are equally compelling.

On grounds of hardship, the HSE can apply discretion and grant a medical card.  Mr. O'Brien stated here that, as of 1 October 2013, 52,733 medical cards were issued where the applicant's means were above national guidelines and 22,115 GP visit cards were granted.

I refer to those who would have been over the income threshold guidelines initially but who received them on discretionary grounds of undue hardship.  I suppose what I am trying to ask is, how does one determine \"undue hardship\"?  Is there a price on discretion?  Is there a formula that brings it about?

I agree that some of the bases for those savings are less than solid in terms of the sort of analysis that has been given.  What is the likelihood of a supplementary budget or budgets being needed in 2014?  How much does the Minister expect will be required in supplementary budgets?  Conscious that we will no longer be under the intense scrutiny of the troika, there might be some more leeway afforded to the Minister and his colleagues in the Cabinet.  I would be interested in hearing from him on that.  The way in which the figure of &euro;113 million has been arrived at is somewhat dubious, and I am quite sceptical about the likelihood of realisation through the probity review of medical cards.<\/p><p>  Second, I wish to follow up on Deputy Kelleher's question on the reduction in tax relief for medical insurance.  It is quite extraordinary that this taxation measure was arrived at without any consultation with the Minister for Health.  That it was exclusively a decision of the Department of Finance is pretty much alarming.  I realise that the &euro;127 million in potential savings is a convenient figure to arrive at for the Department of Finance.  As Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly has a duty of care to patients, others in the health system and the huge swathe of people who benefit from health insurance at present but who rely on the tax relief that will no longer be available.  Has there been any in-depth analysis by the Department of Health or others collectively on the likely impact on public health care costs?  There will clearly be an impact.<\/p><p>  Can the Minister clarify the likely number of people who will be affected?  It has been suggested by a number of people with considerable expertise, including Mr. Dermot Goode, that up to 1.8 million people could be affected, or 90% of policies.  Is that likely?  Does the Minister believe the figures are accurate?  How on earth will this fit in with the Minister's plan to roll out universal health care in the years ahead?

Under the assessment, the HSE is asking for a notice of assessment from the Revenue Commissioners on income where a means test has already been done, for example, by the Department of Social Protection.  Ordinarily, one would not be asked for another revenue assessment.  An extra layer of effort is involved, particularly for over-70s.   A couple over 70 might have non-contributory pensions assessed by the Department of Social Protection, yet they are asked for proof of income from the HSE.  This is a necessity.  With regard to the under-70s, people on very low incomes, such as those in receipt of the farm assist payment, would be asked for a further assessment of income.  Until the day comes that the Department of Finance asks every citizen to file a tax return, asking medical card applicants to carry out a further assessment, which might involve their having to go to an accountant, involves extra unnecessary expenditure, time and effort.  The accountancy industry may not thank me for saying that.

It can be awarded on the basis where an illness has an impact on one&rsquo;s financial situation.  It is not whether or to what extent the person is ill.  It is whether or to what extent that illness impacts on the person's financial situation.  There is a big difference between the two.  It sounds harsh but I am trying to clarify the specifics.

Has he stress-tested the HSE's value for money in respect of outsourced private health services?  I was shocked to hear earlier about the salary scale of &euro;340,000 for a CEO because the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Foundation does not merely exist to look after our children and nurse them at home.  According to the report of Professor Charles Normand from Trinity College, it is nine times cheaper to let the money follow the patient and nurse him or her at home.  We have raised &euro;47 million and are on our way to &euro;50 million and the HSE has given us &euro;4 million since 1998.  I am very interested in understanding things.  <\/p><p>  The HSE has also changed the way one gets a medical card if one is unlucky enough to give birth to a child who needs palliative care and one would like the child to go home.  It used to be the case that one was given a medical card there and then in the hospital.  It used to be the case that with a few telephone calls, an emergency medical card would be issued.  One must now go out to the General Register Office as a very stressed and upset parent and register the birth.  One must then wait a number of days.  I heard a case only two weeks ago involving a baby born in the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital who was transferred to Our Lady's Childrens Hospital in Crumlin.  It took a week to get that child a medical card and Our Lady's Childrens Hospital and the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Foundation had to pay for the supply of equipment to feed the child to get them home so they could die at home.  I do not want to get too personal but we have two realities here.  I asked a question in the Seanad the other night and was not happy with the answer because it did not reflect the reality of what is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700021#Y00100","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1382010300,"counter":788,"content":"<p>All of us would accept that it should not take a week for the emergency medical card to be issued.

That is something we will do because I believe this country is progressive and provides good standards by comparison with other countries.  We should be able to measure up to that standard.

Perhaps this provides us with an opportunity to refine that definition to benefit people as best we can.

I would also be very concerned if there is a lack of compassion and understanding in the system, as referred to by Senator O'Brien.  I am not taking from anything that has been said here but I know from colleagues in the House and from people outside that there is a very high measure of understanding and empathy on the part of the staff in the PCRS.  I have heard them complimented widely for that.  That is not to say that there are not circumstances where the standard we expect is not achieved.  That is why we want to know about that.  We are not engaging in any criticism of anybody but if there is a lack of understanding or people have experienced insensitivity, I certainly want to know about it.  This is separate from the issue of eligibility and concerns the way people are dealt with.

I do not think anyone in the HSE has suggested that there is no problem.  It is a question of what our definition of the problem is.  We are administering the scheme as it stands.  The scheme does not do all that we would wish it to do.  I do not think that the fundamental problem relates to the way the scheme is being administered.  It is being administered in accordance with the legislation as it exists and the resources provided to it.  What we are really having is a discussion about what the scheme should be as opposed to what it is.  We can all relate to that discussion.<\/p><p>  In respect of the specific issue raised by Senator O'Brien regarding the unfortunate birth of a palliative baby and the way that case was dealt with, we will certainly review our procedures to see if we can come up with a better way of managing that.  <\/p><p>  The salary of &euro;340,000 is not being paid by the HSE.  I can tell the Senator that it is not in agency that is fully funded by the HSE.  I do not know which agency it is.  I am assuming it is a section 39 agency, of which there are many from very small to very large.  I can only assume it is an entity that has very substantial external funding but they will all be subject to an audit review to ensure that public funds are not used to support excessive salaries such as that salary.  Obviously, in respect of the services we buy, we look for value for money in respect of the quantum of service we receive for the funding we provide.  Nothing I say is intended to take away from the particular situation experienced or described by Senator O'Brien and her colleagues but what we have is a plea for a different type of medical card system - a universal one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013101700021#Y00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1382010300,"counter":794,"content":"<p>I conclude by again thanking the members, members of the HSE, the Minister, the Ministers of State and staff from the Department of Health.
