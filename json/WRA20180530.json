This figure is based on 15% of average agriculture emissions in 2008-2012 in recognition of the limited mitigation potential in agriculture. Afforestation is measured as the greenhouse gas change in forests less than 20 or 30 years of age.  Thus the mitigation benefits of current afforestation in terms of national targets can last for a considerable time. <\/p>  <p>  Wood harvested from forests is itself a long term, renewable carbon pool and can produce sustainable materials that can substitute more emissions-intensive non-renewable materials and fossil fuels.  With regard to forest based biomass almost 1.6 million cubic metres of this material was used for energy purposes in 2016.  Domestically produced biomass was the primary source of this material and abated 761,000 tonnes of CO2   emissions from fossil fuels.  My Department&rsquo;s strategy is to fully exploit the potential of forestry in relation to climate change mitigation.  I have made sure to place at the core of this strategy ongoing support for a sustainable afforestation programme. <\/p>  <p>  My Department's action plan for forestry is set out in the Forestry Programme 2014 -2020 which represents almost &euro;500 million in development funding for the sector. During the period 2015 &ndash; 2017 over 18,000 hectares of new forests have been established.

Average family farm income fell by 9% in 2016 and increased by 5% in 2015. It should be noted that there are significant differences in family farm income depending on the system of farming and the size of the farm.

Most cattle farms and the majority of sheep farms are classified as part-time in terms of labour input requirements.  This preliminary release does not break farm income down between full and part-time farms but this will be available with the full NFS 2017 publication in the summer.

The BDGP is the current main support for the suckler sector and will provide farmers with some &euro;300 million of funding over six years.  <\/p>  <p>  It was introduced by my Department with the clear and stated objective of using bovine genetics to address the progressive decline in key maternal traits within Ireland's suckler herd.  The scheme aims to improve the profitability of the sector and  reduce the carbon footprint of the herd.  This is being achieved through the use of objective metrics which ensures consistency in evaluation of animals in terms of genetic merit.  Currently there are 24,775 participants between BDGP I and II and a total of &euro;42.8 million has been paid to participants for 2017 already.  <\/p>  <p>  The scheme's effectiveness is based on enhancing the genetic merits of the national suckler herd through clearly defined objective metrics for participants in the scheme.  Key metrics such as the number of calves per cow per year, the calving interval, and age at first calving, docility, size and vitality, along with the prevalence of conditions such as scour and pneumonia are measured against agreed criteria.  One of the most notable examples is the number of calves per cow per year, which has moved from 0.80 in 2014 to 0.87 for 2017; which across the entirety of the scheme herds represents an additional 40,000 calves for sale, with a weanling output value of some &euro;30m to the participating beef farmers.<\/p>  <p>  After years of decline in key maternal traits, genetic trend for replacement index has now turned around and is generating significant additional gains for participating beef farmers.  Additionally, important validation work undertaken by Teagasc and the Irish Cattle and Breeding Federation (ICBF) on 46 participating commercial beef farms over the past 3 years has confirmed that 5 star cows are more fertile, lighter (thereby requiring less feed), produce more milk (a heavier weanling) and overall produce a heavier carcass for beef farmers.  In effect the key metrics of the scheme have provided clear evidence that cattle in the BDGP schemes are producing more benefits from less resources.  This is consistent with the key objectives of the scheme, which is to breed more profitable and climate efficient cattle.<\/p>  <p>  On this basis, I believe the scheme is an excellent example of utilising empirical evidence to enhance the quality and sustainability of the national herd. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000075#WRA03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme Review","counter":52,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000075#WRA03850"},{"type":"question","counter":53,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[23738\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000075#WRA03900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of the ANC review with regard to redesignation using a set list of bio-physical criteria; if the new approach must be introduced from January 2019; if the mapping of all current ANC lands has been completed; the specific actions that have been completed to date by officials; the outstanding actions in this regard; the timeframe for remaining actions; when he expects to submit final ANC data to the EU Commission in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":54,"content":"<p>Under EU regulation, Less Favoured\/Disadvantaged Areas (with the exception of the islands) were to be replaced by newly designated Areas of Natural Constraints from 2018 with eligible areas being designated using a set list of bio-physical criteria such as soil drainage, texture and slope.

As well as by official from my Department, I was accompanied throughout the trip by Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and senior executives from our leading companies in the beef, pigmeat, dairy and seafood sectors.<\/p>  <p>  By way of background, Ireland&rsquo;s agri-food exports to China have increased roughly five-fold from around &euro;200 million in 2010 to nearly &euro;1 billion last year.  China is now Ireland&rsquo;s third largest market overall. Dairy exports to China reached &euro;667 million in 2017, and pigmeat exports have increased from &euro;37 million to &euro;100.3 million between 2012 and 2017.  China is also a growing market for seafood and other food and drink exports. <\/p>  <p>  This growth is, of course, very welcome. But the partnership between Ireland and China goes far beyond a transactional trading arrangement.  This is about cooperation at multiple levels. Political visits in both directions at the very highest level, technical engagement between officials providing assurance on food safety standards, and a programme of internships in my Department for Chinese veterinary officials have all played an important part in building trust and developing key relationships.<\/p>  <p>  This mission was an opportunity to strengthen and develop those relationships. It is imperative that we continue raising the profile of Ireland as a source of quality food and beverages, and expand the range of exports into China and Hong Kong. <\/p>  <p>  The Trade Mission itinerary was an extensive one that encompassed over 20 official engagements in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Hong Kong.  I had extremely productive meetings with the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs Han Changfu, the Minister for Marketing Regulations, Zhang Mao and the Vice Minister for the General Administration of Customs, Zou Zhiwu.  A number of additional Irish beef plants and one additional pork plant have now met the required approval standards to export to China.  It is intended to complete the final administrative details to register other plants.  We also held preliminary discussions around the issues of approval for additional plants as well as the prospect of sheep meat access.<\/p>  <p>  In Hong Kong I raised the profile of Irish food at a Bord Bia prestigious cooking competition.  I also met with the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation, Dr. S.F. Leung.  I took the opportunity to impart information on Ireland's unique agri-food sector including our commitment to strict food safety standards, sustainable production and high quality.  Hong Kong has a population of almost 8 million consumers  with relatively high disposable incomes.  <\/p>  <p>  We had a particular opportunity to present the Irish beef sector to potential buyers and distributors, following the recent success in obtaining access to the Chinese market. But we also wanted to build on existing trade links in other areas including dairy, pig meat and seafood.  We wanted to highlight the credentials of Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink sector from a food safety, sustainability and authenticity perspective, in order to develop a unique selling point for Irish product.<\/p>  <p>  A key engagement in the itinerary was our participation in the leading food event, SIAL, in Shanghai, where Irish companies had an opportunity to engage with buyers, distributors and manufacturers from China&rsquo;s food sector. <\/p>  <p>  I also oversaw the signing of a memorandum of understanding, committing to an Irish presence at the China International Import Expo taking place this November in Shanghai.  It is a great honour for Ireland to be invited by the Chinese authorities to participate in this November&rsquo;s event in Shanghai.  This initiative which is being personally driven by the President of China, Xi Jinping, will have an expected attendance of 185,000 Chinese buyers.  An event such as this, which is being promoted by the Chinese Government, offers the ideal opportunity for Irish food exporters to do business and enhance relationships.<\/p>  <p>  I also held high level meetings with a number of potential investors in the food and agri tech sectors. <\/p>  <p>  Overall this was an extremely successful mission, facilitating the development of our ever growing partnership with China.  There is a clear ambition on Irish and Chinese sides to further build co-operation between Ireland and China on many levels, including trade. Against the backdrop of Brexit, market diversification is crucial for the Irish Agri-food sector.  As markets and opportunities go there are none bigger than China and in that regard the Trade Mission represented a very good week indeed for Ireland&rsquo;s food exporters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000076#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Suckler Welfare Scheme Payments","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000076#WRB00500"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[23642\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000076#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the possibility of increasing the level of direct support for the suckler cow herd to &euro;200 per cow under the next CAP will be investigated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>Examination of appropriate measures to support all agri food sectors, including the suckler sector, is underway in my Department in preparation for the next iteration of the CAP.

Formal notices requiring specific corrective actions may be issued.

These documents have been circulated to all applicants under the BPS.<\/p><p>Where land has been burned, it is not in a state suitable for an agricultural activity such as grazing or cultivation and therefore it is not eligible, except where controlled burning is carried out. It is specified in the BPS Terms &amp;amp; Conditions that under the Wildlife Acts, growing vegetation cannot be burnt between 1<sup>st<\/sup>March and 31<sup>st<\/sup>August of any given year, on any land not yet cultivated. Enforcement of the Wildlife Acts is a matter for the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. <\/p><p>It was apparent during the closed season for burning in 2017 that there was widespread burning of vegetation.

Lands were identified that had been included in some 2017 BPS applications that were burnt after the permitted timeframe and would therefore be deemed ineligible for payment.

Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for sustainable\u00a0growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region. <\/p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025, I led a very successful Trade Mission in February 2017 to the Gulf Region. This covered the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\u00a0This was followed by an extensive Trade Mission to the US and Mexico in June. Both of these latter markets offer many elements\u00a0that are very attractive to Irish exporters.\u00a0The US is the largest food and beverage market in the world and has a population of 324 million people. Around 35 million Americans also claim Irish ancestry.\u00a0Mexico has a population of 127 million, making it the eleventh-largest country in the world in population terms and the fifteenth-largest economy in the world,\u00a0with projections that it will move into the top five by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  Later in 2017, during a Trade Mission to Japan and South Korea in November,\u00a0I was accompanied by 40 representatives of the Irish food sector, as well as by experts from my Department, the CEO of Bord Bia and senior representatives from Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc. <\/p>  <p>  This was a very\u00a0opportune time to bring a delegation of Ireland&rsquo;s food leaders to this part of the world, given that the EU has concluded a Free Trade Agreement with\u00a0South Korea as well as concluding\u00a0an Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan in December 2017.\u00a0Japan and South Korea\u00a0are markets of high potential\u00a0for beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat exports, and so it is important that\u00a0we raise the profile of\u00a0Irish agri-food enterprises\u00a0that already have access to these markets, and make progress in negotiating access for others.<\/p>  <p>  Following a further Trade Mission to the US and Canada in February, earlier this month I\u00a0led a Trade Mission to China and Hong Kong.

The rationale for sheep\u00a0EID includes the provision of a more robust sheep traceability system\u00a0that will further support the development and sustainability of the sheep industry.

The regional spread of both sectors means they underpin the socio-economic development of rural Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  It is for this reason that my &lsquo;asks&rsquo; from the EU\/UK negotiations are:<\/p>  <p>   - Continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures;<\/p>  <p>   - Minimisation of the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries; and<\/p>  <p>   - Maintenance of current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal and protection of Ireland&rsquo;s quota share for joint fish stocks. <\/p>  <p>  The primary means through which the Government is seeking to safeguard the interests of the sectors ahead of Brexit is through the EU\/UK negotiation process and our influence in that process. <\/p>  <p>  I and my Department have been actively feeding into the DFAT coordinated whole-of-Government response and we are represented on all of the interdepartmental committees.  The negotiations are now at a crucial stage, with the main focus resting on finding solutions for the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  The UK commitment in the Joint EU-UK Report of last December to avoid a hard border was extremely important. At the Government insistence this commitment is now being translated into legal form in the draft of the Withdrawal Agreement, and we are currently working closely with our EU counterparts and the European Commission Task Force to achieve progress in the actions necessary to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and any disruption to trade in agri-food and fishery products..<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, we are continuing our work on assessing the impacts of Brexit, consulting with stakeholders and engaging with EU colleagues with a view to mitigating the potential impacts. On contingency planning, my Department is sharpening its focus on preparedness issues, and is currently engaged in a round of detailed discussions with industry stakeholders. These discussions are aimed at getting a fuller understanding of the potential financial, administrative and operational impacts of Brexit along the supply chain, as well as providing logistical data that will help the Department tailor its response in the negotiation process.<\/p>  <p>  Since the Brexit vote, I have introduced a range of measures in the two most recent Budgets. These were aimed principally at helping reduce farm gate and business costs and also assist in reducing costs and improving competitiveness,.  <\/p>  <p>  The measures cover the introduction of low-cost loan schemes for farmers and SMEs, as well as new agri-taxation measures and increased funding under the Rural Development and Seafood Development Programmes.<\/p>  <p>   In Budget 2017, I introduced measures to help reduce farm gate business costs, including a &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme, new agri-taxation measures and increased funding under the Rural Development and Seafood Development Programmes. <\/p>  <p>  In the 2018 Budget I announced a &euro;50m Brexit support package, which will comprise a number of initiatives. Firstly, in cooperation with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I recently announced a new Brexit Loan Scheme aimed at providing affordable, flexible financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future, at least 40% of which will be available to food businesses.  <\/p>  <p>  I am also considering the development of a separate loan scheme similar to the 2017 low-cost scheme, based on &euro;25m funding from my Department to the Scheme. These measures are aimed at enhancing competitiveness within the sector.<\/p>  <p>  I have also introduced supports for Bord Bia for investment in market insight and market prioritisation initiatives, which are aimed at identifying and developing potential diversification opportunities. I had already increased funding to Bord Bia by &euro;14.5m since the Brexit vote, and a further &euro;4.5 million was allocated in Budget 2018.

It is a welcome addition to the body of research and analysis that is informing the Government&rsquo;s ongoing contingency planning and our overall approach to Brexit.  This report provides an analysis of the default legal framework that would apply in what would be commonly referred to as a &ldquo;disorderly Brexit&rdquo; or &ldquo;no-deal scenario&rdquo;, including those rules that would be applicable or might be invoked within the WTO and GATT framework.  As concerns the specific reference to Article XXIV of the GATT, the author acknowledges that this has never previously been invoked and, given that it only covers some customs controls, it would also fail to address key issues that would entail the need for other checks and controls, such as animal health checks or sanitary and phytosanitary controls.  It would therefore not prevent the emergence of a hard border. <\/p>  <p>  This serves to further support the shared analysis of both the EU and the UK that the issues identified in the draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland as set out in the Withdrawal Agreement are those that need to be addressed within the context of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.

As Minister for Finance I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, and neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland has informed me that its members, since 1 June 2014, have factored data on all completed flood defence schemes, provided by the OPW, into their overall assessment of flood risk. This information has been provided as part of the information sharing arrangement entered into between OPW and Insurance Ireland (Memorandum of Understanding). The nature of this arrangement is such that it has led to a greater availability of flood cover in previously higher risk areas. For instance, the most recent Insurance Ireland survey of approximately 85% of the property insurance market in Ireland indicates that of the completed defence schemes, 90% of policies in areas benefiting from permanent flood defences include flood cover, while there has been an increase from 66% to 77% of policies in areas benefiting from demountable defences including flood cover.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy should note that the Insurance Ireland\/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the above information flow and to improve the understanding of issues between both parties.\u00a0The working group allows for the sharing of relevant data on completed flood defence schemes. In this regard, the OPW has also provided a significant amount of detailed data in relation to adequacy and resourcing of flood warning systems, and mobilisation, efficacy, maintenance and development of demountable defences to Insurance Ireland. A sub-group has also been set up to explore the technical and administrative arrangements that may allow for the further sharing of data.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  One of the outcomes of these discussions is that the insurance industry has now acknowledged that they accept that the demountable defences meet the desired 1:100 year standard.

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  <\/p><p>However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years and, indeed, the problem of rising motor insurance premiums was the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  Its <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance <\/i>was published in January 2017.  As the Deputy notes, the Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes. <\/p><p>Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The Fifth Quarterly Progress Update was published on 11 May 2018: <i><\/i>.  It shows that of the 50 separate deadlines set to date within the Action Plan, 40 have been met.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  <\/p><p>In line with the EU framework, the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s starting position on insurance for small public service vehicles was that it was not possible for it to make a recommendation on pricing as this is primarily a commercial matter for insurers. It did however recognise that this sector serves a social as well as an economic purpose, particularly in rural areas where public transport is less readily available.  This position was acknowledged by the inclusion of Recommendation 10 in the Report of the Cost of Insurance Working Group on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  This recommended that the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles should enter regular discussions with Insurance Ireland to explore solutions for drivers in the sector. <\/p><p>That Fifth Update Report mentioned above outlines the implementation of this recommendation.  In summary, Insurance Ireland met with the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles, commonly known as the Taxi Advisory Committee (TAC), on 22 May 2017.  The TAC submitted the required report in relation to this meeting on 21 June 2017 to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  To date, no further meetings have taken place between the TAC and Insurance Ireland.  However, the TAC has advised my officials that it is keeping itself informed of developments in the area, particularly through the industry representatives on the Committee, and future meetings with Insurance Ireland are a part of the TAC strategy.  Recommendation 10 has been completed in the sense that the TAC has reported to the Minister for Transport.  Notwithstanding this, my view would be that work needs to continue on this general issue.  Therefore, I look forward to further engagements between the TAC and the insurance industry.  <\/p><p>I would add that, notwithstanding the role of the TAC, the issues raised by the taxi sector were in the main similar to those affecting consumers generally, notwithstanding that there are risks that are specific to the sector.  While there is no silver bullet to reduce the cost of insurance, I believe that cooperation and commitment between all parties can deliver fairer premiums for consumers, including taxi drivers.  <\/p><p>I also believe that the work of the Cost of Insurance Group should better facilitate potential new entrants to the market.  In this regard, I have been informed by my officials that Insurance Ireland has stated that there has been some increase in market capacity in relation to the provision of motor insurance for taxi drivers recently.<\/p><p>Finally, if a consumer is unable to secure a quotation on the open market, he or she may be in a position to avail of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA) process.

In its ruling, the Court of Justice had underlined the importance of free movement of personal data under the 1995 Directive and concluded that Member States were not permitted to impose additional conditions that would have the effect of amending the scope of any of the grounds in Article 7 of the Directive. Those grounds are now set out in Article 6.1 of the GDPR. <\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Attorney General has now advised my Department that insofar as section 30 purports to make it an offence for any company or corporate body to process the personal data of a child for the purposes of direct marketing or profiling, such a prohibition appears to go beyond the margin of discretion afforded to Member States in giving further effect to the GDPR and would conflict with Article 6(1)(f), read in conjunction with Recital (47). Put simply, it is not an option for a Member State to unilaterally prohibit a category of processing activities which might otherwise be lawful under Article 6.1(f). Since commencement of section 30 could, therefore, give rise to a substantial risk of infringement proceedings against the State pursuant to Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, I have requested my Department to clarify the matter with the European Commission. <\/p>  <p>  Apart from this apparent conflict with the GDPR, the Office of the Attorney General has pointed out that section 30 gives rise to difficulties under Article 38.1 of the Constitution and under Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 38.1 provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law. In order for a domestic offence provision to comply with Article 38.1, it must be clear, precise and foreseeable in its application.  This is not the case here since it is not clear what might constitute the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes micro-targeting.  Whereas the GDPR refers to both direct marketing and profiling, the concept of micro-targeting does not appear in the GDPR and its scope remains uncertain and undefined. It is also a requirement under Article 7 of the Convention that offence provisions must be sufficiently clear and precise so as to enable individuals to ascertain which conduct constitutes a criminal offence and to foresee the consequences of engaging in such conduct.  <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the difficulties concerning section 30, the Deputy will be aware that I have made provision in section 32 for the drawing up of codes of conduct intended to contribute to proper application of the GDPR with regard to the processing of the personal data of children for the purposes of direct marketing and creating personality and user profiles. I regard the drawing up of such a code as an urgent priority and I urge all relevant stakeholders, including bodies that represent the interests of children, to support that objective and to make appropriate input into its development and implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000078#WRD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000078#WRD03500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Claims Agency","counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000078#WRD03400"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[23984\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000078#WRD03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the stage of each case the State Claims Agency is dealing with, by programme, relating to the various cancer screening programmes; the notifications it has received from the HSE or the programmes themselves regarding correspondence received from persons or their legal representatives regarding a possible claim; the approach of the agency in dealing with these cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":212,"content":"<p>The State Claims Agency (SCA) has a statutory remit to manage personal injury claims, including claims in respect of clinical negligence, on behalf of Delegated State Authorities (DSAs) one of which is the Health Service Executive. <\/p><p>The SCA states that this request for information is broader that cancer misdiagnosis claims, which have recently been reported in previous parliamentary questions.

The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.<\/p><p>From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care.

These objectives should ultimately lead to healthier fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and more sustainable fishing patterns.<\/p>  <p>  In the European Union as a whole, 53 stocks will be fished at MSY in 2018 which is an improvement from 44 in 2017.  As recently as 2009 the number of stocks at MSY was only 5.  The rebuilding of many of our stocks is demonstrated by a 34% increase in our whitefish quotas off the north-west coast and a 64% increase in the Irish Sea compared to 5 years ago - both areas where stocks were depleted.<\/p>  <p>  Scientific information on the state of the fisheries exploited by the Irish fleet is compiled by the Marine Institute and is published in the Stock Book each year.  The most recent Stock Book, 2017, contains 74 stocks managed under the CFP in which Ireland has a quota share.  Of those 74 stocks, 29 were assessed as being sustainably fished in 2017.  This number has grown every year since 2013.  This in turn leads to the number of stocks being overfished declining from 22 in 2014 to 17 in 2017.  The biomass of stocks, the quantity of mature fish in the sea, has also increased. In 2017 there were 27 stocks in a positive state above biomass trigger points. This is an increase over the preceding year of 22.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland intends to continue to work with all stakeholders, Member States and the Commission to build upon this substantial and tangible progress to achieve the ambitious conservation targets set out in the CFP while supporting the communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000081#WRG04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Industry Exports","counter":397,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000081#WRG04300"},{"type":"question","counter":398,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[23948\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018053000081#WRG04400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he continues to encourage new markets for food and food products; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":399,"content":"<p>The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is of course an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agri-food sector, as evidenced by its placement right at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development over the coming decade. Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular. <\/p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region. <\/p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025, I led a very successful Trade Mission in February 2017 to the Gulf Region.  This covered the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  This was followed by an extensive Trade Mission to the US and Mexico in June. Both of these latter markets offer many elements that are very attractive to Irish exporters.  The US is the largest food and beverage market in the world and has a population of 324 million people.  Around 35 million Americans also claim Irish ancestry.  Mexico has a population of 127 million, making it the eleventh-largest country in the world in population terms and the fifteenth-largest economy in the world, with projections that it will move into the top five by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  Later in 2017, during a Trade Mission to Japan and South Korea in November, I was accompanied by 40 representatives of the Irish food sector, as well as by experts from my Department, the CEO of Bord Bia and senior representatives from Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc. <\/p>  <p>  This was a very opportune time to bring a delegation of Ireland&rsquo;s food leaders to this part of the world, given that the EU has concluded a Free Trade Agreement with South Korea as well as concluding an Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan in December 2017. Japan and South Korea are markets of high potential for beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat exports, and so it is important that we raise the profile of Irish agri-food enterprises that already have access to these markets, and make progress in negotiating access for others.<\/p>  <p>  Following a further Trade Mission to the US and Canada in February, earlier this month I led a Trade Mission to China and Hong Kong. This was an extremely successful mission in the development of our ever-growing partnership with China. For example, being present at one of the World&rsquo;s largest food trade exhibitions in Shanghai allowed me to reinforce the positive messages about the quality and sustainability of Irish agri-food exports to Asian buyers, and I was also fortunate to secure meetings with three senior Chinese Ministers and three Vice-Ministers over the course of the week.

This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain. Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is\u00a0referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.

The creation of a National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) is one of the key provisions of the proposed Governance of the Energy Union Regulation. The plan will include trajectories for renewable energy, energy efficiency, and national emissions, as well as the measures required to achieve these trajectories. <\/p>  <p>  In October 2014 EU leaders agreed on a 2030 Framework for climate and energy, which included new EU-wide targets and policy objectives for the period between 2021 and 2030. The three targets from this framework are at least 27% share for renewable energy, at least 27% improvement in energy efficiency, and at least 40% cuts in greenhouse gas emissions (from 1990 levels). The proposed Governance of the Energy Union Regulation will underpin these commitments. The NECP will cover all five dimensions of the Energy Union, the policies and measures proposed to reach these goals and will be based on a common template to allow for comparability. The first draft is due for submission to the Commission by end 2018, with a final version due by end 2019.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Governance Regulation is the subject of an ongoing trilogue process with the European Parliament which is expected to conclude later this year. Until this point is reached, the targets, policy objectives and timelines are subject to revision.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My\u00a0Department is working closely with other Departments on the development of the plan through the structures that have been established to co-ordinate Government activity on climate change. There is a high-level steering committee on climate action, which I chair,\u00a0and a Technical Research and Modelling group which provides expert advice and support. Relevant Departments and agencies are members of these groups. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>Preparation of the plan is at an early stage but its development will be facilitated by the work already undertaken to complete the Energy White Paper, the National Mitigation Plan, and the recently published National Development Plan. The NDP in particular represents a step-change in Government commitment to climate change, with &euro;21.8 billion in funding directed to addressing the transition to a low-carbon society over the period to 2030.

Section 301 of the Act provides for the questions which shall be decided by a deciding officer. <\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.  Appeals Officers are appointed by the Minister under section 304 of the Act. <\/p>  <p>  Section 302 of the Act provides for the effective date of revised decisions. The effective date can be the date of a previous decision, the date of some new fact or evidence of a change of circumstances or a current date. <\/p>  <p>  Section 302(a) relates to situations where there is evidence that the person deliberately gave false or misleading information or deliberately concealed relevant information.
