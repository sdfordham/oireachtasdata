Statutory protection of the architectural heritage is primarily a matter for the planning authorities under Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Under the provisions of the Act, each planning authority is required, for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, to include in its development plan a Record of Protected Structures and to include in that record every structure which is, in the opinion of the planning authority, of such interest within its functional area.  This may be done at the time of the preparation of the development plan or, where appropriate, at any other time.<\/p>  <p>  Section 53(1) of the 2000 Act enables the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to make recommendations to a planning authority concerning the inclusion of specific structures in its Record of Protected Structures.  A planning authority must have regard to any such recommendations.  Ministerial recommendations are generally based on National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) surveys undertaken by my Department of the post-1700 built heritage of the country.  Such a survey for Dublin City is currently underway and, as such, I am not in a position at this stage to make recommendations on the structures referred to by the Deputy.  However, I understand generally that industrial heritage sites are being considered, in terms of their significance, in the fieldwork for the survey completed to date.

This has included intense engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission. A cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme was introduced,  comprising a payment of &euro;1,500 per annum, index-linked, for 15 years, or relocation, where feasible, to a non-designated bog together, with a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500.<\/p><p>The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan was published in January 2014. It sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. The draft plan sets out the demanding tests which must be met before turf cutting could be consented to within the provisions of the EU Habitats Directive. The final plan will clarify whether the relevant provisions of the Directive could be applicable for any particular special area of conservation and will seek to establish whether sufficient consensus can be achieved at a national level to make a successful case to the European Commission for flexibility in accordance with Article 6(4) of the Directive.<\/p><p>Final resolution of all issues in relation to the protection of Ireland's raised bog special areas of conservation will only be brought about by everyone working together, within the law, with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established with the purpose of ensuring the input from all stakeholders.<\/p><p>The <i>Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network, <\/i>published in January 2014<i>, <\/i>provides detail on future arrangements regarding turf cutting on each of the 75 current raised bog natural heritage areas.

A value for money review of child income supports, published by the Department of Social Protection in 2010, found that the participation pattern of children in education supports the 18 year age limit for child benefit.<\/p><p>For families on low incomes there are a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including:<\/p><p>- qualified child increases (QCIs) with primary social welfare payments<\/p><p>- family income supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children<\/p><p>- The back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families.<\/p><p>Therefore, I have no plans to make any changes to the age threshold for child benefit.  <\/p><p>Budget 2015 increased child benefit by &euro;5, from &euro;130 to &euro;135 per month or &euro;60 per annum. In addition, the new Back to Work Family Dividend for long-term unemployed jobseekers with children and One Parent Family Payment recipients will enable these families to retain the child-related portion of their social welfare payment on a tapered basis over two years.<\/p><p>These measures recognise the sacrifices that families made during the economic crisis and their continuing difficulties. They are in line with the commitment in the <i>Statement of Government Priorities<\/i>for a new deal on living standards for hard-pressed families. Strategically, the measures will increase the pace of the progress in helping people back to work, boost the recovery, reduce welfare expenditure in the long-run, and, most importantly, help the families in question to build a better financial future for themselves<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100066#WRB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100066#WRB04100"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[10650\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100066#WRB04200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the outcome of her officials' discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on a pension plan for community employment supervisors; when they will report back, which they had previously indicated would be by January 2015; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>Community Employment Supervisors are employed by sponsors in the community and voluntary sector.

The Committee has concluded its deliberations and has given me and the Governor of the Central Bank a copy of the report. As noted in the report, the full implications of a mortgage insurance scheme can only be examined once the new Central Bank macro prudential regulations for residential mortgage lending are in place and the effects they have on mortgage lending can be examined. As the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank also considered the issue of mortgage insurance in the context of the new macro prudential framework and it concluded that an exception for suitably insured mortgages was not an effective practical amendment at this time.<\/p>  <p>  An overriding primary public policy concern is to deliver an affordable and sustainable housing and credit market over the course of the economic cycle and the avoidance of boom and bust cycles which we have experienced in the recent past. The new Central Bank macro prudential measures are intended to help achieve that objective. Mortgage insurance could have a contributory role to play in the achievement of that objective at a future point. However, as suggested by the Central Bank, it is likely to have such a role only if it effectively transfers risk away from the banking system and from the State in a cost effective way. This is a matter, therefore, that will need to be kept under review by my Department and by the Central Bank.

While the figures submitted by the Deputy are accurate, it is important to understand that PAYE workers and the self-employed are taxed in different ways to reflect their differing circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, employees in the PAYE system benefit from a PAYE income tax credit worth &euro;1,650 per annum, to which the self-assessed are not entitled. The PAYE allowance, as it was then, was introduced in 1980 to improve the tax progression of PAYE taxpayers and to take account of the fact that the self-employed generally then had the advantage of paying tax on a preceding year basis. The argument was also made at the time that the general scheme of allowances for expenses discriminated against employees and in favour of other taxpayers. <\/p>  <p>  There have been some changes since 1980. For example, the self-employed now pay tax on a current year basis. In addition, the PAYE allowance has become a tax credit. However, there are other aspects to how the self-assessed are taxed which can be beneficial to them. For instance, there are significant timing benefits, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer, which are available to the self-assessed but which are not available to PAYE workers. In addition, the expenses regime for self-assessed taxpayers remains somewhat more liberal than that afforded to employees and therefore the self-employed can actually pay less tax when compared to a PAYE worker on the same income.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, I am of the view that the tax position should be standardised for PAYE workers and for the self-employed, bearing in mind the\u00a0need to encourage enterprise. I have stated that the position will be kept under review such that policy change can be considered when resources allow. <\/p>  <p>  Turning to PRSI, it is true that employees are exempt from the charge to PRSI if their income does not exceed &euro;18,304. However, once PAYE income exceeds this threshold they are liable to pay PRSI on the full amount at 4%, thus equalising the treatment of personal PRSI contributions, on all of the income, for PAYE and self-assessed workers on incomes above that level. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of employees, their employers are required to pay a PRSI charge in respect of each employee. Thus the contribution made to the Social Insurance Fund in respect of employees is usually higher than that made by a self-assessed individual. For instance, at an income level of &euro;100,000, an employer would typically be required to pay PRSI of &euro;10,750 in respect of the employee, in addition to the &euro;4,000 payable by the employee. Total PRSI of &euro;4,000 is payable in respect of a self-employed individual with the same income. Entitlement to social welfare benefits is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. However, it is worth pointing out that for individuals with incomes in excess of &euro;18,304 the total PRSI payable in respect of an employee is 14.75% of salary, while the total payable by a self-employed individual is 4%.<\/p>  <p>  I must\u00a0reject the charge that the income tax system is regressive. A progressive taxation system means that those on higher incomes pay proportionately higher rates of tax on their income than those on lower incomes. This is clearly the case in Ireland and is widely acknowledged to be so. The European Commission compares progressivity of taxation by taking the OECD tax wedge for an individual earning 167% of the average wage and dividing it by the tax wedge for an individual earning 67% of the average wage. On a rating system where less than 100 is regressive and above 100 is progressive, most EU countries have a progressivity rate of between 120 and 140. Ireland, in comparison, has a progressivity rate of 183, making it considerably more progressive than any other EU member of the OECD.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that the changes to the Income Tax system introduced in Budget 2015\u00a0benefit all those who pay income tax and\/or USC equally, regardless of whether they are PAYE or self-assessed taxpayers. These measures are the first stage of a three year plan to reduce the income tax burden on low and middle income earners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100067#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Private Partnerships Data","counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100067#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[10672\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100067#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in respect of the total general Government contingent liabilities and non-performing loans in European Union member states in 2013, as reported by EUROSTAT on 10 February 2015, if he will provide a breakdown for Ireland  of the outstanding liabilities related to off-balance public-private partnerships liabilities of Government controlled entities classified outside general government and non-performing loans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":165,"content":"<p>The Enhanced Economic Governance package (the so-called &quot;six pack&quot; composed of five Regulations and one Directive) was adopted by the European Parliament and Council in November 2011.

The details, which are outlined below, were set out at that time by the (then) Chair of the Authority to the (then) Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Chair also subsequently appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business on 25 October 2006 on this (and other) matters. Numerous measures were immediately put in place in the Authority to ensure the same thing would not be repeated. Since its establishment in 2002 as an independent statutory Agency, this has been the only merger whereby the Authority missed the statutory deadline to make a determination.<\/p>  <p>  A notification was made to the Competition Authority on 12 July 2006 pursuant to Section 19 of the Competition Act 2002 (&ldquo;the Act&rdquo;). Under Section 21 (2) of the Act, the Authority had one month within which to make a determination. The Authority commenced its investigation and, on 11 August 2006, it requested further information from the parties as provided for in Section 20 (2) of the Act. The making of such a request had the effect of restarting the one month determination deadline from the date on which the information requested was furnished by the parties. Further information was supplied on 25 August 2006 thereby changing the one month deadline to 25   September 2006.<\/p>  <p>  Following a further examination of all of the information received, the Authority advised the parties that it had competition concerns in relation to some specific aspects of the proposed acquisition. On 22 September 2006, Topaz furnished the Authority with proposals to address those concerns, a facility provided for in Section 20 (3) of the Act. Section 21 (4) of the Act provided that where proposals are submitted, the one month deadline is automatically increased to 45 days. It was at this point that the miscalculation occurred and 10 October 2006 was erroneously calculated as the new deadline rather than 9 October 2006. This happened as a result of the case team who were conducting the merger review adding 15 days to the one month deadline rather than recalculating 45 days from the revised start date of the investigation. The one month period (25 August to 25 September) had 31 days and so by adding 15 additional days, the new deadline was of 46 days duration rather than the statutory provision of 45 days. The issue came to light on 10 October 2006 and the Authority issued a press statement on the matter. After this event, the Authority continued to work with Topaz with a view to removing the competition concerns that had been raised during the comprehensive review of the merger. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100067#WRC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":184,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100067#WRC03500"},{"type":"question","counter":185,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[10622\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100067#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the Construction Contracts Act 2013; the actions he will take regarding the matter; the progress being made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":186,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to the earliest possible implementation of the Construction Contracts Act, 2013 and, as a consequence, approved the delegation of responsibility for its implementation to my colleague, the Minister of State for Business and Employment, Mr. Gerald Nash T.D., last November.

Applicants under the 2015 National Reserve also have the flexibility of choosing either the 2013 or 2014 tax year, whichever is more advantageous.<\/p>  <p>  Applicants must comply with all eligibility criteria including off farm income criteria in order to be deemed eligible to qualify for an allocation of entitlements under the National Reserve. By increasing the off-farm income limit and granting a choice of reference years, I have granted the maximum possible flexibility regarding income limits for the National Reserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100067#WRC04300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100067#WRC04400"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[10603\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100067#WRC04500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a payment under the disadvantaged areas scheme and the agri-environment options scheme will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>A review of the land parcels declared by the person named under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme \/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme revealed that several of the land parcels declared by the person named contained ineligible features.

Commissioner General Krahenbuhl visited Brussels last week to meet with senior representatives of the EU, including representatives of Member States, and to share his concerns about the plight of vulnerable Palestinian refugees and the need for a political engagement to address their situation.<\/p>  <p>  One of the big challenges for the reconstruction of Gaza is that much of the money committed at the Cairo Conference on Reconstruction has not yet materialized. I was pleased to announce funding of &euro;4.7 million for UNRWA and the UN&rsquo;s Emergency Response Fund in the course of my visit. <\/p>  <p>  As for the reconstruction effort so far, in a briefing to the UN Security Council on 18 February, the UN Under Secretary General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman reported that the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism is providing a measure of hope that genuine progress can be achieved. He said that the GRM is functioning and delivering concrete results, citing statistics including the more than 47,000 individuals who have already procured construction material. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has consistently and repeatedly called for the lifting of the blockade of Gaza. In my address to the major international conference on Gaza reconstruction held in Cairo on 12 October 2014, I said:<\/p>  <p>  &ldquo;The process begun in the 26 August ceasefire must continue, and both sides must work with the Egyptian mediators to address the underlying issues and find a new path in Gaza. This must mean an end to attacks from Gaza on Israel, but also an end to the unjust blockade which has endured now for seven years. This should begin with a real opening of supplies of materials needed for reconstruction, including of essential infrastructure such as water, sewage and power. Every effort must be made to ensure that humanitarian goods and personnel are guaranteed safe and unimpeded access to Gaza. But it must then continue to the end of senseless restrictions on ordinary economic and human life. The only way to reduce support for militarism among people in Gaza is to allow them to work and export their produce, to find jobs, to feel part of the wider Palestinian people and the wider world.&rdquo;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100068#WRD08500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Communications","counter":324,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100068#WRD08600"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[10693\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100068#WRD08700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps that have been taken to publicise the advice his Department published in June 2014 advising Irish citizens, and businesses, regarding involvement in financial and economic activities in Israeli settlements; and if representations been made to the private sector to ensure the advice is being made known.","asker":"1037","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":326,"content":"<p>On 3 July 2014, my Department published advice to Irish citizens and business on financial and economic activities in Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.

In 2013, 7.8% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy. <\/p>  <p>  Policies and schemes are in place to incentivise the use of renewable energy. The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies. The total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid is 2500 MW of which around 2,200 MW is wind.

There could also be penalties associated with any shortfall. <\/p>  <p>  Any shortfall in terms of targets for Green House Gas emissions would be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government. <\/p>  <p>  Analysis underpinning the Draft Bioenergy Plan, published in October last year, indicates that an additional bioenergy focussed measure in the heat sector would represent the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals including reducing the potential shortfall in our renewable heat levels. The draft Plan recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive to incentivise larger heat users in the industrial and commercial sector to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. The first consultation on the development of this scheme will be published by my Department shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100070#WRF00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nuclear Plants","counter":421,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100070#WRF00600"},{"type":"question","counter":422,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[10739\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100070#WRF00700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on the use of nuclear energy here; the amount of imported electricity currently generated by nuclear power; and the amount which will be generated and imported by Ireland by 2025.","asker":"1190","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":423,"content":"<p>The 2014 Green Paper on Energy Policy covers a broad range of energy issues, including an exploration of all possible fuel options, for securing a balanced, sustainable and secure energy mix. It is in this context that the current discussions on Ireland's future energy policy and fuel mix are taking place.<\/p>  <p>  The use of nuclear fission for the generation of nuclear power is statutorily prohibited by the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act, 2006 which prohibits the authorisation of development consisting of an installation for the generation of electricity by nuclear fission. The Electricity Regulation Act 1999 also makes similar provision in respect of regulatory authorisations. It is important to note that there are no plans to change the existing legislation in order to allow nuclear power in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The statutory prohibitions on nuclear do not prevent the importation of electricity generated by nuclear energy from other countries. It is the case that nuclear generation forms part of the overall UK generation fuel mix. The Lisbon Treaty legally provides for individual Member States to determine their own energy mix. Ireland takes the view that nuclear power plants, wherever located, must comply fully with all relevant conventions and legal provisions in regard to health, safety standards, environmental impact and economic justification. Ireland imports electricity from Britain via the East West Interconnector (EWIC). Ireland can also import electricity from Northern Ireland, which is in turn linked to the UK electricity market via the Moyle Interconnector. <\/p>  <p>It is not technically feasible to distinguish the flow of electricity across interconnectors by reference to the original source of supply or generation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100070#WRF00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":425,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100070#WRF01000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Signage","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100070#WRF00900"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[10623\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100070#WRF01000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will report on the renaming of the N2 and N3 national primary routes at their point of intersection at Doyle&rsquo;s Corner Phibsborough, Dublin 7; in addition, the re-naming of the N2 as the R135 and the N3 as the R147 where they intersect, the other traffic calming or other steps that were instituted in February 2012, the day of the re-naming, or since to mitigate the effect of the convergence of N2 and N3 traffic at Doyle&rsquo;s Corner, a Victorian crossroads in a residential area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":426,"content":"<p>Section 10 of the Roads Act 1993 as amended by the Roads Act 2007 provides for the Classification of National, Regional and Local Roads.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the 2011 Roads Classification review, a part of the Old National Route 2 (between its junction with R132 at Dorset Street Upper in the city of Dublin and its junction with M50 at Balseskin in the county of Fingal) was re-classified as the R135 while a part of the Old National Route 3 (between its junction with R135 at Phibsborough Road in the city of Dublin and its junction with R102 at River Road in the county of Fingal) was re-classified as the R147).

Culture Ireland recognises the significance of culture and the importance of cultural identity for our many emigrants. Culture Ireland, in promoting Irish artists abroad, places a special focus on key territories and areas where there is a strong Irish diaspora and interest in Irish culture. Events supported by Culture Ireland offer an important opportunity to engage with members of the diaspora and assist them in maintaining their cultural ties to Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Many of the presenters who seek Culture Ireland support to promote Irish arts events worldwide are members of the diaspora, who have created annual arts events in key territories worldwide, including Irish film and music festivals. Indeed, the work of the diaspora has served to generate new audiences and new interest in Irish arts, extending beyond those with Irish connections. <\/p>  <p>  Culture Ireland also supports an annual programme of events in Irish centres abroad, including partner organisations such as the Irish Arts Centre, NY, Centre Culturel Irlandais, Paris, and the London Irish Centre. All these centres have a strong Irish diaspora membership, which can engage in an ongoing programme of contemporary arts from Ireland through Culture Ireland's input. <\/p>  <p>  The St Patrick&rsquo;s Day period is recognised as the main focus period to connect with the diaspora through cultural events. Culture Ireland supports a significant Irish cultural programme each year globally, with highlights in areas where there is a significant diaspora such as London, New York, Sydney and Shanghai. Locally, the diaspora work with Culture Ireland to maximise the impact of the events around this period to celebrate and highlight our artistic strengths and build on Ireland's global reputation as a country of creativity.<\/p>  <p>  This year, the international culture programme for the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day period will see funding in excess of &euro;200,000 supporting more than 50 events taking place in 22 countries. The St Patrick&rsquo;s Day period offers a unique platform to highlight the strength of Ireland&rsquo;s creative sector, and foster tourism and inward investment. It presents Ireland with an unrivalled opportunity to showcase our culture and our talented artists globally. It is a key opportunity to put the spotlight on the best of our culture, and to allow new audiences and the diaspora to see, hear and experience Irish artists first-hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100070#WRF05700","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":473,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100070#WRF05800"},{"type":"question","counter":474,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[10723\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031100070#WRF05900","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the degree to which various aspects of the Habitats Directive will be re-examined, with a view to ensuring that it is not unfairly, and unnecessarily, impacting on landowners, who depend on agriculture for their living; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":475,"content":"<p>I am advised that it is not within the competence of Member States to re-examine legislation enacted by the EU.
