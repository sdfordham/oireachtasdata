I first congratulate the Chairman on his appointment and wish every success to the members of the committee.  We worked closely with the Chairman's predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, and we wish him well in his new role.  We obviously look forward to a positive interaction with this joint committee, as well as engagement on all agricultural issues.<\/p> <p>  On farm income pressures, difficulties undoubtedly have been experienced in many sectors in Ireland throughout 2016 through a combination of a number of factors involving low product prices, a bad spring and negative political events.  Families are under severe pressure as cashflow tightens as the autumn approaches.  In addition, the vote by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union has created much uncertainty.  For Ireland as a whole, for Irish agriculture and for the agrifood sector in particular, with 40% of our agrifood exports going to the United Kingdom and a shared land Border, the implications of their decision will affect us greatly.  No one is underestimating the major challenge that Brexit presents for the agrifood sector but at the outset, I wish to highlight farmers' anger at the behaviour of meat factories in the weeks following the vote in over-hyping the Brexit result in an effort to push down their prices and to create panic in the trade.  This was not reflective of the strong market conditions for finished cattle that existed at the time and which continue to exist in the UK market.  Moreover, further evidence of this behaviour by the factories was to be seen this week.  At a time of political uncertainty and in advance of formal negotiations, the IFA&rsquo;s focus is on highlighting the key issues and on identifying the best means by which these can be addressed.<\/p> <p>  This brings me to budget 2017 and the farm schemes and in this context, the Government must use budget 2017 to take funding and taxation decisions to alleviate the farm income difficulties being experienced and to underpin the longer-term development of the sector.  The IFA is clear that having experienced a reduction in funding to the agriculture budget of almost 40% during the downturn, there must be an increase in funding in this year&rsquo;s budget for important farm schemes.  These schemes are vital in supporting farm incomes and economic output on lower-income farms in particular, as well as in supporting important capital investment across all farming sectors.  A viable agriculture sector is critical to the strength of rural Ireland and the rural economy.  It contributes to employment across the country and underpins our agrifood exports, which have grown by almost 60% since 2009 and are likely to exceed &euro;11 billion in 2016.<\/p> <p>  Our expenditure priorities for the farm schemes in budget 2017 are: the funding of &euro;250 million for the agri-environmental schemes, with full payments for all green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, and organic scheme participants; the introduction of the targeted sheep scheme of &euro;25 million with minimal costs and bureaucracy on farmers to maximise its benefits; additional funding for the areas of natural constraint, ANCs, to reach &euro;225 million, thereby commencing the process of restoring ANC payments to the position in 2008 before the cuts; the immediate reopening of the beef data and genomic programme to new participants with additional funding of &euro;25 million to increase support for the very important suckler cow herd; and a funding allocation of &euro;50 million to the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS II, to meet the demand across all farming sectors for on-farm investment.<\/p><p> In addition, farm assist is a vitally important scheme for low-income farm families, particularly in a year like 2016.  The IFA recognises the commitment to a review of farm assist in the programme for Government.  To that end, the income and child disregards that were fully abolished in recent years must be reinstated in this year&rsquo;s budget.<\/p><p> As regards taxation, budget 2017 also provides the opportunity to address ongoing challenges in farming through the taxation system.  Everyone is clear that income volatility is a real challenge.  The barriers preventing more farmers from using income averaging must be removed as a priority.  In addition, a more targeted and individualised volatility scheme is required.   The IFA is proposing to maximise the number of farmers using income averaging; the current restrictions on eligibility where the farmer&rsquo;s spouse is in self-employment must be removed.  Also, the income averaging system must be adjusted to allow a farmer on averaging, in a year when income falls significantly, to pay the tax due for a single year only.  The deferred tax would then be carried forward and paid over a three-year period.  This flexibility could assist greatly with cashflow pressures.<\/p><p> Last October&rsquo;s budget finally saw the first steps in removing discrimination against the self-employed in the income tax system with the introduction of the earned income tax credit.  We recognise the commitment in the programme for Government to increasing this to match the PAYE credit by 2018. However, it is vitally important that the Government equalise those credits fully by 2017, which means bringing forward the two-thirds into this budget.  This would give a direct cashflow boost to farmers and other self-employed people.<\/p><p> I will now discuss Brexit taxation measures.  The weakening of sterling in the aftermath of the vote by the UK to leave the EU has had a negative impact on the competitiveness of Irish agri-food exports into the UK market, and for products competing with UK imports at home.  The more labour-intensive sectors in agriculture are seriously affected by the impact on prices arising from exchange rate volatility.  Those particularly affected in the short run are the domestic horticulture sector and our mushroom industry, almost all of whose &euro;120 million of exports are destined for the UK market.  It is critical that action be taken in budget 2017 to offset this negative impact and maintain cost competitiveness.  In this context, IFA proposes that the lower rate of employer PRSI should be temporarily reduced in order to reduce employment costs for export-dependent SMEs in all sectors.  <\/p><p> There must be no increase in excise rates for marked gas oil - that is, agricultural diesel.  In addition, given the importance of maintaining competitiveness, we would have to question any move by the Government to increase excise rates on other road fuels at this time.<\/p><p> I will now deal with access to credit, including low-cost cashflow funding.  Farm income difficulties are being compounded by a clear market failure in the Irish financial sector.  The lack of competition and flexibility within the banking sector is affecting farmers&rsquo; ability to secure finance at reasonable rates.  Extending merchant credit to deal with cashflow pressures is a high-cost and inefficient way of dealing with short-term farm financing.  The IFA has clearly identified that the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine must deliver, without any further delay, alternative sources of lower-cost long- and short-term funding for farm enterprises.  The &euro;11.1 million funding allocation for dairy and other livestock farmers agreed by the EU in July must be matched by national funding to bring the total package value to &euro;22.2 million.  This must then be used to help farmers with their cashflow difficulties.<\/p><p> In the grain sector we have seen income losses of &euro;100 million this year, as they endure their fourth successive year of losses.<\/p><p>Up to 75% of crops in the north west have yet to be harvested.  The Minister must deliver a European aid package for tillage farmers and the sector, which has been so badly affected this year.  The Minister must also not lose sight of the need to allow farmers in all sectors to convert their accumulated merchant credit, utility, superlevy and other bills into low-cost, short-term loans.  This type of loan package, based on the &euro;15,000 state aid <i>de minimus<\/i>rule, was proposed by the IFA earlier this summer.  While the response from the Minister has been positive, the time for delivery is now.  The July agreement of the EU Council of Ministers confirmed that member states may make advance payments of 70% of the basic payments scheme and 85% of rural development payments on 16 October.  This will help farmers in a very difficult year.  All payments for farm schemes must be made on time and in line with the deadlines set down in the Farmers' Charter of Rights 2015-2020.  This is particularly important in a year when farm cashflow is under stress.<br\/><br\/>High input costs are also a challenge to viable farms.  The Government must take a strong stance at EU level to support the IFA campaign to remove the tariffs and duties on EU fertiliser imports.  This would deliver between &euro;50 million and &euro;70 million for Irish farmers.  The fertiliser issue is of particular importance for to tillage farmers who, through a combination of low prices and yield, are facing an income drop of up to &euro;100 million this season.  Additional support measures that must be delivered for the tillage sector include increased GLAS payments, increased coupled funding to support the expansion of the protein crop and the delivery of funding for the TAMS investment programme.  In addition, there is an urgent need to develop a national certification scheme to promote Irish grain and its maximum use.  What is needed to drive this agenda is to get all stakeholders around the table through the establishment of a national grain forum led by the Minister, Deputy Creed.  I call on him to act on that immediately.<br\/><br\/>A combination of market factors and political decisions have contributed to create a difficult income situation on almost all farms in Ireland this year.  Urgent action and support from all stakeholders in the agrifood industry is required.  I urge the committee to support the proposals we have outlined to tackle the income challenge at farm level across a number of fronts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>A number of members are indicating.

In terms of the different pressures that are out there, what is Mr. Healy's recommendation as to how the funding should be spread across the different sectors?  There are particular difficulties for dairy, which has had a very bad year.  Beef is under pressure as is grain, in particular over the last few weeks in the northern part of the country.  In that regard, I thank Mr. Healy and acknowledge the fact that he visited Donegal recently.  The north west is particularly affected.

In regard to the &euro;250 million in GLAS expenditure the Department has highlighted, some 50,000 farmers are being targeted.  Given that the average payment is well below the &euro;5,000 per farmer which was indicated when the scheme was first introduced, is Mr. Healy making the case for extra farmers to be allowed into GLAS on the basis that their inclusion would not break the &euro;250 million ceiling?  This is important.  If we got up to a figure of 58,000 farmers, this would mean everybody who wants to be facilitated under GLAS can be facilitated.  I would be glad to hear Mr. Healy's views.<\/p> <p>  I note what Mr. Healy said in respect of farm assist.  This is a busy area for me in terms of dealing with farmers locally in Donegal.  There is an issue with regard to farmers who work part-time and have an off-farm incomes, and who may be able to avail of jobseeker's benefit when they have periods of off-farm unemployment.  They need a certain number of payments in order to make claims and they must also have a subsidiary income of less than &euro;12.70 per day, which is very low.  This means that a person with a farm income of over &euro;4,600 a year cannot claim jobseeker's benefit.  I have been lobbying to have this increased to approximately &euro;25 a day, which would make a huge difference and would not be a significant cost to the Department of Social Protection.  Is this something the IFA has come across in the rest of the country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#J00200","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1473774000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I am glad to see the IFA is now on board in regard to the beef genomics scheme because it was certainly a very reticent participant 12 months ago when mine was a lone voice in ensuring that people would not be misled in terms of their participation.  Mr. Healy might not be aware of this but some of his predecessors were, shall we say, reluctant participants.  Coming from the midlands, I want to stress how important it is that no one is misled.  How many more farmers does Mr. Healy believe will participate in the scheme?  Is it the aim of the IFA to get back up to the full &euro;52 million that was allocated?<\/p> <p>  I can see the input of Liam Dunne into this paper.  I want to support him in regard to the point that the most important thing for grain farmers is to succeed at European level, although there seem to be all sorts of obstacles in that regard.  I took that on board last February following his advice.  If the IFA can get that &euro;50 million or &euro;60 million back, it would mean a huge input cost reduction and would improve stability, particularly in the current context where grain crops have been hit by low yields, high costs and now cannot even be got out of the ground.<\/p> <p>  The targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, has not gone like clockwork, as we might have anticipated, and technology difficulties within the Department are one excuse.  Has any progress been made in that regard and what is the current position?<\/p> <p>  I unequivocally support bringing the self-employed up to ordinary PAYE equivalent status and I believe it is high time equivalent credits were granted.  What worries me is that we now see some of the tax strategy groups indicating they will wipe out some of those credits.  If that happens, we will be further back than ever.<\/p> <p>  There is another issue that is probably in Liam Dunne's area.  I have read in recent days of possible proposals to increase the price of green diesel and auto diesel, as an environmental measure, in order to bring it up to the price of petrol.  Would that not be a retrograde step?  It seems to be a case of tax strategy evaluation but it would probably send the entire sector into a tailspin at a critical time.  We will have to keep a tight focus on these issues in terms of the negative impact they would have on the profitability of sectors in the industry that are already experiencing difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#J00300","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1473774000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation.  The IFA does tremendous work in supporting farmers across the country.  I note an allocation of &euro;50 million towards targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, but many farmers find it difficult to get the existing allocation.  Many have been approved for slatted houses and so on only for the specifications to be changed and their approvals withdrawn.  There is all kinds of messing going on.  Naturally, it is important to seek additional money for TAMS, but farmers should get the existing allocation more quickly.  Accelerating the process is vital but has not been done, which has disappointed many farmers the length and breadth of the country.<\/p> <p>  Regarding areas of natural constraint, ANCs, I come from the west where there is poorer, marginal land and farmers are on smaller holdings.  It is vital that there be a recognition that ANCs must be prioritised in the next number of budgets.  Mr. Healy was in north Leitrim and Donegal in recent weeks and would have seen for himself that people were barely surviving.  The kind of land that they are working on puts them at a significant disadvantage.

This was despite commitments made by the Minister or in the farmer's charter.  What is the current state of play and what proposals has the IFA on making the system work more efficiently and bypassing bureaucracy?<\/p> <p>  The second issue relates to the problems experienced by grain growers.  Perhaps Mr. Dunne will elaborate.  I spoke with the IFA chairman in Donegal yesterday.  He appreciated that Mr. Healy had visited the county.

At a more local level with a narrower scale for competition in the south-east area, taking in the premium cattle of steers and heifers falling into the Meat Industry Ireland spec, one is talking about a portion at 44% of the kill.

We will forward a copy of the report to the committee.  There is much in it.  The key issue in it was that this proposed deal, if it goes through, will weaken competition in a market that is already characterised by very weak competition.  That is a key finding in the report.<\/p> <p>  There was mention of the 50,000 farmers in the GLAS scheme and 5,000 extra farmers.  We want the money to go to farmers and there should be no money left in the pot.  It is similar to the beef genomics scheme.  The average payment is approximately &euro;4,200 and with the 5,000 extra, it would take the &euro;250 million.  To get to the &euro;250 million would require more than 50,000 farmers, and there are more than 50,000 farmers who would join it.  The key for us is to get that money into rural Ireland and out to farmers.  If the average payment stays at &euro;4,200, the number of farmers participating would increase.  The Minister spoke at our national council meeting and he was adamant that the money would be spent.  He said that was all he would say but he indicated it would be spent on the genomics scheme.  There are enough farmers willing to join and draw it down.  It is difficult to change the rules mid-stream given that other farmers would have joined under existing rules.<\/p> <p>  It is incredible there is a proposal to bring up green diesel.

It is a job of work for us all to ensure that the key areas are kept in the scheme.  I attended a county executive meeting the other night.  It examined the ANC money and said it is the one payment we get out of which there is nothing taken back.  There are no planners or veterinary fees, so they want that to be retained.<\/p><p> A key point for this year is that all payments are made on time.  There is an argument to be made that the first tranche of the basic payment scheme should be paid in full to everyone because the second tranche is more than adequate to cover the penalties.  It is important, in a year such as this one, to keep in mind that the first tranche should be paid out.<\/p><p> If the Chairman agrees, I will hand over first to Se&aacute;n O'Leary, who will answer some of the dairy questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The questions posed by Deputies Cahill and McConalogue are similar in terms of our proposals to deal with the cashflow crisis on dairy farms, in particular.  Since last March, it has been within the remit of our own department to make an exceptional exemption regarding state aid.  It was announced from Brussels that up to &euro;15,000 of state aid per dairy farmer could be made available for a period of three years; there was a three year exemption on that.  At that stage, we put forward proposals by which we felt the Department could make low cost loans available to farmers.  Members may recall there were a number of issues at the time, including the overhang superlevy payment and the merchant credit building up on farms.  Those options have been available since last March.  In discussions with the Department on the previous superlevy scheme, that money was sourced at 1% and made available to farmers.  In light of the current crisis, which has continued over the past year, there is a responsibility to deal with that issue through that state aid exemption.  The Commissioner, while refusing to move on the postponement of the superlevy repayment, said it was open to each member state to incorporate that into that state aid exemption.  That opportunity still exists.  The Minister and the Department officials have said they are looking at it.  The message we have been sending out is that as those merchant credit bills fall due for repayment and as taxation bills start to hit this autumn, the time for that cashflow relief is now.  That is one specific proposal.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the question on how the &euro;11.1 million should be disbursed, that funding has to be matched, as the previous scheme last September was announced and matched.  As dairy farmers, we would like to see now, as then, that money paid out directly to dairy farmers but, unfortunately, in this particular case, there are a number of obstacles to that.  First, it is not allowed to do that specifically for dairy farmers.  This aid is open to all livestock farmers and we must take cognisance of that.<\/p><p> The other issue is that it is a conditional scheme and must meet a number of criteria in order to qualify.  In examining the scheme, we assessed how the money could best be made available across all sectors and used to best effect, rather than having a piecemeal amount of money spread over a number of schemes.  The Department has indicated a willingness to look at how this money could be used to make cashflow loans available to farmers.  We have endorsed that idea.  Unfortunately, at this stage no meat has been put on the bones in terms of how the Department proposes to proceed.  We will certainly be meeting its representatives in the coming weeks.  A decision on how the money is to be used must be made by mid-November.<\/p><p> The overriding issue on farms is how farmers will be able to extricate themselves from a situation that has arisen, through no fault of their own, in the midst of an expansion programme and major volatility caused, by and large, by political decisions.  Dealing with that particular issue will be the number one priority.<\/p><p> On the question of a cap or otherwise on whatever might arise, the latest information we have from ICOS is that, by and large, one is currently looking at merchant credit bills in the region of &euro;30,000.  We are dealing with that issue in the midst of an expansion programme.  We have finally seen a halt to the downturn with milk prices starting to rise.  However, we have to deal with the overhanging debt on dairy farmers, particularly younger expanding farmers.  We cannot walk away from it.  There is an issue of cost to finance and the availability of finance.  It comes back to the question of one's ability to repay.  <\/p><p> We have seen the Glanbia MilkFlex product come onto the market and the security is based on a commitment on repayment from milk cheques and milk accounts.  Our own pillar banks will have to stand up and meet some of that demand and match what is out there. <\/p><p> The problem, however, is that we have a lack of competition, as identified by the president.  When that State aid and relief is available we have to take advantage of it.  We cannot walk away from our responsibilities in that regard.  The Minister has to make announcements on this in the coming weeks.  The discussion process has been going on for six months or more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>The grain issue was highlighted by members of the committee.

Some 20 years ago we were getting approximately &pound;140 per tonne for barley, which is the biggest crop in the country.  I am meeting Glanbia in the morning and we will try to get it off the &euro;115 per tonne and up, if we could, to close to &euro;130.  It will not be easy.  Of course there are greater efficiencies now than there were before.  We are more mechanised but these things cost money and involve a great deal of investment.<\/p> <p>  In 2016, almost every tonne of grain produced in the country will be paid for at a price which is below the cost of production.  We estimate that a tonne of barley will cost about &euro;135 per tonne to produce, but we will be paid less than that for it.  We have to make up that difference, which can only come from our direct payment from Brussels.  That means that a farmer would have been better off staying in bed at the beginning of the season because he will get the direct payment in any event if he tops weeds in the ground.   It is not in our nature to do that, however.<\/p> <p>  This is the fourth year in a row that prices have been bad.  They were bad up until now but this year they have actually dropped below the cost of production, so we are in a serious situation.  The biggest problem is that Europe has a policy of no tariffs on grain being traded internationally.  This means that if the Russians want to export grain here, they can do so and there is no problem.<\/p><p>If the Australians or Argentinians want to, there are no tariffs at the port and there are no restrictions on quality.  There are trading standards but there are no regulations on other admixtures.<br\/><br\/>We recently visited boats that came into the ports.  The samples we found were very serious and made us very angry because they were below the quality standards at which we grow our barley.  On top of that, we found evidence, which I think one will see in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>this week from Andy Doyle, of seeds coming into the country that are not native to this country.  Weed seeds are coming in that could have a devastating effect on our farming.  We are very worried about it.  As a result of an open trading system and because we are not making any money, there is a serious danger that the country will have to look for more imports of grain in future, not fewer.  We will not be able to produce it.  We cannot keep going as we are.  It is all very well to say, &quot;There is a farmer with a big tractor and a big combine harvester.&quot;  Those things cost a lot of money.  He has to have a lot of acres to put them over to make them pay and probably has to do work for other neighbours who maybe used to have a machine but do not have one anymore.  There is also the weather window, which is always small in this country.  One has to get a lot of work done as quickly as possible.  We should not be prepared, as a country, to accept that we can import grain when and if we want.  We will not have any control over the quality of it and we would not have any control over the price, not that we have much at the moment.<br\/><br\/>The second biggest issue we have is our interest rates compared with our European counterparts.  Tillage farmers in France, Belgium and Germany are looking at 1%, 1.5% or 1.8% interest per year.  We are looking at anything from 6.5% up to 8.5%.  I am reasonably well financed; I have managed to get there.  I do not have any difficulties with my bank but there is no negotiating with them this year.  They just said that is the interest rate, take it or leave it.  They did not care.  I cannot afford that.  It is all of our costs right across the board.  If a French farmer gets &euro;130 per tonne, he probably has a margin on it of a couple of euro per tonne.  We do not have any.  That is how big the crisis is with us.  We are looking at the possible termination or at least a collapse of the industry within the island.  I am asking all members of the committee to take the issue very seriously.  We need help and we need it as quickly as possible.<br\/><br\/>Tillage farmers were specifically excluded from the aid package that came in from Brussels earlier in the year.  We are not allowed to participate in it.  We are reliant upon the committee members to support us.  It is possible for national funds to be used.  We are asking for the committee's support in that.  We need it very badly.<br\/><br\/>There is also the issue of fertiliser which is the single biggest cost we have.  There are tariffs on fertiliser coming in from outside Europe.  There are many manufacturers who would bring down the price of fertiliser if they could.  Our campaign has succeeded in bringing fertiliser prices down but only to some extent and on a voluntary basis.  The manufacturers know that politically they are under severe pressure in Europe because of our campaign.  It has been quite successful in that regard.  As soon as we stop the pressure we know the fertiliser prices will go back up.  The only hope we have is that our Minister, along with the Council of Ministers and the Commissioners, will take away the tariffs on imported fertiliser.  Nitrogen fertiliser is a manufactured product that is manufactured from natural gas.  Phosphates and potash are different; they are mined out of the ground.  There is no money left in the system at the moment for reinvestment.  It is quite the opposite.  There is certain evidence coming to light at the moment that a number of the larger growers that have big machines are bringing them back to the UK to try to sell them second-hand on the market there.<\/p><p>The situation is in serious decline.  The weather is making it worse.  We spent yesterday and today trying to get some extra combine harvesters to Donegal.  That is not easy to do.  One cannot wheel a combine out on to the road and head off to Donegal.  The ground conditions are poor in Donegal too, so we cannot bring any large machinery there.  Fields there would not tend to be as big as they might be further south and in the east.  The situation is difficult for those farmers but there is still grain, up to 30% of the harvest, to be cut in many parts of the country.  South Wexford and some parts of Cork are in a bad way.  Galway and Roscommon are also in poor condition.  There is grain in north Meath still to be harvested.  It was a late spring and many crops were not sown until late.  We are concerned about the ground conditions at the moment.<\/p><p> We also cannot afford extra costs such as the price of diesel going up.  The reductions over the year were welcome but costs are increasing again.  There is nothing left in our pockets.  Any resilience that farmers had over recent years is gone.  There are no reserves left.<\/p><p> The targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, grant for mechanisation would be a help.  Some people would probably manage to put something together if they could.  There will not be any capital for farmers in the next couple of years to purchase anything without aid.  The TAMS grant for tillage farmers has not come to fruition yet.  We were hoping it would be open in June but it has not happened yet.  We are now told it may open in October but it still may not happen.  We have been working with the officials as close as we can but it needs a push and a shove from the committee to get it over the line.  We ask for the committee members&rsquo; help and support in every way they can.  Making the right noises in here can be of considerable help to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Dunne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I will be as brief as possible because when one listens to other farm organisations, one recognises that there is much common ground in certain respects and repetition will not serve anyone well.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his elevation to the Chair of this committee.  I wish the new committee very well in its future endeavours in trying to serve the citizens of the country.  I wish to refer to the importance of the agrisector, which generates &euro;11 billion worth of exports.  The fact that most of the production is indigenous means we are major contributors to net foreign earnings in this country.  The point is often missed in terms of our importance in bringing other currencies into this country as net foreign earnings.<\/p> <p>  We are concerned about the crisis that has befallen the dairy sector and rural economies.  Full-time farming, especially the dairy sector, is the mainstay of economic and environmental sustainability in rural areas.  When one adds the multiplier effect from 14 through 16, we have quantified that the rural economy has lost more than &euro;800 million of spend.  That is a significant amount and there is an onus on us all to try to correct the situation.  It is possible to do that if we structure our industry correctly.  We can do well.  I am on the record as stating previously that the three main stakeholders are the individual business person, who must look in the mirror and make him or herself as efficient as possible.  After that one must look to the Government, facilitated by this committee, to put structures and policies in place to help us do business in such a volatile marketplace.  The third main stakeholder is the European Commission and the European Parliament.  The prize is to have a safe, secure supply of affordable food for the citizens of the Continent.  That is not a big ask, but we are in a situation now where ruinous volatility has visited the most vibrant sector in this country.  There was no need for us to go there if we all worked in a collaborative and professional fashion in order to invent new policies and tools to put in the armoury of the farmer to mitigate against such volatility.<\/p> <p>  Milk prices have increased by 1 cent to 2 cent in recent weeks but the crisis is not over and we cannot take our eye off the ball.<\/p><p>The question is whether it is a big cashflow issue or whether it will be structural.  We are at the tipping point.  Farmers are used to dealing with cashflow.  Once the profits come at a certain point, one can manage the cashflow but if one falls below the cost of production, which has happened - that has been recognised by everybody - then structural damage begins to affect the entire industry.  We need to focus our attention on that today.<\/p><p> I wish to highlight issues raised previously.  It is coming to a crunch point now with bills from contractors and merchant debtors mounting.  I submitted a comprehensive document which I wish to commit to the record.  I do not believe in reading stuff out so I will continue to refer to notes I have prepared.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Comer","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Has the document been circulated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>It has been circulated already.  I have highlighted the problems in the dairy sector and I might refer to solutions later.  We are most concerned about the beef sector also and the increasing numbers for 2017 according to the CCMS.  We must put a plan in place.  Competition is critical.  An emphasis must be placed on competition by way of live exports.  There is a responsibility on Bord Bia and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We have heard about the US and Chinese markets being opened but there is no real evidence of that.  A further push is needed for ground beef in the US and, in terms of the fifth quarter, that goes to China.<\/p> <p>  The effect of Brexit is more pronounced in rural areas and the agricultural scene than in the rest of the economy.  We must deal with the outcome of that democratic result.  To date, the response here has been tardy at best.  There is a lack of structure to the approach.  Ireland is one of the most exposed member states in Europe and the rural economy is the most exposed sector in this country.  We need to talk about the situation in terms of the UK versus the EU.  What suits the rest of the EU will most likely not suit Ireland because it is different to other member states.  The fact is that the UK put &euro;18 billion into the coffers of the EU and got &euro;10 billion back, which left it with a deficit of &euro;8 billion.  The way the deficit was justified to the taxpayers in the UK was by virtue of its access to the Single Market.  The Single Market was roughly valued at &euro;8 billion per year.  It will not suit the other governments in Europe to allow the UK free access to that market.  If a tariff is put on trade between Ireland the UK - or, more correctly, between the European Union and the UK - but it will affect Ireland most.  We will be in trouble.  We must recognise that and put serious plans in place to deal with the effects of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  I will return to how we mitigate against volatility in the dairy industry.  I have no doubt the dairy industry will recover but I do not want that to happen at the expense of farmers across Europe going broke.  Unless plan is put in place, that is exactly how the free market will work.  There was euphoria when quotas were lifted on 1 April 2015.  The situation was hyped up.  The ICMSA was not opposed to the quotas being lifted, as we were not in favour of them.  The quota system was a lazy tool that was not fit for purpose.  Ultimately, quotas became redundant and we were delighted to see them go.  However, it is not the case that one can plan a business in a free market situation and provide a product with a three-year lead-in.  That is nonsense and it cannot be done.  From the time one makes one&rsquo;s business decision and one puts one&rsquo;s cow in the crush and puts in the straw, one must wait nine months before an animal is born and wait two years before a cow comes into the milking parlour.  If anybody can tell me where the markets will be in three years&rsquo; time, then I will provide for it.  However, nobody knows what will be the position.  There must be political structures and interventions in food production in order to make sure that we do not have the cyclical volatility of boom and bust.<\/p> <p>  After much lobbying from the ICMSA, &euro;150 million was ring-fenced for a voluntary supply constraint, but not per member state.<\/p><p>That was introduced on 18 July.  Any reasonable observer would say that it had an immediate positive impact on sentiment.  There was an immediate uplift in the buoyancy of dairy markets because the buyers were coming back into the market.  It was the first time that Irish or European farmers had an alternative to producing the product.  I see the processors responded with increases in prices.  I would like to see that.  The only other alternatives to this voluntary supply constraint that we currently have in the toolbox, after all the huffing and puffing, are either private storage or intervention.  The voluntary supply constraint is designed to facilitate at 14.4 cent per litre, taking out 1.1 billion litres or 1.1 million tonnes of product.  That is three times what we currently have dried in powder in intervention.  We have somewhere in the region of 290,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder and 100,000 tonnes of butter in intervention.  Imagine had we not put that into intervention and we had this tool at our disposal six to eight months ago.  We would not now have all that product overhanging the market, which is going to keep our price down for even longer.  It would not have been produced in the first place and the markets would have gradually recovered.  I know that the consumer has to be protected in this situation as well.  We cannot ignore the consumer.  However, it is a concept that needs to be worked on to facilitate a reasonable price graph for both the consumer and the producer.  I believe it should be there as an automatic trigger once we fall below the cost of production.<\/p><p> On the issue of the discretionary moneys, which is &euro;350 million at European level and of which our portion is &euro;11.1 million, we are very clear.  The ICMSA would like to see that issued as an emergency measure in a single payment to farmers.  It is uncomplicated, does not have administration costs and is within the rules and regulations.  We made enquiries with the Commission and it is certainly within the scope of our Government to pay that as a payment to our farmers directly, specifically to our dairy farmers.  We would like to see it matched by an equal amount here.  We are lobbying strongly for that.  That would amount to in the region of &euro;1,200 per dairy farmer to try to help them meet their bills at a time when the contractor's bill, the feed merchant's bill and everybody else's bill all come in a concentration at the back end of the year.  Therefore, I believe it is important to do that.<\/p><p> There was a discussion earlier that we were listening to in the Visitors Gallery about interest rates and alternatives for that money.  I believe that we cannot let the banks off the hook.  If one benchmarks Irish debt with the rest of the European debt and one compares the average cost of money in Europe with what Irish farmers have borrowed, one will see that we are paying &euro;80 million per annum more in higher interest rates in Ireland than our competitors and counterparts in Europe.  That is an intolerable situation that can be addressed by Government.  The Government can have a role in creating a situation in which that will not be allowed to happen.<\/p><p> I will be brief on the other points because that is the central point of what I am trying to emphasise here today.  We can structure our production in a different way that is more economically and environmentally sustainable.  There is the issue of the management of stocks that are in intervention - 290,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder and 100,000 tonnes of butter.  Those stocks need to be held there until the markets themselves return to a sustainable level for the primary producer.  We cannot take our eye off the ball in this regard.  I have mentioned the points about market access for beef.  We need competition in terms of purchases of cattle in this country.  We made a submission to the EU competition authority on the proposed merger of ABP and Slaney Meats.  I can take questions about that afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Comer","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Comer to wrap up, please.

Unless there is a statutory way of dealing with them, those voluntary codes are a waste of time.  I believe there has been an opportunity missed in the recent legislation.

While we can take steps, they are going to be somewhat within the confines of what is happening elsewhere.

We have listened carefully to Mr. Comer's colleagues in the IFA, such as Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Leary, who is a very experienced man in the dairy area.  It is about the crisis in funding.  Mr. Comer indicated that it can be paid out directly, while Mr. O'Leary indicated that there may well be obstacles and conditions attached to it and there may be other farmers entitled to it.

We are all very conscious of what has happened in the dairy sector over the past 12 months.  Many people are struggling to produce milk on poorer land.  Credit is the biggest problem.  Some farmers had a problem with the super levy because they had increased production anticipating the end of the quota.  We were told we would have white gold but this has not transpired.  It has brought many people to the wall.  Many people speak about selling their cows and stopping.  It is a terrible situation for many farmers whose families have produced milk for generations.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about the power of multiple retailers.  We are all conscious that while the price of milk has gone through the floor there is no difference in the price in the shop.  In food production in this country, and perhaps throughout the world, the two ends seem to get screwed.  Prices stay high for the consumers no matter what happens and prices keep getting lower for producers.  Everyone in the middle seems to make all of the money.  The farmer does all the work and takes all of the risk but gets the least out of it.  The witnesses have stated that legislation needs to be introduced to ensure transparency.  Transparency is one thing, but we are trying to create fair trade.  Fair trade is vital for those producing coffee beans in Africa or wherever, but it is also vital for our people at home.  As far as I can see, and it is clearly to be borne out, there is no fair trade when it comes to how the processors, the big players and the big multiples are able to dominate the market.  They have totally and completely put the farmer out of business.  This is what they are doing.  It is almost like a glass ceiling.  They are allowed to go so far but cannot get any further.

The most sober part of this is that every time the farmers are squeezed, the ICMSA and similar organisations must come to the State looking for their income to be augmented.  The market is an artificial construct and it is not organic.  Certain people are in control of it and they have power.  This will be an eternal chestnut unless something is done.  I welcome the call by the Minister, Deputy Creed, for the Commission to examine it from an EU legislation point of view.  This is not just an Irish problem.  It is the way farming and agriculture operate Europe.  We have high standards and regulations but we also have an issue in the market.  We have suggestions of control by factories and dominant positions and on previous occasions, the former Minister questioned this.  I am sure others have also.

Mr. Comer gave a detailed presentation on the long-term and short-term issues.  I agree with Deputy Penrose in that I would like more background on the farm management deposit scheme.  Unfortunately the back end is coming and there is no cashflow on farms to pay the tax bill at the end of October.  Many farmers will try to obtain loans from their banks to pay income tax, which is unsustainable.  The farm management deposit scheme is a policy initiative on which I would like more background information.<\/p> <p>  We have been hearing about the power of the multiples, tackling the multiples and regulation of the market for a long time.<\/p><p>We have heard about this for a long time and through tackling multiples.  We regulated our liquid milk business 20 or 25 years ago, which has done nothing for farmers.  <\/p><p> People talk about regulation and the power of retailers and multiples.  I have been involved in the liquid milk trade for a long time and we are being squeezed out of existence.  The market is supposed to be regulated.  Someone will have to convince me that regulation can bring protection to primary producers because it has not worked in the liquid trade.  We pay our levy as producers to the regulatory body and it has given us absolutely no protection.<\/p><p> The beef forum was established and made a couple of recommendations on age and weight restrictions, which factories have completely ignored.  There has been no improvement for the producer side following from the beef forum.  There is a quality assurance scheme, but unfortunately a lot of cattle leaving farms do not qualify for the payments.  We have now gone down the road of dairy quality assurance schemes as well.  For a farmer involved in dairy and beef, only 20% of the stock that leaves the farm qualifies for quality assurance payments.  That is something that has to be looked at.  If a farm is quality-assured, all produce leaving it should qualify for premium.  Farmers go to the expense of bringing farms up to the required standards, and to receive payments for only a percentage of the stock is completely unjustified.<\/p><p> Active discrimination against Friesian cattle is creeping in in the different schemes that are being established.  Fianna F&aacute;il representatives met the Irish beef industry some time ago and it was evident that there was a total bias against Friesian cattle.  Fortunately or unfortunately, in the future, larger numbers of cattle that are finished in this country will be Friesian.  Like the beef breed in the past, there will be another stick to beat primary producers with, in that there will be active discrimination against those cattle.<\/p><p> Farmers are facing many issues.  At the end of the day, we have to face up to the principal issue - namely, that we are being asked to produce at world prices but we do not have world costs of production.  That is something which has to be focused on and will be the main issue in the future.  If one buys a tractor in Russia or in this country, the difference in cost is immense.  Whether it is producing grain, a bullock or a litre of milk, Western European farmers are being asked to do so on a different cost of production plane compared to many of those with whom they are competing.  If our family farm structure is to survive, that issue has to be addressed.  The Commission has a responsibility to European producers to address that, and it is something on which we need to focus more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#V00400","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>As the delegation probably knows, the committee published a report on the relationship between primary producers and large multiples.

There were many questions, and I will go through a few of them briefly in no particular order.  Our general secretary, Mr. Enright, will take up the ones I leave out or that do not know the answer to but will not admit it.<\/p> <p>  The voluntary supply constraint is a major issue.  It is new and people are afraid of it.  I and our organisation are fully supportive of the concept.  Deputies Penrose and McConalogue and others referred to the term \"voluntary\" at the beginning of the meeting.  It certainly has to be voluntary, because any farmer who has incurred fixed costs in terms of expansion cannot be told that he or she cannot milk cows.  We have to put that up against what caused the problem.  Why did we go from almost 40 cent down to 21 cent?  It was not the same as in 2009, and people found that difficult to understand.  The farmer experienced the same results but for completely different reasons.  Both reasons were the same, but involved different jurisdictions.  The problem was oversupply.  The 2014 crisis was caused by extra milk in Europe.  Europe traditionally produces around 140 billion litres of milk per year, and production increased to 147 billion litres.  The market was still growing.<\/p><p>We created a crisis by producing too much in Europe, not in New Zealand, Australia or America.  We were the main contributor to the extra volumes.<\/p><p> It seems to me to be a rudimentary idea that an alternative is provided to drying a product and putting it into storage.  After a lot of lobbying, a voluntary supply constraint was proposed.  Many people asked for it not to be voluntary.  Deputies McConalogue and Penrose are correct.  It was not in Ireland's interest, as a major exporter, to have it made mandatory.  I felt if we did not opt for a voluntary scheme it would be made mandatory and we will would be snookered.<\/p><p> The scheme is in place now and it is a concept that will work.  It should be an automatic trigger at whatever level an independent body decides the cost of production is, and once levels fall below that it should automatically kick in.  It will not cost taxpayers a whole pile of money as far as I am concerned, compared to the alternatives.  It is a strong tool that can be used at a European level. <\/p><p> At a national level, the farm management deposit scheme can be used in cases where, like in 2014, there is a high income.  The reality is that some farmers were faced with high taxable income and paid the top rate of tax but in late 2015 and 2016 faced a tax bill and, in some cases, were not able to put food on the table.  I am not putting on the poor mouth because I do not go into that, but that is the reality.  Farmers ended up with no income after having had high levels of income.<\/p><p> In a good year, farmers could be allowed to put, for example, &euro;20,000 into a private scheme and pay corporation tax on the way in.  We are building up a major problem in this country, whereby farmers are being forced to incorporate and sole traders, that is, the family farm structure with which we are familiar, are disadvantaged at every turn.  This would help as an alternative.  One can choose any figure to invest; I am only explaining the concept.  A farmer could put money into a scheme and if, within five years, they had to take it out to augment their income because they had no income, they would pay income tax relevant to the year they took out the investment.  If we could get the concept established we would be doing very well.<\/p><p> There are many questions on the beef grid, which Mr. Enright might cover.  On the power of the multiples and what we want, I am not sure if I am at liberty to name a multiple operating in this jurisdiction but one has a turnover of over &euro;32 billion.  That would shake our Taoiseach and Government because it is a lot of money.  No member state can come up with legislation that will address the imbalance in terms of the giant versus individual farmers.  The issue has to be addressed at a European level. <\/p><p> In terms of fleshing out some of the detail, Deputy Cahill did not seem to have great faith in legislation.  I am not so sure about legislation, but I can tell the committee without fear of contradiction that voluntary codes have not worked.  When something is not working, one has to look for a way around it.  I would be open to developing ideas that might work.  Deputy Pringle stated a litre of milk was only 5% of Irish production, but that could also pertain to other products such as powder, cheese and everything else.  I do not see any issue with that.  It does not have to specifically involve a litre of milk.<\/p><p> There are many other questions and I would like to be respectful in trying to answer them all.  I will ask Mr. Enright to deal with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Comer","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I refer to the &euro;11 million fund that was mentioned.  We are firmly of the view that money can be paid as direct payments to dairy farmers.  They are the regulations.  Our proposal is that dairy farmers should get a payment of &euro;1,200 each.  We asked the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine whether that is legally possible under the regulation and the response we received was that it was.<\/p> <p>  From our reading of the regulation we are very clear that it is possible.  There is one distinction compared to the payment that was made to dairy farmers last year, namely, that one must meet one condition.  There are seven options, but a farmer must meet in order to qualify for the payment.<\/p><p>For example, one of the options would be that I took part in the voluntary reduction scheme.  Others include that I did not increase my milk production, that I am a small-scale farmer, that I am engaged in extensive production methods or that I am in a quality assurance scheme.  At this stage, there are 15,000 dairy farmers who are either in the quality assurance schemes or close to being in them, so we are very firmly of the view that this is possible.  The Department confirmed to us that it is possible and we also spoke to the EU Commission on it.  The Commission said it is entirely up to the member state to decide what it wants to do with it.  We do not see any barrier, under the legal regulation, to allowing that to happen.  This was a dairy package.  It was negotiated as a dairy package and we feel it should be there to support the dairy farmer.<\/p><p> We accept Deputy Pringle's point regarding the multiple retailers and the fact there is no point putting pressure on the Irish multiple retailer, but the point we would make is that dairy farmers across Europe have seen their milk price fall by 35% to 40% in the last 12 months.  At the same time the retail price of dairy products across Europe fell by 2%.  Somewhere in between, somebody is getting an extra margin.  As a starting point, we need to expose who is getting what in that chain.  As an example of what can be done, recently on the beef side one multiple retailer in France has agreed to pay a price that will return a positive margin for the farmer.  The French farmers are in a much different position to ourselves in that they have a home market that is much bigger than ours, but that has happened in the last two to three weeks.  Pressure will have to be put on the multiple retailers to address the cut in the margin for the farmer.<\/p><p> On interest rates, it is possible under the CAP rural development plan, for example, if the Minister wants to do so, to use funds that are unused at present to set up financial instruments to help farmers.  The crisis fund should be used for the crisis and we should look at the CAP rural development plan to deal with financial instruments to try to address the issue with the banks.  To be fair to Glanbia and Dairygold, they have introduced low-interest loans for their suppliers and that model, along with some of the work that is being done by the SBCI, is an alternative.  It does not make sense to use crisis funding to fund low-interest loans.<\/p><p> On Senator Lombard's point regarding the beef forum, the key issue from our perspective is that if there are more cattle in the system, there will have to be more alternative markets for farmers.  The live export trade is critical from that perspective.  We have a live export trade for calves and weanlings but the finished cattle element is very important from our perspective.  If that could be secured, it would go a long way to addressing the issues in that respect.  Much work has been done on the US market for ground beef, as our president has mentioned, and the Chinese market, but we need to see beef moving to those markets.  I think we have answered most of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Enright","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>On the issue of famous &euro;11 million, or potentially &euro;22 million, there is a big divergence of opinion.

Young farmers should be viewed as prized assets by the Government because they yield jobs, growth and investment for the sector.  With the weight on their shoulders of being the future of the Irish agricultural industry and at the heart of rural Ireland, it is vital that the necessary resources and supports are made available to young farmers to fulfil this expectation.  An injection of youth into the sector to regenerate and rejuvenate Irish agriculture and ensure its survival and expansion is essential and will only be achieved with an increase in the attractiveness of the industry to the younger generation.<\/p><p> Luring more of Ireland's youth into this exciting sector must be seen as a twofold approach.  First, the relevant avenues must be explored and support provided to young farmers.  Second, the availability of land for young farmers to establish their businesses must be a priority.  Access to land is a primary requirement for any agricultural or farming activity as without land there is no farming.  To contribute to the agricultural sector in the most efficient manner possible, young farmers need to be installed on holdings at a young age when they have the energy and time to develop their enterprises.  Furthermore, for the successful passing on of land, all schemes need be inviting to the older generation to encourage the exchange of land.  Despite the need for change in the demographic of Irish agriculture, challenges still exist in supporting young farmers in terms of agricultural education, training and advice, which also helps deliver efficiency, innovation and productivity at farm level.  Such investments in education, skills development and advisory resources are vital in ensuring young farmers play their role in delivering on the targets set out in Food Wise 2025, for the creation of 23,000 jobs and in increasing the value of primary agricultural output to &euro;10 billion by 2025.<\/p><p> Macra na Feirme's pre-budget submission outlines productive tax and resource proposals with the dual aim of benefiting young farmers and Irish agriculture.  Macra acknowledges the Government's extension of stamp duty relief to young farmers in last year's budget to the end of 2018.  Stamp duty relief is extremely advantageous as it puts persons in a significant and beneficial financial position after the purchase or transfer of land.  The moneys saved via stamp duty relief allow for considerable investment in a property to improve its productivity.  Currently, 35 is the maximum age at which a young farmer can avail of stamp duty relief, yet the EU definition of a young trained farmer is up to a maximum age of 40.  Macra proposes extending the required age to avail of stamp duty relief for young trained farmers on the purchase of land to 40.  As a result of the considerable cost of purchasing land, a young farmer will struggle to avail of much of the benefit of stamp duty relief before the age of 35.  By extending the maximum age to 40, Macra feels young farmers will be in a better position to take advantage of the benefits of stamp duty relief.<\/p><p> In terms of capital allowances, with tough years like 2016 becoming more regular, many farmers meeting high loan repayments are further crippled by large tax bills.  Investment, jobs and growth go hand in hand.  The working group report of the 2014 agri-taxation review revealed a 10% increase in capital input is likely to increase agricultural output by 1.6% to 4.2%.  The Government, in the upcoming budget, should reward those willing to take risks and invest in their businesses.  Their risk benefits both themselves and the wider agricultural community by improving farm efficiency and output.  An increase in agricultural output has the ability to generate additional jobs in rural communities, thus helping to keep the Irish countryside populated.  Macra proposes the implementation of an annual investment allowance similar to the UK model whereby a portion of a year's capital expenditure can be written off in the first year, with the remaining balance written off over the normal period.<\/p><p> Currently, the Irish system allows machinery and motor vehicles to be written off at 12.5% per annum over an eight-year period and buildings, reclamation, etc., at 15% over a seven-year period.  The UK system allows a maximum of &pound;25,000, which is approximately &euro;30,000, to be written off against income in the first year.  The UK model applies to all types of capital expenditure and does not, therefore, favour one enterprise over another.  Such a system will at worse be cost-neutral, with the money farmers invest normally spent in local areas.  Simply put, Macra's proposal will allow farmers to manage loan repayments better, thereby providing the finance for more on-farm investment, with the additional benefit of creating jobs for the sector.<\/p><p> In terms of capital acquisitions tax, to promote the establishment of young farmers on agricultural holdings, Macra is calling for an increase to the current capital acquisitions tax thresholds by 25% for category A, therefore increasing it from &euro;280,000 to &euro;350,000, with an equivalent increase to categories B and C.  Historically, capital acquisitions thresholds were as high as &euro;521,000 in 2008 and at the same time the capital acquisitions tax rate was 20%, compared to today's rate of 33%.  Thus, the increase proposed by Macra is moderate and much less than pre-recession levels.<\/p><p> It has also come to Macra's attention that some high-wealth, non-farming individuals could potentially be using farmland as a way of sheltering wealth from capital acquisitions tax when passing the property on to their children, who have no intention of ever farming it.  The present capital acquisitions tax relief reduces the market value of \"agricultural property\" by 90% so the gift or inheritance tax is calculated on the \"agricultural value\" of the asset.  Macra welcomes the revised criteria of the Finance Act 2014 to ensure those who avail of capital acquisitions tax agriculture relief hold an agricultural qualification or spend a minimum of 50% of their time farming.  To prevent the use of agricultural property as a way for non-farmers to shelter wealth, further measures may need to be introduced to ensure the relief remains farmer-focused.<\/p><p> In terms of tax relief on the leasing of farmland to family members, every effort should be made to facilitate young farmers' access to land.  Relief needs to be not only focused at young farmers, but also aimed at the personnel who supply the land.  Rewarding those who transfer the land to young farmers will both encourage and speed up the accessibility of land for young farmers.  The current tax code goes against natural justice in that tax relief on the leasing of farmland only applies to non-related parties.  A parent who leases his or her land to a son or daughter is at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to leasing his or her land to a third party.  The total cost of leasing relief to the Irish Exchequer, as identified in the agri-tax review of 2014, is &euro;5.2 million, making it the sixth least expensive agri-tax cost.  Macra feels the introduction of agreements between parents and their children and between siblings to qualify for tax relief on land leasing is one measure which should be undertaken to decrease the range of factors which has caused the low uptake of leasing relief.  As a result, Macra is calling for the extension of tax relief on the leasing of land to include agreements between parents and children and between siblings who are young trained farmers.  However, the relief should be available on a one-term lease of no longer than seven years and available to those up to the age of 35.  We call on the Government also to prioritise the approval of the family transfer partnership, which was announced in last year's budget.<\/p><p> In terms of young farmer stock relief, the extension of stock relief to young trained farmers to the end of 2018 in last year's budget is welcomed by Macra.  Stock relief to young trained farmers goes a long way in allowing young farmers to expand their herd by offsetting the increase in herd value against the tax liability, yet there are limits to the reliefs benefit.  As the relief is only applicable for the first four years after the issue of the herd number, not all young farmers are in a financial position to grow their herd rapidly and to get the full benefit of the relief.  Infrastructural constraints and compliance with nitrates directives may also limit young farmers in their expansion initially.  Macra calls on the Government to allow for greater flexibility around the activation of the four years of the 100% stock relief.  This flexibility would allow young trained farmers to select the four years they wish to apply the 100% stock relief, consequently allowing the relief to come in line with their long-term business plans.  Indecon outlined the positive and statistical correlation between increasing stock numbers and the impact on farm productivity.  This, combined with Indecon's estimated 12% higher levels of output by trained farmers compared to untrained farmers, makes the outcome of a more flexible approach to stock relief for young trained farmers nothing but positive.  Macra calls for an increase to the amount eligible for the relief from &euro;75,000 to &euro;150,000 for those farming on their own and from &euro;7,500 to &euro;75,000 for those in a farm partnership.  Macra believes this is a justified increase due to stock relief to young trained farmers being the third least expensive agri-tax cost to the Irish Exchequer, with Indecon estimating the cost to the Exchequer being &euro;0.9 million.  This proposed increase to &euro;150,000 equates to a 100 dairy herd.<\/p><p> We are willing to share with the committee our thoughts on income volatility.  I will briefly conclude by summarising our last couple of points.  We believe in education as an organisation and that additional resources should be supplied to Teagasc to allow for the implementation of the Education Strategic Vision project, as the Teagasc model is a unique model in integrating research, education and advisory within the one organisation.<\/p><p>From a productive point of view, we would encourage the Government to consider putting in place a grass utilisation measures fund for young farmers.  We suggest the Government put a &euro;2 million Exchequer fund in place to subsidise the provision of grass measuring equipment for young farmers to the value of &euro;500 per farmer.  This would mean 4,000 young farmers could benefit from the financial backing to purchase such equipment.  Grass utilisation is a major target of the Food Wise report and we would encourage the committee to work with the Minister and try to implement a measure of this nature.<\/p><p> We would like TAMS, under the Rural Development Programme, to focus more on grazing infrastructure.  Therefore, Macra calls for this to be included as part of any future TAMS because we realise the value and importance of focusing on investment in the productive assets which farmers have on their farms, being grass and soil fertility.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for inviting us here to day to present Macra's pre-budget submission.  While it is not necessarily a budgetary issue, we would also call on the Government to make a national reserve available in 2017 as a priority, as 2016 saw no reserve.  The national reserve is seen by Macra as fundamental for young farmer's development and future contribution to the sector.<\/p><p> The uncertainty facing the Irish agricultural sector surrounding Brexit makes budget 2017 one of the most paramount budgets of the century for the agrisector.  It is pivotal that the budget puts the framework in place to instil confidence, trust and belief in the sector for young farmers as they are the ones who will live with the implications of Brexit in five, ten and 20 years' time.  We would also welcome a discussion as part of the questions on the more strategic issues in the sector, such as those that have been talked about by the previous speakers in their presentations.  I thank the committee for its time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#Z00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Finan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Finan.

It is one of the issues most prevalent among young farmers coming to me, and particularly acute for those who are affected.  It has meant that many genuinely young farmers who have been farming for more than five years have been discouraged from expanding their farming enterprises.

As it stands, it is far more advantageous to lease land to a stranger rather than to lease it to a family member.  I note Macra includes in its presentation that the relief should be available on a one-term lease for no longer than seven years.  Has Macra pushed this previously in a pre-budget submission and what response has Macra received?

I accept that is not the case across the board but it would seem that in regard to leasing, there is a lack of recognition that land is kept very much within families.  There are bachelor and bachelorette farmers who do not have natural successors but it seems to be at odds with that fact.  On the land access side, I presume the position is that one does not have people going to agriculture college for the most part who do not have some access to land.  Is farm size and access to more land the issue?<\/p> <p>  I have an observation in regard to the capital taxes relief on the stamp duty young trained farmer relief 90% reduction and also on the agricultural relief on the gifts and inheritances side.  It is attractive compared to somebody who is getting a gift or inheritance of non-agricultural land or non-business assets and it would seem that the issue in regard to land mobility is not so much concerned with that but with the older farmer who is not passing on the land at the rate Macra might like.  Macra might comment on that.  Macra has made suggestions to improve the situation but, as I say, it has already been there.  Macra acknowledges that there has been an extension and it appreciated that.  That side seems to be fairly well looked after.<\/p> <p>  I also agree on the extension of the definition of young trained farmers to those 40 years of age.  Nowadays we are all living longer, and that includes older farmers.  People have the ability to farm longer.  It seems a natural progression that one would extend the definition and make everybody feel a lot younger too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#DD00100","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1473774000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I welcome the Macra delegation here today.<\/p> <p>  The issue, already been raised by a number of others, that I had in mind was the issue of the old young farmers.

It is a significant barrier to many young farmers around the country and it is something that needs to be dealt with.  I wonder has Macra any suggestions as to how progress can be made because to date it seems to be a significant block for everyone concerned.  I am firmly of the view that, if the correct application and concentration of effort was made, there must be a solution to resolve this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#DD00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1473774000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I join other speakers in welcoming the Macra na Feirme delegation.<\/p> <p>  The real issue for me is still land mobility.  Macra na Feirme produced a report two or three years that came up with a frightening statistic that there were more farmers over 80 than under 35.  That statistic is what haunts farming.  I do not know whether looking to increase the age of a young farmer from 35 to 40 will help that scenario.  On this issue of land transfer, and the requirement to have farmers reach their thirty-fifth birthday to move it, I wonder will they be now required to reach their fortieth birthday to move it.  Some of us here are farmers.  We know how farmers think and it is an issue.  I am genuinely concerned about that and how we deal with it in the long term.  It is something this committee must look at with help from Macra.  However, it is a key issue.  As Macra has proven with its statistics, when one gets a young trained farmer on a property the productivity goes up and everything else goes up with it, but how does one manage it?  I do not know whether making a young trained farmer 40 is the correct approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#DD00300","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I will endeavour to answer all the questions.  I will then pass over to my colleagues to add anything I may have overlooked.<\/p><p> First, to elaborate for Deputy McConalogue on the education and training places, we undertook a recent young farmers survey which identified that 33% of those surveyed had not completed their agricultural education.  There could be a number of reasons for that, one being access.  As members know, there was huge demand on the education system as a result of the CAP measures which were announced.  We constantly have to work on this issue, which is more pronounced in some parts of the country than in others.  For example, we will have to work with local Teagasc organisations on the ground to make sure places are available for young farmers who want to avail of education.  Macra na Feirme has played a huge part in education and we are currently rolling out a further education programme through our Macra na Feirme young farmer skillnet programme, which is providing further education to young farmers and giving them the practical skills they need.<\/p><p> On the older young farmer issue, which was raised by a number of speakers, this really comes back to the five-year rule, which we highlighted when the CAP legislation was published.  We fully support the plight of the older young farmer, or the young farmer who is beyond five years establishment and who is not entitled to avail of the schemes as other young farmers are.  We welcome the commitment in the programme for Government that representations will be made to Europe to find out whether this issue can be addressed.  We have no real solution but we are involved with CEJA, the European young farmers council, at a European level.  We understand there is flexibility in some member states in terms of the implementation of the five-year rule across both pillars.  The Irish Government has decided that the five-year rule will be consistent across both pillars.  If this can be looked at with a view to allowing flexibility to be built into Pillar II, whereby some of these young farmers could avail of 60% of TAMS, that might be an option.<\/p><p> We support the plight of these young farmers because it is not right there are two tiers of young farmers.  One person might only be commencing farming activity at 37 and getting all the benefits of that through the top-up and the reserve, while another person at the age of 25 might have five years farming done and is no longer eligible for any of the schemes.  It does not seem fair.  We will be working at a European level to see if anything can be done.  We have met with the Department and with Commission officials at an EU level, and we ask the committee to look at this issue, on which we made a presentation here last year also.<\/p><p> A number of committee members spoke about stamp duty relief in regard to the extension up to the age of 40.  We have asked for this in order to make it consistent with the young farmer definition that has existed across the EU.  We take the point that it might slow down or reduce the transfer but we believe that young farmers will probably be in a better position to avail of this relief between the ages of 35 and 40.  While we would be a little concerned that it may slow down the transfer, which is the principle we push in terms of getting more young farmers onto the land, in order to bring consistency to the approach on young farmers, we will be asking for this to be extended to the age of 40.<\/p><p> Deputy Cahill referred to the issue of tax relief for family members.  Through our land mobility programme, we have seen many people taking up long-term leasing.  That land mobility programme is going from strength to strength and long-term leasing is a major part of it as a result of the tax measures in place.  However, as part of that, we feel there should be some means to allow parents to lease their land to sons or daughters, which would encourage more transfers within the family.  The reason we have put in that the relief should be for one term of seven years is because we do not want this to be an indefinite arrangement.  We want the transfer to happen after a period but this might be the transition period that is required.  It would first go into the lease and then, ultimately, result in the transfer of the farm holding.<\/p><p> I have addressed the other issues around the question of the older younger farmer.  Senator Lombard referred to the land mobility programme, which, as I said, is going from strength to strength.  We have over 500 clients in place and over 200 arrangements in place as part of the programme, which is great to see.  The focus of our organisation is always to encourage young farmers.<\/p><p> A speaker mentioned the size of holdings.  We are trying to encourage efficiency and improvements at farm level so young farmers are as efficient as possible at the farm gate.<\/p><p>As representatives of young farmers and as a young farm organisation, we work on a lot of the external factors, but we always encourage young farmers to make sure they are as efficient as possible inside the farm gate.<\/p><p> I will hand over to Mr. Dillon to deal with anything I have missed, and if any of our other representatives have anything to contribute they can do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#DD00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Finan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I will pick up on two points, the first being stamp duty relief for young trained farmers.  Our proposal is that we focus on extending the age to 40 for the purchase of land, because we feel young farmers may be in a better position in their late 30s to purchase land and they should still have that advantage over another farmer who might have better financial means.  We have not proposed the extension of the age to 40 on the transfer of the land and we want to retain the age limit at 35 in that regard.  As Senator Lombard said, there is a spike in the number of transfers made on the 34th birthday, but we want to retain that while changing the age restriction in regard to purchase.  Young farmers say they are in a better position to purchase land when they are in their late 30s and we want to give them that advantage.<\/p> <p>  Second, I want to pick up on the points made about older young farmers.  It is a critical issue and is an Irish phenomenon rather than a European phenomenon.  This is a result of the stop-start nature of young farmer schemes.  We had installation aid but we stopped it, then started it, then stopped it, then started it again.  As a result, people fall between the cracks and fall outside the definitions of particular schemes.  That is why we have a cohort of older young farmers who have never been eligible for schemes.  Our president has outlined the importance of funding initiatives such as the national reserve.  We had no national reserve last year.  If we are fortunate enough to have a national reserve this year, we hope that nobody who missed the scheme last year will miss out due to eligibility criteria.  That is how these issues come about.  If we have schemes for young farmers, we must keep them open for the duration of each CAP reform.  Most European countries keep them open for the full duration of the reform but we have not had that consistency in the past.  We need to learn the lessons of the past, which suggest that if we do start a young farmers scheme, we need to keep it open.  Otherwise, we will have this scenario of older young farmers, which we would not have had if we had kept schemes open in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#FF00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derry Dillon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Mr. Barber is also going to speak on the older young farmer issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#FF00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Finan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Before he does, I would like to get a view on another issue mentioned by different groups, namely, the allocation of potential funding of &euro;11 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#FF00400","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I will speak on that after Mr. Barber speaks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#FF00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Finan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I am one of those older young farmers.

However, when the new schemes came out in 2015, we did not qualify for them because the EU saw us as farming because we had entered into a partnership.

I know there is an issue with cashflow at the moment, but the volume of money to be paid out would be relatively small when divided across all the industries.  As Mr. Barber has said, it should go into some kind of grassland improvement scheme or measure where the costs of reseeding would be covered or partly covered as part of that.<\/p> <p>  As it will be too small a pot to spread across all the sectors, it should be used strategically.  We have to have a strategic focus on agriculture because ultimately it is about equipping farmers with what they need to make them more efficient and ultimately drive profitability within the farm gate.  We acknowledge there are factors outside the farm gate, as we have faced this year, which are out of our control and put incomes under severe pressure.  That is where we stand on the measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#GG00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Finan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":97,"content":"<p>With regard to the old-young farmer issue we were discussing, does Mr. Finan have any figures the number of old young farmers at the moment - the actual costings?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>We have heard various accounts of different figures.

Increases in tax receipts have helped to support a sense of recovery and allow the Government to consider options that would have been inconceivable two years ago.  However, we should not get carried away on that.  We saw clearly in the general election that recovery was not something that had reached rural Ireland and, since then, nothing much has changed.  We believe that the huge pressures facing all sectors of agriculture in 2016 are integral to the lack of recovery in rural areas.  Farmers are not making any money and therefore economic activity in rural Ireland is subdued.  It is that simple.<\/p><p> During the downturn, farmers stayed productive and contributed to keeping the economy going when other sectors sank, but we should recall that farmers were among the first to suffer austerity cuts.  The disadvantaged areas scheme was seen as an easy target in 2008 when its expenditure was cut from &euro;257 million to &euro;220 million.  A second cut led to that figure dropping to &euro;195 million.  Those affected were the most vulnerable in the farming community.  It is now time to begin the process of reversing those cuts in full.  The programme for Government foresees a &euro;25 million partial restoration of the payments, now called the areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme.  The Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers' Association, ICSA, wants full restoration to the level of &euro;257 million over the next three budgets, with &euro;25 million put in place for 2017.<\/p><p> In other expenditures, we want to see a full drawdown of the &euro;52 million per annum for the beef data and genomics programme.  In our view, that will require additional top-ups for existing participants and space for new entrants to the scheme.  The ICSA is concerned about the slow pace of uptake of the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS II, due to technical difficulties in the Department and, significantly, farmers being unable to commence work due to cashflow difficulties.  We want to see more flexibility, therefore, in the next tranche of the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, to ensure maximum benefit to farmers.  Also, it is imperative that the sheep scheme is up and running in 2017, and we are somewhat concerned that it may be too bureaucratic to ensure maximum uptake.<\/p><p> Overall, the key message is that we now need to ramp up expenditure under the rural development programme, RDP, to make sure that the total fund is spent.  The profile of expenditure suggests an average of &euro;580 million over the full 2014-2020 period, but inadequate spending to date means we need to be spending close to &euro;600 million per annum for the period 2017-2020.<\/p><p> We also need to see the locally led schemes up and running to support farmers with land designated for hen harriers, pearl mussels and so on.  However, it is our belief that it is now essential to restore funding from the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service, NPWS, scheme as a complementary measure to RDP funding.  For many years it was accepted that a variety of instruments were required to ensure proper compensation for every designated hectare, something the EU favours.  Hence, we need to go back to models that have worked in the past and can work in the future.<\/p><p> I emphasise that all of this money is badly needed by the farming sectors.  Brexit has led to a level of uncertainty which is already putting pressure on beef prices.  The Government must fight hard to ensure that the impact is mitigated and that a UK-EU trade deal is negotiated to allow our exports to continue unhindered.  We also need to fight against unfavourable trade deals with Mercosur and under the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP,  which would see significant quotas for beef imports.  However, while this is a battle to be fought at EU level, we are in control of ensuring adequate supports under the RDP.  The Department of Finance must also avoid measures which damage our competitiveness.<\/p><p> The ICSA is demanding that we do not score own goals in terms of adding to fuel costs.  We are quite alarmed about proposals to increase taxes on diesel.  Even if the insane proposal of the environmental pillar to increase the price of green diesel to the same level as petrol never sees the light of day, the tax strategy group has examined a possible increase in the price of auto diesel to petrol price levels.  I can deal with that in more detail when we take questions.  It is quite a strange idea to drive up the price of fuel in rural Ireland at this time.  Questions arise also about carbon taxes.  This move would be extremely short-sighted.  Higher auto diesel prices mean we are less competitive in terms of our exports.  At a time when we are already struggling with competitiveness in terms of UK exports due to sterling-euro exchange rate movement, any additional pressures provoked by diesel increases would be foolish in the extreme.  We must remember this is a double whammy, as increased diesel prices increase the cost of inputs and also affect the export costs of our output.<\/p><p> When it comes to taxation, we are not looking for the Apple deal.  However, it is worth reflecting on the apparent consensus that everything possible must be done to protect the 6,000 Apple jobs, and perhaps some 150,000 jobs directly created by foreign direct investment.<\/p><p>Farmers are the foundation of an agrifood sector which accounts for at least 8.4% of total employment in this country.  The sector is far more significant than Apple on its own and, arguably, more significant than the entire foreign direct investment sector, particularly when we consider the reach into every community in every county in Ireland.  On the other hand, the benefit of Apple is limited to the main urban centres.  Hence, we will make no apologies for saying that the levels of tax on sole traders here are way too high.  The ICSA supports the phasing out of the universal social charge, USC, and wants to see a 1% cut in it in this budget.  We also support the strategy, begun in the previous budget, of bringing in an earned income tax credit equivalent to the employee credit.  The &euro;550 announced in budget 2016 must be doubled in 2017, and the job finished in 2018.<br\/><br\/>These are small changes but it is vital to understand how the universal social charge can be so damaging to the progressive farmer who is investing in his farm but whose capital allowances against income tax do not extend to the universal social charge.  Also, our members have to provide their own pension, and there is no relief against the universal social charge for pension contributions.  For all of these reasons, we want the universal social charge phased out.  It is worth reflecting on the fact that there is almost universal consensus that the 12.5% corporation tax rate is essential to job creation and the sustainability of most businesses, but little appreciation of the fact that farm businesses can be hit for almost 50% tax even on relatively modest incomes.<br\/><br\/>There are other taxation measures which the ICSA believes are vital but which typically only apply to a small fraction of farmers in any one year.  As such, their contribution to the state finances are minuscule but the impact on individual farmers faced with them is immense.  The ICSA wants to see further increases in the category A threshold, which was increased in last year&rsquo;s budget to &euro;280,000, having regard to the fact that it was &euro;542,000 in 2009.  The 90% agricultural relief must continue.<b><\/b>With regard to capital gains tax restructuring relief, which assists the consolidation of holdings, we want to see this relief extended beyond current deadline of the end of 2016.<b><\/b>The ICSA proposes that 50% stock relief be available for all farmers in the interests of encouraging farmers to meet the targets of Food Harvest 2020.  In the longer term, the State will reap much more from increased exports and future tax take rather than taking the short-term view, which limits stock relief except in the case of young farmers or partnerships.<br\/><br\/>With regard to rainy day planning, the ICSA proposes that farmers should be able to shelter a proportion of income from tax in a good year by putting it into a special account where it would be taxed on drawdown in a bad year.  The ICSA submits that tax relief for pension contributions should continue at the marginal rate, and take into account the universal social charge as well, until such time as the USC is fully abolished.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Chairman and the committee members for the opportunity to appear here today.  What we are looking for in budget 2017 is modest in terms of the overall strong performance in the economy.  When the economy was on its knees, farmers kept going and performed an act of patriotic duty in continuing to produce, which led to annual increases in export earnings.  That was the good news story when everything else was gloom and doom.  The ICSA is increasingly alarmed, however, that farmers are not getting their fair share of the cake, and that must be examined in other forums.  Our members look at fancy strategies such as Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025 with a jaundiced eye.  They do not appear to be getting any benefit from putting more in and taking less as a result.  However, while this will be determined by a variety of policies at home and in Brussels, we expect that the measures we have outlined will be delivered.  The Government will not be forgiven if our sacrifices in the downturn are quickly forgotten.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#HH00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Kent","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473774000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their contributions.

How can we guarantee that the primary producers will actually make money in the future?  The money that buys land is never made from land.  That is one of our problems.  Our agriculture sector has to make enough money to expand and grow.  At present it does not.

There is probably an opportunity there.<\/p> <p>  The sugar tax has been kicked down the road to 2018.  That should be addressed immediately and the funding generated by the tax on carbonated beverages should be used to educate kids in school, on milk schemes in schools, or to educate kids to cook.  Many kids now only know how to phone up and order a pizza or other takeaway.  Increasingly, kids going to school in the morning get breakfast rolls with carbonated beverages in petrol stations.  As a result they become obese and unhealthy very quickly.  That transfers to the HSE budget as they develop massive health problems in later life such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other issues.  That has to be addressed.  There might be a lack of courage to do that because people think these are poor people but everybody drinks these carbonated beverages and everybody suffers as a result.  That goes across the spectrum of the health care industry.  There are vested interests involved and huge lobby groups.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Pringle asked the IFA how to increase the price for farmers.  We have to increase demand.  We are producing grass-fed beef and lamb, the healthiest meats in the world.  If the funding were put into advertising those to get them into the high price markets, we would have a massive future.  That is not being done.  An Bord Bia is asleep.  Its members go on junkets abroad to Taiwan and places like that.  We have got to get into our main markets in the UK.  We have to advertise the food, get the consumers to appreciate and be proud of it.<\/p><p>When a child is brought down the street in a pushchair, she is given a coloured chemical cocktail and the next time she is given milk at home she throws it away.  Some recent research shows this cocktail is more addictive than cocaine.  The sugar tax has to be brought in.  People have to be healthy.  They have to appreciate the food we produce here and farmers have to be appreciated for producing it.  The very good environment we have must be appreciated also and it has to be understood that this is the future.  Hippocrates, the founder of modern medicine, said, \"Let food by thy medicine and medicine be thy food.\"  We have to adopt that sort of approach.  <\/p><p> On the issue of diesel, I have seen some misleading stuff in the press recently saying that there is a diesel subsidy for farmers.  There is no such thing.  That is misinformation given out by a particular lobby group based in this city.  What has been said is not true.  Farmers do not get a diesel subsidy.  They get a lower tax rate on it.  There is also misinformation given out that farmers do not pay carbon tax on the diesel for their tractors.  Farmers pay a higher proportion of their diesel bill in carbon tax than any other sector.  The price per litre is higher.  Green diesel costs over 5.5 cent a litre - that is more than white diesel - in carbon tax.  If the carbon tax continues to be taken it has to be ring-fenced and put back into rural Ireland to finance green energy schemes, that will feed into the national grid on a small scale.  There is only very large-scale funding for big projects and vulture funds come in from abroad and launder money through them.  We have to act small and basic.  This money is being taken out of farmers&rsquo; pockets.  There are many opportunities in rural Ireland for wind, solar, water and methane projects.  Due to the fact that so much carbon tax is levied on farmers, they do not have money left to invest in anything else.  They do not even have an income. <\/p><p> I will hand over to Mr. Punch to deal with technical issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#LL00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Kent","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Martin Kenny&rsquo;s question about the fair share of the retail price, the ICSA proposed some time back that this needs to be solved at EU level.  The entire food chain has to be regulated.  Our proposal is to have a regulator at EU level who would have power to audit the accounts of the multinationals involved in the retail trade.<\/p> <p>  At the moment, no individual member state is able to pursue this - to follow the money, as it were.  Companies such as Aldi, Lidl, Tesco and so on are involved in this country and other countries.  With the best will in the world, it would be difficult to audit the margins they make and identify where the money goes.  There needs to be auditing power at EU level to examine the accounts of these multinational corporations.  There has been much talk about multinationals in recent weeks but there is no getting away from the fact that the source of almost all the farmer's income difficulties is that the more the farmer is dependent primarily on Brussels funding or national funding, the more he is being undermined by getting less and less of the retail price at the other end of the food chain.  We have to begin with full understanding of who - the processor or the retailer - is making what.  The situation where these corporations can work and keep consumers, farmers, policymakers and the EU in the dark about where the money is going is increasingly intolerable.  The proper function of an entity like the EU must be to tackle the power of very large multinationals.  There is no point in the EU solely regulating the activity of the little people, namely, small-scale businesses.  There is, for example, a huge burden of bureaucracy on farmers.<\/p><p>Any number of State employees are, on behalf of the EU, auditing, measuring and examining what farmers are doing.  There are satellites in the sky and so on.  We need this effort to be refocused on what is happening in the food chain at the money end of the show.<\/p><p> Regarding European funding, there is clearly no getting away from the fact that the beef, sheep and cereal sectors are not the most profitable in Irish farming.  It is baffling to us how there have been two rescue packages for dairy, notwithstanding the fact that the incomes of cattle and sheep farms in 2016 will still be at the bottom of the heap.  The cereal farms will not be much better.  It is incomprehensible that we would twice put a package in place to give cash to dairy farmers only.  The likelihood is that the dairy markets will recover next year and revert to their traditional position of making three times per hectare what cattle and sheep farmers make.  I do not want a row between farmers, but there is no getting away from this.  We must reflect the fact that cattle and sheep farmers are the poor relations.<\/p><p> Regarding a computerised system in the Department, our point was that the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, was held up because a software system had to be put in place to deal with applications.  Our understanding is that the Department has resolved this situation.  We will watch carefully to ensure that payments are progressed as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> Like everyone else, we are concerned about the impact of Brexit on our sector.  Beef prices have slipped in recent weeks.  Live exports will be even more important now if we are to reduce our dependency on beef exports to the UK.  We must use every opportunity to get the message across that Ireland's position is a special one.  I spoke at an agrifood conference in France yesterday that was organised by Ouest-France.  I got the opportunity to have a few words with Mr. Michel Barnier, the European Commission's Brexit negotiator and a former French Minister for agriculture.  I put across the message that we needed a special and continuous engagement in the EU's negotiation with the UK.  He outlined that he would be engaging with each member state's government, particularly ours.  This avenue must be pursued very assiduously by our Government.  There is an appreciation in Europe that we have a particular interest.  In a nutshell, we do not want the trading arrangements between Europe and the UK, which really means our exports of beef to the UK, undermined in any way by the playing of a different political game in the talks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2016091300002#MM00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Punch","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473774000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Punch.

People rang to say that they could hardly put diesel in their tractors as things stood and that an increase in the price of diesel would see them walking.<\/p><p> Blame whoever one likes for farm debt - the banks or the farmers who borrowed - but it remains a major problem and is nowhere near being solved yet.  The number of farmers who contact me or the ICSA monthly for help is not decreasing.  A large number of people are still ringing us asking what they can do.  I want to ensure that there is a realisation out there about how bad the situation remains.  The problem is that many farmers are not great at discussing the issue.  Unfortunately, this has led to many taking their own lives because they could not cope.  I get phone calls at midnight from fellows whom I have never met.  When one gets a call from a farmer at that time, he or she is under severe pressure.  There is only so much that anyone can do for him or her.  When I plead with the banks to work with us on solving the problem, I tell them that the blame game is over.

The council views the enhanced role for the Oireachtas in providing greater scrutiny of the budgetary process as a positive step and we wish the committee well in its work.  With me this afternoon are council members, Mr. Seamus Coffey and Mr. Michael Tutty, and the council secretariat is also present.<\/p> <p>  In my opening remarks, I will focus mainly on the key messages from the council's pre-budget statement, published on Thursday last.  While we are limited in what we can say as a council by our well-defined statutory mandate, we will, as always, endeavour to be as forthcoming to the committee as possible, making clear in responses to questions where we are giving personal rather than council opinions.<\/p> <p>  Three developments have created a challenging backdrop to the assessment of the appropriate fiscal stance for budget 2017: the CSO's revised national accounts data showing 26% growth in 2015; uncertainty over the impact of Brexit; and questions over the sustainability of corporation tax receipts.  The revised CSO data mean that measures of growth based on headline aggregates, such as GDP and GNP, are detached from underlying developments in the Irish economy that determine the employment and incomes of Irish residents.  Moreover, fiscal ratios based on these measures are not reliable indicators of the health of the public finances.  This creates challenges for the council in respect of all elements of its mandate.  These challenges will be addressed in detail in the council's November report by which time some additional data may be available from the CSO.  In advance of budget 2017, an immediate issue is the assessment of the macroeconomic-fiscal position and the appropriate fiscal stance for 2017.  In the current circumstances, it is necessary to look beyond the standard national accounts aggregates and to use alternative indicators when assessing the pace of growth of the economy.  Based on an estimate of growth in domestic demand, real growth in 2015 measured approximately 5% and this pick-up is also reflected in other aggregates, such as employment and consumption.<\/p> <p>  The fast pace of recent growth has implications for the cyclical position of the economy.  The output gap measures the difference between the actual level of output in the economy and what it could sustainably produce if all resources &ndash; human and capital &ndash; were being fully utilised.  A range of formal estimates of the output gap reported in the council's June 2016 Fiscal Assessment Report suggested that the economy is operating close to potential in 2016.  Recent strong growth in domestic demand and employment along with the return to net inward migration in the year to April 2016 are all consistent with the demand shortfall in the economy being reduced rapidly.  While there are no major signs of overheating in the economy at present, it is important to note that there is significant uncertainty around this assessment and the position could change over the next number of years.  Understanding the cyclical position of the economy and avoiding potential overheating will be important considerations in framing fiscal policy post -budget 2017.<\/p> <p>  Turning to an assessment of the fiscal position, the problems with the official estimates of GDP and GNP mean that the headline debt-to-GDP ratio underestimates the size of the debt burden and overstates its rate of improvement last year.  As a result, alternative fiscal ratios must be used.  In this report the council has found it more useful to focus directly on fiscal ratios expressed as a percentage of actual general Government revenue.<\/p><p> The council's adjusted debt ratio improves from 105% in 2014 to 97% in 2015, a fall of eight percentage points compared to the 27 percentage point fall in the unadjusted debt to GDP ratio.  Thus the adjusted data point to a continuing gradual reduction in the State's debt burden, although the overall level of debt remains high by historic and international standards.<\/p><p> Turning to the council's assessment of the fiscal stance, the Government's planned stance for budget 2017 is more expansionary than implied by the intended use of the &euro;1 billion of fiscal space for 2017 outlined in the summer economic statement.  Previously announced new spending commitments for 2016 and 2017 of &euro;0.5 billion and &euro;0.9 billion, respectively, give a combined package of measures of &euro;2.4 billion.<\/p><p> As the demand shortfall in the economy is likely to be small and is disappearing quickly, the economic case for a more expansionary stance than already planned by the Government through the &euro;2.4 billion package is weak.  Regarding debt sustainability considerations, the government debt level when measured relative to government revenue remains high.  Although the current interest rate environment is favourable, the experience of recent years has demonstrated how quickly market sentiment can change.  The State's high debt level means the overall fiscal position is still fragile and an adverse shock could cause the debt ratio and deficit to start rising again.<\/p><p> Moreover, in the wake of Brexit the risks facing the Irish economy have heightened since the publication of the council's last assessment in June.  While it is possible that the eventual impact of Brexit on the Irish economy and public finances will be modest, there is much uncertainty and a more severe outcome is also possible.<\/p><p> There is also particular uncertainty related to the sustainability of the recent surges in corporation tax.  Although the latest national accounts data give some insight into the reasons for the out-performance, its relationship to the asset and tax management decisions of a small number of multinational corporations gives reason to be cautious about its sustainability.  Moreover, when underlying revenues are volatile, prudent budgetary management suggests that buffers should be built up to protect against potential reversals, especially where it is costly to reverse expenditure increases and tax cuts.<\/p><p> Weighing up these considerations, the council assesses that the Government's current plans for a &euro;1 billion package in budget 2017, on top of the pre-committed expenditure increases for 2016 and 2017, is at the limit of the range of prudent policies.  Any further relaxation of the fiscal stance in 2016 or 2017 beyond the current plans would not be appropriate given the strong pace of underlying economic activity, falling unemployment and the need to bolster the resilience of the public finances to adverse shocks.  While an anomaly in the fiscal rules related to the AIB preference share transaction in 2015 could allow additional expansion in 2016, a further relaxation of the stance, as occurred in last year's budget through late supplementary expenditure estimates, would not be appropriate.  The Government should take advantage of the current relatively strong growth in revenue to eliminate the remaining budget deficit and accelerate the reduction in the debt ratio.<\/p><p> The pre-budget statement also analysed the possible implications of Brexit for the Irish economy.  Given the uncertainty around the eventual impact of Brexit on the UK economy and on Ireland, the council examined two possible scenarios.  In a relatively benign baseline scenario using the most recent post-Brexit forecasts for the UK economy from the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, NIESR, in the UK, estimates suggest that Irish growth could be lowered by approximately three quarters of a percentage point in 2017 with more limited effects thereafter.  In this case, the estimated fiscal space out to 2021 would not be significantly reduced compared to the summer economic statement.<\/p><p> A more severe outcome than these relatively benign short-run effects is also possible.  Such a scenario could transpire if the UK's potential output growth is reduced by Brexit with knock-on consequences for the Irish economy.  The exercise is not intended as a forecast of the possible impact of Brexit but rather is designed to illustrate how fiscal space could dissipate if the economy performs significantly worse than currently forecast in the years ahead.<\/p><p> For illustrative purposes, assuming a reduction in Ireland's potential growth rate of half a percentage point per annum, fiscal space could be reduced by approximately a quarter to &euro;8.5 billion if attainment of Ireland's medium-term objective was also delayed by a year.  Drawing on the council's stand-still expenditure estimate, allowing for increases in expenditure in line with projected inflation and demographic pressures would absorb over half of the reduced fiscal space in the illustrative adverse scenario.<\/p><p>Finally, while much of the current focus for the upcoming budget is on short-term considerations related to 2017, as in previous reports, the council would like to highlight the importance of ensuring that annual budgetary decisions are anchored to realistic medium-term forecasts for the public finances.  Without a realistic medium-term anchor, there is a risk of a return to the type of <i>ad hoc<\/i>year-to-year budgeting that served Ireland poorly in the past. <br\/><br\/>To sum up, amid the unusual uncertainty that prevails in advance of budget 2017, a few fundamental facts about the economy and public finances should not be lost<i>. <\/i>The economy has made an impressive recovery from the economic and financial crisis and good progress has been achieved in repairing the public finances.  However, government debt remains high leaving the public finances exposed in the face of numerous risks and potential negative shocks.  The Government should take advantage of the current strong growth in the economy to reduce the debt to safer levels.  This would leave policy makers with more scope to offset the effect of future negative growth shocks and to protect the employment and living standards of Irish residents. <br\/><br\/>I thank the committee again for the invitation to appear today and we look forward to your questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016091300002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473768300,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Thank you Professor McHale.

This is one place where we have to be careful to respect our mandate, in that it does not really allow us to get into giving advice or making suggestions for the composition of spending increases or tax cuts.  My remarks, therefore, will have to be a bit more general rather than making specific recommendations on capital spending.<\/p> <p>  One thing we have observed and on which we have produced an analytical note is that currently public investment or public capital spending is low by our own historic standards as well as by international standards.  Even though recent increases in planned capital spending have improved the situation somewhat, public capital spending is still just about keeping up with the depreciation of existing capital stock.  There is some positive net investment but it is not very large.  That is the background.  <\/p> <p>  One of the issues that has come up a lot and which is implicit in the Deputy's question is whether the existing fiscal rules overly constrain capital spending.  I wish to say a few words about the fiscal rules themselves first because they have come under a lot of attack.  One of the reasons countries have these fiscal rules is that often the democratic process can create a tendency towards a deficit bias, which is not surprising in the sense that politicians have to get re-elected and their time horizons are thus that bit shorter than those of a body like the IFAC.  Fiscal rules serve the function of pulling countries back, when the deficit is getting too large or the debt levels too high, to something more appropriate to the economy for the long term.  <\/p> <p>  In the Irish case, the deficit bias problem is not too serious.  There is a real understanding of the damage that excessive deficits and debts can do and so there is a natural tendency anyway, within the political process, to pull that back.  However, a key problem in Ireland in the past has been that in good times when we had revenue surges, often when we were running budget surpluses rather than deficits, we introduced tax cuts and increases in spending which were very difficult to reverse once the revenue surges reversed.<\/p><p>We saw that during the property bubble and there is a danger that it might occur again with the recent surge in corporation tax.  One aspect of the fiscal rules that is very beneficial in stopping it from happening is the expenditure benchmark because it constrains overall expenditure growth, net of discretionary tax changes, to be in line with the underlying growth in the economy.  That is a positive aspect of the rules.  On the other hand, if the rules are at odds with what we might consider optimal fiscal policy then we should be concerned about the rules.<\/p><p> I know that many are concerned that the rules might be taking us away from optimal fiscal policy.  It is true that if we were following optimal fiscal policy, we would want to undertake investments which have a positive net financial return.  One could argue that the ideal rules would actually exclude net investment from the overall calculation of the deficit target and there have been developments at a European level to look into possible modifications of the rules to exclude at least certain categories of net investment.  That is a positive development.  That said, there is one other question that we need to ask.  Even if we were concerned that the rules were not most effectively designed and that they should be making more of a distinction between current and capital spending, we still have to ask if the overall deficit target that we are aiming at is correct.  In this, we must take into account that we still have a very high debt and need to bring it down.  The only way we can really bring that debt down is by bringing the deficit down towards a balanced budget position.  We also have to recognise that there are strong, underlying demographic pressures that will be going on for a number of years to come.  Professor John Fitzgerald in an article published last week pointed out that there is annual growth of 3.5% in the number of pensioners, just to take one example of those underlying demographic pressures.  Therefore, even though we might be concerned that the rules should be making more of a distinction between current and capital spending, given the need to bring the debt down and given the demographic pressures, we probably should be running a reasonably sizeable current budget surplus and an overall budget that is reasonably close to balanced is probably not inappropriate in the current circumstances.  This means that we have difficult decisions to make.  We certainly do not want to squeeze capital spending but we must take into account the demographic pressures and the need to bring the debt down, while still aiming for something close to a balanced budget, which the current fiscal rules do.  It is a somewhat long-winded answer but I am saying that while people have raised issues about the fiscal rules, where we end up in terms of the overall deficit target seems to be broadly appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016091300002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473768300,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McHale for what was quite an extensive answer.  He made reference to a positive net financial return from investment.  Is there any leeway for us there if we can show that the investment will bring money back into the Exchequer over time?  It is a concern that we are only just keeping up with the depreciation of the national capital stock.  I feel that my question has not really been answered in terms of assisting this committee in drafting its report and doing its job.  One of the key issues we have discussed at length is capital investment and the need to stimulate the economy.  In the context of current low interest rates, would we be foolish not to capitalise on that?

The rules are constraining at the moment in terms of the investment that we can undertake.  What we have is an overall deficit target that includes both capital and current expenditure.  I can see that with the backlog of investment projects - a lot of investment was postponed during the crisis - and the current low interest rate environment, one might ask why we are not undertaking those investments.<\/p><p>There is a strong logic to that.  However, if one is going to do it on-balance sheet in the general Government accounts, one faces these overall deficit targets.  What I was trying to do was to recognise the power of the argument the Deputy is making, because there is much economic logic to it, but it would be a positive development to develop the rules to make more of a distinction between current and capital so one does not face these types of constraints.  However, even after recognising that, the point I was making is that one must still look at the overall deficit.  There are also other factors, including the fact that we have this very high debt and the demographic pressures.  Ultimately, the deficit we are aiming at is still appropriate notwithstanding the correctness of the argument the Deputy is making, that there should be more of a distinction in the rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016091300002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473768300,"counter":139,"content":"<p>That is a job for us to work on into the future at European level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016091300002#U00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473768300,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016091300002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1473768300,"counter":141,"content":"<p>That brings me to my final question.  There is a theme throughout Professor McHale's document.  He says that the Government should take advantage of the current relatively strong growth in revenue to eliminate the remaining budget deficit and accelerate the reduction in debt ratio, and that it should take also advantage of the current strong growth in the economy to reduce the debt to safer levels.  Earlier in the document, Professor McHale says that the council assesses that the Government's current plans for a &euro;1 billion package in budget 2017, on top of the pre-committed expenditure increases for 2016 and 2017, is at the limit of the range of prudent policies.  There appears to be a cautionary tone in that.  The Central Bank told us last week that it proposes that we should go further than the 60% target and reduce it past that.  Does Professor McHale agree with that assertion?  Second, does he agree with the budget package we are putting in place?  Are we going a little too far or would he be more cautious in his approach this year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016091300002#U00400","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473768300,"counter":142,"content":"<p>In terms of the debt target, that is somewhat down the road because it will take some time to bring the debt ratio down.  It is useful to remember that in 2007 we had a debt-to-GDP ratio of 25%.  That was not enough to avoid the crisis and we ended up losing our access to market borrowing, even though we went into the crisis with a very low debt-to-GDP ratio.  However, it probably was essential to us avoiding default.  We could have had a much more serious crisis if the State had been forced to default.  One can see that even with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 25% to begin with one can still get into trouble.  Currently, we estimate that if one makes an adjustment to GDP which we do based on revenue - we can get into the technical details of that if the Deputy wishes - the debt-to-GDP ratio last year we estimate at 97% of GDP.  It is a very different situation from the one with which we went into the crisis.  That is an unsafe debt level.  We are not forecasting that a crisis is going to occur in the near term, but one can think of many things that could go wrong, ranging from a new crisis in the eurozone and the effects of Brexit being much more serious to a long list of risks to which one can point.<\/p> <p>  What we want to do is bring that debt ratio down in a phased way, and first down in the direction of 60% of GDP.  It is worth noting that under the rules that currently exist, we have a medium-term budgetary objective to get the deficit, adjusted for cyclical factors, down to 0.5% of GDP.  Once one goes below 60% of GDP one is allowed to run a deficit of 1% of GDP.  If one kept at that and there was a nominal growth rate in the economy of 5%, one would eventually converge down to a debt-to-GDP ratio of just 20% of GDP, which is a little below what we had when we went into the crisis.  Even under the current rules we are on a path to bring the debt down to much lower and safer levels.  Whether it is necessary to have a supplementary target for the debt beyond that, as below 60% of GDP, it might be helpful, but already we are on a path, if we stick with the rules, to a debt-to-GDP ratio that would be in very safe territory.  It is still a long way away to get there, but the important thing is that we bring it down in a phased way so that we reduce the risk the economy faces.<\/p><p> We note in the report that the size of the package is more than the &euro;1 billion.  There is &euro;900 million of spending already committed for demographics, the Lansdowne Road agreement and some capital spending.  There is also the &euro;540 million that was announced for this year in June, so the overall package, taking together the new measures taken in 2016 and planned for 2017, is &euro;2.4 billion.  From an economic point of view, we still see that as a slightly contractionary stance.  It is lower than what could be possible, given the underlying growth in the economy, but that is necessary, given that we are still in the process of bringing the deficit down towards the medium-term objective of 0.5% of GDP.  We need to do that if we are going to have that further improvement in the deficit.  Our view is that that is still a prudent policy in terms of what is being planned, but it is now at the limit.  Our concern is that we basically said the same thing last year based on the planned use of the &euro;1.5 billion of fiscal space, but the overall package turned out to be twice that, given the increases in spending announced through the Supplementary Estimates process.  We would not like to see a repeat of that.  That is why we are drawing attention to it.  However, if the Government were to stick to that, we would see that as being consistent with a prudent policy and with the policy of bringing the deficit down and putting the debt on that phased path towards safer levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016091300002#U00500","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473768300,"counter":144,"content":"<p>That is a really important point that Professor McHale has just made - that we are at the upper limit of prudent policy, in his opinion, and that Supplementary Estimates throughout the year might bring us past a prudent position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016091300002#V00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1473768300,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McHale and his colleagues.

It has no international standing and nobody else recognises the manner in which the council is calculating the ratio.  Its task is to ensure that we comply with the fiscal rules but they do not mean anything unless one wants to believe that we reduced our debt to GDP ratio by 27% last year.

Putting aside any issues of international comparisons, we need to know what the situation is here.  Between 2014 and 2015, by the measured numbers the ratio fell from 105% of GDP to 78% of GDP.  This massively exaggerated the improvement and underestimated the extent of the debt we have.  The first thing to do is get a better understanding of how things are changing over time, and the level of debt relative to the output of the economy.  When we look at the debt-to-GDP ratio we are trying to compare the debt to the revenue potential of the economy, and GDP could be taken as a measure of the revenue the economy could generate.  Given that GDP is problematic and inflates the true measure of activity in the economy, we go directly to examining the debt-to-revenue ratio.  This is an unfamiliar number, so we scale it to make it comparable to the type of debt-to-GDP numbers with which people are familiar.  There we take advantage of the fact that the revenue-to-GDP ratio was constant between 2011 and 2014, at approximately one third.  We rescale revenue using the ratio for 2014 and this gives us a way to see the true improvement.  By this measure, rather than going from 105% to 78%, it goes from 105% to 97%, with further improvements taking place this year.  This shows there is improvement, but it is nothing as dramatic as we see with the headline numbers.  It underlines the fact it is still very high and unsafe.

There are choices to be made.  Some may not be continued or inflation may not be kept up with fully for benefits.  These are political choices.  At least there is a recognition before commitments are made that these pressures will use up much fiscal space and that that space may not turn out to be there if there is a desire to maintain the existing level of services and benefits.

On the measurement of economic activity and gross domestic product, GDP, as the previous speaker said we are in a bit of a mess in that regard.  The Central Statistics Office is speaking about using two sets of figures.  I do not believe there is anything wrong with giving us the genuine debt and the real economic activity figures.  It is not legal, however.  EUROSTAT accepts certain measurements can be used, meaning we can have different sets of figures.  How helpful are these, however?  Last week, the chief economist from the Central Bank told the committee about a uniquely Irish bespoke set of economic indicators which would strip out aircraft leasing and intangibles and that would be the way to measure GDP.  We can then go to Europe and elsewhere to sell this as a new way of measurement.<\/p><p>How realistic is that, particularly given the headline figures that went around the world as a consequence of the distorted figures?  It seems that we are blaming the fire alarm for the fire rather than addressing the fire in the first place.  Part of the explanation is that we have a restructuring of company assets and we had capital flows as a consequence of the ending of the double Irish, which is to be phased out by 2020.  Will that continue for the next number of years?  Will we see more restructuring and capital flows and will this further distort the figures?  This is a real problem for us because that is how we measure and apply the fiscal rules such as debt to GDP so we need to have a real hard look at it.  We can come up with all sorts of different figures.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council can have its figures, the CSO can have a different set of figures and the Central Bank can have its view but I am concerned about, and we should be concerned about, how they are interpreted in Europe and internationally and how they apply to the actual fiscal rules and the budgetary process.  What is the witnesses' response to how we deal with that mess?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016091300002#BB00700","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473768300,"counter":189,"content":"<p>There is no doubt that the revised national accounts were completely unexpected and the impact of some of these changes was not expected.  In respect of how we react to that, the CSO says that there is an ongoing process to look at this and what the solution might be.  I do not think we will end up with a situation with a bespoke Irish measure of national income.  In respect of the process of coming up with methods of national accounting, by international standards, it takes years to come up with these approaches.  The manuals run, not to hundreds of pages, but thousands.  I do not think the best response we could come up would be an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  The Central Bank has tried to strip out some of the things with its measure of domestic demand, which is a measure we also use.  It involves stripping out the effective intangibles and aircraft leasing.  It is not perfect but it does provide what might be called a measure of underlying growth relating to the impact if we can ignore these effects.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the 2015 figures, it is expected that it is a level shift so, primarily, it should happen once and one should return to more normal growth rates, whatever they might be in the Irish case.  It is not really expected that something of this scale will happen again.  The Deputy mentioned the impact of company restructurings and the abolition of the double Irish but, as he said, that is not happening until 2020 so it is not clear that companies would respond now to something that would not really have an impact until 2020 or 2021.  There are various other distortions relating to US companies and their views on inversions where they wish to escape their US incorporation and merge with a smaller foreign entity.  Many of them are choosing Irish companies to merge with and the US has moved to try to restrict that, but we are still not sure whether that will fully affect it.  It did stop one major pharmaceutical company from inverting with an Irish company that itself had become Irish as a result of an inversion.  I do not think we expect to see something of this nature happening again but we simply do not know.<\/p> <p>  We will have the 2015 figure that will show a massive jump - a big step effect - and from then on, we should return to more normal levels of growth but given the state of the Irish figures, that is quite hard to say.  In terms of how we react and how they feed into the fiscal arithmetic, 2015 will remain an issue and as has been mentioned previously, steps are in play to smooth it out involving looking at happened in 2014 and what one expect to happen in 2016 and possibly taking a step in 2015 rather than including it.  I do not think the CSO will say that this is a new denominator that we should use for fiscal rules.  These rules are in legislation.  They must have international comparability.<\/p> <p>  Our view concerns what the improvement is, particularly given the adjusted debt ratio.  We are not saying that the debt ratio is 97% of GDP.  We are saying that if we take it as being 105% in 2014 and one makes an adjustment for how much revenue the Government is bringing in, adjusted measure would be that it improved by eight percentage points so it is improving.  It is not a measure that other countries use so one cannot ask what it is in terms of France or Germany but I get the point that our debt remains high.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the EUROSTAT figures, there was an increase in output in Ireland.  We are not disputing that the figures are wrong but the key issue is who are the beneficiaries of that output.  Given the huge role of multinationals in the Irish economy, if they have significant profits, we are getting perhaps a corporation tax cut of that, but if those profits go to foreign shareholders, they are not improving the Government's ability to service its debt.<\/p><p>That is the key message we are trying to get across.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016091300002#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473768300,"counter":191,"content":"<p>My final question is in two parts.

Are the witnesses concerned about the sustainability of those figures?<\/p> <p>  Regardless of what tax it might be, if we were to phase out or abolish taxes that are billions of euro, it is of a huge scale.  There must be some opinion on that and on making budgetary decisions that are based on corporation tax rates where there was a spike and on the basis of eventually phasing out taxes or eroding the tax base to the extent that might happen over the next number of years.  What are the witnesses' views on that?<\/p> <p>  It is very interesting to hear some of the voices that shouted loudest in support of the fiscal rules now looking for flexibility and talking about the rules being a strait jacket.  IBEC is one of those.  It is welcome that we are trying to get more investment in terms of capital investment but IBEC talks about taking the fight to Brussels to allow the investment strait jacket to be loosened.  It then makes an argument that we should only pay down the interest on our debt and not on the capital.  It was a unique and novel suggestion from IBEC.  How tenable is it?  <\/p> <p>  While the witnesses are limited to discussing capital investments, IFAC published a very significant document, which I have here, on capital investments in which it talks about very depressed levels of capital investment.  The European Commission is on side.  IBEC, trade unions and almost all the groups that have come in have said that we have had a capital investment strike and we need to invest more.

One issue is that it jumped up so quickly.  We are not predicting that it will fall but if it can rise so quickly, there clearly is the potential for it to fall again.  We have assessed the volatility and predictions and forecasting of various tax heads.  Corporation tax is the one that shows one of the highest levels of volatility and has the greatest difficulty in forecasting it.  The revenue is coming in, and coming in quite strongly.  If one considers what happened last year with supplementary spending, if that is being done on the basis of corporation tax receipts that are volatile, one can put in those changes in spending but can one be sure the funds will be there in the future?  There is nothing there to say there is a major downturn in corporation tax receipts likely but caution should be practised when looking at it, particularly as to how concentrated it has been as was mentioned.  Ireland does not appear to be unique.  It is something we have looked at.  Other countries seem to have a reasonably similar concentration of corporation tax but they do not seem to have the volatility in the receipts.  It seems to be an issue we should take greater care of.  It is highly volatile and the sustainability issue is because this year we are seeing it rise, yet next year it could fall.  Should we be basing spending, as one would expect to do on a weekly, monthly, and annual basis, on something that is as volatile as that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016091300002#DD00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Coffey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473768300,"counter":193,"content":"<p>On investment, we talked earlier about the fiscal rules and investment and the fact there is a clamour in many countries at the moment to say, particularly with interest rates so low, that we should be investing more and not be limited by the fiscal rules.  There is some flexibility there in the fiscal rules on investment.  It is very limited and it applies only where one is making a major investment that is equivalent to a structural reform, namely, reforming an area through capital investment and it will bring returns to the Government over the future years.  It is very limited; it only applies to 0.5% of GDP on a once-off basis so it is not really relevant.<\/p><p>The real difficulty in trying to exclude investment is that there are many items that are regarded as investment which may not be bringing much of a return and then other things that are classified as current expenditure, for example, in the education area, that really do have a return.  Trying to do it on a general basis and defining what should and should not be allowed in would always be a difficult matter.  In my days in the Department of Finance many years ago, there was always a difficulty of trying to look at the rate of return on investment.  John FitzGerald and the ESRI were doing a lot of work in this area for us on Structural Funds and trying to identify rates of return etc., so it is possible.  One would get back to what John McHale was saying earlier that even if one looks for some flexibility, one would still have to look at the overall deficit in the country and determine whether that level of deficit was appropriate.  It may be appropriate to do a little bit more on investment and increase the deficit but one certainly could not say that any amount of investment, no matter how much or what it is being spent on, should be added to the existing deficit.  We are required and need to get our deficit down.

The Deputy is correct that if one can make an international comparison, although there are massive difficulties in terms of getting a common denominator to compare across countries, Government revenue in Ireland is substantially below the OECD average.  The question becomes why Government is revenue below the OECD average.  In the main it comes down to social insurance contributions.  If one looks at income tax, sales taxes like VAT, corporation tax, which is now above the OECD average, and other taxes, we are close to the average for most of them.  There might be differences in how we collect the money.  With income tax, we are close to the OECD average for the amount of money collected but we collect it in a much different manner from other countries.<\/p> <p>  The big issue with social insurance is how we run our pension system.  We are a much lower Government revenue raising country than other OECD countries but equally we are a much lower Government spending country, particularly on pensions.  We tend to have a flat-rate pension system where one makes contributions and benefits are flat-rated based on the number and length of contributions, whereas in most other countries they have contribution-based systems where a person who puts in more money gets more money back.  Our system is much more redistributive.  Those on higher earnings make much greater contributions and those on lower incomes make a smaller contribution but everybody gets the same pension.  One of the key drivers of the difference, which is quite substantial, is down to social insurance and how we run our pension system.  There is ongoing debate in Ireland about how we should change it.  If it were to change, it may end up with people actually giving more money to the Government, but equally then they just get it back.  It would be a form of a long-term saving scheme.

It is Apple, not being able to pay tax anywhere anymore, re-domiciling its IP or whatever and its non-domiciled headquarters here.

There are still some uncertainties about all of the causes of that surge but it does seem that the on-shoring of assets, which was also behind the big rise in GDP, was a contributing factor.  Mr. Coffey told me before we started that I should be more cautious than I have been in saying that on-shoring of assets was the real driving force but I think we all know that it certainly was a driving force.  Whether there are other factors at work is something we still have to find out.  Maybe that should have clued us in a little bit more because we were really puzzled by that.

In terms of the surprise element of it, was any consideration given to the fact that something might happen and what was the gap between what the IFAC thought might happen and what actually happened?

In terms of a new measure of the economy that would complement GDP, it really is, at least initially, if not for the longer term, for our own use.  We need to understand the level of domestic activity in the economy.  That said, it is not easy.  Both Dr. Conefrey and Mr. Coffey are on the new committee that is working with the CSO to consider alternatives.  On the one hand, one can argue that there are now elements within GDP that are not part of Irish economic activity - much of what is known as contract manufacturing, for example, which does not affect Irish employment or Irish incomes.  In some senses, it is a contaminant in there that is leading to a distorted measure of domestic activity.  The challenge is to come up with measures that do not have those contaminants while not cutting out a bunch of stuff that we are actually interested in.  In this report we have come up with a number of alternative measures, but they all cut stuff out that we might be interested in.  When one looks at domestic demand, for example, one is cutting out net exports.<\/p><p>When one looks at gross value added, excluding industry, one is getting rid of the stuff that is distorting things but one is also getting rid of all of the rest of industry and one does not want to do that.  No matter what measure one looks at, it is a trade off between getting rid of the stuff that is distorting things and maybe getting rid of other stuff that one really does want to measure.  These guys face the challenge of using the data as it exists at the moment to try to identify measures that really give one a better sense of the activity that is taking place in the Irish economy.<\/p><p> In respect of the 25%, I also mentioned that our debt to GDP ratio, appropriately measured as we see it, is probably around 100% of GDP.  If the crisis had started off with a debt to GDP ratio of 100% of GDP, we would almost certainly have defaulted.  Remember we went from 25% of GDP to 120% of GDP and lost access to markets but we avoided default, taking advantage of some outside assistance.  If we had gone from 100% of GDP to 220% of GDP, there is no way we would have got through it without defaulting.  We would have had a far more serious crisis that we might still be in rather than the recovery mode we are currently in.  That gets back to the need over time to get to a safer level so that if some negative event should affect us again, we are in a stronger position to deal with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016091300002#OO00700","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473768300,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I am going to reply on the VAT question.

Coming up to Brexit and searching exchange rate movements that may have affected what was going on in the economy, the main effect of Brexit is the uncertainty created for investment for the future because Brexit has not happened.  It is not going to happen for quite some time so it should not have an immediate effect on consumer behaviour or business generally apart from its investment.  I do not think we should be looking at Brexit as the reason for the VAT receipt shortfall any more than the income tax shortfall that is also behind profile.  We must wait and see.  The underlying consumption figures - the consumer expenditure figures - seem to be quite good so it is difficult to understand that shortfall.  Hopefully, it is just a timing thing in terms of receipts.  We are putting too much emphasis on Brexit.

Perhaps there is an opportunity in it.<\/p><p> I apologise for looking at my phone.  I take the Chairman's comments earlier about paying attention to the meeting but there is a quote from the Taoiseach, who I do not often quote, that I wanted to get.  In his nomination speech after he was elected on 10 May, he said, \"While on the international stage, the official record of the life of Ireland is one of exceptional growth and recovery, it is in the lived experience, the personal experience that the national life is revealed.\"  He went on to say, \"... I am anxious that the national record of the life of the time, be it the surge in tax receipts or the headlines on growth, must be more in tune and aligned with the personal record, the lived experience of the people\".  I thought that was a really good summary of the fact that this gospel economics must change.<\/p><p> I was also looking at the council's assessment of its mandate.  I looked at the wording, which I am sure was chosen very carefully.  It involves an independent assessment of the macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts published by the Department in the stability programme update and in the budget.  In this process during which we are trying to reconsider our budgetary analysis and in light of whatever we must do for the European fiscal rules, could we not use it as an opportunity to develop economic metrics that follow the instructions from the Taoiseach, which are that they are in tune with the lived experience of the people?  In response to Deputy O'Connell's point, Professor McHale said that the council was looking for metrics.  Why not be ambitious and take the sustainable development goals and apply them to quality of life indicators?  I know this is a difficult thing to do but it may give us exactly what the Taoiseach is looking for, namely, a form of economics that is more in tune with, or more useful for assessing, the lived experience of people than just bald GDP growth or inflation figures.  It is a very broad philosophical question but it is right at the moment because we have seen that, in respect of simple adherence to growth figures on their own, they are not necessarily gospel.<\/p><p> The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is another person I would not usually quote as my first source of wisdom but he got it absolutely right when he asked in the national economic dialogue whether in respect of assessing our budgetary process we can get away from just assessing if it should be &euro;1 billion or &euro;1.2 billion and look at the lump sum of our expenditure and come up with answers as to whether we should stop spending in certain areas.  Is the council unable to give us an independent assessment of this?  Could we look at the productivity of our expenditure within the public expenditure area as one of the ways of assessing our progress or success rather than just looking at the headline quantum?  As one example, could we do this to try to assess the productivity output of the public service, the money we are spending?  This is particularly important at the moment because unless we have a baseline indicator of productivity, however we might want to measure that, how are we going to assess the next phase of our economic public service issues around, for example, pay issues after the Lansdowne Road agreement?  Connecting pay increases to productivity increases that are real is surely the lesson from the crash.  The benchmarking process was not capable of delivering that assessment.  In response to an earlier question, Mr. Tutty said that the Department of Finance is looking at different metrics of performance measurement and so on.  Can the council get involved in this, especially in assessing how innovative our public service is and what sort of output improvements we will get?  Can we take that into account as part of a revised assessment of economic performance?  It is tough but if we do not do that, economics is not connected to the real-life experience of our public servants as well as our people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016091300002#PP00500","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473768300,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I am delighted to see that Deputy Ryan is so ambitious for us because these are certainly big tasks.<\/p><p>On the Deputy's first question on the measurement issue, there is no doubt that gross domestic product, GDP, even if there were no problems of the sort we have been dealing with this summer, is an extremely limited measure of what matters in a society or even in an economy and it needs to be supplemented by many other measures that would give better measures of well-being that take into account environmental and income distribution issues.  I agree with Deputy on the broader measurement challenge and considerable work is being done to come up with better measures.  The Deputy is probably familiar with Stiglitz's and Sen's committee work on alternatives to GDP.  However, we also need something like GDP to the extent that it measures the economic output of a country.  We tell our students that GDP is a measure of the goods and services produced in a country in a period of time.  However, because of various changes to the measurement and the fact that elements such as contract manufacturing have come in - the Central Statistics Office, CSO, follows the rules precisely, so this is no criticism of it - GDP is not measuring the economic activity in the way we need to underpin economic and budgetary policy.  In a sense there are two separate issues.  We need to go much further in terms of those broader measurement issues but we also need to have measures of domestic economic activity, and if GDP is not going to do it, we need complementary measures.<\/p><p> With respect to Deputy Ryan's second question, this is a theme that has come up through the meeting with respect to the council's mandate.  A mandate was given to us.  We did not decide it.  It was set down in legislation.  We try to respect it.  It has four elements to it, namely, assessing the macroeconomic forecasts, assessing the budgetary forecasts, assessing compliance with fiscal rules and assessing the fiscal stance as measured around the deficit, but it does not get into questions such as the issue the Deputy raised about the productivity of expenditure.  There are other bodies that get into that space.  The ESRI does work that certainly relates to that.  A good deal of work is going on within government on assessments and evaluations of particular programmes.  Perhaps there is scope to expand the mandate of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, in the future but for the moment we respect the mandate we have been given.  We go into some issues in terms of the overall planning and control of expenditure and there is a section in the pre-budget statement indicating that we will continue in ongoing dialogue with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the way expenditure is planned and controlled, but I will not go into the details of that here.  That goes into the areas that we consider to be within our mandate, but on the broader issues of examining the productivity of public expenditure, we see that as going beyond our mandate.  I take it as encouraging the fact that the Deputy considers the council would have valuable things to say on that.  I am sure councils in the future would be very open to potential expansions in terms of what the council is required to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016091300002#QQ00200","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473768300,"counter":282,"content":"<p>Mr. Tutty is itching to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016091300002#RR00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473768300,"counter":283,"content":"<p>When the proposal for a parliamentary budget office was brought up last year, a question arose as to whether the IFAC should be incorporated into it or should be that budget office.

I am president of the Irish Road Haulage Association.  The Irish Road Haulage Association, as Ireland's largest Government-recognised licensed road transport representative body, is committed to tackling the issues affecting its industry head on.  It seeks to build the future of the Irish road transport industry by developing and promoting industry standards, facilitating road transport operator education and training, educating end-users and securing an equitable business environment.  As the Irish Road Haulage Association sees the rising cost of motor, fleet, employer and public liability insurance, it should be noted that over the past year insurance premiums have increased across the board by between 50% and 100% and in many cases even more.  The following is a cost comparison with trucks in other member states: in Ireland a truck on a motor policy costs an average of &euro;5,000 per truck; in the UK it is &euro;3,000; in Belgium &euro;2,500; France &euro;2,500; Portugal &euro;2,400; Bulgaria &euro;2,500; Germany &euro;2,500; Poland &euro;2,000 and Romania &euro;2000.<\/p> <p>  We see several reasons for this increase.  There is a uniform approach by all brokers and underwriters both of which blame the judicial awards in Irish courts and the book of quantum.  The  insured will pick up the tab for the Setanta debacle regardless of what the courts determine to be the case because neither the Government nor the insurance companies will absorb the cost, it will just be passed on to the consumer.  The insured hauliers already operate in a very anti-competitive environment.  Insurance companies are using high reserves to reduce claims bonuses and raise premiums.  There is no competition in the market and those who are competitors are not competing, the insurance industry is very lax in fighting claims and there is a tendency to increase premiums as the preferred option.  If there is no competition it is easier to hike the premium than fight the claim.  The culture in Ireland is to claim as it is very easy to spend another person&rsquo;s money.<\/p> <p>  There are several threats to the haulage sector.  If an Irish haulier carries on operations it will become anti-competitive to the point of becoming a non-viable operation and go out of business.  It can take the business abroad to another European country and set up an operation whereby it can obtain a new EU haulage licence and halve the insurance cost.<\/p><p>The foreign-registered Irish haulage operator is a loss of &euro;250,000 per vehicle to the Exchequer and they are leaving in their droves.  Northern Irish haulage operators accessing the market in Ireland already have a distinct competitive advantage as they can avail of the benefits of not having to pay the HGV levy in Ireland, while also having the scope to claim the diesel rebate in the South of the country.  Such a competitive advantage is further enhanced as insurance premium increases are not being experienced to any similar degree as are being experienced in our indigenous haulage sector.<\/p><p> What follows are solutions to the problems and the way in which the Government can help.  We ask the Government to make provision for road haulage operators to source their own insurance in a neighbouring member state.  Can the Government change the operating field of the courts?  For example, can they make a claimant accept compensation and encourage him or her not to go to court?  On the issue of the claims culture in Ireland, can the Government fund a proper advertising campaign or even enact legislation that will result in imprisonment or fines for fraudulent claims and see that area policed?  The collective road haulage industry must be permitted to access the European Single Market to ensure its fleet.  There should be no difference in insuring trucks on continental territory, no matter where they are based, as long as they hold an EU registration plate.<\/p><p> Regarding the Government cap on reserves and the length of time reserves are being placed on incidents, insurers are using them to reduce claims bonuses and raise premiums.  The Government must encourage new entrants into the insurance sector.  There is no competition in the market.  The insurance industry is very lax.  Where there are enough competitors in what we see as a small market, they are not operating in a competitive fashion.  We must discourage the practice of blocking the market and allowing only one broker to quote for one insurance company.<\/p><p> We ask the Government to support our IRHA-led initiative of the driver apprenticeship programme.  We also ask for support for fleet and driver management.  The Road Safety Authority's current approach is to pursue companies for road traffic offences as opposed to the drivers.  The RSA feels that it cannot obtain a large enough financial fine from a driver and there are often repeat offenders appearing for different companies.  It is the company that is fined and not the offender.  We seek Government support for the IRHA HGV driver apprenticeship programme, which will commence in January 2017, with a view to counter-acting the critical driver shortage that is imminent.  All insurance providers should be encouraged to support haulage operators and the apprentices participating in this programme as it will ultimately mean proper training and should reduce insurance risk.<\/p><p> There are haulage operators formally based in Ireland who have had no choice but to open a transport office in a more competitive member state.  The Irish haulage companies that remain based in Ireland cannot continue to operate under the exorbitant costs associated with holding a fleet policy.  This will result in operators reflagging to alternative, more competitive jurisdictions, which will obviously result in job losses.  Urgent action and support from the Government must be undertaken in order to stem the loss of road haulage operators and subsequent job losses arising out of the current operating environment created by the rising cost of fleet insurance.<\/p><p> I myself put a scenario to insurance brokers at an open forum recently by asking the following question.  This is very important.  If a haulage operator was based in Ireland but was termed to be a continental haulier that is primarily carrying imports and exports to and from Ireland, thereby spending 90% of its time abroad and giving it a 10% chance of an accident in Ireland, on what basis could it blame the Irish Judiciary, the book of quantum or even the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB?  They were also asked what they believe is the basis for the increase on haulage operators that have no claims experience on the island of Ireland.  Neither of these questions were answered and they remain unanswered to date.<\/p><p> It is the opinion of the IRHA that the legislation that stops an Irish-registered vehicle from being insured by an out-of-State broker no longer fits the criteria of the European Single Market.  In essence, if an operator's licence can be obtained by an Irish citizen anywhere in the EU, it should follow that an Irish operator can obtain his or her insurance in any country in the EU.<\/p><p> I thank members for the opportunity to present on this very important matter for the road haulage sector in Ireland.  I would welcome any relevant questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Verona Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak.  Taxi insurance has increased, on average, by 60% across the board.  For those on the bottom level of premium, which was approximately &euro;1,000, insurance rose to &euro;1,600.  That is excessive but the worst case is when somebody has an accident, because there is then no limit on the increase that can be put upon them.  As a result of high insurance premiums a lot of drivers who were driving on their own licence have been forced to surrender that licence and drive for other people.  They were previously able to get block insurance but that is no longer the case.  Last year the cost for co-drivers, as they are known, went from &euro;1,040 to a minimum of &euro;3,000.  In many cases, drivers just cannot afford this.  A lot of them went into co-driving not just because of the cost of insurance but because the country's finances and bad economy meant they could not get finance for newer vehicles.  In a large number of cases, the change to working for somebody else was not bad for them but with the latest increases in insurance the situation is now unbelievable.<\/p> <p>  There are three main insurance companies for taxi drivers and another company acted through a broker in Rathfarnham.  The broker has now said it is no longer quoting for taxi insurance and has told its customers they will have to go elsewhere.  In many cases, the drivers who did go elsewhere could not get a quote.  When they get a refusal of a quote from three different insurance companies they can go to the insurance federation, who will get one of the companies to give them a quote.  Some of these quotes, however, are absolutely outlandish and exorbitant.<\/p> <p>  My third point concerns the new wheelchair-accessible licences that are being granted.  Some drivers just cannot get a quote unless they have three years' taxi driving experience.  How they can get this without insurance is beyond me but this is what the companies want.  One gentleman had driven a van for 23 years accident free but when he decided to go into taxi work, he got his grant for a wheelchair-accessible vehicle but the lowest quote he could get for insurance was &euro;9,500.  This does not make sense.  If fares were to increase to cover the higher cost of insurance, that would reduce the amount of work drivers got.<\/p> <p>  The problem, as we see it, is that there are only three insurance companies which quote.  Foreign insurance companies that could set up here will not do so because it appears the insurance companies will not divulge the full facts about what their costs and claims are.  The vast majority of claims are settled without having to go to court, wherein lies a huge problem.  Nobody knows what the figures are.  Have taxi drivers suddenly become very dangerous animals on the road, necessitating the rise in insurance premiums?<\/p> <p>  One of our members has driven for 11 years on the same licence and for the same man.  He has not had one accident but his insurance went from &euro;1,040 last year to &euro;3,000 this year.<\/p><p>It is just unbelievable.  Our problem is that there are only three insurance companies and there appears to be no encouragement from the State to attract other insurance companies that would be willing to quote for taxi insurance.  We would like to see the market much more open.  The situation is that there are only three insurance companies in this country but in the European Union there is an untold number of companies.  We would like to see some law introduced that would allow other companies to come in, see the figures for themselves, and to quote.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Herron","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I represent the car rental industry in Ireland.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to present the industry&rsquo;s particular issues relating to motor insurance and to provide members with a tourism perspective on the subject.<\/p> <p>  Licensed franchisees of all the leading international companies operate in Ireland.  There is also one subsidiary of an international car rental company.  A very significant proportion of the car rental business is conducted at the three main airports - Dublin, Cork and Shannon.  The industry is an important part of the tourism infrastructure and is critical to get tourists around the regions.  There is no point in marketing the Wild Atlantic Way unless one has a transport infrastructure to support it.<\/p> <p>  I will give members an idea of the size of the industry.  More than 626,000 rental agreements were concluded in 2015 at the major airports, and already in the first six months of this year, which has been another very good year for the industry, 323,000 rental agreements have been concluded.  Much of the recent national debate has been about the rising costs of motor insurance premiums.  The car rental industry has long lost the ability to procure insurance cover simply by the payment of an annual premium and therefore to a large extent operates on a self-insured basis.  That means the settlement of personal injury claims is in large part a direct operating expense for the companies.<\/p> <p>  International car rental companies have identified Ireland as having the highest risk liability costs for car rental operations.  One car rental company operating in Ireland, which is a direct subsidiary and not a franchised operation, has access to comparative data in other countries.  The company has seen its third party liability costs in Ireland treble in the past four years.  Those costs are now three times higher than its operation in France and twice as high as in Germany, Spain and the UK.  The company has had to increase its liability reserves by more than 200% to the point that its liability costs are now the biggest of any of its European operations.  After people and cars, risk liability is now the company&rsquo;s third biggest expense.<\/p> <p>  Car rental companies incur significant legal costs in trying to defend claims.  Unfortunately, most of those involved in motor accidents in rented vehicles are visitors to this country and will have gone home by the time claims are processed.  That makes processing claims and sourcing witness statements very time-consuming and costly and, to be honest, often very ineffective.  If one is on holidays in Ireland and is involved in an accident, when one goes home, does one really want to get involved later on, perhaps nine months or a year later?<\/p> <p>  The car rental industry is also particularly vulnerable to fraudulent and criminal activity as unsuspecting tourists are often preyed upon.  Criminals know the difficulty of securing evidence and the issues that arise relating to the presence of tourists in any ensuing court case.  We carried out a recent survey of our member companies which revealed that more than 20% of all claims are suspected to be fraudulent.  Many of the claims involve pure criminality, such as deliberately staged accidents where two cars crash into each other on an arranged basis, often with little damage done to either car, but usually resulting in multiple injury claims.<\/p><p>Such is the potential reward in Ireland for personal injuries car rental companies are suspicious that they are being targeted by criminals from other countries coming here to stage car crashes.  The Minister referred on the previous occasion to perverse incentives; that is certainly one of them.<\/p><p> Even in cases where minor injuries are reported, these staged accidents will usually have multiple claims resulting in very high settlement costs, particularly when associated legal costs are factored in.  A &pound;5,000 award for a whiplash injury in another country can in Ireland start with a recommendation of &euro;15,000 from the Injuries Board, be rejected and, following procrastination, finally yield a settlement or a court award of, say, &euro;23,000.  When legal fees on both sides are added, that punitive escalation can mean total costs can be close to &euro;50,000 for each claimant, and there are usually four or five claimants involved.  This type of incident, therefore, can cost significantly more than &euro;100,000, which is a direct operating expense on a car rental company.  One does not have to be a genius to work out that we cannot withstand too many of these in any year.<\/p><p> Industry representatives have met the Garda fraud squad and presented it with many examples.  We requested that a national Garda operation focused on claims arising from accidents in the car rental industry be initiated.  While we did receive helpful advice, the fact remains that there are very few prosecutions for making a fraudulent claim and, therefore, there is no real deterrent in this matter.<\/p><p> The chairman of the Council of the Bar of Ireland, refuting an insurance industry claim, admitted recently that while it may be that the level of damages awarded in respect of particular injuries in Ireland is greater than that in another jurisdiction, it was not so in respect of all claims.  Unfortunately, these particular injuries - soft tissue, whiplash etc. - are the very claims that predominate against the car rental industry, and from presentations already made to this committee, it would appear that 80% of claims are falling into that category.<\/p><p> While the various parties to the national debate argue over the extent of the increase in court awards, legal costs, effectiveness of the Injuries Board etc., the bottom line is that the car rental industry can testify to a significant impact from the rising cost of risk liabilities.  We understand that a review of the book of quantum is under way.  As the book of quantum is not a recommendation for compensation levels but merely a reflection of prevailing levels, our industry does not have much confidence that this review will alleviate our problems unless it is prepared to benchmark personal injury awards to a European norm for these whiplash and soft tissue damage claims.  We accept that anyone with a legitimate claim deserves an appropriate level of compensation.  However, why should that level of compensation be twice or three times what people in France, Germany or the United Kingdom receive?  A system that benchmarks personal injuries awards with other countries would help prevent fraudulent and spurious claims, reduce legal and other costs and help to maintain our tourism competitiveness.<\/p><p> Competitiveness will be key to continued growth in our tourism sector as, ultimately, tourists either pay for these exorbitant personal injury awards against car rental companies or, if the market does not allow the costs to be passed on, car rental companies do not survive.<\/p><p> In summary, the car rental industry needs a reduction in the level of personal injury awards for whiplash and similar injuries.  We need a reform of the Injuries Board procedures that prevent certain categories of cases being referred to the courts.  A reform of the Injuries Board procedures would seem to be the action that might provide the quickest win in this matter and, as suggested by the Chairman to the Minister on the previous occasion, we would welcome immediate action and urge all Oireachtas Members not to allow the legal profession to frustrate the necessary reforms in this very dysfunctional marketplace.<\/p><p> We need a reduction in legal costs and, in particular, in multiple legal fees in respect of single incidents.  An accident can lead to four or five personal injury claims resulting in four or five separate levels of legal fees and, in most cases, all from the one firm of solicitors.<\/p><p>We need improved deterrents to reduce the level of fraudulent claims and to assist Garda authorities and the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, to secure prosecutions.  Unfortunately, there is a wide gap between a car rental company believing a claim to be fraudulent and a successful court prosecution.  It is, apparently, difficult to prove intent to defraud.  Overall, we need a reduced cost environment for risk liabilities that helps and makes a contribution to sustaining a competitive tourism sector.

While we understand the substantive issue before the committee is private motor insurance, obviously we represent people who deal in large books of commercial vehicle motor insurance, public liability insurance, carrier insurance and property insurance.  All have risen so substantially in the past two years that they represent a material threat to the viability of many distribution and passenger businesses.  We have responsible companies and members such as Elsatrans Limited, which is represented here behind me, that on their own initiative and with our assistance have taken aggressive risk mitigation measures to lower the insured risks of their transport operations.  Despite this, however, they have also been penalised because the insurance market in general is hardening.  We believe that it is time to stop the national compensation culture that drives this excessive insurance cost and that it is absolutely necessary to address the ridiculous compensation payouts on the basis that they are victimless; they are not.  While they impose a real excessive cost on employers, householders, businesses and motorists, it is possible to tackle excessive cost.  For instance, we see no reason for whiplash injuries in Ireland, as many speakers have stated today, to result in the payment of multiples of the damages payable in the United Kingdom or on the Continent.  We see no reason for serial claimants and fraudsters to be able to enjoy the freedom to falsify or exaggerate claims without the threat of prosecution for a codified offence of perjury, which we lack.  There is no reason that insurers should not pay for rehabilitation of plaintiffs rather than paying them general damages and genuine claimants have nothing whatsoever to fear from this.  Moreover, there is no reason why we should continue to accept a system that functions effectively as a social welfare system for unscrupulous lawyers and litigants.<\/p> <p>  The joint committee by now has heard from many players on how and why insurance costs have escalated so much in recent years.  As we have stated, the escalation is not inevitable and our roadmap to lower insurance costs, which we provided to the joint committee, lists 52 recommendations on how we think it would be possible to so do.  We have made recommendations for operators of transport, insurers, legislators, the legal profession and the Courts Service, as well as for the enforcement authorities.  In addition, of a parochial interest to the transport industry is the need to provide for the insurance of young trainee and apprentice drivers, which is a particular issue at present.  More than half of these 52 recommendations are in members' gift, as legislators, to deliver.

I understand the cabotage issue and flagging in another country.  Does the IRHA have an assessment as to where the political fault lines are in opening up the insurance market for hauliers?  Up to 90% of our export goods are moved by road which means hauliers are absolutely vital to the economy.  We introduced a set of measures to reduce the motor tax element in budget 2016.  It seems now, however, that has been wiped out because of increased insurance costs.<\/p> <p>  I would like to get an idea as to how Irish hauliers are interfacing with European hauliers in opening up the market.  For instance, Aviva is an international insurance house.  If it can operate in the Irish market and other member states, I cannot see why there cannot be a greater degree of flexibility across boundaries, particularly as we have a Single Market and free movement of goods and services.

It is within the remit of the Department of Finance, which we know has had a report since 2012 that was never published.  It could have had this committee set up much sooner.  All we know is that under the EU regulation and the conundrum that causes in Irish legislation, we are precluded from accessing insurance on an Irish registration plate anywhere outside this country, which means that the insurer, underwriter and brokerage must be regulated here by the Central Bank.  As I said, this means that the operator has no choice but to move their operation.  They cannot simply insure their truck abroad.  They must move it to another jurisdiction to be able to operate in a competitive sphere.  Currently, I am operating against my own colleagues at twice their cost base.  They are operating at half of my cost base.  We flagged this two years ago.  Ultimately, as a sector, we will become foreign direct investment and that leaves the consumer wide open to me as a haulier coming into the market and charging what I like because an Irish competitive sector will no longer exist.  <\/p><p> We are looking for a meeting with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  If we were based in Brazil, we would probably have got it quickly but I am not sure if we are going to have a meeting.  We have some very serious issues.  We work off a five-point plan that we presented to the Minister when he held a meeting with us at the eleventh hour - an eleventh hour meeting during which he managed to reduce 8% of our income with the stroke of a pen.  He reduced our loading capacity from 42 tonnes back down to 40 and yet he expects us to absorb increases in excise duties on fuel, possible toll increases due to VAT and 300% increases in insurance.  I could go on.  This is a catastrophe for the transport sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Verona Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473760800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I do not want to give Ms Murphy platitudes.  I think we all appreciate the attendant costs that are being loaded on to the sector.  Our purpose here is to try to drill down.  My understanding is that there is a single European market for insurance.  I want to get to the nub of the interaction between the witnesses and the working group.  It appears that there has been no engagement so this committee could recommend that the people who have made presentations here today in respect of very specific points could carry forward and interact with the working group because this is vital.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the guidelines on injuries, I know we will use the big toe and little toe analogy.  The Injuries Board is basically telling us that the average payout on claims between 2009 and 2015 was approximately &euro;22,000 or &euro;23,000.  Mr. Redmond and Mr. McDonnell have touched on this issue.  We have to find a solution somewhere.  Notwithstanding the Supreme Court decision where there is the right to legal representation, and one takes that for what it is, it seems that if it has dealt with 100,000 awards since 2005 and the average payout is approximately &euro;22,000 or &euro;23,000, it appears that there is a multiple of that, which is not quantifiable at this point in time, where claims are paid out on the steps of the court.  This is where the data and lack of transparency come in.  This is where we will be engaging with the Law Society of Ireland in interrogating that dynamic as well as engaging with Insurance Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  The issue of cartel-like behaviour does come into play.  If Insurance Ireland has a finite membership composed of the bigger houses and if Zenith Insurance, which is exiting the market, is saying that it does not have access to data, it is clear that there is a blocking mechanism there by certain elements of the insurance sector to ensure there is incomplete access to information by either the Irish Brokers Association or some of the insurance players in the market.  If we can tackle that element, we can introduce data sharing among insurance providers.<\/p><p>If data sharing was introduced it would sort out the taxi drivers that Mr. Herron is representing.  To have a situation where there are only three insurance companies providing insurance for the Taxi Drivers' Federation seems to me to be a ludicrous scenario given the importance of taxis to how we operate.  I want to get a sense of the witnesses' perspective on or perceptions of how Insurance Ireland and its members operate and whether they perceive there to be a blocking mechanism in relation to data.  To return to the PIAB, if we could have transparency around the data from claims settled out of court, it would sort many of the people who are renting cars in this country.  It would sort many of the problems for the providers in that sector.  <\/p><p> I want to make one small point on the staging of accidents before I let the witnesses back in.  Mr. Redmond touched on the issue of soft tissue injuries.  He stated he had no confidence in the review unless it benchmarks against European Union norms.  If we had a situation here, for instance, whereby small claims for minor injuries such as whiplash were dealt with by things like vouchers for access to medical services, it could then be monitored on an ongoing basis.  Is that something that the witnesses' members would accept?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#O00200","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":362,"content":"<p>That is why we suggested rehabilitation in the first place.  If one looks at the French system for that, not alone do they have rehabilitation as part of their mechanism, but they also only permit diagnosis of whiplash from a confined field of specialists.  It is not a free for all.  I heard shock and horror from the legal profession last night that anyone would entertain the French system.  In France, one cannot go to one's GP and get a diagnosis of whiplash for insurance purposes.  One would go to a specialist.  I do not want to disagree with the IRHA but most of the underwriters in Ireland at the moment are non-Irish; they are substantial houses.  I will not mention any of the company names but one of our operators quoted her experience of going through the motor book.  The only company that gave her a quote is the one insuring the company.  It gave her a 35% increase on the previous year.  All the rest, which are household names, either quoted an unrealistic quote, showed no interest in winning the business, declined, exited the market or declined to quote haulage.  Ironically, the company that declined and will not quote haulage is insuring another member so I know they are quoting haulage.  We are definitely dissatisfied with what is happening in the market as far as underwriters are concerned.  Our services manager is an insurance professional and when we have spoken directly to underwriters, the message we are getting from some of the recently exited companies is that they recently entered the market and got burnt.  They stated they got burnt because of lack of information on the 70% of what was going on.

As Conor Faughnan noted the other day, it becomes a roulette wheel.  As I pointed out in my presentation, that &euro;23,000 becomes &euro;50,000 per individual and if there are two, three or four in the car who all have personal injury claims, it brings it to over &euro;100,000.  That is an operating expense for a car rental company to pick up.  Anything we can do to get these cases contained and ring-fenced in some fashion, and to get a settlement, is positive.

While the cost of the mirror is fundamental to our operations, the road safety aspect is most concerning.

We had already heard much of what was said in the past week from other contributors, but there are some very useful things in there.  I will start with hedge cutting.  If any members or witnesses have travelled the R312 from Mayo, they certainly know about the dangers of not having hedges cut, particularly in the context of high vehicles and the dangers that can arise.  We have met with hauliers in Mayo to discuss that very issue and to try to get it addressed.  It is a huge problem.  Obviously, the austerity faced by the local authorities, all of the financial burdens that have been put on them and the way the local government fund has been eroded over the years have a direct impact.  The solution is, therefore, that when the local authorities are preparing their budgets for this year, there should be a proper line in their submissions that would allow them to cut the hedges in such a way that vehicles, and the people travelling in them, will be safe on the roads.  That is one matter I will again take up with Mayo County Council.<\/p> <p>  The key point, which we came across last week as well and which seems to be building all the time, relates to the uniform approach.  We called it a cartel last year.  I am interested in what Ms Murphy is saying and I completely agree with her assertion that if there is even a sniff of a cartel, the matter should be investigated.  It appears that the data is available.  Who controls that data?  Where is it?  Is the Government not strong enough to be able to take that data and then have the actuarial resources that are needed to be able to analyse it in order to get to the truth behind what we, as a committee, are trying to do?  Again, that is something we will take away with us.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the European Single Market, again, I completely agree with Ms Murphy.  I would like to discover exactly who is stopping it and where are the blockages to which one of my colleagues referred.  Ms Murphy has outlined the big picture really well and the absolute threat to the economy that is being posed.  We made insurance compulsory and we mandated the private sector to provide it, but it is failing to do so.  It is also telling that brokers had no reply to Ms Murphy's questions about re-flagging.  The insurance industry and brokers seem content to shrug off the cyclical nature of this while we just need to wait it out.  Ms Murphy pointed out that the latter is not an option.  It is certainly not an option for this committee.  Her evidence is a reminder that it may be cyclical for the insurance industry but it is not cyclical for the rest of us.<\/p> <p>  I would like to discover the exact position regarding the 30% of operators and to establish how many of them have actually moved their operations abroad for legal or accounting purposes.<\/p><p>Is this being seriously looked at?  The European financial services integration action plan explicitly states that an integrated financial services market should generate significant economic benefit by promoting growth and employment in conformity with the goals approved by the EU Heads of State in Lisbon in 2000.  We are absolutely contravening this.  Five out of the big nine insurance providers in the country are based in Gibraltar.  There is a role for the Single Market in examining models to calculate the solvency of these companies.  How do we know how many more will go bust in the near future?  How will it leave us exposed as consumers?  My insurance has increased, but I could save almost &euro;200 if I paid it all now as opposed to running it over ten months.  This makes me wonder whether the insurance company will still be here in ten months' time.  Why is this &euro;200 included as an extra cost to people who can little afford it?  Those who can afford it can pay the amount up front, but why should those who cannot do so and who must spread the cost be penalised by paying an extra &euro;200?<\/p><p> Has an assessment been done on the impact of Brexit?  What are the main issues we need to consider?  I thank Ms Murphy for her presentation, which contained much detail and very good recommendations which we can implement.  I will come back in with questions for the other witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#R00900","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":406,"content":"<p>As did everybody else, we awaited the Brexit result and we are gathering data on how it will affect us.  The predominant issues are the Border and immigration.  As hauliers across Europe, we are best placed to tell the committee what the roads, byways and landlocked countries entail.  We are concerned that we are not being included and we will write to An Taoiseach to ask him to bring us into the consultation group.  Our drivers and hauliers and anybody who takes goods from Ireland across Europe will be the most affected.  We have a big concern about how North versus South will operate, particularly with regard to the competition we face against Northern operators.  They do not have to pay a road toll here such as the &pound;10 we must pay to access ten miles of the A5.  They can access our fuel rebate scheme by buying diesel in the South, which gives a double competitive advantage.  They get diesel cheaper than we do and have the advantage of the fluctuation in sterling.  Our closest neighbours operate with a big advantage over us.<\/p> <p>  The Government gave us a reduction in road tax, which brought us in line with Northern Ireland but gave us no competitive advantage.  We thought it would make us sustainable but unfortunately insurance has trebled so we have had no commercial benefit.  It was badly needed and if we had not got it many of us would have gone under or, probably, reflagged.<\/p> <p>  No matter what is put forward with regard to Brexit, we will be the most affected group.  We face the same regulation throughout the EU as all other member states, but we are an island nation off another island, and the effect of the tachograph regulation will mean that Irish goods are brought to market differently from what would be the case if Brexit had not occurred.  If the EU decides to introduce new regulations governing tachographs we will have severe problems.  We already have a severe problem in Calais, particularly regarding traffic coming to Ireland, and this will not go away.  They can build the wall of China or the Berlin Wall but it will not help with this problem.  It is a problem that is spread throughout the EU.<\/p><p>It is amplified in Calais, but we urge vigilance among all of our members regarding migrants.<\/p><p> Anything that will affect the operation of the tachograph regulation will be detrimental to Irish products accessing mainland Europe in the same way as other countries do.  It is incumbent on the Government to remember that we are an island off an island.  There should be a favourable consideration of this in the operation of the tachograph regulation, as it no longer fits the model following Brexit.  It is an EU regulation and everyone must adhere to it, but we do not know what Brexit will entail.  The operation may have to be remodelled, as it will be fundamental in getting our goods to market.  Our travel time could take as much as 12 hours longer than it does now.

He did not have specific claims in the motor fleet, but he did have some in the employer's liability, EL, and public liability, PL, areas.

Five of the ten appeals that have been put before the new appeals court to date have been halved on appeal.  If insurance companies are doing what they say they are doing, they must now be taking cognisance of the fact that awards are being halved on appeal.  Therefore, they should be basing their awards on half of what they thought they were paying out.  That is not happening.  Rather than recognising that appeals are being halved, they keep speaking about exorbitant claims.  It is incumbent on Insurance Ireland to collate data in the interests of transparency regarding how brokerages are paid by insurers and consumers.  I have no idea how much commission my broker receives from the insurance company by way of commission.  I know that when my motor insurance needed to be renewed this year, RSA quoted a price of &euro;12,900 to me.  When I went to the market, a quote of &euro;7,900 came back from a different company.  My initial broker told me that he would match it and he would not place it with RSA.  When I agreed to this and signed my insurance policy, my premium was placed with RSA.  This is about transparency and competition, of which there is none.  There is just nothing there.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure that Insurance Ireland can deal with any of this.  I refer to the manner in which brokers and underwriters are operating.  Insurance Ireland deals predominantly with regulation.  It is like obtaining a haulage licence.  If one wishes to obtain a haulage licence, one deals with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Road Safety Authority.  If one fits the criteria, one's licence will not come up for renewal for five years.  I am sure Insurance Ireland fulfils a similar function.  It does not do anything in between.  It does not seem to reprimand anybody.  I return to the fundamental fact that companies that are supposed to be competitors are acting in an anti-competitive fashion.  How are they being allowed to do so?  How are they back in a market that they say they did not charge enough for?  Once they sustain that, they can charge what they like.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#Y00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Verona Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1473760800,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Would Ms Murphy support an investigation by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission here or the EU Commissioner for Competition-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#Y00400","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":467,"content":"<p>Both.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#Y00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Verona Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1473760800,"counter":468,"content":"<p>-----to look at the Irish motor insurance industry?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#Y00600","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I would support an investigation by the most effective authority.

I do not imagine such a model would be fitting as a solution in the context of what we are here to discuss today.  This is a feasibility issue, a competition issue.

I worked in a legal environment for several years and there the IB is seen as a step to be got over.

Does Ms Murphy think that, as well as fraud, regulatory measures introduced in the context of doomsday scenarios - as they were in respect of marts and credit unions - when everything would crash and companies would need to be bailed out, are also a factor?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#DD00400","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":541,"content":"<p>Yes, that has certainly added to the situation.

Nobody appears to be doing anything about it.  We will go out of business all over the place before we have a decision from the EU competition authority, which could be five years down the road.  I do not think the investigation should stop but we need to take evasive action to deal with this in the short term.

The question on the minds of members and everybody else is simply what has caused this extraordinary, shocking and excruciating increase in motor insurance premiums in Ireland which we believe is over 38% per annum.  We say the answer lies within the closely guarded books of the insurance industry which each insurer seems remarkably reluctant to open to anybody outside of their own company.  For years all insurers engaged in a price war which saw them quote unsustainably low premiums while insuring bad risks.  The inevitable upshot has been an increase in premiums to restore profits and thereby compensate for these poor business decisions.  It is also common knowledge, although rarely admitted by the industry, that much of the profits emanate from the investment of the premium income.  It is abundantly clear to us that these returns have not been at remotely the same levels that would have been experienced in the past given the recent volatility of global markets.<\/p> <p>  While studiously ignoring these obviously significant factors in the manner of how it has conducted its business, the industry has conducted a long-running and widespread public relations campaign in which it has sought to blame everybody but itself.  Part of this has been a campaign of snide innuendo about the bona fides of personal injuries victims while reserving particular ire for the easy target of the courts and the lawyers who seek to obtain compensation for the innocent victim.<\/p> <p>  The campaign has included a number of stock phrases and pseudo facts which are either completely untrue or greatly embellished and which appear to have gone largely unchallenged.  What we seek to do today is to try to explain some of those pseudo facts that have been put forward and why they are not correct.  One thing that is said is that lawyers have found a way of bypassing the Injuries Board.  This simply is not true.  All cases must go to the Injuries Board.  In fact, it is only an insurer who can decide whether a case goes through the courts or not.  The vast majority of insurers want the case to go to the board and the acceptance rate has not changed in any way in the 12 years of operation of the Injuries Board.<\/p> <p>  There is an idea that lawyers have infiltrated the system.  Again, this is simply not correct.<\/p><p>Almost since the beginning of the Injuries Board, over 90% of claimants have been represented by a solicitor, at their own cost.  They choose to do so at their own cost.  This figure has not changed in any way since the operation of the Injuries Board and given the fact that it is the claimant who pays for the involvement of a solicitor, it clearly can have no effect on the level of premiums.<br\/><br\/>There is a suggestion that claimants wilfully do not show up for medical examinations.  Again, there is no evidence of this.  There is nothing whatsoever to back this up.  The Law Society meets with the Injuries Board twice a year.  We discuss matters of mutual interest on these occasions and at no stage has that issue been brought up with us.  Over eight years ago, we wrote a practice direction in our industry magazine, <i>The Law Society Gazette<\/i>, in which we urged all solicitors - lest there be any doubt - to persuade their claimants to go to medical examinations.  As we understand it, that is what happens.<br\/><br\/>There is a suggestion that lawyers are persuading claimants to turn down awards and that there is no penalty if they get less in court.  This is absolutely not true.  Of course there are occasions on which awards will be turned down, but there is a penalty if one gets less.  One simply cannot get costs if one gets less for an award in court and one may have costs awarded against one.  There is no incentive to turn down awards unless the person is going to get considerably more.<br\/><br\/>The suggestion that damages are going up and the judges ignore the book of quantum has been put out there on a regular basis.  Damages have not gone up.  The only manner in which they have gone up is in respect of what we see as the very large medical negligence awards for tragic birth injuries.  These do not relate to motor insurance premiums.  In fact, if one takes them out of the equation, one will find the awards have actually gone down marginally.  Judges are required to have regard to the book of quantum, under section 22 of the Civil Liability and Court Act 2004 and they do.  They are obliged to do so.  If they do not, the<font color=\"#FF0000\"><\/font>Court of Appeal<font color=\"#FF0000\"><\/font>is there to deal with any mistake a judge may make.  Of course, judges are human and they will occasionally get it wrong, but the Court of Appeal on a regular basis over the last nine months has overturned awards.<br\/><br\/>The one unheard voice in this debate is the most vulnerable and least represented, that is, the victims of road traffic accidents.  They have no representative organisations; there is nobody there to be their voice.  That is where the solicitor comes into it.  The impression is given that there are a large number of claims that are fraudulent and that whiplash claims are exaggerated.  No evidence has been produced to support these assertions and the reality is starkly different.  The provisions of the 2004 Act ensure that any exaggerated or fraudulent claims must be dismissed and provide for a mechanism for prosecuting claims by anyone who has exaggerated or fraudulently brought a claim.  While the Judiciary has dismissed claims in these circumstances and does so on a relatively frequent basis, there have been practically no prosecutions and we do not know why.  Are the insurers not pursuing it?  Is the Garda not pursuing it?  Whether or not that is the case, we know there are relatively few, if any, prosecutions for fraudulent claims.<br\/><br\/>The truth is that personal injury claimants suffer genuine and often very debilitating injuries and have only one voice, that is, their own solicitor or barrister.  The pejorative term &quot;whiplash&quot; that is used to dismiss the significance of neck and back injuries is very insulting to the many citizens of this country who have had their lives damaged and sometimes ruined by such injuries, caused by the negligence of others.  What is to be done?  We believe we must uncover the truth.  The Law Society calls for a new task force, along the lines of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, to establish the real reasons premiums are rising at an unsustainable rate and to make recommendations to deal with the problem.  Real and accurate data is key.  The insurance industry's black box must be prised open in the interests of everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#TT00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stuart Gilhooly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman and the members of the committee for allowing us this opportunity to come before them today.  We provided a written submission, which I commend to the committee.  I will start by focusing on some key points arising from that material.  First, I will identify the facts as we know them.  There has been no significant increase in the number of claims that have been processed through the Injuries Board in recent times.  A 6% increase in 2015 might be seen as reflecting increased economic and social activity and higher traffic volumes.  That mirrors the views of the Central Bank in its Bodily Injury Thematic Review in November 2015.  The levels of award by the board are also consistent with a modest 1% increase in 2015.  Second, the board has, in effect, succeeded in removing two thirds of personal injuries cases from unnecessary litigation.<\/p><p>There has been no significant increase in the number of claims going to court.  The High Court saw an increase of 2% in 2015 and the Circuit Court saw an 8% increase, which was expected given the increase in the jurisdiction.  This does not reflect the explosion of claims that has been alleged to have occurred by the insurance industry.  In 2015, there was an increase of 8% in the total amount awarded in the High Court and a 20% increase in the total amount awarded in the Circuit Court.  Again, that is not unexpected, given the jurisdictional increase in the latter court.  These figures do not reflect the allegations of soaring awards.<\/p><p> It should also be noted that there has been a major increase in medical negligence claims over the past few years.  During the period 2008 to 2013, the number of High Court medical negligence cases increased from 481 to 942, an increase of 96%, with further increases again in 2014 and 2015.  This has no bearing on motor insurance whatsoever and there is no comparison with the levels in motor insurance cases.<\/p><p> A person who sustains genuine personal injuries is entitled to be properly compensated for those injuries and the concept of reasonableness and proportionality is inherent in the exercise undertaken by a court in assessing the appropriate level of damages in each case.  Judges are independent and do not have any vested interest in the outcome of proceedings.  Contrary to popular belief, barristers' fees have fallen significantly in the last few years.  Published figures from the various State agencies show that professional fees fell by between 26% and 50% during the period 2006 to 2013 and these reductions are mirrored in other areas of private work.  We know that the Legal Services Regulation Act introduces a new costs regime that will ensure greater clarity around the principles to be applied by costs adjudicators in assessing costs.  That is a replacement for the existing taxation of costs system and we see no reason that provision should not be commenced as soon as possible.  That is within the capacity of the Minister for Justice and Equality to do at any time.  It is a provision of that Act which has been welcomed by all interested parties.<\/p><p> What to do about the insurance issues with which this committee is concerned?  We agree with the cacophony of calls for greater transparency and data sharing.  Data relating to settlements entered into by insurance companies is vital to provide greater clarity and to enhance our understanding of the claims environment and the factors contributing to rising motor insurance costs.  In 2014, for example, 71% of cases were settled privately by insurers and there is no information or figures available at all on the particulars of any of these settlements.  That is more than two thirds of all claims settled privately by insurers, with no information provided.  The book of quantum which has been referred to quite a lot provides a guideline of injuries and value ranges of damages appropriate to particular injuries.  It is not a recommendation for compensation levels but a reflection of the prevailing level of awards made by the courts, the Injuries Board, the State Claims Agency and the settlements entered into by insurance companies.  Obviously, however, the absence of the data relating to the private settlements entered into by the insurance companies greatly hinders this process.  <\/p><p> We also think that the business models operated by insurance companies warrant close scrutiny.  There is a &euro;1 billion discrepancy between the premium income of Irish insurers and the published awards.  This must warrant some form of investigation.  It has also recently been reported in the United Kingdom that insurance companies are overcharging motorists for cover despite certain measures, including the Government crackdown on the no-win, no-fee industry which has led to a significant drop in what are described as \"whiplash\" claims and which has helped the industry to save &pound;500 million in the past three years.  Despite this, the cost of premiums has gone up.  If the overall cost to the industry of such claims has dropped, then why have motor insurance prices in the UK continued to rise?  It is likely that insurance companies are trying to recover losses incurred from a period of imprudent pricing or bad management.  If this is the case and policy holders are being asked to pay extra to increase solvency in the financial services markets, then that needs to explained clearly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#UU00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul McGarry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473760800,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I agree with a lot of their analysis, particularly the clearing up of the so-called facts that have had too much influence on this debate to date.  That is not to say that, as part of the system which includes politicians, insurers and others, there is no role for legal practitioner to play in reducing premiums.<\/p><p>That is not to say that, as part of the system, there is no role for the legal system and legal practitioners in reducing premiums, as there is for politicians and insurers.  For some time now, including this morning, we have heard calls for whiplash to be singled out as a special case and for a special regime to be put in place for compensation for whiplash.  It has been suggested to me not only that this would be unfair, but also that it may well be unconstitutional.  As has been said, it was made clear in a recent Court of Appeal judgment that it is important that when compensation is awarded by the court in respect of pain and suffering, it should be reasonable and proportionate in all circumstances.  The court further stated that damages awarded for pain and suffering must be reasonable, having regard to the injuries sustained, and must also be proportionate to the awards commonly made to victims in respect of injuries which are of significantly greater or lesser import.  That would seem to imply that any sort of British-style care-not-cash system would be legally difficult to implement.  Do the witnesses have a view on whether such a scheme would be compatible with Irish law, or with the Constitution?  Likewise, this committee has heard calls for certain injuries or cases to be excluded from the courts.  Can the witnesses confirm that ultimately, each person has the right to seek damages in a court, regardless of the Injuries Board process?<\/p><p> I believe the main reason we are seeing increases is the insurance industry's investment policies.  No amount of spin can change that.  If there are other things we can do - things that should be happening in any event - we need to look to them.  For example, greater competition within the legal sector might help to bring down legal costs.  It is my understanding that the EU has cited the Law Society's current regulations regarding advertising by solicitors as being in contravention of the services directive.  Do the witnesses believe the advertising guidelines are fit for the modern world of smartphones and rapid transport?  I do not think anybody would agree that an American-style ambulance-chasing system would be an appropriate solution.  Given that there is always the likelihood of a judge awarding costs against an alleged victim, however, the \"no win, no pay\" line will not work here.  The EU believes the current system is illegal.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has reported on this wider issue, which is relevant to today's discussion.  The new Legal Services Regulatory Authority has the power to update these regulations.  In the opinion of the witnesses, will that help to reduce legal costs for people seeking insurance claims?  There has been a great deal of expectation regarding the revised book of quantum.  As we know, it is due soon.  Given that time has passed, it is likely the revised book it will show an increase in most awards, rather than a reduction that would be consistent with what we are trying to do here.  We have discussed the lack of transparency on the industry side.  Would it be possible to have an accurate updated book of quantum, given that the industry does not seem to be fully disclosing all of its data?  I appreciate that the witnesses do not speak for the Judiciary, but I would like to know whether they believe there is an appetite within the courts for a newer book of quantum.  In their opinion, will the judges use it in the way it is intended to be used?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#VV00200","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I will deal with a couple of the matters raised by the Senator.  Perhaps Mr. Murphy will come in on some of the other matters.  I will begin by responding to the Senator's questions about damages and the book of quantum.  It is fair to say that her analysis of the jurisprudence of the court of appeal - I think that is what she was reading from earlier - is a sign of a recalibration of how the courts are looking at damages.  I think she will find that in the past nine or 12 months, the courts have taken the view that damages must be in line with what society expects from its citizens.  In the past nine months, there have been at least five cases in which damages have been halved.  I think the courts are taking it on themselves to deal with this issue.  I think they would welcome a new book of quantum.  In recent years, many people have commented that the current book is out of date.  I do not doubt that it is out of date.<\/p><p>It remains to be seen what is in it.  From what we have heard in the media and from those who have seen it - I have not seen it - my understanding is that at the lower levels, strangely, it appears as though they are a little bit higher but at the higher levels, they are going to be lower.  Overall the damages would be a little bit lower in the book of quantum but I believe the courts are taking it on themselves to treat this matter very seriously.  We should place our trust in the Judiciary which, in fairness, under the Constitution has been appointed to award damages in the State.<\/p><p> We talk about \"care not cash\" which is a very specific plan that has been suggested in the UK.  It has not come into play there yet and is not due to be introduced there until April 2017.  It is almost impossible to see how it could work in Ireland because, first, we have a Constitution which the UK does not.  In terms of the practicality of how it might work, I cannot see any way in which it could work.  I am not sure how one would distinguish between the injuries to which it would apply and the injuries to which it would not.  It would also pose a severe danger of real injustice being done to victims who simply would not be able to understand the difference.  I do not think there is any prospect of that plan being successful in this country.  I do not believe it will even be successful in England.  Even if it does come about in England and Wales, it remains to be seen as to whether it will result in any reduction in insurance premiums.  We have seen that no matter what happens and what reductions there are in claims costs, premiums seem to go up.  They have been going up for the last two years and it is perfectly clear to everyone here that claims to costs have not been.  I hope that I have answered the questions.

With regard to care not cash, I understand the political sponsor of the idea, Mr. Osborne, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, is no longer in office, so it remains to be seen whether it will happen.  It is not in place yet so nobody can say what the effect of it will be.  It seems to us to be deeply troubling and a disturbing proposition from the point of view of the compensation of victims of injuries.  With the greatest of respect to this committee, which is clearly striving to hear all voices, and I absolutely accept the bona fides of the committee seeking to hear all voices on this issue, I wonder if it is hearing the voices of accident victims.  No organised lobby, or no powerful industry lobby, is prepared to appear before the committee to talk on behalf of the people who have suffered sometimes life altering injuries and certainly pain and suffering, the consequences of accidents caused by the negligence of others.  They have no voice and it seems to us that they are vulnerable individuals with no corporate or collective clout.  Their solicitor becomes their voice and their guide through the process.  <\/p> <p>  The Law Society of Ireland has a concern.  I was present in the RTE studio last night when Ms Dorothea Dowling, who is something of a guru in this area, raised the question as to whether the insurance industry should be dictating the solutions to this problem.  In any case, it seems to us that the insurance industry has caused this problem.  The changes that have occurred and resulted in the enormous increases in premiums over the last couple of years originate with matters internal to the insurance industry, not internal to the courts, the Injuries Board or the compensation system.<\/p> <p>  A perfectly reasonable question regarding the European Commission's expression of concern about advertising regulations for the legal profession in Ireland was raised.  I was rather taken aback when I first heard about that because the Law Society of Ireland has not been in any way notified about this.  This seems to be in play - to use a loose phrase - between the Department of Justice and Equality, the State and the European Commission.  The Law Society of Ireland has not been put on any notice of this and we do not know any detail on it.  I can say from general knowledge of advertising regimes in the EU generally that the one in Ireland is quite liberal and quite permissive.  The changes to restrict advertising in respect of personal injuries were put in place to reflect the will of the Oireachtas in the Solicitors (Amendment) 2002 Act.<\/p><p>At the time or up to then it was considered that legal advertising was, in fact, encouraging the bringing of personal injury litigation and that this was contrary to public policy.  That may be the issue between the State and the European Commission, but I can genuinely tell the committee that those of us in the Law Society of Ireland do not know.  We have seen no documentation on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#XX00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473760800,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Does the uniformity in the approach from insurance companies in premiums cause Mr. Murphy concern?

For years I was a practitioner in Irish and European competition law.  I spent a number of years in Brussels as well as in Dublin practising in this field.  I was struck by the insightful remark from Dorothea Dowling on last night's television programme.  She referred to the prediction, apparently coming from the insurance industry, of premium increases next year of in the region of 40%.  Any competition lawyer or regulator would immediately recoil and recognise that this is what is known as signalling to the market.  It should not happen.  It should not be the case that the insurance industry is telling the market and, therefore, each of the other providers, what they intend to charge in premiums next year.  This seems to be a dubious practice.<\/p> <p>  The overall pattern over many years seems to have been a vast amount of under-pricing and under-reserving and, as a result, driving competitors out of the market.  As a consequence we have seen the removal of Quinn, Royal Sun Alliance, Setanta, and the most recent firm to leave, Enterprise Insurance.  All of these firms have now left the market.  Inevitably, the level of competition in the market has been greatly reduced and as a consequence we are seeing extraordinary increases in premiums.  That in itself should be of interest to the competition regulator.  There is a notorious absence of adequate competition in the motor insurance market in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The answer overall, it seems to the Law Society of Ireland, is to bring in more competition.  More competitors should come in from abroad.  That will not happen, it seems, until there is a greater release of data, the cards that are being held close to the chest of the current insurers.  The implicit question Senator Conway-Walsh asked was whether I have a concern about an absence of competition.  I do and market behaviour is reflective of an absence of competition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#YY00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1473760800,"counter":571,"content":"<p>The other question related to costs.

The point seems to us to have been accepted by the Competition Authority in its report in 2006, although it was critical of other aspects.  We were not wholly fans of that report in terms of its rigour, depth or reliability.  However, it recognised a considerable degree of competition.  All the characteristics of a highly competitive market exist in respect of solicitors' practices in Ireland.  Let us contrast the sector with insurers: we are not talking about four or five \"competitors\".  I gather we have 2,228 solicitors' firms in this jurisdiction.  They are all competing with each other for clients.  They are in different segments of the market but there is intense white-hot competition in the market.<\/p> <p>  Personal injury litigation is an intensely competitive area as well.  People choose their representatives.  Ultimately, in most cases we are talking about cases that either go through the Injuries Board, and are determined on a recommendation of the Injuries Board, or those settled by some other form of negotiation with insurers.

Bear in mind also, as the Bar said in its presentation, that the Legal Services Regulation Act is now in place.  We are simply waiting for the commencement of the relevant section.  Once the section has been commenced, we are looking at an entirely new cost regime.  We are looking at a costs adjudicator regime which will be very different from the one which we have seen up to now.  I expect that will make a difference.  It is impossible to tell at this stage the extent of that difference but I am quite confident that it will make one.

They are a bit of fresh air in terms of some of the discussion we have heard.  I agree with the analysis that there is quite an extensive propaganda war going on by the insurance industry.  It has actually been quite successful and is reflected in some of the contributions we have had from people who are also victims.  The two buzzwords used to explain the biggest causes of the massive hike in premiums we are seeing are \"fraud\" and \"whiplash\", which are interrelated terms and obviously serve the interests of the insurance company.  The most important thing that we, as a committee, and the Government need to decide on are what the key causes of the increase in premiums are.  Then we can devise a solution.  For example, the care not cash model fits into the narrative of fraud and whiplash as opposed to the narrative of massive profits.  That is the point: it reinforces that narrative.  <\/p> <p>  The most important question I would ask the Bar Council and the Law Society is whether they think it is fair to say on the basis of the limited information that they have - I know it is limited; that is part of the point - that the primary reason for the significant increase in costs to drivers that we have seen is an attempt by the insurance companies to restore profits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#ZZ00500","speaker":"1308"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":578,"content":"<p>Yes.

As we have said in the past, and as we made clear in both presentations, there has been no real change in claims costs over the course of the last seven or eight years.  If it is indeed claims costs that are driving up premiums, why were they not driven up two, three or four years ago?  That just does not make any sense.  There therefore must be other factors.  I think Dorothea Dowling said on \"Claire Byrne Live\" last night that it was her feeling that the Solvency II Directive was driving the increase, that there was an unpreparedness for the Solvency II Directive that was driving insurance companies to build up their capital reserves.  As Mr. Murphy has correctly pointed out, there is a suggestion that they have already decided that next year will see a further 40% increase.  They do not even know what the claims market will be like next year, so I think this is a red herring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#ZZ00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stuart Gilhooly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":580,"content":"<p>The briefing document prepared for the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohue, which, as members know, was obtained by Mark Hilliard of <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>under the Freedom of Information Act, made interesting reading and corresponded with the type of research we had found ourselves.  It reads: &quot;It appears motor insurers are now imposing higher premium rates to return themselves to profitability or to boost profitability after a number of years of insurers competing for market share with prices driven down accordingly and possible underwriting losses in some cases.&quot;  The anonymous civil servant who penned the document goes on to add an intriguing caveat: &quot;The question does arise for motor insurers - if motor insurance is so unprofitable, why does anybody do it?&quot;.  That of course comes back to the exercise in which Dorothea Dowling has engaged over time which shows that the discrepancy between the premium income that has come in and the actual payment out on awards - all awards, not just motor claims - is &euro;1 billion.<\/p><p>That is the discrepancy.  We absolutely accept that the committee wants to come up with solutions.  It is going to be hidebound until it gets the information.<br\/><br\/>When we saw these headlines in March of this year, we immediately formed a sub-committee to find out why this was being said.  Anecdotally, as someone who practises in personal injuries, I had not noticed any dramatic sea-change in awards.  In fact, I would have said it was the other way around, because the Court of Appeal has been quite stringent in reducing awards.  I certainly had not noticed the costs I was getting going up.  I had not noticed more cases coming to court as opposed to being settled by the Injuries Board.  We went back to primary sources, so we went to the accounts of the insurance companies, to see if we could get any information from that as to what they were settling, but <i>de nada<\/i>.  We went to the insurance companies themselves to try to get information - we did a search of the Companies Registration Office - but we found nothing.  Every time it is put to him, Kevin Thompson of Insurance Ireland does not deal with it and, frankly, the media let him go on unchallenged.<br\/><br\/>The Courts Service reports are available.  They are not controversial; they are based on fact.  There is the Central Bank report, which is based on fact, and the Injuries Board, which is based on fact.  There are no major changes arising from any of those entities, none of whom are particularly lawyer-friendly, as they would say themselves.  We have an excellent relationship with the Injuries Board in the sense that we have dialogue with it, but its role is to make sure people accept awards, do not go to the courts and minimise costs.  Its representatives will say that to the committee tomorrow.  Three separate entities cannot see any sea-change in the regime, yet we are told last year the premiums went up by 38%.  We all know as drivers, that premiums are rising for no reason.  I am the classic profile - middle-aged woman with a full no-claims bonus and no penalty points - and my motor premium went up by 25% last year.  It does not make sense, but they will not answer the questions, and until they answer the questions and give the data, I do not know where one moves to in terms of solutions.  What is really worrying at this stage is that they are already flagging that they will increase the motor premium again next year.  How could they know what the claims history is for this year at present?<br\/><br\/>Deputy Paul Murphy also referred to the question of fraud.  There is fraud in the system but the whole point of the 2004 Act was to introduce a system that dealt seriously with fraud.  It is not just about fraud, it is also about exaggeration.  One can have a case in which a person exaggerates a portion of what is actually a legitimate claim.  For example, there is a reported case, heard by Mr. Justice Quirke, of a man who lost a portion of an arm in a very bad machinery accident.  There was no doubt that he lost it and that there was negligence involved, but he exaggerated when it came to his earnings, what he was doing and what he could not do.  As a result, he got nothing.  He did not get a proportion because he was entitled to it, he got zero.<br\/><br\/>I agree with Mr. Gilhooly in that we do not know why insurance companies, even as a matter of sending out a message, do not go to the Director of Public Prosecutions and say it wants the case prosecuted.  We see this sort of incident every day in the paper, where a case is dismissed on the basis that the claimant was dancing around on Facebook when they said they could do nothing.  We all know that if a message went out from an insurer saying that this is wrong, it would have a significant effect.  We do not want to be dealing with fraudulent claims and we certainly do not want to be representing fraudulent people.  I dread seeing Facebook coming towards me in any court case, because one never knows what is going to be there.  One thing one learns is how indiscreet people are on Facebook.  Insurers have that power and they have had that power since 2004.<br\/><br\/>Senator Conway-Walsh referred to the book of quantum and what view the judges hold.  They are keenly aware, despite the myth that they are out of touch, of concerns in respect of the quantum of damages.  While we can always be troubled that we are perceived at the lower end of the scale to have quite generous awards but one must bear in mind that at the higher end of the scale we have very low awards.  When one tells people that the limit on general damages for a person who is catastrophically injured, who is never going to be able to work or do anything again, is &euro;450,000, the public is horrified.  Time and again, the Supreme Court has said that must remain, for public policy reasons, as the cap on general damages.  The Court of Appeal has said recently that one must now work backwards from that in respect of all other claims.  That has had quite a significant effect in terms of general damages.  Judges should be trusted in regard to that.  This can never be resolved until we have the information, which we do not have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#ZZ00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Sara Moorhead","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473760800,"counter":582,"content":"<p>Mr. Conor Faughnan of the AA said that about 10% of the claims are resolved in court, 20% go through the Injuries Board and the rest of them are out-of-court private settlements.

Insurance companies will try to settle a case at a lower level early on; that makes sense for them.

Occasionally, I will get what I regard as a very straightforward case, for example, a rear-end collision in which clearly liability is not an issue, and the case is rejected by the insurance company even to go through the Injuries Board.  I often have to say to clients: \"I have no idea why this has happened.  Is there something I'm missing here?  Did this accident happen the way you said it happened?\"  They just look at me.  Then two months later, having issued court proceedings - as I have to - I get a phone call from an insurance company asking if I want to settle.  I am left wondering what happened there and why the insurance company did not let the case go through the Injuries Board.

Until they come and show those are the causes, we will not be in a position to provide huge solutions.  However, we have some solutions.  We have one solution which we are surprised has not happened.  The new Legal Services Regulation Act provides for a legal costs adjudicator.  That Act has been in place for a significant period but has not actually commenced.  There is an establishment date of 1 October.  That section of the Act is free-standing.  It has always been welcomed by all of the legal profession as a much more transparent system for everybody regarding legal costs.  Therefore, if there are issues about our legal costs - whether they are solicitors' legal costs or barristers' legal costs - that should be dealt with speedily by the insurers and the plaintiffs.  That is one practical solution.  If the insurers are right that legal costs have greatly increased, the introduction of the legal costs adjudicator, properly financed - it is supposed to be self-financing, in fact - would be a very significant improvement to the whole thing.  That is one constructive thing we have come up with.<\/p> <p>  We have also welcomed - if it is properly done - a revised book of quantum.

The civil law system in continental Europe, Scandinavia and, really, the rest of the EU outside of the United Kingdom and Ireland is very different in its approach.  It does not really have the fault-based approach, what lawyers call tort, whereby a person's negligence caused the injury to someone else and therefore creates an obligation to compensate the injured person.  Strangely, negligence is not even a concept in civil law.  It is a different system in continental Europe where these things are socialised and it becomes an issue for the health system and social support system not a system based on the person causing the compensation to be paid.  It is not a valid comparison with the rest of Europe.  I accept that the common law system in the United Kingdom and Ireland is very similar and hardly distinguishable at all.  Again, there may be social or historical reasons why certain things are viewed differently in compensation terms.  I do not know whether it is true or not, but it was said to me some years ago that perhaps the experience in the United Kingdom of huge numbers of people being injured in the First World War and the Second World War gives them socially a greater tolerance for people being injured and putting up with it than was the case here.  It is a theory, but the fact is that the system in Ireland, and the Judiciary operating the principles - based on Irish law - of what is fair and reasonable, have produced certain results and it seems to us that is with the support of the Irish people.  Interestingly, I do not think one will find it criticised by the victims, the question is whether in fact we should be interfering with this for the benefit of the profits of insurance companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#GGG00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":643,"content":"<p>Another factor to bear in mind in terms of the system in the United Kingdom and Ireland - I appreciate that this does not happen so much with the lower awards - is that we work on a system whereby we pay for nothing for the injured person so one of the issues is that anybody who gets money here loses money in another way.  In the UK, everything other than the general damages is covered to a large extent.  There is the NHS, much as it is now maligned, and care costs.  One of the particularly problematic issues here is that in the bigger claims &ndash; I know we are not dealing with the bigger claims &ndash; the reason they are at such a level is because it would not be inconceivable that one would spend &euro;300,000 a year on nursing care for a catastrophically injured person who has a fairly normal life expectancy.  That is the reason settlements of up to &euro;10 million can be reached.  I know we are not dealing with such payments today but there is a periodic payments provision which it seems to us is a far fairer system for everybody.<\/p> <p>  Another factor is that people lose their disability payments if they get money.  For example, if they get &euro;100,000 they lose their disability payments so they now put in a claim for the loss of disability payment as an actuarialised out-of-pocket expense.  That leads one to the area of societal choices as to whether in those circumstances the insurance company or the taxpayer should pay.  It is a complex issue for that reason.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#GGG00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sara Moorhead"},{"type":"speech","time":1473760800,"counter":644,"content":"<p>We are teasing out quite a lot this afternoon.

The members of the committee will be glad to know that I have been following their deliberations online over recent days.  There was an interesting exchange with Mr. Faughnan of AA Roadwatch.  Senator Horkan began probing with questions about the extent to which these extraordinary and amazing increases of up to 70% over two years were to restore losses on balance sheets or in reserves, and whether they represented a prudent approach taken by an insurer or represented super-profits, and to what extent.  Of course Mr. Faughnan replied that he did not know.  This a perfect example of the extent to which data, insight and information can inform debate.  We could actually know how much of the increase is super-profits and how much is completely justifiable, to what extent there is paranoia or excessive prudence being displayed now and whether the pendulum has swung to the other side.  It is thematic in light of what we have being saying.  It seems there is an absence of the level of insight that appears to exist in other jurisdictions and which could be, therefore, legitimately available.  It seems to us that the Legislature could prise open what we call the black box, but unless that is opened it is questionable whether we could have the opportunity for more potential insurers.  There are numerous other insurers in Europe that are not in this market.  In those circumstances they may be able to see to what extent this is profitable work and determine whether they should come in and join the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#HHH00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1473760800,"counter":646,"content":"<p>Are the companies in the market acting in cartel-like behaviour?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#HHH00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":647,"content":"<p>Again, it goes back to what I was saying earlier.

Once the Setanta case is over - and that will be very soon because it is being heard in the Supreme Court at the end of next month - I will wager any money that a new motor insurance bureau agreement will be signed in which it is made perfectly clear, in black and white, that any insolvent insurer will not be bailed out by the MIBI.

The Injuries Board has 12 years of experience and this will allow it to produce a system similar to that in the UK, which is a much more refined and detailed system.  The UK system has indices of injuries into which one can shoehorn more specific amounts awarded by the courts.  It may give details of a person who has had a hip replacement, for example, who has had three years of difficulties and will require ongoing treatment but made a good recovery.  There may be five factors in total and it is more specific.  One of the problems with the current book of quantum is the wide range within it.  The other problem with the book of quantum, although the Injuries Board has been dealing with this in recent years, is that it was not originally intended to assess psychological or psychiatric injury at all.  People have mentioned whiplash injuries, but a significant part of what people go through with injuries is the trauma associated with them, and this often feeds into the award.  The book of quantum is quite defective in that respect.  It is to be hoped that when the new book of quantum comes out it will be a useful tool.  If it is a useful tool there is no reason judges will not use it.

If it is a realistic document in terms of the day-to-day approach, there is no reason it will not be used by the lawyers, the litigant and the judges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#MMM00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Sara Moorhead"},{"type":"speech","time":1473760800,"counter":732,"content":"<p>Was a book of quantum in place before the Injuries Board was established?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#MMM00700","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":733,"content":"<p>No, it is a creature of the 2004 Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#MMM00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Sara Moorhead"},{"type":"speech","time":1473760800,"counter":734,"content":"<p>Whose is responsible for the legal costs adjudicator?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#MMM00900","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":735,"content":"<p>That is a matter for the Minister.  It is a matter about which we are very concerned.  There has been a considerable hiatus in the taxation of costs, which I will not go into here.  We are surprised that there has not been more of an impetus to get that portion of the Legal Services Regulation Act up and running because it is a very detailed provision in respect of legal costs.  It is very transparent and is supposed to be self-financing.  It has been welcomed by all the representative bodies and there seems to be no reason there is a delay in it.  There are significant backlogs relating to the awarding of costs.  Again, this is not an issue for today but it is a real issue, particularly for plaintiffs' solicitors who are funding litigation on an ongoing basis such as catastrophic injuries cases where they are simply not getting their costs dealt with.  There is no reason the costs provision should not be up and running and it will be good for everyone if it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#MMM01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Sara Moorhead"},{"type":"speech","time":1473760800,"counter":736,"content":"<p>It is only a question of the Minister for Justice and Equality making the order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#MMM01100","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":737,"content":"<p>Exactly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#MMM01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sara Moorhead"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":738,"content":"<p>The Law Society of Ireland's position is that the sooner that happens, the better because the current system is in deep trouble and the uncertainties around it need to be resolved by the activation of the new legislative provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#MMM01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1473760800,"counter":739,"content":"<p>On 20 April, the Minister for Finance identified a range of possible factors that contributed to the increase in the costs of motor insurance in Ireland in the past 12 months.  Among the reasons noted by the Minister were the frequency and scale of claims, the cost of claims and the operation of the insurance market.  The Minister noted an increase in the frequency of claims over the past year, which he advised was associated with improving economic conditions, and also referred to an increase in the number of large claims.  Reference was also made to the increase in the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court since February 2014, which the Minister said may possibly lead to increased legal costs.  The Minister for Finance, who has all of the information available to him from the Central Bank and so forth, said quite clearly on 20 April that an increase in legal costs could be the cause of the increase in the cost of motor insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#MMM01400","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":740,"content":"<p>With all due respect to the Minister, the comments he made sound fairly wide-ranging.  There are a couple of things there with which we need to deal.  The suggestion that there has been a widespread increase in claims is not borne out by the statistics.<\/p><p>In fact, there has, as we understand it from the Injuries Board, been a 6% increase in claims.  The board tells us - and it is independent - that this is in line with what is to be expected in the economy, which is improving so there are more people on the roads, going to work, etc.  It is fully to be expected that there would be an increase in the number of accidents and claims as a result.<\/p><p> The reference to the jurisdiction change is interesting.  The jurisdiction change was carried out by the previous Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, almost three years ago, in February 2014.  In almost unique circumstances, that I can recall, the insurance industry and the legal profession were in complete agreement that it should not happen.  Dorothea Dowling was very clear it should not happen.  As far as I am aware, there was only one person in the entire country who thought it should happen, and that was the then Minister.  He changed those jurisdictions.  I think that was a mistake.  I do not think it should have been done but that was a decision made by Government and not at the behest of anybody else.  It could be changed back, although I doubt it will be.  Even when considered logically, let us just assume - as it has happened - that if there are more cases now in the Circuit Court, presumably there are fewer in the High Court, which means the legal costs should be lower because Circuit Court costs are generally lower than High Court costs.  There are fewer barristers and the fees tend to be lower.  That does not make any sense.  The argument is that damages are a little higher in the Circuit Court, and they are because the jurisdiction went up.  That is inevitable.  I am not sure, however, that it makes any sense about legal costs.  I am not sure where the Minister is coming from in his point about the legal costs.  There are many general comments in there but I am not sure there is anything specific.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#MMM01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stuart Gilhooly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473760800,"counter":742,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Gilhooly saying that the Minister's information is not accurate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#NNN00200","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473760800,"counter":743,"content":"<p>I am not saying that at all.

They are generally catastrophic injury awards, such as birth defects.  There has been a substantial increase in the number of medical negligence cases, which has doubled since 2009, and in the value of the awards relating to them.  One of the reasons for this, and it is a matter for politicians rather than lawyers, is that the real rate of return on investments has been adjudicated by the High Court and the Court of Appeal to be only 1%.  This means that if a person is buying in care for a catastrophically injured individual the value has gone up hugely.  The answer to that, which has been advocated by all representative bodies, is to bring in periodic payments.  That means paying on an annual basis only what it is required to pay.  If the plaintiff dies ten years later that is the end of the settlement but if the plaintiff lasts to 90 years of age that continues.  That is included in the assessment of the overall matter by the Minister for Finance.<\/p> <p>  In our submission, however, we make clear that there is no evidence of significant increases by the Injuries Board or by the Central Bank because when it did its thematic review it also made the point that the only increases it expected to see were in the order of 8%, based on the improvement in the economy rather than any massive escalation in awards or legal costs.  Premiums have gone up 38% in a year and 70% in the past three years.  There is no evidence of a statistical increase of that magnitude in awards, claims or costs.  This is not coming from us.  It is not insurance bashing.  This is coming from the Central Bank, from the briefing document to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and from the Injuries Board, all lawyer-free zones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016091300002#NNN00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sara Moorhead"},{"type":"speech","time":1473760800,"counter":745,"content":"<p>The Minister set up a working group.
