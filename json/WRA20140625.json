While the budgetary targets this year are particularly constrained, it is important to recognise that similar financial and resource constraints have applied in each of the last number of years in preparing the HSE National Service Plan as a direct consequence of the emergency financial situation the Irish State has had to address since 2008.  The cumulative impact of this unprecedented period of financial and resource restraint has resulted in reductions in the health service budget of the order of &euro;3.3 billion (over 20%) with numbers employed reduced by over 14,000 in this period. On a comparative basis the OECD Report, Health at a Glance 2013, shows that recent reductions in public health expenditure per capita in Ireland are the highest experienced in any OECD country with the exception of Greece.  <\/p><p>  These challenges come at a time when the demand for health services is increasing each year which, in turn, is driving costs upwards. However, despite these resource reductions and increasing service demands the HSE, in its annual National Service Plan, has managed to support growing demand for its services arising from such factors as population growth, increased levels of chronic disease, increased demand for prescription drugs, and new cost intensive medical technologies and treatments. The HSE is to be commended for meeting these increased demands on its services.  That said, 2014 is proving to be a particularly challenging year for the health services.  Cumulative net expenditure to end April is &euro;138 million lower than the same period last year, but given the extent and the phasing of the targeted budget reductions, the cumulative deficit of &euro;107.5 million, is higher than last year&rsquo;s &euro;24.7 million.  The Vote for the HSE is reporting a net deficit of &euro;158m at the end of May.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the expenditure ceiling for the HSE is decided by Government, amongst other things, against a backdrop of national budgetary objectives and the prevailing macro-economic conditions. Very difficult decisions were taken by Government in the context of this year's overall budgetary arithmetic.  Certain savings targets required of the HSE at the time of the Budget and the finalisation and approval of this year's Service Plan were considered so challenging that it was agreed that a separate validation exercise to assess their achievability would be undertaken by the Departments of Health, Public Expenditure and Reform and An Taoiseach.  Whilst work continues in relation to the maximisation of the savings achievable under the Haddington Road Agreement, the initial savings targets under medical card probity were reduced by &euro;110m in the context of the REV.  Along with pay savings targets, and taking account of the reliance on agency workers which is further compounded by the European Working Time Directive, it is clear that the challenges facing the HSE in 2014 were extraordinary from the outset.<\/p><p>  There is ongoing and intensive engagement each month between officials of my Department, D\/PER and the HSE in the context of regular monitoring of expenditure. The HSE is pro-actively engaged in internal efforts to maximise savings and cost containment plans and to ensure that additional measures are identified and safely implemented to mitigate any projected deficits which are within HSE direct control, while engaging on an ongoing basis with my Department. I would also like to assure the Deputy that the National Director for Acute Hospitals has written to all hospital groups \/ hospitals setting out clear key messages around the need to reduce costs safely and to submit additional cost containment plans. Additionally, a full round of high level performance assurance meetings has been completed and another round is starting. The Director General has met the Board Chairs, CEO&rsquo;s and Clinical Directors of the 10 hospital groups\/hospitals with the greatest financial challenges to ensure the messaging is explicit right up to board level in terms of the hierarchy of performance management priorities - i.e. service safety and quality first, financial management next and then all other priorities come behind these including elective access for non-clinically urgent cases.   <\/p><p>  Work is ongoing between the HSE and my Department on finalising projections to year end based on data for the first four months of 2014, in tandem with assessment of performance in the same period and risk to year end within its cost containment plans.  It would be premature for me to comment further at this stage, pending the outcome of this work, but as the HSE has indicated, the scale of the risk and challenge in achieving financial breakeven by year end remains extremely significant as predicted in the 2014 NSP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500068#WRA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance Regulation","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500068#WRA02750"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[27055\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500068#WRA02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his assessment of the VHI&rsquo;s annual results for 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":43,"content":"<p>On Tuesday 17 June this year I welcomed the announcement by the VHI of its annual results for the year 2013 and I am pleased to note the positive financial results of &euro;65m profit after tax.

Therefore, the Government has decided to develop a policy framework for providing eligibility for health services to take account of medical conditions, including new legislation as appropriate and a HSE clinical expert group is to examine the range of conditions that should be considered as part of this process. The group has been asked to make an early report to the Minister for Health in the autumn.<\/p><p>The Government was very concerned about the potential impacts on the health of persons with serious illnesses whose discretionary medical cards and GP visit cards were refused renewals since the centralisation of medical card assessment in 2011. Therefore, in the context of the above eligibility policy development, the Government decided that medical cards and GP visit cards are to be issued to persons with a serious medical condition (or disability) who had the renewal of their discretionary card refused by the HSE, having completed an eligibility review during the period from 1 July 2011 to 31 May 2014.<\/p><p>This arrangement applies in the following circumstances:<\/p><p>- During the period, the person held a medical card or GP visit card issued on a discretionary basis, but the HSE made a decision to refuse its renewal on foot of a completed eligibility review.<\/p><p>- The person completed the review process during that period, i.e. provided the information and documentation required assessing their eligibility.<\/p><p>- The person has a serious medical condition, i.e., which required that their case was referred to a Medical Officer as a part of the review process. <\/p><p>It is anticipated that about 15,300 cards will be issued to people with serious medical conditions as part of this process. It is estimated that:<\/p><p>- 5,288 people will be issued with a discretionary medical card;<\/p><p>- 2,899 people will be issued with a discretionary GP visit card; and,<\/p><p>- 7,118 people will be moved from GP visit card to a discretionary medical card.<\/p><p>It is also recognised that a small number of individuals may not have been able to complete their review during the defined period due to circumstances relating to their medical condition, e.g., hospitalisation during treatment, change of residence during treatment.  Therefore, the Director General of the HSE may act, on his own initiative, to take account of an <i>ad misericordiam<\/i>appeal on a case by case basis to issue a discretionary card to such a person that has a serious medical condition. <\/p><p>People do not need to make an application to receive a card as the HSE is working as quickly as possible through its database to contact the people concerned over the next few weeks to inform them that their card is being issued.

I am keen to create the best possible environment within which more people will want to obtain and retain private health insurance cover that is affordable, competitive and meets costumers' needs as we prepare to move towards Universal Health Insurance. With this in mind, I am introducing a series of measures from 2015 including Lifetime Community Rating (LCR) and discounts for young adults to help support the sustainability and competitiveness of the Private Health Insurance market.<\/p><p>  As part of the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance, I appointed Mr. Pat McLoughlin as Independent Chair to work with insurance companies and the Department to identify effective cost management strategies to help ensure the long-term sustainability of the private health insurance market.  Mr. McLoughlin's first report, published at the end of December, made a number of important recommendations, including the introduction of LCR as a measure to encourage younger people to buy health insurance. Lifetime Community Rating is intended to encourage people to join health insurance schemes early and to retain their private health insurance cover. Late entry loadings are applied to those who join later in life. There will be a grace period to allow people take out insurance without loadings and a strong communications campaign to give everyone adequate notice of the change.<\/p><p>  I also wish to help address the substantial reduction in the market penetration rates between the ages of 20 and 25 by requiring sliding discounts for all young adults up to age 24. It is intended that this measure will also be introduced from 2015. This phasing in of full adult rates will smoothen the dramatic price increase currently experienced when student rates no longer apply, usually after the age of 21 years at present. <\/p><p>  In addition to the above measures, I have consistently emphasised the need for much greater cost control in the private health insurance industry so that premiums are affordable for as many people as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500069#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Services Provision","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500069#WRB03750"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[27065\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500069#WRB03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way he will improve conditions in emergency departments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500069#WRB03900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance Prices","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500069#WRB03950"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[27058\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500069#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his proposals to help persons with the cost of private health insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>I have consistently urged the private health insurers to do everything possible to keep down the cost of private health insurance.

I am aware that a number of Saharawi prisoners have been on hunger strike for various periods over the last number of years in protest at the conditions of their detention.<\/p><p>  The UN Special Rapporteur for torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment visited a number of prisons and police stations in Morocco and Western Sahara in 2012.  He reported that the conditions in which many Saharawis were detained failed to meet international human rights standards.  His report also outlined that alleged or known supporters of Western Saharan independence are subjected to ill-treatment and torture by police officers and other security personnel, both within and outside of detention centres.  Many Saharawi are forced to make false confessions, which are often used as the only basis for their imprisonment.  These findings were echoed by a UK Parliamentary Group which visited Western Sahara in February 2014 and which found that many Saharawi activists had suffered physical assault, arrest, imprisonment and disappearance at the hands of the Moroccan authorities, as a result of peaceful activities in support of Saharawi self-determination.<\/p><p>  It seems apparent that the hunger strikes by Saharawi prisoners are directly prompted by the inhumane, degrading treatment to which they are allegedly subjected.  However, the use of hunger strike is a very dangerous tactic which Ireland cannot encourage.  Instead, I call on the Moroccan authorities to give full effect to all recommendations outlined in the Special Rapporteur&rsquo;s report; to conduct impartial, independent investigations into allegations of torture, to hold perpetrators accountable, provide compensation to victims, reconsider the jurisdiction of military courts over civilians, and further strengthen protection for internationally recognized human rights in the area of detention.  Though no obvious improvement in detention conditions has occurred following the recent visit of Ms. Navi Pillay, High Commissioner for Human Rights, to Morocco, the Moroccan authorities should continue to be encouraged to instigate efforts towards reform, following on the positive efforts already taken to better protect human rights within Morocco itself since the adoption of a new constitution in 2011. <\/p><p>  As I have stated before, Ireland raises concerns regarding the situation in Western Sahara with the Moroccan authorities on an ongoing basis, including through the Moroccan Embassy in Dublin and our Embassy in Lisbon which is accredited to Morocco, as well as in Geneva at the UN Human Rights Council.  Specifically, during Morocco&rsquo;s 2012 Universal Periodic Review, Ireland recommended that independent and impartial inquiries are carried out with respect to all allegations of mistreatment in detention.  I will continue to raise this matter with the Moroccan authorities at every appropriate opportunity. <\/p><p>  Finally, Ireland supports the inclusion of a broader human rights monitoring mechanism within the mandate of MINURSO, the UN peace-keeping mission in the region.  It is a matter of serious regret to Ireland that the UN Security Council failed to implement such a procedure in connection with the most recent renewal of the MINURSO mandate on 30 April 2014.  However, I hope that this matter will be reconsidered over the coming months, particularly given UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon&rsquo;s recent call for the sustained, independent and impartial monitoring of the human rights of Saharawi people, both in the occupied territory and in refugee camps. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500070#WRC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Good Friday Agreement","counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500070#WRC02750"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[27564\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500070#WRC02800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the further steps he believes are necessary in order to complete the terms expressed in the Good Friday Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":165,"content":"<p>The principles and values of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement are essential to peace and reconciliation in Ireland and across these islands.

However, the Deputy can be assured that my Department fully recognises the key role of physical exercise within the school environment and continues to respond to the need to improve PE facilities for all pupils attending schools within the constraints of the available funding.<\/p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the Physical Education curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary. Many second level schools have sports halls and practically all schools have outdoor facilities which are used for teaching different aspects of the P.E. programme. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.<\/p><p>  The provision of playspace, where site conditions and circumstances allow, is one of the issues considered in the architectural design of new schools and major extensions. The level of facilities, including playspace, that can be provided in schools will therefore vary depending on the extent of classroom accommodation needed for the school. A suite of technical guidance documents is available on my Department's website (www.education.ie) to assist design teams in best practice in the design and development of projects and to encourage them to take a complete design team approach from project conception. These documents cover all aspects of the development of a building project for both internal and external works.  My Department's design guidelines for schools include guidance in the provision of P.E. Halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts. Other P.E. facilities, e.g. pitches are provided, where appropriate, and in the context of available resources, as part of the Department's school building programme.<\/p><p>  In the context of my Department's co-operation with local authorities in identifying suitable sites for schools, the location of sporting facilities is one factor taken into account in locating schools. The Deputy may be aware of my Department's role in developing shared community facilities in the Fingal County Council area, which has made facilities available to the wider community on a shared basis with the school.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department's over-riding objective is to ensure that every child has access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers.

Many of the MAs have specialist post-graduate qualifications and all have experience\/training in Human Disability Evaluation. <\/p><p>  Applicants for DA are required to provide medical and other evidence from their own doctor(s) or other therapists etc. to demonstrate their eligibility.

The market has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual commercial operators.<\/p><p>In terms of the quality of mobile coverage throughout the country, licences issued by ComReg require Mobile Network Operators to provide a minimum level of national population coverage. There are no Universal Service Obligations attached to mobile phone licences. The design of the network is a matter entirely for the operator concerned although operators tend to exceed their minimum coverage requirements for commercial reasons. However, given that mobile telephone services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by several factors including topography, the capacity of the network and more generally the quality of access customers have to mobile telephone antennas.<\/p><p>ComReg's 2012 multiband spectrum auction has released additional radio spectrum previously unavailable for mobile operators. This is expected to further improve the coverage and quality of mobile service throughout the country. Since the auction, three mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services and rollout is continuing. There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements. <\/p><p>I would also point out that Local Authorities have a strong role to play in facilitating the roll-out of the necessary telecommunications infrastructure to help enable service availability throughout the country. This is a matter which has been raised by telecommunications services providers and is reflected in the Government's National Broadband Plan, which commits to addressing barriers to deployment of services.  The Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:-<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and <\/p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. <\/p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. <\/p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention. I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This list is available on my Department's website, . This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. I expect that this mapping exercise will be concluded in the autumn.  I would point out that the EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. <\/p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end strategy for the State led intervention. It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed strategy. EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised. This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500072#WRE02400","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tyre Labelling Regulations","counter":275,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500072#WRE02450"},{"type":"question","counter":276,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[27500\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500072#WRE02500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will improve tyre labelling in view of the fact that there is no independent body assessing each tyre and awarding the rating; his plans to establish such a body.","asker":"1093","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":277,"content":"<p>The Tyre Labelling Regulations (S.I. 342 of 2012) set out the national rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No. 1222\/2009 on the labelling of tyres.

This information is provided in the form of a label which, since 1 November 2012, must be displayed on or in close proximity to the tyre at the point of sale.<\/p><p>  Under the Regulations, it is the responsibility of the tyre supplier (manufacturer or EU importer) to produce a label in the correct format for each tyre. Technical documentation must also be produced for the tyre to verify the accuracy of the information contained in the label for inspection purposes. No independent assessment is required for the production of the label.   Compliance with the Tyre Labelling Regulations is monitored by national Market Surveillance Authorities (MSAs) which, for the purposes of tyre labelling, is located in my Department . My Department's market surveillance programme for 2014 &ndash; 2015, which also includes the Ecodesign and Energy Labelling Regulations, has been published in Ireland&rsquo;s biennial national market surveillance programme compiled by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Through this programme, which includes an awareness, inspection, testing and enforcement regime, my Department is committed to ensuring that levels of compliance improve. <\/p><p>  Promoting and raising awareness, especially among retailers and distributors, is essential to ensuring compliance and in June 2013 my Department wrote to tyre suppliers and distributors informing them of their responsibilities. A training programme has also been put in place whereby, in advance of a formal inspection, each retailer receives a pre-inspection visit by an Authorised Officer to provide advice and assist them in meeting their obligations. We have also engaged the assistance of the Irish Tyre Industry Association. My Department's market surveillance programme will see 200 inspections of retail outlets carried out and a number of risk-based testing campaigns completed. It is expected that approximately one quarter of these surveillance activities will focus specifically on the Tyre Labelling Regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500072#WRE02600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":279,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500072#WRE02700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rental Accommodation Scheme Administration","counter":278,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500072#WRE02650"},{"type":"question","counter":279,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[27445\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500072#WRE02700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"in relation to the rent allowance scheme, the restrictions that are placed on local authorities on the size of properties acceptable under the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1013","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":280,"content":"<p>The operation of the rent allowance scheme is entirely a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.

As part of the follow-up to that initiative,  I chaired the first special themed meeting of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group (NDSIG) on the issue of Irish Sign Language on November 28, 2013. This meeting brought together representatives of relevant Departments, the NDA, the Deaf Community and other relevant stakeholders with a view to further progressing the implementation of the NDSIP in this regard.<\/p><p>  The meeting reviewed the current situation across Government Departments and their Agencies with regard to promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language including in-service provision and provided the Deaf Community with the opportunity of presenting their experience of interaction with the Public Sector.  It also provided a useful opportunity to examine mechanisms which could promote the further use and recognition of Irish Sign Language and understand practical implications for service users.  Further to this meeting, the Deaf Community prepared a report to reflect their views on key actions and priorities. This report was submitted for my consideration last month. The intention is that the recommendations from this report  will be reflected in the NDSIP where practicable, through the incorporation of new actions and related performance indicators and timelines as appropriate.  Progress on all relevant actions will then be monitored as part of the Implementation Plan monitoring process.<\/p><p>  The focus therefore remains on the identification of mechanisms for the further promotion and recognition of Irish Sign Language with a view to promoting and supporting its use, thereby improving service delivery on the ground, rather than on its designation as an official language.

Enquiries are made to establish if the applicant satisfies the conditions for naturalisation such as residency and good character. As well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation as provided for in law is also a major step for the State which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level. There are no circumstances under which these necessary checks would be waived as to do so would undermine the integrity of the process.   The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process and, in some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay and every effort is made to process each application as expeditiously as possible, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, requires that an applicant for naturalisation is required to have one year's continuous reckonable residence in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years preceding that, to have a total reckonable residence amounting to four years.  The INIS website www.inis.gov.ie includes a residency calculator to assist prospective applicants in this regard.  Section 16 of that act provides that I may, in my absolute discretion, waive the conditions for naturalisation in certain circumstances, for example where the applicant has Refugee status or is of Irish associations.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established specifically for this purpose.

Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date and employers would be exposed to civil liability if they knowingly recruited staff based on out-of-date criminal records information where the person in fact had a more recent criminal conviction. Effectively, the non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service and such procedures are in line with best practice internationally.<\/p><p>  There are, however, certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  For example, persons involved in voluntary work may be doing work with more than one voluntary organisation at the same time, and may agree with the vetting applicant to share a single vetting disclosure.  Similar arrangements arise in the health sector in regard to persons working as locums, agency nurses or other temporary employees in a number of different organisations, or in the education sector where substitute teachers are on panels for substitute teaching in more than one school.<\/p><p>  Finally, the current average processing time for vetting applications is four weeks. Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account  the need to protect children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, I do not think that this time period is unreasonable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500074#WRG00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations Expenditure","counter":354,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500074#WRG00950"},{"type":"question","counter":355,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[27551\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500074#WRG01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the total amount of moneys spent to date on the purchasing of lands for the proposed new Garda station in Wexford town; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1096","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":356,"content":"<p>The provision of Garda accommodation, including all site purchases and new buildings, comes under the remit of the Office of Public Works (OPW).

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines. In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website ().<\/p><p>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.

Therefore, the Government has decided to develop a policy framework for providing eligibility for health services to take account of medical conditions, including new legislation as appropriate and a HSE clinical expert group is to examine the range of conditions that should be considered as part of this process. The group has been asked to make an early report to the Minister for Health in the autumn.<\/p><p>  The Government was very concerned about the potential impacts on the health of persons with serious illnesses whose discretionary medical cards and GP visit cards were refused renewals since the centralisation of medical card assessment in 2011. Therefore, in the context of the above eligibility policy development, the Government has decided to  issue medical cards and GP visit cards to these people.  The Government recently approved the method by which medical cards and GP visit cards, awarded by way of discretion, can issue to persons with serious medical conditions where renewal was refused having completed an eligibility review.  These cards are issuing in the context of government decisions in relation to future eligibility policy. <\/p><p>  The eligibility reviews conducted during that period were in accordance with legislation as it stands. The Government did not decide to retrospectively compensate persons for expenditure during the period January 2011 - May 2014  when the person did not qualify for a medical card.  The Deputy may be aware that persons with certain prescribed conditions qualify for the Long Term illness (LTI) scheme, irrespective of income or means. Under the LTI scheme, persons suffering from prescribed conditions can get drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances for the treatment of that condition free of charge.  <\/p><p>  It should also be noted that under the Drugs Payment Scheme, a household only has to pay a maximum of &euro;144 each month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and certain appliances. This scheme is aimed at those who do not have a medical card and who normally have to pay the full cost of their medication. It also applies to those who have a GP visit card.

Therefore, the Government has decided to develop a policy framework for providing eligibility for health services to take account of medical conditions, including new legislation as appropriate and a HSE clinical expert group is to examine the range of conditions that should be considered as part of this process. The group has been asked to make an early report to the Minister for Health in the autumn.<\/p><p>The Government was very concerned about the potential impacts on the health of persons with serious illnesses whose discretionary medical cards and GP visit cards were refused renewals since the centralisation of medical card assessment in 2011. Therefore, in the context of the above eligibility policy development, the Government decided that medical cards and GP visit cards are to be issued to persons with a serious medical condition (or disability) who had the renewal of their discretionary card refused by the HSE, having completed an eligibility review during the period from 1 July 2011 to 31 May 2014.<\/p><p>This arrangement applies in the following circumstances:<\/p><p>- During the period, the person held a medical card or GP visit card issued on a discretionary basis, but the HSE made a decision to refuse its renewal on foot of a completed eligibility review.<\/p><p>- The person completed the review process during that period, i.e. provided the information and documentation required assessing their eligibility. <\/p><p>- The person has a serious medical condition, i.e., which required that their case was referred to a Medical Officer as a part of the review process. <\/p><p>It is anticipated that about 15,300 cards will be issued to people with serious medical conditions as part of this process.

Therefore, the Director General of the HSE may act, on his own initiative, to take account of an <i>ad misericordiam<\/i>appeal on a case by case basis to issue a discretionary card to such a person that has a serious medical condition. <\/p><p>People do not need to make an application to receive a card as the HSE is working as quickly as possible through its database to contact the people concerned over the next few weeks to inform them that their card is being issued.

This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  In line with this policy, the Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill was published on 23rd April 2014 and is currently progressing through the Oireachtas.  The Bill was debated and approved at Committee Stage on 19 June 2014 and it is intended that the legislation will be passed by the Oireachtas before the summer break.

I am currently progressing measures to ensure that we will have an adequate supply of highly skilled consultants, doctors and nurses.<\/p><p>  There has been a significant increase in the number of consultants (Whole Time Equivalents) since the establishment of the HSE, the number increased by 723 from 1,947 in January 2005 to 2,670 in December 2013. However there are some specialties in which there are international shortages and which have been traditionally difficult to fill, regardless of the salary scale. There are also some hospitals to which it has historically been difficult to attract applicants, in particular smaller hospitals. The establishment of Hospital Groups will help to address this issue, as this will allow doctors to be appointed as group resources. <\/p><p>  The ability of the public service to attract and retain high quality frontline staff shapes the extent to which the HSE can maintain and develop the range of health services required. I set up a group under the chairmanship of Professor Brian McCraith last July to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures. The Group will make recommendations aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system, planning for future service needs and realising maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training.  It provided an Interim Report in December 2013 focusing on training. In April 2014 the Group submitted its second report to me and this dealt with medical career structures and pathways following completion of specialist training. The final report of the Group will deal with a number of issues including workforce planning and this is due to be submitted to me by the end of this month. The work of the Group is key to ensuring that we have attractive propositions for consultants and doctors in training, NCHDs, in the years ahead.<\/p><p>  Additional nursing support is being made available throughout the system. Measures include the increase in nursing hours available under the HRA and the appointment of nearly 500 nurses and midwives under the graduate scheme, with over 200 others currently going through the recruitment process. This innovative model combines a contract of employment (with clinical rotation) with a fully funded interdependent education programme. I have just approved the establishment of a taskforce to develop a framework that will determine the staffing and skill mix requirements for the nursing workforce in a range of major specialities. The focus will be on the development of staffing and skill mix ranges which take account of a number of influencing factors. The taskforce is being chaired by the Chief Nursing Officer.<\/p><p>  Where frontline staffing shortages exist, the HSE makes alternative arrangements to ensure service provision, including recourse to agency and locum cover. However, it is preferable that sufficient numbers of doctors, nurses and NCHDs are recruited to permanent posts to support the most efficient and effective delivery of services. The details of availability and development of staff are a matter for the HSE and I have forwarded this aspect of the Deputy's questions to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500076#WRJ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":480,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500076#WRJ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":481,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[27517\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014062500076#WRJ01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which the working hours for junior hospital doctors are being brought into line with EU requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":482,"content":"<p>The provisions of the European Working Time Directive encompass a number of measures to protect workers' welfare and safety, including a maximum 48 hour working week - averaged over a reference period, the granting of breaks, minimum daily and weekly rest periods and the granting of compensatory rest where the working day exceeds 13 hours.  The HSE is focused on advancing implementation of the Directive and progress has been made in respect of NCHDs.  Data from the HSE shows that average working hours for NCHDs in 2009 was 60 hours a week, 54 hours per week in 2012 and just over 51 hours at the end of 2013. Intensive negotiations conducted at the Labour Relations Commission in September and October 2013 resulted in agreement on a joint approach, involving hospital management, the IMO and NCHDs to achieve EWTD compliance, with an immediate focus on eliminating shifts in excess of 24 hours. Data for March 2014 shows 93% compliance with this target, and 99.7% compliance in relation to elimination of working weeks in excess of 68 hours.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">     <\/font><\/b><\/p><p>NCHD recruitment and retention is required in order to facilitate the achievement of EWTD compliance.

However, there are international shortages of NCHDs in certain categories and specialties. There are also some hospitals to which it has been difficult to attract NCHDS, for a range of reasons including training opportunities and rural location.  <\/p><p>The next NCHD rotation occurs on 14th July. The HSE has advised that it is too early to be definitive on the level of vacancies that will arise, noting however that the number of posts that have not been filled is similar to previous years.

In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  However, in light of legal advice following on a ruling of the High Court, children born after 1 June 2002 are being treated by the HSE as eligible to apply for an assessment under the Act.  Part 2 of the 2005 Act provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants, occasioned by their disability, to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.  <\/p><p>  Although the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process given the number and complexity of cases, it has taken a number of measures to address the issue.  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child. <\/p><p>  Following the publication of a report commissioned from the National Disability Authority by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring disability services for children into integrated multidisciplinary geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the implementation of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme.  This involves the roll-out of a new model of service, the objective of which is to bring about equity and consistency, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their difficulty.
