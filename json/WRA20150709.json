Based upon current trends those requiring long-term care will increase by about 9,000 over the same period.In that context, it is important to both maintain and modernise our existing stock, particularly of public beds, and to ensure that sufficient additional capacity is provided across the public and private sectors to meet future demand. My Department is examining how this can best be achieved, and is committed to ensuring  that support continues to be available through the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, that there are adequate beds available for those who need them, and that relevant public funds and other resources are applied in the most efficient way possible and deliver value for money.<\/p><p>In this context my Department has engaged  DKM Economic Consultants to identify the policy options that are available to address future requirements for nursing home capacity, and to undertake a Cost Benefit Analysis of these options.

Challenges in recruiting nursing staff can mean that some beds have to be closed, although this is not amongst the most important contributory reasons in overall terms.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is committed to increasing nursing numbers and to the conversion of agency to permanent posts where feasible.  The development of capability within nursing to take on senior decision making roles in relation to delegated discharge is also a priority.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced in the last budget the delegation of greater autonomy to Departments and Agencies to manage their own staffing levels. The change from the application of a rigid employment control framework, with its particular focus on a moratorium on recruitment and compliance with employment ceilings and targets, to one operating strictly within allocated pay frameworks will allow for recruitment where it is determined that this can achieve more economical service delivery.  <\/p>  <p>  An extra 475 nurses and midwives have been employed between May 2014 and May 2015. In addition, the HSE is planning to recruit over 600 nurses across a number of nursing disciplines. There is significant work being undertaken to achieve this. This includes recent and ongoing national and local interviewing of General Nurses, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability, Registered Children's Nurses and Midwives.  The HSE has also developed an International Nurse Recruitment Project for filling posts. This initiative is a targeted recruitment drive in the UK primarily focused on Irish trained nurses who left during the moratorium. In order to facilitate this the services of a recruitment agency has been secured. It is hoped that the first of the interviews will commence in the coming weeks in a number of UK cities with the first nurses due to commence duty in August.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to workforce planning, Action 46 of Future Health (DoH, 2012) provides for the Department to work with the HSE to implement an effective approach to workforce planning and development with the objectives of: recruiting and retaining the right mix of staff; training and upskilling the workforce; providing for professional and career development; and creating supportive and healthy workplaces. In 2015, the Department of Health will develop a national integrated strategic framework for health workforce planning, on a cross-sectoral basis. A cross-sectoral Working Group will be convened to develop the framework in the near future. The Group's deliberations will take into account issues including population aging.

The current model of stand-alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally.

International studies and scientific assessments suggest that the best way to prevent most disease due to human papillomavirus (HPV) is to vaccinate as many girls and women as possible.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.  <\/p>  <p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  Gardasil&reg; is a medicinal product which has been authorised for use across the European Union since September 2006 following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  With this authorisation, the vaccine can be marketed in all EU Member States.  Since first authorisation the HPRA has continuously monitored the safety of Gardasil&reg;  .  This monitoring includes a review of global safety data in addition to national experience with use of the vaccine.  The EMA is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the European Union.  <\/p>  <p>While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil&reg; has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  This is done by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.  The most recent EU review of cumulative global safety update data completed in December 2014 concluded that the benefit\/risk profile for Gardasil&reg;   remains positive and concluded that no updates to the product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) were considered necessary.<\/p>  <p>Up to the 8 June 2015, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 873 reports of suspected adverse reactions\/events notified in association with Gardasil&reg;.  National monitoring experience has been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects known to occur with the vaccine, as outlined in the approved product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) for Gardasil&reg;  .  The majority of the reports received to date involved events\/reactions related to injection site reactions, malaise, headache, myalgia, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and skin reactions.  Vaccination related events such as dizziness and syncope (fainting) was also reported and would not be unexpected in this patient population.<\/p>  <p>The HPRA continues to ensure that the quality, safety and efficacy of all vaccinations licensed in Ireland including HPV meet the required standards.  The safety profile of Gardasil&reg;   has been continuously monitored since it was first introduced both nationally and at EU level and like all medicines and vaccines will continue to be so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900066#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900066#WRB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[27668\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900066#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to commission any reviews on the over-use of drugs in mental health and disability services for children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":75,"content":"<p>A Vision for Change provides for a comprehensive model of mental health care which highlights a person-centred and recovery-focussed approach across a span of mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  Where a person is referred to an appropriate health professional, and has been assessed and diagnosed as having a mental health condition, the diagnosis will inform the treatment plan for each individual.

In certain situations, particularly where people are experiencing acute symptoms of a serious psychiatric disorder, medication treatment is a key intervention in alleviating distress and in the treatment of this phase of the illness.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is committed to ensuring that all aspects of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) are delivered in a consistent and timely fashion, regardless of where the service is accessed throughout the country. The HSE recently launched  a Standard Operating  Procedure for both in-patient and community CAMHS, the purpose of which is to ensure that the delivery of services for those with mental health issues is carried out in a consistent and transparent manner, and that the care and treatment reflects the identified clinical needs of the child.<\/p>  <p>  The Mental Health Act 2001 also provides that the Office of the Inspector of Mental Health Services must also visit and inspect every approved centre, both for adults and children, both public and private, at least once in each year and furnish an annual report to the Mental Health Commission. This includes the quality of care and treatment given in such facilities, and examination of individual care plans, as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>In relation to Disability Services, inspections of designated centres are carried out under the Health Act 2007. The regulations in this area contain provisions relating to safeguards in respect of medication and pharmaceutical services, and set out the obligations of the service provider for medication management, and monitoring and review of medications.   <\/p>  <p>  Many children with disabilities take medications to support and improve their health conditions. Residential services have an overall responsibility to ensure that children receive effective and safe support to manage their medications when such assistance is required. Service providers are required to have policies and procedures in place to support this, outlining the parameters of the assistance that can be provided. <\/p>  <p>  Records are kept to account for all medicines and these records must be available for examination by HIQA, the independent statutory body with responsibility for the registration and inspection of designated centres for children and adults with disabilities. <\/p>  <p>  The Department, and the HSE will continue to provide the best possible standards of care for children, irrespective of setting, and to advance the concepts of Quality and Safety at all times. Given the safeguards in place, I  have no plans to commission any reviews on the over-use of drugs in either mental health and disability services for children at this time.  However, if the Deputy has any concerns concerning a particular care facility or an individual case, he should immediately contact the  HSE, which has operational responsibility to deliver services at individual levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900066#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900066#WRB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[27698\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900066#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is satisfied with the roll-out of service delivery reform in the area of mental health as envisaged under A Vision for Change, particularly in County Wexford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":78,"content":"<p>Since coming into office, this Government has prioritised the reform and resourcing of our mental health services in line with the recommendations in A Vision for Change.   Additional funding totalling &euro;125 million has been provided primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children and to enhance specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness, those with an intellectual disability and mental illness, and forensic mental health services.  <\/p>  <p>This sustained investment in mental health since 2012 is enabling the funding of over 1,150 new staff for the sector.  As at the April 2015, of the 416 approved posts in 2012, approximately 96% (397.5) are now filled.  Of the 477 posts approved in 2013, 85% (405.5) are filled.  The remainder of the vacant posts are at various stages of recruitment, with some difficulties in identifying some outstanding candidates, primarily for geographic and qualification reasons.  The recruitment of the 251 approved posts for 2014 has commenced, 52 have been hired of which 31 have started by 31st   March 2015 and a further 70.5 at various stages of the recruitment process.<\/p>  <p>A great deal of progress has been made with the accelerated closure of old psychiatric hospitals and their replacement with bespoke new facilities, better suited to modern mental health care.  Progress also includes the establishment of the HSE Mental Health Division which delivers on key recommendations of Vision  including, the development of child and adolescent services, shorter episodes of in-patient care, the adoption of a recovery approach in the delivery of services and the involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health policy, service planning and delivery.<\/p>  <p>In relation to Wexford, progress continues to be made.  In line with Vision, Wexford Mental Health Services have reorganised the provision of its services through the amalgamation of the Acute Mental Health Unit in St Senan's Hospital with Waterford Mental Health Services, which are now provided for in a 44 bed Acute In-patient Mental Health Unit in University Hospital, Waterford.  In addition to this, arrangements are in place whereby service users who live in North Wexford who attend Tara House Mental Health Services in Gorey, and require acute in-patient admission, have access to 5 beds at Newcastle Hospital, Greystones, Co. Wicklow.  This allows for 49 acute in-patient beds in total which meets the requirements as set out in Vision for Change  , which recommends 50 acute in-patient beds for each mental health extended catchment area of 300,000 population. <\/p>  <p>  To support the amalgamation of acute mental health services, a comprehensive &euro;18m capital investment programme was implemented with the main developments taking place in Co Wexford as follows: Tara House Community Mental Health Centre in Gorey &ndash; Day Hospital; Tus Nua, Rehabilitation Unit in Enniscorthy (12 bedded unit); Havenview (14 bedded unit) and Millview (12 bedded unit) Intellectual Disability and Rehabilitation Units,  Enniscorthy; Farnogue Psychiatry of Later Life Unit and Team Headquarters, Wexford (50 long stay elderly beds); Upgrade of Summerhill Community Mental Health Unit, Wexford.<\/p>  <p>  The amalgamation of Waterford\/Wexford Mental Health Services together with the development of community Mental Health Services, and the capital development programme, has facilitated a reduction (by approximately 40% from March 2011 to present) in the need for acute admission to the Acute In-patient Mental Health Unit at University Hospital Waterford.  <\/p>  <p>  In July 2014 a new purpose built 10-bed Crisis Respite Unit, An Tearmann, opened in Enniscorthy to provide 10 respite beds for service users who are referred through their mental health community team for respite care.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, there are a number of Mental Health Services in operation in Wexford, seven days a week from 9 am &ndash; 5 pm, at Tara House Gorey, Carn House Enniscorthy, Summerhill Wexford and Maryville, New Ross.  There is also a 7-day Specialist Liaison Services at the Emergency Department Wexford General and the Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse (SCAN) service is available in Wexford, working with General Practitioners in the Community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900066#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Departments","counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900066#WRB01750"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[27372\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900066#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the action that is being taken to address the overcrowding crisis in the accident and emergency unit in Beaumont Hospital in Dublin 9; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":81,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

Of this &euro;25m: &euro;10m was used to provide an additional 300 places under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. This reduced the waiting time for approved applicants from 17 weeks to 11 weeks; &euro;8m was used to provide access to an additional 115 short stay beds across the Dublin area; &euro;5m was used to provide 400 additional Home Care Packages to benefit 600 people over the course of a year: and &euro;2m was used to expand the Community Intervention Team services in primary care across Dublin and the surrounding region.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2015 the Government provided a further &euro;74m to address issues that impact on delayed discharges. This amount built on the &euro;25m provided earlier and was allocated as follows: &euro;44m was allocated to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to provide an additional 1,600 places and to further reduce waiting times for approved applicants from 11 to 4 weeks; the remaining &euro;30m was principally applied to provide additional transitional care beds, some of which were on a temporary basis to address the particular pressures then being experienced by acute hospitals. <\/p>  <p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) budget in 2015 is &euro;993 million, which includes the additional &euro;54 million referred to above.  It is expected that a waiting period of 4 weeks will be maintained for approved applicants for the rest of the year. <\/p>  <p>  The latest information available to me is that there are about 22,600 people now receiving financial support under the NHSS.  The Scheme is continuing to take on new clients and it is estimated that we will be supporting in excess of 23,900 people by the end of this year.  <\/p>  <p>  The position regarding the availability of nursing home beds is that there are some areas where supply is tight, and individuals sometimes have to wait for a place in the facility of their  choice, but in overall terms there are enough nursing home beds to meet demand. However, between now and 2024 the population over 65 years is projected to increase by about 200,000 people. Based upon current trends those requiring long-term care will increase by about 9,000 over the same period.   In that context, it is important to both consolidate our existing stock, particularly of public beds, and to ensure that sufficient additional capacity is provided across the public and private sectors to meet future demand.

Thirty-seven community and voluntary groups participated in the forum.  The forum gave organisations that represent the community and voluntary sector, including lone parent representative groups, an opportunity to voice their views and priorities in relation to social welfare expenditure in the context of the forthcoming Budget.  In light of these views and priorities, which I openly welcomed, I look forward to examining the various supports that are available to all families, including lone parent families, in the next Budget.<\/p>  <p>  This year the Department will be spending approximately &euro;607 million on the one-parent family payment scheme. <\/p>  <p>  However, despite extensive funding being committed to lone parent payments since the 1970s, lone parents remain the most at-risk-of-poverty, and their children are at a high risk of poverty.  For too long, significant numbers of lone parents have been typecast and, also, confined to long-term social welfare dependency.  The best route out of poverty and dependency is through paid employment.  The purpose of the recently implemented changes to the one-parent family payment scheme is to maximise the opportunities for lone parents to enter into and increase employment.  <\/p>  <p>  The changes to the scheme, which culminated in the reduction of the maximum child age threshold to 7 years for all recipients on 2 July, 2015, address the poverty and dependency experienced by many lone parents by providing them with improved access to the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment supports.  In addition, I was pleased to introduce the back to work family dividend in the last Budget.  This provides a significant incentive for families with children to move into employment &ndash; as recently reported by the ESRI. <\/p>  <p>  Access to these supports is imperative for lone parents in order to ensure that their prospects of securing employment and financial independence are improved.<\/p>  <p>  Any reversal of the changes to the scheme would delay this critical interaction between lone parents and the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services and would potentially increase the barriers that they face to entering employment in the future.<\/p>  <p>  I therefore have no plans to reverse the recent changes to the one-parent family payment scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900072#WRH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Expenditure","counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900072#WRH02900"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[28150\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900072#WRH03000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"following the pre-budget forum held on 3 July 2015 if she will increase rent supplement levels to address homelessness.

Over 10,000 new tenancies have been processed since the start of the year, indicating that significant numbers of people are being accommodated under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the valuable inputs and proposals provided by the various groups which attended the pre-budget forum on 3 July 2015, and note the views to increase maximum limits under the rent supplement scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The Department carried out a review of the maximum rent limits which found that increasing rent limits could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not alone rent supplement recipients, but lower-income workers and students. Between rent supplement and the Rental Accommodation Scheme administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market and is, therefore, a very significant player in the sector. The Department&rsquo;s review of rent limits points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting and seeking to rent is the reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation. In this regard, the Government will deliver significantly increased supply of social and affordable housing through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy. <\/p>  <p>  Rather than a blanket increase in rent limits which at this time will not address the fundamental issue, the Department has implemented preventative measures to provide for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework. Under this approach, the circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits. The Department also works with Threshold&rsquo;s Tenancy Sustainment service in Dublin and Cork city where supply is most acute, with plans under way to extend this service to Galway City. This flexible approach has already assisted over 2,500 rent supplement households nationwide through increased rent payments. <\/p>  <p>  Where Departmental staff are notified of a threat of tenancy loss, the preventative measures are implemented as appropriate. The Department has also undertaken a communications campaign to encourage people at risk to avail of these measures. I am continuing to keep this matter under review to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided in the light of vital feedback which we receive from the community and voluntary sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900072#WRH03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":281,"content":"<p>Question No. 102 answered with Question No. 70.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":282,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900073#WRJ00250"},{"type":"question","counter":283,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[28190\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900073#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she is aware that a significant data breach occurred within her Department with regard to a person (details supplied); if she is aware that as a consequence of the mistake, child benefit was discontinued for this person who is a lone parent; that due to the nature of the breach other significant negative consequences for this person and their child may have arisen; the steps her Department has taken to rectify the situation; if the Data Protection Commissioner has been made aware of the breach; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":284,"content":"<p>The issue referred to arose from information received from another State Agency in relation to an individual.

If it is received as capital it will be taxed under the Capital Gains Tax rules.<\/p>  <p>  In last year's Finance Act, I included provisions allowing for a measure of tax relief to the many thousands of Irish shareholders with a small shareholding in Vodafone plc who inadvertently found themselves subject to an unintended liability to income tax, PRSI and USC rather than a nil capital gains tax liability arising from a return of value payment from that company. I did this because the shareholding of very many of those individuals arose originally from their investment in Eircom plc and, as a result of which investment, they continue to carry capital losses. I considered, given the particular background in that case, that to leave those shareholders with income tax and other liabilities on foot of a decision they inadvertently made or didn't make at all would have been inequitable.

At an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and thus the interaction of individual earnings with household income and supports such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement and housing, education and health supports all contribute to an individual's standard of living.  In the UK, it is a voluntary code that some employers, who pay in excess of the UK national minimum wage, are keen to be associated with. The Living Wage concept draws its strength from the fact that it is a grassroots civil society campaign. It has been successful in the UK, with around 1,500 separate employers across the country having endorsed the approach. <\/p>  <p>  In this context, I intend to hold a Living Wage forum in the Autumn, the first of its kind, to which civil society organisations, trade unions and, crucially, employers will be invited to discuss the concept of a Living Wage in Ireland and how it can be applied here. <\/p>  <p>  I fully support the concept of a Living Wage. However, I would differentiate the application of a mandatory National Minimum Wage and a societal movement that would see employers volunteer and be proud to pay what might be considered to be a Living Wage.<\/p>  <p>  The National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Bill 2015 is expected to be enacted shortly. The Bill provides for the establishment of the Low Pay Commission whose main function will be, on an annual basis, to examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.

The scheme is the national implementation of the Commission&rsquo;s initiative to facilitate payback of the superlevy bill over an extended three year period on an interest free basis. On the basis of the larger than usual superlevy bill faced by farmers I was anxious to implement the scheme here as quickly as possible. My Department consulted widely with both milk suppliers and purchasers and this is reflected in the final scheme design which has been broadly welcomed. After receiving the detailed rules on 18 June, milk purchasers distributed the information on the instalment scheme, in addition to the application forms , to all the suppliers in their area who incurred a super levy liability in the 2014\/2015 quota year. Milk producers who intend to avail of the scheme were required to complete the first section of the form and return it to their milk purchaser by the 30 of June. Milk purchasers must then complete the second section of the form and have until the 15 of July to return the completed forms to my Department. This process is currently underway and it is after this date that we will have more information on the level of uptake of the scheme. <\/p>  <p>Under the terms of the scheme milk producers can pay their super levy liability over three years. Producers who participate in the scheme must have paid at least one third of their super levy liability to their milk purchaser in time for the purchaser to forward the payment to the Department by the 1 of October 2015. The second and third instalments must be paid by the producer in accordance with the terms of the formal agreement that will be signed by each participating producer. This will require that at least two thirds of the entire levy due from a producer will be paid by the 30 of September 2016, with the outstanding amount paid by the 30 September 2017. The repayments will be required in equal amounts in the months of May to September in each of those years. <\/p>  <p>It should be noted also that the scheme design allows for participation from farmers who are no longer supplying milk to the milk purchaser with whom they incurred the levy as well as allowing for suppliers to switch his or her milk purchaser at any time during the lifetime of the scheme subject to their own milk supply arrangements with their purchaser. <\/p>  <p>I am satisfied that there are systems in place to ensure compliance with the scheme. <\/p>  <p>My Department issued a detailed FAQ note at the time of the scheme launch which is also available on our website and which answers most of the main queries.

Therefore, there was an over-claimed amount of 49.34 hectares of commonage for the years up to 2012 and this resulted in a clawback of REPS payments already made prior to 2012 and a further reduction within his 2012 Scheme Year payment.

This will be underpinned by core communications principles of openness and honesty; professionalism; accuracy; engagement; being informative; responsiveness, and being legally sound.<\/p><p>The Communications Strategy is designed to promote policing excellence and our changing culture through a wide variety of communication channels in a co-ordinated and consistent way to demonstrate An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s on-going commitment to protecting and supporting communities and the State.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Communications Strategy can be accessed on-line at<i>www.garda.ie\/Documents\/User\/Communicating%20Better%20On%20All%20Fronts%20-.pdf<\/i>.<\/p><p>As part of the Communications Strategy, a range of Garda experts will be selected and trained to provide comment to local and national media on the work being undertaken across the organisation as well as public safety messages.  They will do this in line with existing regulations relating to the interaction between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the media.<\/p><p>Any member of the public who believes that he or she has been the subject of unauthorised disclosure of information by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may make a complaint to the independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which has extensive powers of investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900077#WRN03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Firearms Licences","counter":426,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900078#WRO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":427,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[28065\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900078#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding the review of firearms licensing legislation; if the concerns of the National Association of Regional Game Councils and the Sports Coalition have been given detailed consideration; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":428,"content":"<p>As part of the consultation process for the on-going review of firearms licensing I have given  a commitment that I would not make any decisions until I had met the key stakeholders, including the organisations who represent those who use firearms for sporting purposes.<font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font>I had a useful meeting with the key stakeholders on 29 April 2015.

HIQA identified two areas of significant risk in the 27 standards examined: firstly, delays in assessments by dedicated social workers, and secondly, management of assessments of adults who were alleged to pose a risk to children. These risks largely arise from staffing shortages. They were brought to the attention of the area manager during the inspection and immediate action taken.  The associated action plan has been accepted by HIQA and there are clear timelines for completion before the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that some commentators have focused on references to delays in Tusla notifications to Garda&iacute; in relation to allegations of physical and sexual abuse, and the impact this delay was having on Garda investigations.  It is right that to be concerned about this.  However, the inspection report indicates clearly that this issue had been resolved well before the report was published.  Management level meetings had increased in frequency and had strengthened communication, leading to better management of cases.  The HIQA inspection report goes on to reference positive results from a survey of Garda representatives regarding the response by Dublin North over the previous 12 months.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s action plan indicates that it is redeploying staff to assist in handling high priority cases, and has commenced internal staff transfers to address staffing shortages.  In addition, it is improving management of lower risk cases by rolling out training in Meitheal, so that families can be referred to family support services where it is appropriate to do so.  Tusla is currently developing cultural competency training, with social workers on duty teams being prioritised for such training.  Tusla is actively working to fill all social work vacancies, including posts with a particular focus on managing cases of retrospective child abuse.<\/p>  <p>  As with previous reports, there were a number of positive findings. HIQA found that children at most serious risk of harm received a timely and effective service and there was excellent inter-agency collaboration, strong leadership and communication systems in the area.

They were found to be of no relevance to Ireland, given our regulated fluoridation levels.  The view of the Expert Body is that the overall design of the studies is poor and they do not provide evidence of any effect on children's IQ from either high or low fluoride levels.  This view was shared by EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) in its Report in 2011.  The evidence review by the Health Research Board, \"Health Effects of Water Fluoridation\", which was published in June 2015 also supports this view.  It found that there was only one study carried out in an area like Ireland where there is community water fluoridation that examined fluoride and IQ.  This was a prospective cohort study in New Zealand.  The study concluded that there was no evidence of a detrimental effect on IQ as a result of exposure to community water fluoridation.

In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold. Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs.<\/p>  <p>  The Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) payment is made by the Minister for Social Protection to carers in respect of a child at home under 16 years of age with a severe disability, where it has been determined that the child requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age. Eligibility for the DCA is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required. As such it is not possible to say if a particular child or any particular medical condition or disability will qualify for a payment under the DCA scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Out of an approximate population of 1 million people under the age of 16 years, almost 450,000 held a medical card or a GP visit card. Approximately 29,000 children qualified for the DCA payment in 2014. It is estimated that about two-thirds of children qualifying for a DCA payment also hold a medical card. In addition, from 1 July 2015, all children under the age of 6 years are entitled to access a GP service free of charge, as part of the first phase of introducing a universal GP service in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  At the time of the publication of the report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility the HSE announced a range of actions to enhance the operation of the medical card scheme and make it more sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs. The medical card system is now operating in a more sensible and sensitive manner. The HSE is exercising greater discretion, as is evident in the increase in the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation which have grown by 67% from 52,000 in mid-2014 to 87,000 by mid-2015.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the Keane Report, the Director General of the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group (CAG). The CAG is to provide clinical oversight and guidance to the operation of the medical card system. This is with a view to ensuring that the relatively small percentage of cases requiring the recognition of the burden of a medical condition over and above financial hardship can be accommodated. The CAG is continuing its consideration of the medical card assessment process to provide for the measurement of the burden of disease.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900083#WRT01100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"question","counter":572,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[28066\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900083#WRT01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will review eligibility for a medical card in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare, given that the person is in receipt of a disability allowance and the person's spouse has a full medical card; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":573,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

The HSE introduced an embargo on recruitment in 2007, and this was followed by the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public sector in 2008. This curtailed nursing recruitment across the public health service. The net effect in terms of nursing numbers was a reduction in excess of 4,500 over the period. During this difficult period there were very few career opportunities for Irish Nursing graduates in the Irish publicly funded health services and as such they emigrated in significant numbers to the UK and Australia. <\/p>  <p>  There has been a significant reduction in the starting salary for all public servants including nurses, given the need to reduce the public sector pay bill. Although the gross salaries for Irish nurses remain comparable with our UK competitors, taxation and other deductions make them less attractive. <\/p>  <p>  While there was a significant reduction in the number of nurses and midwives up to the end of 2013, the position is now improving. The HSE is committed to increasing nursing numbers and to the conversion of agency to permanent posts where feasible. An extra 475 nurses and midwives have been employed between May 2014 and May 2015. In addition, the HSE is planning to recruit over 600 nurses across a number of nursing disciplines. There is significant work being undertaken to achieve this. This includes recent and ongoing national and local interviewing of General Nurses, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability, Registered Children's Nurses and Midwives.  The HSE has also developed an International Nurse Recruitment Project for filling posts. This initiative is a targeted recruitment drive in the UK primarily focused on Irish trained nurses who left during the moratorium. In order to facilitate this the services of a recruitment agency has been secured.

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced in the last budget, that he intends to delegate greater autonomy to Departments and Agencies to manage their own staffing levels. The change from the application of a rigid employment control framework, with its particular focus on a moratorium on recruitment and compliance with employment ceilings and targets, to one operating strictly within allocated pay frameworks will allow for recruitment where it is determined that this can achieve more economical service delivery.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important for the Deputy to note that, an extra 475 nurses and midwives have been employed between May 2014 and May 2015. In addition, the HSE is planning to recruit over 600 nurses across a number of nursing disciplines. There is significant work being undertaken to achieve this.

It is hoped that the first of the interviews will commence in the coming weeks in a number of UK cities with the first nurses due to commence duty in August.  This move is to be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a significant increase in the number of consultants (Whole Time Equivalents) since the establishment of the HSE, the number increased by 723 from 1,947 in January 2005 to 2,671 in May 2015. However, there are some specialties in which there is an international shortage and which have been traditionally difficult to fill, regardless of the salary scale. There are also some hospitals to which it has historically been difficult to attract applicants, in particular smaller hospitals. The establishment of Hospital Groups will help to address this difficulty, as this will allow doctors to be appointed as group resources. The number of NCHDS has also increased significantly in recent years. This increase will help to address service needs and progress EWTD compliance, thereby improving the working conditions of doctors.<\/p>  <p>  The ability of the HSE and the health service to attract and retain high quality frontline staff shapes the extent to which the HSE can maintain and develop the range of health services required. The MacCraith Group was established  to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures. The Group made a series of recommendations in its three reports aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system and importantly, planning for future service needs.  It provided an Interim Report in December 2013 focusing on training. In April 2014 the Group submitted its second report to the then Minister for Health, James Reilly. This second report dealt with medical career structures and pathways following completion of specialist training. The final report of the Group, dealing with workforce planning was submitted to me in June 2014. The implementation of the Group's recommendations is being actively pursued and monitored. It is noted in particular that revised pay rates for new entrant consultants, incorporating incremental credit for relevant experience and qualifications, were proposed by the LRC in January this year to address the barrier caused by the variation in rates of remuneration between new entrant consultants and their established peers that had emerged since 2012 and that these are now being implemented. Significant progress is also being made in improving the training experience of NCHDs and in improving their working conditions.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to workforce planning, Action 46 of Future Health (DoH, 2012) provides for the Department to work with the HSE to implement an effective approach to workforce planning and development with the objectives of: recruiting and retaining the right mix of staff; training and upskilling the workforce; providing for professional and career development; and creating supportive and healthy workplaces. In 2015, the Department of Health will develop a national integrated strategic framework for health workforce planning, on a cross-sectoral basis. A cross-sectoral Working Group will be convened to develop the framework in the near future. The Group's deliberations will take into account issues including population aging. Consultation with key stakeholders will form part of the Group's work.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this reply proves useful for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900085#WRV00800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Data","counter":629,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900085#WRV00850"},{"type":"question","counter":630,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[28173\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900085#WRV00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of applications for medical cards made in each of the past 12 months to date; the number refused or granted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":631,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

Applications are being assessed by former High Court Judge Maureen Harding Clark and the Scheme has in the region of &euro;34 million available.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme has brought to an end years of uncertainty and costs for women who have undergone surgical symphysiotomy. Judge Clark has informed my officials that as at 6 June 2015, 216 offers have been made to women including 1 offer that was rejected. 200 of those offers have been accepted with 15 offers awaiting a response. Of the 200 offers accepted by applicants, 122 were assessed at &euro;50,000, 73 at &euro;100,000 and 5 at &euro;150,000. <\/p>  <p>   Where there was a delay arising in the compilation of a woman's supporting documentation due to difficulty in obtaining medical records, applications were accepted by the Scheme, provided the application was received within the time period set out in the Scheme, with a written explanation of the reasons for the absence of the documentation. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme continues to contact applicants who have provided incomplete documentation. The applicants are encouraged to engage with the Scheme and to make the Scheme aware of any particular problems.  The Scheme seeks to provide every assistance possible to the women in a fair, transparent and person centred manner, to assist them to complete  their applications and provide relevant evidence of disability.  <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme was designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial and aims to minimise the stress for all women concerned. The Scheme was designed following meetings with all three support groups, two of which have welcomed its establishment.  It was set up to give women who do not wish to pursue their cases through the courts an alternative option in which payments are made to women who have had a surgical symphysiotomy, whether or not negligence is proven. The Scheme is voluntary and women did not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition to participating in the Scheme. Women may opt out of the Scheme at any stage in the process, up to the time of accepting their award.  It is only on accepting the offer of an award that a woman must agree to discontinue her legal proceedings against any party arising out of a symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.<\/p>  <p>  There have been two High Court cases in recent months in relation to symphysiotomy. The first, where the woman underwent a symphysiotomy following the birth of her child by Caesarean section, was settled in February 2015 without admission of liability in the sum of &euro;200,000.   It should be noted that applicants to the Symphysiotomy Payment Scheme with this type of symphysiotomy are entitled to the highest award of &euro;150,000 on submission of the necessary documentary proofs, for example, the relevant hospital records indicating that this procedure was carried out. <\/p>  <p>The second case ran in the High Court for 15 days and judgement was delivered on 1 May, 2015.  In this case the Judge dismissed the claim for damages by a 74 year old woman who had a symphysiotomy 12 days before the birth of her baby in 1963 and who had also taken legal proceedings against the Hospital.  The Judge ruled that even though the woman has suffered since the operation, the practice of prophylactic symphysiotomy (that is before the birth of the baby) &ldquo;was not a practice without justification&rdquo; in 1963. The Judge also stated in his judgment that   'Though I would in the words of Sir Ranulph Crewe, Chief Justice of England, &ldquo;take hold of a twig or twine-thread&rdquo; to uphold the plaintiff&rsquo;s case, I must find that this remarkable lady whose story indeed deserves to be told must fail in her case against the defendants'.<\/p>  <p>  Judge Clark has commissioned medical experts in the areas of obstetrics and gynaecology, radiology and orthopaedic surgery to assist her in assessing the women's applications, where there is absence of evidence either that the procedure was undertaken, or of its consequences on the health of the woman. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has given careful and detailed consideration to this complex and sensitive matter.  It believes that the provision of the Scheme, together with the ongoing provision of medical services by the HSE, including medical cards, represents a comprehensive response to this issue, which should  help bring closure for the women, many of whom are elderly, and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900086#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centre Provision","counter":654,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900086#WRW00800"},{"type":"question","counter":655,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[28181\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900086#WRW00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of primary care centres  fully operational; those pending; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":656,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.

Community rating is a fundamental cornerstone of the Irish health insurance system. Under community rating, the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid. This means that people who are old or sick do not have to pay more for the same insurance plan than the young and healthy. Insurers are also required to accept all applicants for health insurance, regardless of their health status or age. <\/p>  <p>For community rating to work we depend on adequate numbers of younger people taking out health insurance to help keep premium prices down for everybody. Lifetime community rating, which came into operation on 1 May 2015,  modifies community rating so that the premium that\u00a0individuals pay for health insurance increases with the age at which they enter the\u00a0health insurance market.   Late entry loadings now apply for people aged 35 and over when taking out health insurance for the first time. Lifetime community rating encourages people to take out health insurance at a younger age, thereby helping to spread the health costs of older and less healthy people across all insured persons. It is a necessary measure to help support the viability of community rating within our system of health insurance.<\/p>  <p>An effective and robust Risk Equalisation Scheme is in place to support to community rating by equalising the risk of insuring older or less healthy people across the market. The scheme involves the payment of risk equalisation credits to insurers which are funded by stamp duties levied on insurers, based on all policies written.   All insurers receive payments from the Risk Equalisation Fund in respect of their older customers and the number of overnight stays in hospital incurred by their customers. The Risk Equalisation Scheme offsets some of the additional cost of insuring older and less healthy members. This allows all insured persons to continue to pay the same net amount for a given health insurance product and helps to support affordable premiums for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900086#WRW01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Accommodation Provision","counter":660,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900086#WRW01400"},{"type":"question","counter":661,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[28184\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900086#WRW01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is aware that the parental accommodation at Our Lady's hospital in Crumlin in Dublin 12 is at such a low standard that parents, after spending the whole day with their sick son, were placed in a room which had sick on the bed and floor, and which provided one single bed with no pillow or blanket for the two parents; and if he will allocate sufficient funding to the hospital to ensure it will provide an adequate standard of accommodation for parents, who must be with their children 24 hours a day, seven days a week.","asker":"1065","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":662,"content":"<p>It is acknowledged that parental accommodation at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin is not adequate.

As we approach the centenary of the 1916 Rising next year, I am keen to encourage people around the world to reconnect with their Irish roots.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900090#WRAA01700","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Natural Heritage","counter":792,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900090#WRAA01750"},{"type":"question","counter":793,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[28024\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900090#WRAA01800","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the measures that are being taken to halt the loss of native plant biodiversity, given the increase occurrence of cases of invasive species such as giant hogweed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":794,"content":"<p>While it is certain that invasive species are having negative effects on biodiversity locally, through competition and complete or partial replacement of the native flora\/vegetation communities, my Department does not currently consider that rare plant species are under imminent threat from such invasives.
