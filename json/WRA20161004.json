These assessments will be undertaken by students across the junior cycle, one in 2nd year and one in 3rd year.  The second CBA will be followed by a written Assessment Task which will be externally marked by the State Examinations Commission.  The Assessment Task is worth 10% of the marks for the final examination.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier grounds for objection of the ASTI to the new Framework have been addressed.  Under the 2015 Framework agreed with the unions, teachers are now not involved in assessing their own students for State certification purposes.<\/p>  <p>  However, teachers of English who are members of ASTI have been directed by their union that, while they are to teach the new specification, they are not to undertake the Classroom Based Assessments (CBAs) with their students.\u00a0 Therefore, students who are taught by a teacher who is a member of the ASTI will not receive a grade for their CBAs.  Since the second CBA is linked to the written Assessment Task these students cannot complete the Assessment Task.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department recently met with the ASTI on this matter, where the position regarding the written Assessment Task was made very clear.  In cases where the Assessment Task is not completed the State Examinations Commission cannot award any marks in respect of this mandatory component.  Therefore, candidates for Junior Cycle English in 2017 who do not complete the assessment task can only be marked and graded based on a maximum of 90% of the available marks.<\/p>  <p>  Given the very unfair position in which the ASTI directive now places teachers and students of English, my Department asked ASTI to provide an immediate derogation from their directive for current teachers of English, while talks on the Junior Cycle proceed, in order that current third year English students of ASTI members are no longer unfairly and unjustifiably disadvantaged. \u00a0The ASTI have yet to respond on this request.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400057#WRB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pupil-Teacher Ratio","counter":56,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400057#WRB00700"},{"type":"question","counter":57,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[28379\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400057#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools in the upcoming budget; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":58,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government has a commitment to reduce class sizes at primary level.<\/p><p>Budget 2016 provides for a one point\u00a0improvement to the staffing allocation to primary schools, which has been implemented for the 2016\/17 school year.

These are the 33 hours of additional work per year (less than one hour per week) that were agreed under the Croke Park agreement, to facilitate staff meetings, parent-teacher meetings, etc., without closing schools.  ASTI's decision to withdraw from these hours means that the union has repudiated the Lansdowne Road Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has committed to fully implementing the Lansdowne Road Agreement in accordance with the timelines agreed, subject to the continued cooperation of the unions.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement remains the framework for public service pay.  It is the only framework available for managing the needs of the public service while implementing the reforms that enable us to deliver better public services in the future.<\/p>  <p>  In opting to withdraw from the LRA, ASTI members are also opting to forego a series of benefits and protections.  These include avoiding an increment freeze, continuation of the alleviation of the FEMPI Act 2013 pay cut for higher earners, the addition of the &euro;1,592 Supervision and Substitution allowance to the pay scale and protection against compulsory redundancy.<\/p>  <p>  Further significant consequences of withdrawing from the Lansdowne Road Agreement are the withdrawal of the benefits introduced under the Ward Report and the non-application of the revised sequence for the filling of posts\/hours, both of which measures enable new teachers to gain permanent employment and full hours more quickly than before.  In addition, newly qualified ASTI members will not receive the benefits of the recent agreement reached with TUI and INTO on new entrant pay.<\/p>  <p>  I previously offered that my Department would suspend the implementation of measures associated with ASTI&rsquo;s repudiation of the Lansdowne Road Agreement, if the union suspends their directive to withdraw from the Croke Park hours.  This would provide a more constructive context for talks to take place and would avoid disruption in schools.  It would also mean that thousands of ASTI teachers would receive the payment for supervision and substitution as well as other benefits and protections under the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Unfortunately, ASTI have refused this offer thus far but it remains open.<\/p>  <p>  Despite this, my Department is making arrangements to continue the ongoing discussions with ASTI in relation to their issues of concern.  I believe that continuing dialogue between my Department and the ASTI would be in the best interests of schools, parents, students and teachers as is evidenced by the agreements reached with the INTO and TUI.

These are the 33 hours of additional work per year (less than one hour per week) that were agreed under the Croke Park agreement, to facilitate staff meetings, parent-teacher meetings, etc., without closing schools.  ASTI's decision to withdraw from these hours means that the union has repudiated the Lansdowne Road Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has committed to fully implementing the Lansdowne Road Agreement in accordance with the timelines agreed, subject to the continued cooperation of the unions.

Further significant consequences of withdrawing from the Lansdowne Road Agreement are the withdrawal of the benefits introduced under the Ward Report and the non-application of the revised sequence for the filling of posts\/hours, both of which measures enable new teachers to gain permanent employment and full hours more quickly than before.

It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2015, I published the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015, as approved by Government.  The Bill provides for two new offences of purchasing sexual services, in the context of prostitution.  The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.  The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, in the context of prostitution, and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and\/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not commit an offence. <\/p>  <p>  These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012.  The new offences also implement the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.  Both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have recognised the effectiveness of the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services as a tool in the fight against human trafficking.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill has completed all stages in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and is scheduled for consideration at Second Stage before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 5 October 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400059#WRD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400059#WRD02400"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[28196\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400059#WRD02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if stamp 4 will be facilitated in the case of a person (details supplied); the correct procedure to be followed in this instance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":212,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person in question entered the State in 2013 and was registered as a student to 01 October 2016.

The Authority comprises eleven members of whom a majority, including the Chairperson, are to be lay persons.  While members of the new Regulatory Authority are duly appointed by the Government under these procedures, under section 9 (2)(a) of the 2015 Act, a resolution approving such appointment has first to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The relevant procedures set out in Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 are being adhered to as regards the nomination by the nominating bodies designated in the Act and the approval and appointment of members of the new Regulatory Authority.  For example, resolutions of both Houses approving members of the Authority were passed in July with resolutions concerning one remaining nominee being considered for approval by the Houses this week.<\/p>  <p>  By way of ensuring the new Authority&rsquo;s independence of appointment and the desired balance in its representation of the interests of lawyers and those of consumers of legal services, all of the potential members of the new Authority are put forward, subject to stated criteria, by those prescribed nominating bodies set out in section 9 of the 2015 Act.  Each of these bodies puts forward their nominees as identified by them under their own selection procedures.  They do this as appropriate to their functions and objectives as may be set out, in each case, under legislation or under common law.  It will, therefore, be for those bodies, in the first instance, to resolve any alleged breach of process that may arise under their applicable internal governance procedures. <\/p>  <p>  Section 12 of the Legal Services Act 2015 sets out a number of circumstances in which the Government may remove a member of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority from office by reference to ill health, stated misbehaviour, conflict of interest or being otherwise unfit to hold the office or unable to discharge its functions.  This section also sets out the procedures for such a removal including notification of the member and of the nominating body concerned and the provision of a statement of the reasons for the proposal to remove the member.  It also allows the member or nominating body concerned a period to make representations as to why the member should not be removed from office.  When, having taken account of these matters, the Government decide to remove a member, they shall notify the member and the nominating body concerned subject to possible appeal to the High Court which may, as it thinks proper, either affirm or overturn the decision concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400059#WRD05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Data","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400059#WRD06000"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[28439\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400059#WRD06100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the total number, broken down by type, of crimes reported in each of the electoral area wards in Galway city for 2014, 2015 and to date in 2016; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>The Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, is responsible for the compilation and publication of the official recorded crime statistics, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.

Included in the 2016 TSG Income Tax &amp;amp; USC paper are details of the distribution of the burden of these taxes, international comparisons, and analysis of potential impacts on different groups of a range of possible reforms.\u00a0 The TSG papers were circulated to the Oireachtas Committees in July, well in advance of the Budget and facilitating the Committees in considering distributional issues.  They were subsequently published on the Department of Finance website. Overall, the analysis and transparency of the decision making process, as well as awareness and assessment of the impact of these decisions on different members of the population, has undergone constant improvement over recent years and continues to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400061#WRF03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Rehiring","counter":365,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400061#WRF03900"},{"type":"question","counter":366,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[28979\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400061#WRF04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of retired public sector employees in his Department, including bodies under its aegis, that are in receipt of a public sector pension that have been re-employed either part-time or full-time, temporary or otherwise by the public sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":367,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that there are currently no public sector employees in my Department\u00a0in receipt of a public sector pension who\u00a0have been re-employed either part time or full time, temporary or otherwise by the public sector.<\/p><p>However, from time to time my Department and the Public Appointments Service (PAS) engage former employees to sit on Interview Boards for\u00a0Internal \/ External Competitions.<\/p><p>I am awaiting information regarding Bodies under the aegis of my Department and will communicate with the Deputy directly on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400061#WRF04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":368,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400061#WRF04200"},{"type":"question","counter":369,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[28992\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400061#WRF04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of staff employed by his Department or seconded to his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1232","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":370,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that as at 30th September, 2016 there were 326 staff employed in my Department.

Recruitment to apprenticeship is therefore driven by employers rather than by SOLAS or by education and training providers. <\/p>  <p>  The 2014 Review of Apprenticeship in Ireland acknowledged that the number of women employed in craft apprenticeships is low as they operate in sectors that have traditionally low levels of female employment.<\/p>  <p>  SOLAS offers a bursary to employers to encourage women to take up apprenticeships in these areas. Despite this the number of female apprentices remains low.<\/p>  <p>  Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers. 25 proposals have been prioritised by the Council for development.  The first of these new apprenticeships, the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship, was launched last month with further new apprenticeships to be launched later this year and early next year.<\/p>  <p>  Many of these new apprenticeships are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace and I am confident that this will lead to a strong increase in female participation when these new apprenticeships are launched in the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  Accompanying the renewal and expansion of apprenticeship in Ireland will be a new branding and marketing campaign.

The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme, which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website <i>( www.pyriteboard.ie)<\/i>.<\/p><p>The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  It is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion.<\/p><p>Given the scheme does not apply to dwellings which have a Damage Condition Rating of 1, the Board do not maintain records on the number of properties that fall into this category.  Nevertheless, the Board is aware that 7 dwellings, which had a Damage Condition Rating of 1 when their building condition assessments were first completed, and which were refused under the scheme, have now progressed to a Damage Condition Rating of 2; these dwellings have now been included in the pyrite remediation scheme following the submission of new applications.<\/p><p>In general terms, the cost of pyrite remediation is largely dependent on the dwelling type, the number of units in a project, the floor area of the dwellings, the depth of hardcore in the units and the presence or otherwise of under-floor heating systems.  Against this background, remediation costs can vary significantly and may not always be directly comparable across projects.  While my Department monitors overall expenditure under the scheme, the costs associated with individual projects are determined by on-going competitive procurement processes, which fall within the remit of the Housing Agency.  However the average cost of remediation having regard to those dwellings already remediated is some &euro;59,000, inclusive of the allowances provided under the scheme for alternative accommodation, furniture removal and storage and Building Condition Assessments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400064#WRJ04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Funding","counter":583,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400064#WRJ04300"},{"type":"question","counter":584,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[28174\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400064#WRJ04400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if funding can be released to allow site enabling works on the highlighted piece of land at Shangan, Ballymun, for affordable and senior citizens units.","asker":"1215","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":585,"content":"<p>The preparation of this site for development is, in the first instance, a matter for Dublin City Council and is outside of the Ballymun Regeneration Project.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances.  A yearly average of 48-52 weeks contributions is required to qualify for a 100% rate pension of &euro;233.30, and banded payments apply for those with lower yearly averages.  For example, where someone entered insurable employment aged 16 and had 2,000 weekly contributions (38.5 years) paid and\/or credited, they would have a yearly average of 40, and would receive a pension at 98% of the full rate (for those in the 40-47 band).  People who qualify for lower band rates may, if they satisfy the means-test, qualify for the State pension (non-contributory), the maximum rate of which is 95% that of the State pension (contributory).  Where their spouse is in receipt of a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult, which maybe paid at up to 90% of the rate of a full pension (by default, this payment is made directly to the Qualified Adult).<\/p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years after that date spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund.  For example, those with a yearly average of only 20 contributions (38% of the maximum) may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate.  The Review also examined the changes in the contribution rules and the associated rates of payment which were to be introduced in September 2012.  The Review found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories still obtain the best value from their contributions.<\/p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances.  A yearly average of 48-52 weeks contributions is required to qualify for a 100% rate pension of &euro;233.30, and banded payments apply for those with lower yearly averages.  For example, where someone entered insurable employment aged 16 and had 2,000 weekly contributions (38.5 years) paid and\/or credited, they would have a yearly average of 40, and would receive a pension at 98% of the full rate (for those in the 40-47 band).  People who qualify for lower band rates may, if they satisfy the means-test, qualify for the State pension (non-contributory), the maximum rate of which is 95% that of the State pension (contributory).  Where their spouse is in receipt of a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult, which may be paid at up to 90% of the rate of a full pension (by default, this payment is made directly to the Qualified Adult).<\/p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years after that date spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension. <\/p>  <p>  When the home-makers scheme was introduced, it had no retrospective effect, i.e., it only applied to such periods following the introduction of the scheme.  Had it been introduced for other periods, aside from administrative challenges in verifying such periods which pre-date computerised records, it would have carried a very significant cost, which would have been met by existing contributors through increases in contribution rates, by existing pensioners by reduced payment rates, and\/or by the Exchequer, funded by higher taxes or lower spending elsewhere.  This cost would be significantly greater now because the numbers of pensioners is much greater and the pension payment rate has increased.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund. For example, those with a yearly average of only 20 contributions (38% of the maximum) may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate.  The Review also examined the changes in the contribution rules and the associated rates of payment which were to be introduced in September 2012.  The Review found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories still obtain the best value from their contributions.<\/p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.

It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from around 2020.

Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.976 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was estimated to provide annual savings of &euro;48 million. These savings meant that my Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.  My Department will spend approximately &euro;228 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 420,000 customers.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew, arising from the increased number of pension recipients. In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of the Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has responsibility for the Seniors Alert Scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes.  The grant assistance is made available through community and voluntary groups registered with that Department and the equipment supplied under the scheme remains the property of the community group.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years was given.  This has increased the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  I believe that, taken together with other changes, such as increasing the Christmas Bonus to 75% of weekly rate, the impact of the last Budget has been very positive for older people.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to restore the telephone allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400067#WRM05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments Administration","counter":806,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400067#WRM05800"},{"type":"question","counter":807,"qnumday":302,"qnumall":"[28615\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400067#WRM05900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"his views on matters concerning post offices (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":808,"content":"<p>Implementation of the recommendations of the Kerr Report, including the introduction of a basic payment account, is the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.

Under the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, this Department must have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and treatment of our staff and customers, and protect the human rights of staff and customers.  An initial assessment of the human rights and equality issues arising from the Department&rsquo;s role as a policy maker, service provider and employer has begun in tandem with the drafting of the Goals, Outcomes and Outputs which make up the Statement of Strategy.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has also offered its assistance to our Department to identify the best possible approach to this public duty and officials from my Department intend to draw on their expertise.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Government has a consistent record in relation to the promotion of human rights and equality globally.  My Department chairs the Inter-Departmental Committee on Human Rights and actively engages with civil society domestically and abroad.  Human rights and equality issues are mainstreamed into the development of all our external policies.  In addition, the Department is also conscious of the need to reflect the obligations of the Act into our internal policies and procedures as they are developed.  In recent years, the Department has taken a number of steps in relation to gender equality.  These include the establishment of a Management Board Sub-Committee on Gender and Diversity, as well as the development of a Gender Equality Action Plan.  Two working groups &ndash; one on gender equality and one on diversity and equality &ndash; have been set up to take work forward in this area. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment relating to equality and gender proofing in the Departmental and Budgetary process.

I fully support such efforts and am committed to ensuring that the staff of my Department are equipped with the skills necessary to enable them to fulfill this commitment.

The Government is continuing to use every possible opportunity to underline our concerns about this case to the Egyptian Government, and also with the EU.  <\/p>  <p>  I met with Foreign Minister Shoukry last week in New York where I highlighted my concerns at the repeated delays in the court proceedings and reinforced the Government&rsquo;s support for the recent Decree 140 application made by this citizen&rsquo;s lawyers.  Both I and An Taoiseach have communicated our support for this application in writing to Minister Shoukry and President el-Sisi respectively.<\/p>  <p>  As has been previously reported to the House, An Taoiseach has been in direct contact on a number of occasions with President el-Sisi of Egypt about this case, underlining the Government&rsquo;s concerns about the continuing detention of this young man, who has been in prison for over three years now without having been convicted of any crime, and who is part of a group trial that has been adjourned on fourteen occasions.  <\/p>  <p>  At the last hearing (29 June), the trial was adjourned until early October following an application by defendants for an expert review of the audio-visual evidence in this case.  It was originally anticipated that a technical hearing connected to the audio-visual evidence review would take place on 2 October.  However the hearing did not proceed as the 2nd of October was designated in recent days as the opening day of the Hijra (Islamic New Year) Feast, and a public holiday.<\/p>  <p>  The Court Office has indicted that the next hearing date is likely to be 12 November and we are awaiting confirmation of this date through official channels.  On Sunday last, 2 October, I spoke directly to Egypt&rsquo;s Ambassador to Ireland, Soha Gendi expressing my concern about further delays and underlined the Government's strong desire to see this citizen returned to Ireland as a matter of urgency.  My officials are continuing to work closely with this citizen&rsquo;s family and with his lawyers in Dublin and Cairo.  <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and I stand ready to further engage with the Egyptian Government as and when appropriate, in line with our key focus of securing this citizen&rsquo;s best interests; this means continuing our determined efforts to see him released by the Egyptian authorities at the earliest possible opportunity and, in the meantime, providing consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention. <\/p>  <p>  All of the sustained and focused actions that have been taken by my Department throughout this case have been aimed at furthering these two objectives, and importantly, avoiding any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to this citizen&rsquo;s best interests.<\/p>  <p>  Significant resources in Cairo and in Dublin continue to be deployed in the provision of consular assistance in this case and my officials are in close contact with both the citizen&rsquo;s family and their legal representatives.  <\/p>  <p>  To date, the Egyptian authorities have been cooperative in allowing regular access by Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Egypt to this citizen for the purpose of conducting consular visits.  While the Ambassador travelled to the prison last week, on that occasion the citizen declined the opportunity of a visit.  We are aware of the reports of this citizen&rsquo;s medical condition and any such concerns on his behalf have been promptly raised by the Embassy with the relevant authorities, most recently on Thursday, 29 September.  The occasion of prison visits provide an important opportunity for the Embassy to discuss with the citizen any issues relating to his health and well-being and to raise any concerns directly with the prison authorities.  I therefore regret that this citizen declined the visit last week.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400068#WRN03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":867,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400068#WRN03450"},{"type":"question","counter":868,"qnumday":324,"qnumall":"[28562\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400068#WRN03500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that his Department is paying &euro;46,000 a month to rent an apartment in Tokyo for the Irish ambassador to Japan; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that the ambassador's residence is reportedly more than twice as expensive as any other property rented by his Department in 2015; the reason this is happening; and his plans to rectify this situation.","asker":"1309","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":869,"content":"<p>It is important to note that such official properties are not solely or primarily the living quarters of Ireland&rsquo;s Heads of Mission abroad.

These official spaces are used extensively to promote our exports and tourism, to attract inward investment, to promote our culture and heritage, to reach out to our diaspora communities, and to build relationships with key contacts and influencers in the countries where we have diplomatic representation.<\/p>  <p>  This is very much the case in Tokyo, where nearly half of the rented space is actually for representational purposes.  The State Agencies, in partnership with the Embassy, use this space to showcase Ireland as a centre of excellence in areas such as research and development, fin-tech, ICT, agri-food, tourism and culture. So far in 2016, the Embassy has hosted 32 events and welcomed some 1,214 guests there. <\/p>  <p>  The criteria for selecting official diplomatic accommodation is that it should be centrally located in safe and secure areas, it should have appropriate floor space for representational functions, as well as living quarters for the Head of Mission and his\/her family, that the rent should be in line with local market rates and that it should be available for extensive use by the embassy and the State agencies for official events. <\/p>  <p>  Once a location has been identified, it is reviewed by the relevant HQ unit in Dublin against these criteria, with cost, location and suitability being the key factors in deciding whether or not to grant approval to proceed with the lease.<\/p>  <p>  Rental prices are based on floor space.  The space in Tokyo consists of 720.45 square metres, 302.22 sq. metres of which are used for representational space and the remainder for private accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  The lease contract for this property was agreed and signed on 28 November 2001.  The lease commenced on 17 July 2002, and will expire on 31 March 2017.  The original lease contract contained an automatic upward rent structure, but that was discontinued in November 2009 following negotiation with the landlord.  The last rent review was completed in September 2015.

Of these, 900 are estimated to be unaccompanied minors.  On a visit to Calais on 26th September, President Hollande announced the definitive closure of the Camp and the redistribution of its inhabitants to centres throughout France.  The President described the planned closure as a &ldquo;full and final&rdquo; dismantlement which will be completed by the end of this year. <\/p>  <p>  The French Government is to provide for 9,000 places in the centres throughout the country. Migrants will be offered the chance to apply for asylum in France, and those who do not qualify will be sent home.  For unaccompanied minors, there will be specific accommodation arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  President Hollande said that the objectives of these actions are to &ldquo;guarantee the security of the people of Calais, to maintain public order and to ensure for the migrants and refugees that conditions are dignified&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that persons who are currently in another EU Member State - including those in the camps in Calais - and who are in need of international protection, are entitled to make an application for asylum in that country, should they wish to do so. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the humanitarian crisis that developed in Southern Europe as a consequence of mass migration from areas of conflict in the Middle East and Africa.  In announcing the IRPP, the Government recognised the importance of prioritising family groups and in addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  A significant number of those who have arrived to date are children with one or two parents.

Therefore, the process to develop a new Statement of Strategy is well underway in my\u00a0Department.\u00a0 This work will, of course, be informed by the priorities set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government (PfPG) and the overall economic, budgetary and fiscal context.

In this regard, in order to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of the impact of budget expenditure measures on household living standards, my Department is developing a new Social Impact Assessment Framework designed to focus on policy areas that cannot easily be incorporated into the existing SWITCH model, specifically the impacts of public expenditure on recipient households. \u00a0Depending on the available data, the impacts of expenditure in certain policy areas may also be examined with regard to certain group characteristics e.g. age, gender, regional spread.

These include recommendations in relation to the renewal of the post office network, the development of a basic payment account, the provision of motor tax services, and the creation of hubs around which local economic and social activity could revolve.  The report also recommended that An Post should, following appropriate consultation with postmasters and others, review and amend the five-year strategy for the post office network.<\/p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government<\/i>commits to acting on the recommendations in the report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group.

The First Responder then goes straight to the scene and administers initial care (defibrillation if required) until the National Ambulance Service Emergency resources arrive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400069#WRO05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1339"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":955,"content":"<p>Question No. 353 answered with Question No. 350.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Investigations","counter":956,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400069#WRO05550"},{"type":"question","counter":957,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[28057\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400069#WRO05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will publish the serious incident management report following an investigation undertaken at Wexford General Hospital into misdiagnosed bowel cancer cases relating to patients who underwent colonoscopy procedures there; the reason the report has not been published despite the look-back review having been completed several months ago; when the report will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The review was undertaken by Dr Niall Herity, a highly respected, Belfast based NHS cardiologist.  It is a comprehensive report which reflects the fact that Dr Herity consulted widely and met with all of the key stakeholders including the management and staff of both UHW and Cork University Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Dr Herity has made clear recommendations that a second cardiac cath lab at UHW is not justified and I accept this.  However, he also recommends investing in UHW to enhance the existing cardiology services including increasing the number of weekly sessions currently provided, in order to address waiting times and to provide improved access for patients.  He also recommends that new specialist equipment be provided to improve contingency for radiological equipment failure during a procedure.  I am happy to provide the additional resources necessary to implement these recommendations.  This investment will be reflected in the HSE National Service Plan for 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Dr Herity also recommends that some services be provided elsewhere.  However, in order to do this a number of operational processes will have to first be embedded.  I want to be certain that any change to how a service is delivered will result in improved services for the patients using that service.  Therefore, I have asked my Department to address the implications of ceasing primary PCI services at UHW by undertaking a national review of all primary PCI services with the aim to ensure that as many patients as possible have access to a 24\/7 basis to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack.  I expect the review to be completed by the end of July 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The Report on the Establishment of Hospital Groups notes that UHW should continue to provide invasive cardiology services for the population of the South East in collaboration with the cardiology service in Cork.  The patient flow analysis detailed in Dr Herity's report provides evidence that the Cath Lab in UHW is currently providing services to the population of the South East and, in particular, to residents of counties Wexford, Waterford and South Tipperary. Implementation of Dr Herity's report will provide improved cardiology services for the South East and will strengthen links between clinicians in UHW and Cork University Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  I intend to visit UHW next month and I will take the opportunity to speak with staff and management on a broad range of issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400070#WRP04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":1019,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400070#WRP04650"},{"type":"question","counter":1020,"qnumday":374,"qnumall":"[28113\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400070#WRP04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"to outline the reason a medical card was refused in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1021,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  <\/p><p>Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held.  In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the three year cap.<\/p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of residential care which are:<\/p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;<\/p><p>- Bed and board;<\/p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living;<\/p><p>- Laundry service.<\/p><p>The Scheme has a number of important safeguards built into the financial assessment which ensures that:<\/p><p>- Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care;<\/p><p>- An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his\/her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater.  This is in recognition of the fact that, although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing;<\/p><p>- If an applicant has a spouse\/partner remaining at home, he\/she will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;<\/p><p>- If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;<\/p><p>- Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account for the financial assessment, including health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence;<\/p><p>- A person&rsquo;s eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drug Payment Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or residence in a nursing home.<\/p><p>In addition to these safeguards, where an applicant&rsquo;s assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate.  This is known as the  Nursing Home Loan (Ancillary State Support), the purpose of which is to ensure that a person does not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care.  A nursing home resident can apply for this deferral at any stage.<\/p><p>A person&rsquo;s financial assessment can be reviewed, at their request, if 12 months have passed since the initial financial assessment or the most recent review, or if the HSE is satisfied that there has been a material change to the person&rsquo;s financial circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400071#WRQ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":1059,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400071#WRQ02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1060,"qnumday":387,"qnumall":"[28198\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400071#WRQ02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the provision of a special chair for a person (details supplied);

The HSE is focused on offering graduating nurses and midwives permanent posts and on replacing agency staff with permanent staff.<\/p>  <p>  Recruitment of additional nurses is the subject of considerable ongoing activity by the HSE and voluntary hospitals with campaigns in train in Ireland and abroad with a relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 available to nurses who return from overseas.  The campaigns encompass General, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability and Registered Children's Nurses, and also Midwives.<\/p>  <p>  Within the Mental Health Sector, where there are particular difficulties at present, a number of measures have been introduced to increase nurse staffing levels in the short and long term.  In the short term this Department issued a Circular to the HSE National Director of HR to allow a derogation from public pay policy for mental health nurse retirees to return to work for the HSE beyond the first point of the mental health nurse salary scale typically at the LSI point.  In addition to this it was agreed that from 1st September 50% of the Community Allowance will be restored and the remaining 50% will be paid from 1st January 2017 (and backdated to 1st September 2016) for nurses who take up positions in the community.  To address the long term staffing levels there has been an increase of 60 additional mental health student nurses for 2016 and an additional 70 places have been agreed for 2017.  Efforts will continue to address the recruitment and retention issues within the Mental Health Sector.<\/p>  <p>  All of the measures mentioned above will facilitate the recruitment and retention of nursing staff at all grades and disciplines within the Irish health service.  My Department is in regular contact with the HSE on matters concerning the recruitment of nurses and midwives and other key staff.<\/p>  <p>  The Organisation Of Working Time Act 1997 provides a level of protection to employees on health and safety grounds, states that  the maximum average working week should not exceed 48 hours and specifies public holiday entitlements.  The HSE terms and conditions of employment for staff in the health services who work public holidays meet and in some instances exceed those set out in the Act.  Historically the average working week of junior hospital doctors would have been significantly more than 48 hours.  Following intensive efforts by management over the past three years, in conjunction with the IMO, the working week of 80% of doctors is now in accordance with the Act and the related EU Directive.  This in the interests of the doctors and patients and the aim is to progress to 100% compliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400074#WRT01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages Expenditure","counter":1216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400074#WRT01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1217,"qnumday":455,"qnumall":"[28517\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400074#WRT01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the funding made available for home help and home care packages for the CHO area 2 comprising Galway, Mayo and Roscommon in each of the past five years;

This report dealt with dealing with governance, finance, regulation and welfare.  This action plan is published on the BnG website. <\/p><p>I am committed to implementing the Indecon recommendations\u00a0and my Department has established processes to monitor BnG's progress in this regard. <\/p><p>I will shortly be bringing forward the heads of a Greyhound Amendment Bill to deal with issues relating to governance, regulation and enforcement.  In the meantime a number of significant steps have already been taken. <\/p><p>Appointments to the board have been made through the Public Appointments Service process, and individuals with skill sets specifically identified by Indecon have been appointed.  Bord na gCon is working to improve its financial position and reduce its borrowings over time through a combination of actions, including\u00a0the disposal of assets, the calibration of race meetings at poorly performing stadia, the reconfiguration of its hospitality services and the development of new products.<\/p><p>With regard to regulation,\u00a0I am advised by Bord na gCon that it\u00a0has carried out an extensive review of procedures for regulatory control.  I understand that many new operating procedures\u00a0have been\u00a0finalised or are close to finalisation.  New secondary legislation is now in place requiring the publication of adverse analytical findings from greyhounds tested for prohibited substances after 1st October 2015.  Greyhounds testing positive for these substances will be\u00a0banned from racing until a further negative test result is obtained.  The findings of cases initiated after that date which come before the Control Committee and the Control Appeals Committee will be published, as will the reasons for the decision.  In addition,\u00a0a Scientific Committee on Doping and Medication Control was\u00a0established to advise on these matters.  I understand its report was published in July of this year and is available on the BnG website. <\/p><p>The power to take samples at the licensed premises of industry participants is being augmented and an intelligence led testing regime is being developed and rolled out.  Furthermore, BnG is developing a collaborative strategy with other agencies, in so far as legislation permits, to ensure intelligence led mechanisms are in place with other agencies to make the best use of scarce resources in this area of risk for the industry.<\/p><p>BnG has commenced the process of strengthening the sanctions for animal cruelty and has launched its first prosecution under the legislation for failure to comply with a welfare notice.  An on-line resource centre has\u00a0been launched for <i>inter alia<\/i>the future publication of welfare information and notices as appropriate.  A process has been commenced whereby BnG regulations will require that records are kept of all medication administered to greyhounds.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>On the question of financial targets, it\u00a0is the case that the BNG operating environment is difficult.  Information relating to key performance indicators such as tote receipts, attendance figures, prize money etc, is contained in BnG's annual accounts which are published.  In addition, the Indecon Report made a number of recommendations intended to improve the financial situation of BNG and its implementation is being carefully monitored by my department. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400075#WRU02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":1308,"qnumday":489,"qnumall":"[28073\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400075#WRU02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1309,"content":"<p>Bord na gCon is the statutory body responsible for the regulation and development of greyhound racing under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies\u00a0and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.<\/p><p>The procurement process aims to identify an entity or entities to build, rollout, operate and deliver high speed broadband of at least 30 Mbps upload and 6 Mbps download speeds to all premises within the intervention area.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area:<\/p><p>-  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered.<\/p><p>-  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process. <\/p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Louth.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map\u00a0should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to\u00a0broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.  The business referred to by the Deputy in the Question\u00a0is within the Intervention (AMBER) area.  This means that it is not within an area receiving services from commercial broadband providers but will be included in the State Intervention network rollout.<\/p><p>Over 750,000 premises\u00a0are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015.  This includes over 15,000 premises in Louth. On 5 July, I announced that my Department has also identified that up to an additional 170,000 premises which are currently marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map are unlikely to get access to services.  My Department is conducting further analysis to identify these additional premises with a view to including them in the formal procurement process.  This work will conclude in the coming months and will be reflected in a further update to the High Speed Broadband Map. <\/p><p>The Department commenced the Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase of the procurement process in July and is\u00a0engaged in the formal dialogue process with the three qualifying bidders.  Following the conclusion of the Dialogue Phase and an\u00a0invitation to bidders to submit\u00a0detailed draft proposals, the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders.  When final tenders have been submitted a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy. <\/p><p>The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of qualified bidders and the complexities that may be encountered during the procurement process.  It must be noted that bidders will need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.<\/p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and \/ or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country. <\/p><p>In line with commitments in the Programme for Government I\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague\u00a0Minister Humphreys in July 2016. The Taskforce\u00a0will recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland, working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The work of the taskforce will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the rollout of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place. I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the taskforce report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400078#WRX03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Media Mergers","counter":1517,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400078#WRX03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1518,"qnumday":560,"qnumall":"[28078\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400078#WRX03800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will review the sale of a company (details supplied); his views on the sale; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1519,"content":"<p>While I am aware\u00a0of the proposed purchase of Celtic Media, including the Anglo Celt newspaper, by Independent News &amp;amp; Media (INM), this matter is currently being considered by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)\u00a0and,\u00a0until the CCPC has made its determination in this case, I have no role in relation to the proposed transaction.<\/p><p>Should the proposed purchase receive clearance from the CCPC, it must then be notified to me as Minister.<\/p><p>Upon receipt of notification from the parties a phase 1 examination of the merger is carried out by my Department.

However, it is important to note that the electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive and that they operate within national and European regulatory regimes. <\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for electricity and gas market regulation is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) which is an independent statutory body.  The CER is focussed on actions to mitigate costs for business and residential consumers, such as rigorous scrutiny of network costs, deeper integration with European energy markets and the delivery of a truly competitive market in the interest of customers.  The CER continues to monitor the electricity and gas markets to ensure that competition continues to develop and that customers benefit from competition.<\/p>  <p>  A number of measures have been taken in recent years to assist consumers deal with\u00a0energy costs.  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) procured Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) Meters to help those in difficulty with energy bills to better manage their usage and reduce the risk of disconnection.  The network companies undertook the rollout of over 100,000 of these meters.  The rollout of PAYG meters has contributed to a fall in the number of disconnections and limited the accumulation of dangerous levels of arrears.  The Department\u00a0continues to work with the CER and the energy industry to ensure that there are no impediments to their continued availability to customers who are at risk of energy poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The energy industry, specifically Bord G&aacute;is Energy, Electric Ireland, Energia, Flogas Natural Gas and SSE Airtricity adopted a voluntary code of practice, the 'Energy Engage Code',\u00a0that saw them commit to never disconnect an engaging customer, to avoid disconnections in the winter period, and to work with their customers on realistic and achievable payment plans for any arrears.<\/p>  <p>  The Code supplements existing obligations on suppliers as set out in the CERs Electricity and Natural Gas Supplier Handbook. The impact of the Code on the level of disconnections is be continuously monitored by the CER.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy gave details about a reconnection charge.  The levying of these charges is an operational matter for ESB Networks, which\u00a0operates the distribution network on the electricity grid.  This is the medium and low voltage electricity network used to deliver electricity to connection points such as houses, offices, shops, business premises, and street lights.  Tariffs and charges levied by ESB Networks are also regulated by the CER.  In order to ensure that only equitable levels of costs are collected through these tariffs, the CER carries out annual reviews of ESB Networks&rsquo; costs incurred in developing, maintaining and operating the distribution system.<\/p>  <p>  Further information on the levying of charges on electricity customers and complaints in relation to connection the electricity\u00a0network should be addressed to the CER who may be contacted at 01 4000800, 1890 404 404, energycustomers@cer.ie or Commission for Energy Regulation, The Exchange, Belgard Square North, Tallaght, Dublin 24.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400078#WRX07000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Generation","counter":1552,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400079#WRY00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1553,"qnumday":572,"qnumall":"[28662\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400079#WRY00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the steps being taken by his Department to ensure that small micro generation projects such as the gas extraction at Kyletalesha landfill at Portlaoise are connected to the national grid.","asker":"1232","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1554,"content":"<p>The commitments in the Energy White Paper, published in December 2015, include facilitating access to the national grid for designated renewable electricity projects.

Under the GPA, system operators issue connection offers to these generators in batches, called &quot;gates&quot;.  The last iteration was Gate 3.<\/p><p>The non-GPA is the process to connect small, renewable and low carbon generators that fulfil public\u00a0interest criteria.  The CER has decided \u00a0(CER\/09\/099 &ndash; available on www.cer.ie) that the following list of technology or classes of technology exhibit public interest benefits and are, therefore, preapproved for processing outside of the GPA: Bioenergy, Combined Heat and Power, \u00a0Autoproducers, Hydro, Ocean, Wave, Solar, Geothermal and\u00a0Experimental\/Emerging Technology.<\/p><p>It is my understanding that electricity generators (including micro-generation) eligible to be processed outside of the GPA will receive a non-GPA connection\u00a0offer\u00a0provided that\u00a0all technical requirements for connecting to the grid are fulfilled by the applicant.

This is a whole of Government effort and is delivered through our integrated Action Plan for Jobs.  The Action Plan for Jobs process aims to strengthen the enterprise base, in particular through supporting entrepreneurship, start-ups and small and medium sized enterprises. <\/p>  <p>  The terms &lsquo;entrepreneur&rsquo; and 'entrepreneurship' can encompass a wide array of activities and individuals.  The National Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship identified entrepreneurship with establishing a new firm or venture.  Richard Cantillon, an Irish economist of French descent in the early 18th Century is credited with introducing the term 'entrepreneur' as what most people understand as meaning someone who organizes land, labour or capital to produce or supply goods and services and assumes the risk of a business in return for the profits.  This definition emphasises the role of the entrepreneur in taking on risk. <\/p>  <p>  In turn, entrepreneurs can be either &lsquo;replicating entrepreneurs&rsquo;, who establish and organise a business firm to mimic the function and processes of firms already in existence, or &lsquo;innovating entrepreneurs&rsquo;, who introduce a change or innovation, whether through the invention of a new good or service, introduction of a new method of production, creation of a new market, discovery of a new source of supply, or re-organization of an industry in such a manner as to improve efficiency. <\/p>  <p>  The definition of the entrepreneur as an individual establishing a new firm or enterprise captures the role of the entrepreneur in establishing a new business.  The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) collects cross-country data on individuals establishing new ventures.  The Central Statistics Office (CSO), as part of their Structural Business Statistics, collects data on the legal form of new enterprises, which determines whether a new enterprise is liable for income tax (as an individual proprietor) or to corporation tax (as an incorporated firm). <\/p>  <p>  Self-employment and SME owners are often used as proxies for entrepreneurship, and have the merit of inclusivity and capturing the risk-taking element of entrepreneurship.  These are also measurable through surveys carried out by the CSO.  In addition, income from self-employment is often subject to different deductions for tax purposes and provision is available for capital allowances in recognition that income from self-employment derives from a trade or profession, while social insurance systems treat self-employed persons differently in terms of contributions and benefits. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance frame legislation in relation to all tax matters.  There are a range of tax expenditures provided to entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises through the tax system.  Specifically, for the purpose of availing of the revised CGT Entrepreneur Relief introduced in Budget 2016 and given effect in Finance Act 2015, and which offers a 20% rate of CGT (rather than the standard 33% rate) on qualifying assets disposed of by a qualifying individual, up to a lifetime limit of &euro;1 million in qualifying gains, the following conditions apply:<\/p>  <p>  -  A qualifying individual is someone who holds 5% or more of the shares in the company (or is a sole trader or owns the company outright) and has worked as a director or employee of the company for three out of the previous five years<\/p>  <p>  -  Qualifying assets are shares in or assets of any company other than those involved in certain excluded activities, including dealing in shares, securities, commodities, land or property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400080#WRZ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement","counter":1637,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400080#WRZ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1638,"qnumday":602,"qnumall":"[28349\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400080#WRZ01600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will provide an assurance that the Government, by signing up to provisional application of CETA, will not open Ireland to ISDS procedures or rulings; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

CETA represents a modern high standard agreement which has the ability to set a new global standard for Trade Agreements.  It will end limitations in access to public contracts, open up markets for services and offer predictable conditions for investors.  I support and welcome CETA and I am looking forward to Irish firms enjoying the benefits and new opportunities as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  CETA will save on duty costs as 99.6% of all industrial tariffs will be eliminated on entry into force.  Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, thus saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.  These are some of the benefits of the trade deal with Canada as well as providing new market opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms.<\/p>  <p>  Given the position taken by Ireland and other Member States, the EU Commission has submitted CETA to the Council for decision as a mixed agreement, that is, one requiring both EU and individual Member States ratification.  Following a decision by the Council with the consent of the European Parliament, it will now be possible to provisionally apply CETA.  The EU Commission is currently finalising the text on provisional application of CETA for submission to the Council for a decision on the 18th October 2016.  As provisional application will cover only those areas for which the EU has full competence, no constitutional issues arise.  It is proposed that provisional application will not apply to investment protection and investment dispute settlement.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with Article 218(8) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the full entering into force of CETA will be subject, in the first instance, to a decision by the EU, through a Council decision with the consent of the Parliament, and secondly by the approval of all Member States through the relevant national ratification procedures.

Information is not available in relation to the numbers of public sector pensioners re-employed in the public sector prior to 1 November 2012.  Prior 1 November 2012, holders of public sector pensions who were subsequently re-employed in the public sector were not required to inform their previous or new employer of any employment, public sector or otherwise, obtained by them subsequent to leaving the public sector.  Such obligations were introduced by the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) Act 2012. <\/p><p>The Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) Act 2012 provides that any person who takes up employment in a public service body on or after 1 November 2012 and<\/p><p>-  has an existing entitlement to retirement (including preserved) benefits under any public service pension scheme,<\/p><p>-  has received, or is in receipt of, retirement benefits under any public service pension scheme, or<\/p><p>-  applies for a benefit from a public service pension scheme,<\/p><p>is obliged to declare such matters to the public service employer with whom they are taking up further employment.  This applies regardless of whether the pension holder is being re-employed on a full-time, part-time, seasonal or other basis.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In tandem with that measure, section 52 of the 2012 Act provides that where a retired public servant who is in receipt of a public service pension resumes employment in the public service on or after 1 November 2012 their pension is liable to abatement, that is, cessation or reduction as appropriate.  Abatement basically means that the combined amount of his\/her earnings from their current public service job plus their existing public service pension, cannot exceed the up-rated (current) pensionable pay from their old job.  Essentially this means that from 1 November 2012, a public servant retiring on pension who at some later point re-enters any public service employment must make a declaration and will be subject to abatement and may, depending on his\/her overall earnings, have their public service pension reduced or suspended for as long as they are in that new job.<\/p><p>Prior to 1 November 2012, this abatement principle operated as a standard feature of public service pension schemes generally, but only within individual sectors\/bodies where a public service pensioner resumed working in his or her former occupation, e.g. Defence Forces, Garda, Civil Service etc.  The 2012 Act extends the abatement principle across and between all sectors without exception.  The extended pension abatement measure applies only where a public service pensioner takes up another public service post\/position on or after 1 November 2012.A public service pensioner already in public service employment<b><\/b>immediately before that date will not be affected by the change while he or she remains in that post\/position.  The change does not apply in relation to employment with the commercial semi-State bodies. <\/p><p>Since the enactment of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) Act 2012, eleven individuals who are in receipt of a public sector pension have been employed as civilian employees attached to military installations and my Department has engaged two retired public servants as civilian drivers to the Minister of State, Mr. Paul Kehoe T.D.  These appointments are to temporary unestablished positions in the Civil Service on a fixed term contract basis.  A retired public servant was also appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Government to the Office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>There are currently thirty two former members of the Defence Forces in receipt of military pensions where my Department has been notified that they were re-employed in the public service and whose pensions are subject to abatement under Section 52 of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) Act 2012.It should be noted that nine of these are re-employed within the Defence area and are included in the preceding paragraph.  The other twenty three may be included in replies given by the relevant Minister with responsibility for the public service body where they have been re-employed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400080#WRZ04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"question","counter":1682,"qnumday":618,"qnumall":"[28989\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400080#WRZ04600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of staff employed by his Department or seconded to his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1232","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":1683,"content":"<p>The number of staff employed by my Department at 30 September 2016 is 357 and the number seconded to my Department on the same date is 5.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016100400080#WRZ04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"}]
