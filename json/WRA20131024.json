","asker":"993","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>Government climate change policy has been developed in line with the ambitious EU climate and energy targets set for 2020.  These targets set three key objectives for 2020: a 20% reduction in EU greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels; raising the share of EU energy consumption produced from renewable resources to 20%; and a 20% improvement in the EU's energy efficiency.  The Government is also cognisant of the need for a carefully planned 2030 energy and climate framework.  This will be critical in the context of establishing a structured, and cost-effective, transition to a secure and competitive, low-carbon European economy and energy system by 2050. <\/p><p>  While responsibility for climate change policy is primarily a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, my Department, which has responsibility for energy policy, has a critical role to play in delivering effective interventions required to achieve climate policy objectives.  Ireland is currently heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs.  While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our energy requirements and improving energy efficiency.  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power from renewable sources, with the transport target also being legally binding.  In 2012 19.5% of our electricity demand was met by renewable generation. Provisional figures show that at the end of 2012, 5.1% of heat demand and 2.3% of the energy in the transport sector was met by renewables. <\/p><p>  Energy efficiency remains one of the most effective methods of lowering emissions, reducing energy bills and decreasing our dependence on imported fossil fuels.  In the second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to a 20% national energy savings target and outlined a range of ambitious, but realisable, actions to be taken.  While we are progressing towards meeting our current targets under the EU 2020 framework, it is critical that we also address the task of developing and implementing the new EU 2030 climate and energy framework.  The timely progression of this work, which is being led by the European Commission and is scheduled for discussion at the European Council in early 2014, will provide much needed policy and regulatory certainty.  This certainty will be key to releasing the investment necessary to deliver the energy infrastructure, without which, long term energy and climate objectives cannot be realised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400067#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":12,"content":"<p>Question No. 13 answered with Question No. 8.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postcode Implementation","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400067#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[45041\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400067#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the costs and perceived benefits associated with a postcodes system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Actuarial Valuation to 31 December 2008 showed an ongoing valuation deficit of &euro;1.9 billion and a Minimum Funding Standard deficit of &euro;1.8 billion. Consequently, the ESB and the ESB Group of Unions formed a working group to assess how best to address the reported deficit and to protect as far as feasible the interest of ESB and the current members of the Scheme.  ESB reached an agreement with staff in 2010 to resolve the pension deficit.  The measures adopted under that agreement have, I understand, had a positive effect, resulting in the Scheme Actuary recently reporting that the Scheme is now in balance on an on-going actuarial basis. <\/p><p>  Aside from the on-going actuarial position, the Pensions Board also requires the ESB Scheme to assess whether it could meet a certain prescribed standard, known as the Minimum Funding Standard (MFS).  This effectively tests whether the Scheme could meet all its current obligations if it were wound up immediately.  Neither the Government nor the ESB envisages the winding up of the Scheme but regardless, the Scheme is currently still required to meet the requirements of the MFS.  I understand that the Scheme Actuary reported at the end of 2011 that the ESB scheme, like many others, did not, at that time, satisfy the MFS requirements.  I understand that the Pensions Board does not require the MFS deficit to be addressed immediately but does require that a plan be developed to address it over a reasonable time.  I am informed that the Trustees of the ESB scheme, with the agreement of ESB, submitted a funding plan to the Pensions Board, which was approved in October 2012.  In light of the fact that the funding plan was submitted in 2011, the then existing rules relating to the Minimum Funding Standard applied.  The Pensions Board published revised MFS rules in June 2012 for addressing pension fund deficits.  I am advised that the ESB plan aims to eliminate the deficit by 2018 and that this plan remains on track.<\/p><p>  Regarding the manner in which ESB accounts for the Scheme in its financial statements, my Department has been advised by the ESB that, having taken expert legal and financial advice, the Company is satisfied that the current accounting treatment for the Scheme is correct and in accordance with applicable laws and international accounting standards.

","asker":"1020","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 45 and 46 together.<\/p><p>  The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers.  Ireland is currently heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs.  While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our energy requirements.<\/p><p>  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power from renewable sources, with the transport target also being legally binding.  The Directive also requires that Member States set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) their trajectories towards meeting these targets.  Ireland's NREAP, which can be downloaded from my Department's website, assumes Ireland's 16% target will be met incrementally at around 1% per annum.  Provisional figures for 2012 indicate that 6.9% of our overall energy requirements were met from renewable sources, made up of 19.5% in electricity, 5.1% in heat and 2.3% in transport.  A second progress report on the NREAP is due for completion by the end of this year.<\/p><p>  To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target.  In 2012, 15.5% of Ireland's electricity demand was met by wind generation.  At the end of quarter three this year, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was just over 2,100 MW.  It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target.  The primary support mechanisms for renewable electricity in Ireland are the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes.  In order to facilitate the rate of build of renewable generation capacity required to meet the 2020 target, a number of changes to the REFIT 1 and 2 schemes were introduced in 2013.  Full details of the revised terms and conditions of these schemes can be found on my Department's website.  Currently, 3,000 MW of renewable generation has taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme. <\/p><p>  Renewable heat deployment is underpinned by current policies such as REFIT3 which supports Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants, ensuring an increase not only in the amount of heat from renewable sources but also in the amount renewable electricity produced.  This builds on the increases in renewable heat which were achieved by the Greener Homes Scheme, the   Renewable Heat Deployment Programme (ReHeat) and the CHP Deployment Programme.  In the transport sector, the penetration of renewable energy will grow mainly with the increased use of sustainable biofuels but also from the deployment of electric vehicles.  My Department is also currently finalising a Bioenergy Strategy following intensive cross-Departmental and stakeholder engagement.  The strategy will set out the actions required to optimise the contribution that energy from biomass can make to the 2020 renewable energy targets.<\/p><p>  As we look beyond 2020 and towards the goal of a low carbon energy system, the need to expand the renewable generation portfolio is apparent.  This will include technologies still at the pre-commercial stage such as wave and tidal, and their development will be considered in the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan which will be published shortly by my Department.  In addition, analysis undertaken by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland of the case for support for solar power is currently under review.<\/p><p>  As regards planning guidelines for the wind energy sector, the development of all wind farms in Ireland is subject to planning legislation, which include requirements for public consultation.  In addition, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, is undertaking a review of the Wind Energy Guidelines which will address the key issues of noise (including separation distance) and shadow flicker. Draft guidelines will be published for public consultation by end-November 2013 with a view to finalising guidelines by mid&ndash;2014.  The revised guidelines will apply to all wind farm development in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Ireland's excellent renewable energy potential can also be developed for export.  Expert advice and evidence shows that Ireland has the capability to achieve its national targets for renewable electricity from onshore renewable generation alone, with capacity to spare. Work is progressing very well on signing an Inter-Governmental Agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom in early 2014 to facilitate trade in renewable energy.  This means that there is potential for projects of scale aimed at export markets.  Planning permission for such projects, which will be determined by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must await the putting in place of a clear national planning policy framework and I have asked my Department to prepare such a framework.  The policy framework will provide the opportunity to integrate relevant EU Directive requirements (including Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment), trans-boundary dimensions and stakeholder participation within the context of a national framework.<\/p><p>  The outcome will be a high level development framework taking its lead from the Inter-Governmental Agreement, EU Directive requirements and relevant national, regional and local planning policy considerations in conjunction with wider policies, objectives and requirements.  It will incorporate a vision and strategy coupled with technical parameters and a spatial element.  The development of the framework will be progressed by my Department over the 12 to 15 months and will provide confidence and certainty for all stakeholders through an open, fair, balanced and consultative process.  The initial phase of public consultation has now commenced and all interested parties and members of the public have been formally invited to make written submissions on the export project which will be taken into consideration in preparing the framework.  Details can be found on a new dedicated section on my Department's website, exclusive to the project, and which will be updated as the project progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400068#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":58,"content":"<p>Question No. 28 answered with Question No. 14.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Generation","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400068#WRB01850"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[45035\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400068#WRB01900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the steps he is taking to ensure that communities are fully engaged in the wind energy planning and development process in the context of the current national debate on wind energy; if the proposed national renewable energy export policy and framework which will guide An Bord Plean&aacute;la will also include the domestic market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1053","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[45032\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400068#WRB02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he is satisfied that the concerns expressed by communities regarding wind energy development have been properly addressed by wind energy companies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[45037\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400068#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he is satisfied that the concerns expressed by communities regarding wind energy development have been properly addressed by wind energy companies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1055","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 34, and 36 together.<\/p><p>  I am aware of the concerns expressed by certain communities regarding wind energy development for export and I have spoken publicly on this matter on a number of occasions.  Some of these concerns have been needlessly exacerbated by poor communications and misinformation and I have emphasised the need for developers to engage with local communities in an effective and timely manner.  The views of local communities must be at the heart of the transition to renewable energy. Industry can go a long way towards achieving public acceptance by addressing and mitigating human, environmental and landscape impacts and delivering the best possible engineering solutions.  It is also important that developers communicate fully and accurately the local as well as the national socioeconomic benefits flowing from investment projects.  A recent Government policy statement on the matter acknowledges the need for social acceptance and for project developers to examine appropriate means of building community gain considerations into project planning and budgeting.<\/p><p>  One of the key requirements for proposals of a significant scale for wind energy export will be the achievement of the necessary planning consents in Ireland.

This will be achieved by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  ComReg has put in place a new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and for service bundles, both of which are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by service providers.  ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, completed in 2012, is also enabling the rollout of advanced mobile broadband services.<\/p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years.  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  In devising any State intervention to deliver high speed services to areas of the country where such services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market, my Department will be adopting a technology neutral approach, as required under EU law.  This means specifying our requirements rather than specifying a particular technology.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.<\/p><p>  Implementation of the National Broadband Plan will be complemented by the National Digital Strategy which I launched in July last.

This paper highlighted that small and medium sized businesses make up over 99% of businesses in Ireland and account for almost 70% of people employed.   Despite Ireland's reputation as one of the world's most globalised economies, 64% of private sector workers are employed by indigenous non-exporting firms, with 56% working for indigenous, non-exporting small businesses.  These numbers highlight the importance of domestic demand for sustaining and generating employment in Ireland, and suggest that our recovery strategy needs to give some additional support to small businesses.<\/p><p>  To that end, the 10 Point Tax Reform Plan contains measures to assist small business in a number of ways by:<\/p><p>  - Helping their cash flow position;<\/p><p>  - Helping them access funding;<\/p><p>  - Reducing the costs associated with the administrative burden of tax compliance;<\/p><p>  - Boosting demand for their products in new markets; and<\/p><p>  - Incentivising them to create jobs.<\/p><p>  The measures are as follows:<\/p><p>  - Reforming the 3 Year Corporation Tax Relief for Start Up Companies to allow unused credits to be carried forward to help create jobs and improve cash flow<\/p><p>  - Amending the Close Company Surcharge by increasing the de minimis level to &euro;2,000 to reduce the administrative burden and assist cash flow<\/p><p>  - Increasing the amount of expenditure eligible for the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit on a full volume basis (without reference to the 2003 base year) to &euro;200,000 to encourage innovation and help cash flow<\/p><p>  - Increasing the VAT cash receipts basis accounting threshold from &euro;1m to &euro;1.25m to help cash flow<\/p><p>  - Extending the Foreign Earnings Deduction for work related travel to Algeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal &amp;amp; Tanzania to help boost demand for Irish goods and services abroad<\/p><p>  - Extending the Employment and Investment Incentive scheme to 2020 to help companies access funding<\/p><p>  - Extending the general rate and Young Trained Farmers rate of stock relief and amendments to the definition of registered partnerships for stock relief to give a targeted assistance to the farming sector<\/p><p>  - Introducing a Capital Gains Tax relief for Farmers for land restructuring to give a target assistance to the farming sector<\/p><p>  - Reviewing the 'carried interest' provision in the tax code to help small businesses to access funding<\/p><p>  - Announcing a joint Revenue and Department of Finance public consultation: 'Taxation of Micro Enterprises: Reduction in Compliance Costs' to identify ways to ease the administrative burden<\/p><p><b>Measures 1 to 9<\/b> above were implemented in Finance Act 2013 which was enacted in March 2013.

The exact filing date will depend on individual circumstances but in the main will arise in Q4 2014.<\/p><p>  To elaborate on some of the specific items in the plan, I would note that in relation to <b>Measure 4,<\/b> the annual turnover threshold for eligibility for the cash basis of accounting for VAT was increased from &euro;1 million to &euro;1.25 million in Budget 2013 with effect from 1 May 2013.  While there are no direct statistics available, it is expected that over 800 businesses will have benefitted from this Budget change.<\/p><p>  In relation to <b>Measure 5<\/b>, the Foreign Earnings Deduction was extended in Finance Act 2013 to include for work related travel to Algeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal &amp;amp; Tanzania to help boost demand for Irish goods and services abroad.  This relief is available to all qualifying persons travelling to these countries for work-related travel for the tax years 2013 and 2014.<\/p><p>  In respect of <b>Measure 6<\/b>, the EII was extended to 2020 to help companies access funding.  This is a state aid scheme and accordingly, the approval of the European Commission is required. An application was made to the European Commission in June to extend the EII until 2020.  Officials have been assured by the Commission that the necessary approval will be received shortly.<\/p><p>  In respect of <b>Measure 7,<\/b> extending the general rate and Young Trained Farmers rate of stock relief and amendments to the definition of registered partnerships for stock relief to give a targeted assistance to the farming sector.<\/p><p>  As regards <b>Measure 8<\/b>, Section 48 of Finance Act 2013 provides for relief from capital gains tax on disposals of farm land for farm restructuring, subject to a Commencement Order, which I made on 6 June 2013 (due to the need to obtain EU State Aid approval for the measure).  The relief applies to a sale, purchase or exchange of agricultural land in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 where Teagasc has certified that a sale and purchase or an exchange of agricultural land was made for farm restructuring purposes.  The initial sale or purchase, or the exchange, must occur in the relevant period and the subsequent sale or purchase must occur within 24 months of that sale or purchase.<\/p><p><b>Measure 9<\/b> relates to reviewing the 'carried interest' provision in the tax code to help small businesses to access funding. Following a review of the carried interest provisions in the tax code, Finance Act 2013 made a number of changes with the aim of making the provisions operate as intended.  Firstly, it extends the scope of the relief so that it is not limited to carried interest derived from investment in trading companies at the start-up phase only.  Secondly, it links the relief to the overall performance of the investment portfolio of the qualifying venture capital fund. Thirdly, it reduces the duration of the period for which the investment in the target companies must be held from 6 years to 3 years.  Lastly, it extends the relief that is currently available to companies and partnerships to individual venture fund managers.  These amendments are designed to assist companies engaging in innovation activities to access investment from venture capital funds. <\/p><p>  As yet, no information is available on the number of people who have availed of CGT farm restructuring relief and\/or availed of the revised carried interest provisions because they will be applied for via personal income tax returns for 2013 which will not be submitted until late in 2014.  It is not anticipated that these returns will include a provision for the separate capture of specific information in relation to these incentives.<\/p><p>  Finally, in respect of <b>Measure 10 - 'Taxation of Micro Enterprises: Reduction in Compliance Costs<\/b>', the public consultation closed in February 2013, and only a small number of submissions were received (7 in total).

However, the Commissioners advise that it is not possible to state at this point the precise amount of LPT which is expected to be collected for 2014 for each local authority, nor the expected revenue from properties valued at over &euro;1m.  There are a number of factors which could affect these figures including the continuation of the very strong level of voluntary compliance that was achieved in 2013, the impact next year of Revenue's national compliance programme to follow-up on those liable persons who have failed to meet their LPT obligations for 2013, and the level of deferrals of LPT staying constant.<\/p><p>  LPT Returns are still being filed and work is on-going to refine the LPT Register.

I said that tax relief on pension contributions would continue at the marginal rate of tax. In addition, I gave an undertaking that the 0.6% pension fund levy would not be renewed after 2014.   I considered that I was in a position to make these significant commitments on foot, among other things, of proposals in late 2012 from the pensions sector for changes to the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) regime, as an alternative to standard rating of pension tax relief, which it was claimed would yield savings and tax revenues in the region of &euro;400 million. Pending further analysis of this claim, I included a much lower figure of &euro;250 million in the Budget 2013 arithmetic. That analysis has since revealed significant downside risks to the achievement of even this lower level of yield or savings. The estimate of the yield from the changes to the SFT regime which I announced in last week&rsquo;s Budget is &euro;120 million. These changes differ in some respects from those proposed by the pensions sector and reflect, on legal advice, the requirement to protect pension rights at the date of change. In addition, valuation factors to place a value on Defined Benefit pensions for SFT purposes will vary with the age at which the pensions are drawn down thereby improving equity within the regime.<\/p><p>  I would not categorise my engagement with the pensions sector on this matter as a &ldquo;deal&rdquo;, in the manner suggested by the Deputy.

As the deficit further improves and we achieve the targets under the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) the primary surplus is forecast to increase to 2.6% of GDP by 2016.   General government debt is a measure of the total gross consolidated debt of the State and includes national debt, as well as the debt of central and local government bodies. For international comparisons, the standard metric is to express general government debt as a percentage of GDP. This ratio has increased substantially in recent years as a result of borrowing to fund a series of deficits and to provide support to the financial sector. In 2013, the ratio of general government debt to GDP is expected to peak at just over 124% before falling to under 115% in 2016. Adhering to the path of prudent budgetary management will allow the debt levels to decline while implementation of policies to encourage economic growth will further aid the reduction in the debt to GDP ratio.<\/p><p>  The EDP targets a general government deficit of 3% or less of GDP in 2015. Three years from when Ireland exits the excessive deficit procedure, the &ldquo;debt rule&rdquo; as described by the Stability and Growth Pact and implemented by section 4 of the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012, will fully apply.

Revenue has examined the return submitted and has confirmed to me that the person selected three different options, including direct debit, deduction at source from her Department of Social Protection payment and payment via a service provider.   Every person completing an LPT Return has the full range of payment options available to choose from and is entitled to select the method that best suits individual circumstances.  The person in question is no different in this regard.   I commend Revenue for the wide range of payment options that it has made available to assist people in meeting their LPT obligations. <\/p><p>  Revenue refutes the Deputy's allegation of incompetence and states it has made every effort to assist the person in question in meeting her obligations.  Revenue cannot be blamed for the incorrect completion of the payment option segment of the LPT Return.  As I stated to the Deputy in reply to Questions Nos. 51 and 61 of 10 October, the information supplied to Revenue by liable persons for deduction at source from a Department of Social Protection pension is electronically transferred between both computer systems and Revenue cannot validate the accuracy of the data provided in advance of the data transfer.<\/p><p>  Revenue has also informed me that the daughter of the person in question has been offered assistance on two separate occasions.  On foot of the first conversation Revenue confirmed and activated the person's preferred payment option of 'payment service provider' and considered the matter to be closed until the Deputy's Parliamentary Questions on 10 October.  On foot of those Questions, a member of the Revenue LPT team made direct contact with the person's daughter and explained the various payment options.  The official also outlined the eligibility criteria for deferral of LPT should the person wish to consider making such an application.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked how the person in question should apply for deferral of LPT.  I am informed that, from the information available to Revenue, it appears that the person qualifies for deferral based on her income.  Should she wish to avail of that option, she or her daughter on her behalf should contact the LPT Helpline at 1890 200 255 and the LPT team will provide every assistance.  The person can still pay her LPT on a phased basis between now and the end of the year should she choose to do so and again the LPT Branch will be glad to offer any advice in this regard.<\/p><p>  The deferred tax, including interest, will become a charge on the property until the tax is paid.  If the property is sold or transferred, any outstanding LPT charges would have to be paid at that point.  The interest will be charged on the deferred amounts from the due date of payment until such time as it is paid, at a daily rate of 0.011%, which equates to 4% per annum.

All of these activities, including livestock in general, are currently charged to VAT in Ireland at the super-reduced rate of 4.8% under Article 110 of the EU VAT Directive.  On 14 March 2013 the Court found against Ireland, in that some of the conditions of Article 110 were not fulfilled in applying the 4.8% rate to the supply mentioned. The application of the 4.8% rate to the supply of livestock in general, however, was not in dispute.   Ireland must comply with the ECJ Judgement, and Finance (No. 2) Bill 2013, which is published today, includes measures in this regard. However, while the Finance Bill changes comply with the Court decision, the measures introduced are also mindful of the possible impact of VAT increases on the sectors concerned.<\/p><p>  Firstly, the VAT rate applying to (a) the supply of live horses, other than those intended for use as foodstuffs or for use in agricultural production, (b) the supply of greyhounds, and (c) the hire of horses, will be increased from 4.8% to 9%.  However, the 4.8% rate will continue to apply to livestock in general, and to horses that are intended for use as foodstuffs or for use in agricultural production.  <\/p><p>  In addition, the VAT rate on &lsquo;no foal, no fee&rsquo; insemination services will be increased from 4.8% to the 13.5% reduced rate, so that the same 13.5% rate applies to all insemination services, for all animals, including livestock, horses and greyhounds. The 13.5% rate also applies to the supply of livestock and horse semen. <\/p><p>  I would point out that the application of the 9% and the 13.5% rates, respectively, are the minimum VAT rates allowable to these supplies under EU VAT law, given the current VAT rate structure in Ireland.<\/p><p>  I would also point out that when these changes are introduced, Ireland will still apply one of the lowest VAT rates in the EU to these services. Most Member States apply the standard VAT rate to the supply of horses not intended as food or for agriculture; with France applying their 19.6% and the UK applying their 20% rate, for example.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Finance Bill provides for the new arrangements to come into effect from 1 May 2014. This will allow additional time for the sector to transition to new VAT arrangements.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, after the introduction of the legislation, the Revenue Commissioners will produce a leaflet which will provide clarification on how the new arrangements will apply particularly in respect of horses intended for use as foodstuffs and for use in agricultural production, to which the 4.8% VAT rate will continue to apply.  The delayed introduction of the new VAT treatment to 1 May 2014 will facilitate a proper consultation between Revenue and the industry concerned in relation to this leaflet, to ensure that all relevant services and supplies that qualify, remain at the 4.8% rate.<\/p><p>  With regard to the impact of the increase in the VAT rate of horses and greyhounds not qualifying for the 4.8% rate from 1 May 2014, it should be noted that horse breeding and minding will continue to qualify as agricultural services under the flat-rate farmer scheme.  As such, the VAT rate increase should not impact on flat-rate farmers supplying horses. VAT registered farmers supplying horses to other registered persons or farmers will, as always, be entitled to reclaim VAT on business purchases and as such the rate of VAT does not impact on them.<\/p><p>  Where a flat-rate farming horse breeder purchases a horse from a VAT registered dealer, the VAT on this purchase will increase from 4.8% to 9%.  However, the increase in the cost of purchasing horses due to the VAT increase will be accounted for under the flat-rate addition calculation in subsequent years.  In addition, flat-rate farmers engaged in horse breeding will continue to have the option to become registered for VAT to claim VAT on their purchases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400074#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illicit Trade in Tobacco","counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400074#WRH00750"},{"type":"question","counter":222,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[45554\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400074#WRH00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the way in which the Revenue Commissioners estimate the tobacco smuggling rate, which shows a reduction of 2% in the past year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":223,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the incidence of illicit cigarette consumption in the State is estimated on the basis of a survey of smokers carried out by IPSOS MRBI on behalf of Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office of the HSE.

A maximum of one credit will be available per single carer\/claimant, regardless of whether he or she cares for more than one child. This is the same condition that applies to the current OPFTC.   Given the difficult fiscal environment it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.

Firstly, the NTMA Budget debt service estimate for 2014 is lower than the corresponding April SPU estimate, of the order &euro;0.2bn, due to an improvement in the interest rate environment generally and lower than previously planned bond issuance.  Turning to the Central Bank income, during the summer, the Central Bank provided an estimate of the 2013 surplus income to be paid to the Central Fund in 2014 based on results to that date and projections for the remainder of the year.  The Central Bank revised this estimate upwards by &euro;0.1bn in September, in light of actual results for the first nine months and the consequent revisions of projections for the remaining three months of 2013.  In terms of savings from the Live Register, the numbers in work rose by 33,800 in the year to the second quarter of 2013 and the Live Register at the end of quarter 3 2013 was down by just over 20,000 when compared to the same period last year. On foot of this recovering labour market, live register savings have exceeded those previously expected of the order &euro;0.15bn.

While fewer than 1% of credit unions were restricted to issuing loans of less than &euro;5,000 per member in 2012, no credit union is currently similarly restricted.  These are the cases where the Registrar of Credit Unions has the more significant concerns in terms of risk to members' savings. <\/p><p>  The Registrar has also advised that individual credit union lending restrictions currently in place are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether they are still set at appropriate levels.  Lending restrictions are typically given effect by regulatory directions.  As from 1 August 2013 regulatory directions are appealable to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400075#WRJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Government Debt","counter":249,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400075#WRJ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[45574\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400075#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the impact of the previously reported 2012 general Government deficit of the Eurostat ruling in respect of the treatment of the revenue from the 4G licence sale; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

All such grants come from the exchequer, i.e. there is no EU or other external funding. <\/p><p>  The new guidelines were adopted by the Commission on 19 June 2013, and will enter into force on 1 July 2014.

All Irish regions are classified as 'C' regions, meaning that they are also disadvantaged, but to a lesser extent than 'A' areas.

Since January 2009, Kerry no longer qualifies for regional aid for investment projects by large companies.  Under the 2014-2020 Guidelines, if Kerry, or any other Irish region, was to be designated, aid to all categories of companies would be allowed.  The rates for SME's would be the same as those 2007-2013 rates listed above.

","asker":"1178","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":357,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 145 together. <\/p><p>  My overall concern in this Budget has been to protect the primary social welfare rates.  To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments such as the household benefits package, including the telephone allowance, which is currently &euro;9.50 per month (about &euro;2.20 per week).  While we have cut the telephone allowance, there have been no cuts to the electricity\/gas allowance, free travel, the free television licence, the fuel allowance or the living alone increase. I am not in a position to reverse the decision to abolish the telephone allowance.<\/p><p>  The abolition of the allowance is expected to yield savings of &euro;44 million in 2014 and &euro;46 million in 2015.  In December 2012, there were 394,671 people getting a telephone allowance from the Department and 218,188 or 55% were in receipt of State pension contributory, State pension non-contributory or State pension transition.  In addition, a further 21,040 older people were in receipt of the allowance but not receiving a pension from my Department.  The remaining 155,443 customers were in receipt of other schemes from the Department for example widow's pension, disability allowance, carer's allowance, or invalidity pension, some of whom may be over 65 years of age.  <\/p><p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme has risen each year and the number of eligible customers has increased very significantly.  In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance, today there are almost 400,000, an increase of 24%.  Each year almost 10,000 extra customers become eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients.<\/p><p>  The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephone services were more expensive and fewer people had telephones.  In recent years the nature of the telephone market has been transformed with deregulation, mobile services and bundled services including television, broadband and telephone.  There is a wide variety of deals and great competition now available. <\/p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has responsibility for the Seniors Alert Scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes.  The grant assistance is made available through community and voluntary groups registered with the Department and the equipment supplied under the scheme remains the property of the community group.  The budget allocation for 2013 was &euro;2.35 million.  While the equipment currently provided requires the use of a landline, there are other companies in the market providing similar services based on mobile technology.<\/p><p>  Finally, if any person is in particular difficulty an application may be made for an exceptional needs payments (ENP) under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his or her own resources.  There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by a Department based on the particular circumstances of the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400079#WRN00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bereavement Grant Applications","counter":358,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400079#WRN00850"},{"type":"question","counter":359,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[45435\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400079#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of applications approved for financial assistance towards burial costs under each of her Department's schemes in 2012; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":360,"content":"<p>In 2012 there were 26,553 applications approved for financial assistance towards burial costs under the schemes within the remit of my Department in 2012.

In 18,306 cases, a report of suspected fraud was sent to the relevant area for examination.In 9,716 of the cases received, it was not possible to issue a report due to lack of information, no claim being in payment or the information reported would not impact on entitlement.<\/p><p>  It should be borne in mind that while there is sometimes a perception of fraud, when a case is examined the individual may be doing something that is allowed under the rules for the particular payment that they are in receipt of.

Anonymous reports are not available to deciding officers when making their decisions.

ComReg has put in place a new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and for service bundles, both of which are designed to incentivise the roll-out of services by service providers.

In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years.  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing.

In addition to the amounts shown in the estimates for my Department, under the Government's Stimulus Package, I secured an additional &euro;30m in funding to increase investment in the Better Energy and Warmer Home energy efficiency schemes to a total of &euro;57 million in 2014.  These schemes fund energy efficiency improvements by householders as well as energy efficiency measures free of charge to low-income households.  In 2014, over 30,000 homes are expected to benefit from energy efficiency upgrades under these schemes, bringing the total number of homes supported to more than 290,000.  This detail will be shown in full in the Revised Estimates which will be published in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400082#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":461,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400082#WRQ01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Meters Issues","counter":460,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400082#WRQ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":461,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[45426\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400082#WRQ01400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he is confident that persons who will be paying for water will have full access to be able to either directly, or through independent verification, access the readings on their new water meters to ascertain their usage and to be able to verify faults; if no such access exists, if he will confirm that only Irish Water and their agents will have sole access to this information; if this represents a potential problem for dispute resolution in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1101","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":497,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 184 to 186, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  The local government funding model will change considerably in 2014.  Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014 the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund.  In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing.<\/p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised.  The establishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisational and financial challenges in 2014 and, in this context, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015.  This approach allows maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax in 2014 with the priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases.  The 2014 Local Government Fund General Purpose Grants will be announced in due course.<\/p><p>  Under section 20 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, a local authority may, as a reserved function , resolve to vary the rate of the Local Property Tax within its functional area by a maximum of +\/-15%.  This power will be available to local authorities effective from 2015, as the relevant sections of the Act will come into operation on 1 July 2014.<\/p><p>  Section 20 of the Act requires that, in varying the rate, a local authority must take account of its financial position, its income and expenditure , and of the financial effect of the varied rate on the economy of its functional area, including on those persons who will be liable to pay the Local Property Tax.  Section 20 also provides that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government may make regulations, including in respect of public consultation requirements prior to the variation of the rate of the Tax.  I will give consideration to the making of such regulations in advance of the coming into operation of section 20 of the 2012 Act.<\/p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates.  A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400083#WRR01700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Place Names Changes","counter":499,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400084#WRS00150"},{"type":"question","counter":500,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[45408\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400084#WRS00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the procedure laid down in law in relation to the changing of the name of a street; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":501,"content":"<p>The law currently in force in relation to the changing of placenames is set out in the Local Government Act 1946, as amended.

The title to be shown to allow the registration to proceed must be based on &quot;adverse possession&quot; under the Statute of Limitations Act 1957.  The circumstances of each case dictate the nature and the processing time of each individual application.  Such applications require careful examination and the exercise of judgement of a high level.<\/p><p>  The process involves the issue of notices to any party who may have an interest in the property in respect of which a Section 49 application has been lodged.  There will routinely be ongoing and detailed correspondence between the Property Registration Authority and other parties.  I am advised by the Authority that by their nature such applications, of necessity, may take a long time to process and it is not therefore possible to give an average turnaround time for these types of cases.  However, every effort is made to ensure that unnecessary delay is avoided.  I understand that there is currently an arrear of 2,278 of these cases pending.  Of these, 1,256 cases have been queried and cannot be proceeded with until a satisfactory response has been received.  This leaves a net arrear of 1,022 cases.  Where requests are made to expedite cases for particularly urgent reasons, the Authority will always endeavour to deal with such cases promptly.<\/p><p>  The Property Registration Authority has a total number of 52,310 dealings on hand on 30 September 2013.  This represents a very significant reduction of 76% compared with the highest level of dealings on hand which was recorded at 220,192 in March 2008.  The Authority has since this time been engaged in an active arrear clearance programme which, it is envisaged, will be substantially completed in 2014.  It is worthy of note that this reduction over a five year period has been brought about whilst the Authority has reduced its cost base by in excess of 33% and its staff levels by 25%.<\/p><p>  Of the 52,310 dealings on hand at end September 2013, 12,587 are the subject of queries and cannot be proceeded with until a satisfactory reply has been received.  The net arrear at 30 September 2013 was therefore 39,723 cases.  A large element of this arrear is comprised of recently received cases and therefore represents the normal expected level of cases pending. During 2012, 75% of all applications for registration lodged that did not involve a change to the map, and were in order for registration, were completed with 10 working days.  I am pleased to able to inform the Deputy that the overall level of cases pending, at 52,310 is the lowest level of arrear of cases in the Land Registry since 1997.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400084#WRS01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Process","counter":524,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400084#WRS01850"},{"type":"question","counter":525,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[45349\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400084#WRS01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"asked if the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 require the making of a ministerial order in order to commence; and if such an order has commenced.

Following engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the ceilings for expenditure within the Defence Sector were set out for the 2012-2014 period.  These ceilings were based on a rigorous assessment of pay, non-pay and pension elements of the Defence Sector Votes (Defence and Army Pensions).

Achieving the required savings in 2014 will be a challenge; however, it is envisaged that cost containment and control measures across the Defence Vote, together with careful evaluation and management of Defence Forces procurement, will deliver current expenditure savings of &euro;2m in 2014.

This detailed analysis of the thoroughbred industry, commissioned by the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association, is a very useful piece of research for anybody with an interest in the sector.<\/p><p>  I am acutely aware of the importance of the thoroughbred sector to the Irish economy and its pre-eminent position on the world stage as a global leader in the bloodstock industry.  Indeed next week, I will be travelling on a major trade mission to the Gulf States, and the promotion of the Irish thoroughbred sector will be a major feature of the visit.  I note that the ITBA Report estimates the industry contributed &euro;1.1bn in economic output and supported 14,000 jobs in 2012.  The Report identifies challenges facing the industry and suggests a range of actions aimed at securing the future of the industry. <\/p><p>  The ITBA Report raises the issue of the taxation of betting and possible changes to the rate of VAT to be charged on horses.  Earlier this year, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, introduced the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 which is aimed at updating the system of taxation applying to the betting industry.  The Minister for Finance will also address the issue of VAT on horses through the Finance Bill.<\/p><p>  The ITBA Report also raises issues with regard to prize money and the importance of the establishment of overseas markets.  Horse Racing Ireland (HRI), a commercial state body established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 and representing key sectors of the thoroughbred industry, is responsible for the overall administration, promotion and development of the industry.  Decisions regarding prize money fall within the remit of HRI.  Irish Thoroughbred Marketing (ITM) is a subsidiary of HRI.  It is funded by HRI and by the Irish bloodstock industry, including breeders, sales companies and stallion farms.  ITM provides  service and support to overseas visitors interested in the Irish thoroughbred racing and breeding industry.  The principal focus of ITM is to generate inward investment and to increase export sales of Irish bloodstock.<\/p><p>  Successive Governments have recognised the importance of the horse industry for our country, and have supported it through legislation and policy initiatives.  Infrastructural supports are provided to the industry through various measures operated by my Department.  This commitment to investment has enabled Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horse racing and breeding.  The Deputy is aware that of my personal commitment to this indigenous Irish industry.  Since taking office I have taken an active interest in the industry and I commissioned an independent review of the industry in 2012.  Officials in my Department are currently preparing legislative proposals aimed at giving effect to the recommendations contained in the Indecon report on the Irish Horse Racing Industry (2012) which I plan to bring before the Cabinet for approval as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400085#WRT02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sc&eacute;im Talmha&iacute;ochta","counter":565,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400086#WRU00100"},{"type":"question","counter":566,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[45337\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400086#WRU00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"c&eacute;n uair a dh&eacute;anfar &iacute;oca&iacute;ocht faoi Sc&eacute;im na Limist&eacute;ar faoi Mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste agus Sc&eacute;im na h&Iacute;oca&iacute;ochta Aonair do 2013 le feirmeoir i gContae na Gaillimhe (sonra&iacute; leis seo); c&eacute;n f&aacute;th go bhfuil moill leis an &iacute;oca&iacute;ocht seo; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":567,"content":"<p>  Rinneadh iarratas ar Sc&eacute;im na Limist&eacute;ar faoi Mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste \/ an Sc&eacute;im &Iacute;oca&iacute;ochta Aonair 2013  an 16 Bealtaine 2013 faoin uimhir thr&eacute;ada thuas.

Earlier this year, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, introduced the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 which is aimed at updating the system of taxation applying to the betting industry.  The Minister for Finance will also address the issue of VAT on horses through the Finance Bill.<\/p><p>  The ITBA Report also raises issues with regard to prize money and the importance of the establishment of overseas markets.  Horse Racing Ireland (HRI), a commercial state body established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 and representing key sectors of the thoroughbred industry, is responsible for the overall administration, promotion and development of the industry.  Decisions regarding prize money fall within the remit of HRI.  Irish Thoroughbred Marketing (ITM) is a subsidiary of HRI. It is funded by HRI and by the Irish bloodstock industry, including breeders, sales companies and stallion farms.  ITM provides  service and support to overseas visitors interested in the Irish thoroughbred racing and breeding industry.  The principal focus of ITM is to generate inward investment and to increase export sales of Irish bloodstock.<\/p><p>  Successive Governments have recognised the importance of the horse industry for our country, and have supported it through legislation and policy initiatives.  Infrastructural supports are provided to the industry through various measures operated by my Department.  This commitment to investment has enabled Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horse racing and breeding.  The Deputy is aware that of my personal commitment to this indigenous Irish industry.  Since taking office I have taken an active interest in the industry and I commissioned an independent review of the industry in 2012.<\/p><p>  Officials in my Department are currently preparing legislative proposals aimed at giving effect to the recommendations contained in the Indecon report on the Irish Horse Racing Industry (2012) which I plan to bring before the Cabinet for approval as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400086#WRU02400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":589,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400086#WRU02500"},{"type":"question","counter":590,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[45580\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400086#WRU02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the expenditure adjustment that will be made within his Department in 2014; the full-year impact of expenditure measures that will be taken in 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The number of reports in each of the years requested by the Deputy is set out below in Table 1.<\/p><p><i>Table 1. No. of sexual abuse reports.<\/i><table><tr><th>Category <\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Reported <\/td><td>2,692<\/td><td>3,326<\/td><td>Data not yet available<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>  The compilation of significantly more detailed breakdowns of referral data, such as that requested by the Deputy, while desirable, must be considered in the context of the significant resources which would be required to be diverted from front line service to compile such data and the inherent complexity of child welfare and protection cases.  In relation to resources, the focus of the HSE is necessarily on working directly with children and families and compiling such key national information as is required to monitor service delivery and inform policy at the highest level.  The issue of complexity in child protection cases is an important consideration as referral statistics are compiled on basis of primary type of abuse at point of referral.  It is common in confirmed cases of abuse for multiple types of abuse to emerge.  Referral statistics only capture the primary cause for referrals. I would stress that the focus of Child Protection Services in all cases is risk assessment and service provision, including therapy, to individual children.  In this regard, all of the information highlighted by the Deputy would be captured at individual child level on individual case files to inform the handling of the case.<\/p><p>  The purpose of management information for Children and Family Services is to know how well it is performing against its aims and objectives.  This is essential in developing strategies and policies to meet the Agency's aims; to identify what policies and processes work and why they work; to assist tactical and operational managers in comparing their performance against targets, other Areas and over time; to provide accountability externally to service users, the public, the Government and other external stakeholders.<\/p><p>  Data collected by Children and Family Services is either in the form of Performance Measures which are items that are relatively unambiguously counted (e.g. number of children, their age, number of child protection plans), or Performance Indicators which  are configurations of performance measures which demonstrate the direction of travel in relation to a desired objective (e.g. percentage of children in care with a written care plan, percentage of children in care who have had three or more placement moves in the last 12 months, percentage of initial assessments which took place within 21 days of a referral).  Performance measures and Performance Indicators inform the measurement of progress against targets set in annual Service Plans.<\/p><p>  The total set of Children and Family Services data metrics is regularly reviewed to ensure that total information needs are being met.  Decisions in regard to the addition of new metrics are considered in the context of the purposes set out above.  A review of the Performance Indicators and metrics is currently underway in HSE Children and Family Services with a view to focusing on outcomes rather than solely on activity.  It is acknowledged that there is scope to improve the range of data currently collected.  My Department is engaged with Children and Family services in relation to improving the range of data available at the policy level in the context of the establishment of the new Children and Family Agency and the implementation of the new National Child Care Information System.  These discussions will have regard to the balance required to be struck between directly working with child and family, and the need to focus on key data that will support the management of services at all levels and inform policy development.  The availability and use of meaningful and accurate management data informing policy and legislative development will, in turn, drive the accuracy and timeliness of the data gathered.  Further, the Children and Family Agency Bill sets out a framework for performance management which is designed to provide a context for the next evolution of performance monitoring in children and family services. <\/p><p>  In regard to the Deputy's query relating to cases dealt with by social work departments where sexual abuse was a component the HSE has informed me that it would be an extremely unusual circumstance in which it would be recommended that a parent would not be allowed to make any further disclosures of abuse.  In relation to cases dealt with by social work departments where sexual abuse was a component the reports of psychologists not in the direct employment of the Health Service Executive may be accessed in some circumstances in assessing those cases as follows:<\/p><p>  In cases where a criminal investigation is being pursued and the credibility of the allegation was not established through the joint specialist interview with an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a further assessment may be required to determine credibility and therapeutic needs following the joint interview.  These assessments are provided by specialist Centres at St Louise's, St Claire's, the Waterford Community Child Centre at the Waterford Regional Hospital and the Family Centre at St Finbarr's Hospital Cork and by community based Children and Family Services staff.<\/p><p>  In cases where a criminal investigation is not being pursued an assessment may be required to determine credibility and therapeutic needs these assessments are normally provided by specialist Centre's and by community based Children and Family Services staff.  Psychologists based at St Louise's and St Clare's Centres are not in the direct employment of the HSE.  There may also be some limited circumstances where the needs of an individual child will best be met through the services of a private practitioner psychologist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400087#WRV01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":609,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400087#WRV01250"},{"type":"question","counter":610,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[45581\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400087#WRV01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the expenditure adjustment that will be made within her Department in 2014; the full-year impact of expenditure measures that will be taken in 2014; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The fluoride used in Ireland is sourced as a primary product; it is mined directly from a raw material source, the mineral fluorospar as calcium fluoride (CaF2). It then goes through a purification process to conform to tightly controlled specifications under the requirements of CEN Standard I.S.EN 12175:2001 to produce Hydrofluosilicic Acid (HFSA), specifically used as the mineral additive, fluoride, to water.<\/p><p>  The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is the competent authority for the licensing of human and veterinary medicines and medical devices in Ireland. The IMB considers that neither drinking water itself nor the fluoride added to drinking water in the form of fluoride salts or silica fluoride, as defined in the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960, should be categorised as medicinal products requiring marketing authorisations.  It considers that the fluoridation of drinking water should be seen as a measure consistent with general public health management.  The principles for approval of use of HFSA in treatment of water intended for human consumption are no different to those relating to other chemicals used in drinking water treatment, such as disinfectants and coagulants.  No water treatment chemical is intended for direct human consumption.  The level of fluoride in drinking water in Ireland has been set at between 0.6-0.8 parts per million.  This level of fluoride is deemed optimal for protecting the oral health of all age groups. <\/p><p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, continuously monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects.

The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE) will pursue the issue of individualised budgeting in the context of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the VFM Review.  A Steering Group which is representative of the major stakeholders has been set up to oversee the VFM implementation process and the first meeting of this Group was held in September.<\/p><p>  Individualised budgeting is an umbrella term that may take many forms, ranging from a method of determining resource allocation to agencies based on assessed client need and actual costs, to a 'money follows the client' model, a brokerage system or a personal budget model administered by the individual service user.  The essence of individualised budgeting is that the individual is given more choice and control over how the money allocated to meet their needs is utilised.  This might or might not involve the transfer of actual funds to the individual.  This approach must be underpinned by a standardised needs assessment to ensure fairness and transparency in the way in which funding is allocated.  The move towards an individualised budgeting framework raises legal and practical issues, and will require careful consideration and possibly legislation.<\/p><p>  The priority is to further improve current services, while expediting the analysis of the benefits to be gained from newer models of individualised supports through demonstration projects which will be evaluated for wider applicability.  The balance and emphasis will shift firmly and comprehensively towards these new models of individualised supports once sufficient analysis of the benefits is carried out in the Irish context and adequate financial management, resource allocation and governance structures are in place to ensure their long-term viability.<\/p><p>  Demonstration projects are already underway to examine the practical aspects of introducing this major change and to establish the costs and benefits.  The projects will be analysed in 2014 to determine their wider applicability, clarify the issues which must be resolved before the projects can be scaled up, and identify the best way forward.  Work is also underway to identify a standardised national assessment tool and resource allocation model which will form the basis of the individualised budgeting framework.  Other essential elements of the new model of service delivery and funding, such as a commissioning strategy and an outcome measurement framework, are also in development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400090#WRY01700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Data","counter":697,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400090#WRY01750"},{"type":"question","counter":698,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[45495\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102400090#WRY01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of doctors currently registered here; if any studies or assessments have been carried out to ascertain the number of doctors required in the State to deal with any capacity constraints that may arise.

Legislation is being developed to provide for, inter alia, a minimum unit price for alcohol.  This is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels per gram of alcohol that must be legally observed by retailers in both the on and off trade sector.  As part of our work, a health impact assessment, in conjunction with Northern Ireland, has been commissioned as part of the process of developing a legislative basis for minimum unit pricing.
