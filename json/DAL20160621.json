That had not been communicated to me.  Maybe we could work out arrangements for situations like this in the future.  I appreciate that, a Cheann Comhairle.<\/p>  <p>  I raise with the Taoiseach the anger, anxiety and great surprise at how the statutory instrument introduced by former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, last January has created chaos and mayhem within the bin industry and caused anger and anxiety among householders across the country.  There have been claims and counter-claims but essentially bills in quite a number of instances have gone through the roof.  In many ways, it highlights the complete lack of transparency in relation to bin charges generally.  Quite a number of companies are not transparent at all in terms of their charging regime.  The standard charges were increased under the guise of the introduction of the pay-by-weight system.  Deputy Kelly signed in the charges on the basis that 87% of people would have their bills reduced but he indicated that the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, were caught hopping.<\/p><p>I do not know whether the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, discussed this with the Taoiseach last January when he signed the instrument or whether there was a discussion on it in the Cabinet because I cannot reconcile his perspective on this at that time with the subsequent view that the Government was caught on the hop by the companies and did not follow through sufficiently.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has brought forward a range of proposals.  Members of the House and spokespersons, including Deputy Cowen, asked the Minister to engage with the companies with a view to bringing about a resolution to this debacle.  Essentially, there has been a deferral of the charges regime for 12 months.  I seek clarity from the Taoiseach on that.  Can he guarantee that householders will not have increased bills over the next 12 months?  Also, during the next 12 months, will the Taoiseach take the opportunity to initiate a comprehensive review of the current waste collection, management and recycling system and industry?  There is a complete absence of transparency and there is no regulator.  Will the Taoiseach consider the appointment of a regulator?  There is also a lack of competition in some parts of the country while an increasing amount of illegal dumping is occurring.  The next number of months should be used as an opportunity to conduct a comprehensive review of this sector, so I ask the Taoiseach to initiate such a review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100003#A00700","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466514300,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Martin for the question.  This controversy has blown up quite recently, following the statutory instrument introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly.  Obviously, what the Government seeks, and most Deputies would agree with this, is that people would take the opportunity to think more carefully about the way they deal with refuse and the disposal of waste.  The theory and spirit of the legislation was that, as a result of examining what should be put into a black bin, less would be put into it on a pay-by-weight basis, which would mean a reduction in charges for people.  In addition, there would be better use of the brown and green bins, as the case may be.  In many cases, there are shortages in capacity for landfill and the less that goes to landfill the better.<\/p>  <p>  In the last couple of days, people were very concerned that their bin charges would rise to a serious extent.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, met with the Irish waste management industry and the majority of those who supply waste services and he has announced a pay freeze, with the support of the waste management companies, for the next 12 months on the basis of the current pricing plans.  That means no increase in what people have paid in respect of their last bill.  During the second half of 2016, the Government and the waste industry are committed to an intensive public awareness and information campaign to promote the benefits of the pay-by-weight charging model and to support customers in understanding how they can change their waste management behaviour and manage their waste costs better under the pay-by-weight system.  That is in everybody's interest as well as in the environmental interest.<\/p>  <p>  No later than 1 January 2017 customers will receive a dual pricing bill listing the amount of waste they are disposing of, the costs under the current pricing system and details of what the comparative cost would be on a pay-by-weight charge.  They will be given the option to transition, should they so choose, to pay-by-weight charging or to remain on their current pricing plan.  People have an option here to reduce the amount of waste they put in the black bin.  After the transitional 12 months, the operation of pay-by-weight in the wider waste market will be reviewed to inform decisions on the arrangements beyond 1 July 2017.  Also, the Minister has confirmed the commitment of the waste industry to provide a full weight allowance for the 60,000 Health Service Executive, HSE, patients supplied with incontinence wear to reduce their waste charges and the Government's provision of a 50% exemption to the waste industry from the landfill levy in respect of such waste.  This point was made last week.<\/p><p>These are the changes the Minister wants to bring in.  <br\/><br\/>In respect of the issue raised by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, it is valid to look at the structure and the way the management of waste is dealt with.  This issue needs to be looked at.  The Minister for communications, climate change and natural resources, Deputy Naughten, will be dealing with it from now on and will be happy to examine it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100004#B00200","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466514600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Did the Taoiseach say that the hot potato has been handed to the Minister for communications, climate change and natural resources, Deputy Naughten?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100005#C00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1466514600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Yes, it transfers across.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100005#C00300","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1466514600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>That is a surprise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100005#C00400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1466514600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>No, that is already in the transfer of responsibilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100005#C00500","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1466514600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thought that the Minister for housing, planning and local government had been handling this proactively for the past week or two weeks but the Taoiseach slipped it in there that it is now the responsibility of the Minister for communications, climate change and natural resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100005#C00600","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1466514600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Housing, planning and local government and, obviously, energy and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100005#C00700","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1466514600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>The former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, was adamant that there would be a reduction for 87% of households.

The Taoiseach was in the previous Government with Deputy Kelly.  Surely they discussed it and were all convinced it would bring down waste charges.  The opposite has happened and the bin charges have gone way up.  Deputy Kelly said the Government was caught hopping.  I am trying to find out in between the two how the Government was caught hopping.  Perhaps Deputy Kelly might illustrate to us in greater detail how something he introduced apparently caught everybody hopping.  It caught the companies, householders and the Government hopping.<\/p>  <p>  In a more serious vein, and I am serious about that one, will the Taoiseach initiate a comprehensive review of the industry because there is a lack of competition in certain places and there is a complete absence of transparency on the part of some companies in respect of their charging?  Some companies are saying that the pay-by-weight system will encourage cross-contamination of waste and will interfere with and undermine the recyclable material and product that emerges from the system at the moment.  Many issues have emanated from this ill-thought-out and poorly implemented statutory instrument, which seems to have been used by some companies, which engaged in below-cost selling to get into the market and to get a significant share, to raise charges excessively and use the pay-by-weight system as a camouflage to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100005#C00800","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1466514600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I do not think the former Minister set out to catch anybody on the hop, least of all the Government of which he was a member.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100005#C00900","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1466514600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>You do not know about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100005#C01000","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1466514600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The spirit of the legislation was that by looking differently at how waste could be disposed of, the charges could be reduced.

Clearly, that was not what was going to happen here, which is why the Minister for housing, planning and local government met with all of the waste management companies and has agreed, with their support, a freeze for 12 months given the other issues that are there.<\/p>  <p>  The fact that some waste disposal companies in a competitive sense decided to tout for commercial business by offering a below-cost service for waste disposal is a matter for themselves in terms of the competitive nature of the waste disposal industry.

This latest debacle over bin charges has been a wake-up call for many.  It is also a very stark demonstration of the shallowness of the so-called new politics.  The reality is that many households cannot afford these bin charges.  There is nothing new, politically or otherwise, about bin companies agreeing that they will go ahead with these charges in July 2017 instead of July 2016.<\/p><p>There is nothing new about the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il opting out of his partnership role to lament the bin charges fiasco even though he has yet to support measures which could annul the statutory instrument that allows these price hikes.  It is nothing but the same old story.<\/p> <p> Under the Taoiseach's watch, the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, introduced a statutory instrument which allowed for households to be fleeced by some unscrupulous waste disposal companies.  At that time, the Government maintained that the new charging regime would mean that 90% of households would pay less to have their bins collected.  It now turns out that, in reality, 90% of families and households will pay substantially more.  The companies have agreed to put that off for one year.  The Taoiseach says it is to give people more time to think about their options.  That is not good enough.  Citizens already struggling with the cost of living crises in respect of mortgages, rents, child care, water charges, property tax and car insurance are being hit once again and the Taoiseach advises them that he is giving them a year to think about this.  It is yet another increase on top of all the other taxes, costs and charges he has inflicted on ordinary citizens in recent years.  It is very clear that this waste management strategy, if it can be called that, will also impact on small businesses and the farming community and there is the real prospect of more illegal dumping across the State.<\/p> <p> It is very simple.  The regulations - part of Deputy Kelly's glorious legacy - were introduced by the stroke of a ministerial pen and they can be removed today by the stroke of a ministerial pen if that is what the Taoiseach wants.  Instead of pushing this issue down the road to diffuse a potential political storm, I ask the Taoiseach to make a commitment that new regulations or legislation to deal with this debacle will be introduced by his Government with the assistance of Fianna F&aacute;il this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100005#C01200","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466515200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Adams for his comment.  I listened to his deputy leader saying that anything that would promote the better distribution and management of waste should be supported.  Everybody accepts that the less one has to put into landfill in the black bin the better and that better use of brown and green bins will follow through.  Deputy Adams wants to jack up income taxes to put more pressure on working families and to have a situation where all of this comes out of general taxation.  The Deputy might like to indicate what he means by that in terms of increased income taxes.<\/p>  <p>  The position is that the Minister has met all the waste management companies.  A freeze has been put in place for 12 months.  When 1 January arrives and the dual-billing process is sent out to customers, they will be able to see the difference and compare whether the current system or the pay-by-weight system would have a better result for them, depending on what they put into the black bin.  They have the option of transferring from one to the other.  There are difficulties in terms of terraced houses where there is no room for a bin to go out the back such that if bags were to be done away with, it would obviously cause a problem.  That is a matter that can be looked at.<\/p>  <p>  In the broader context of having a more effective way of dealing with waste disposal and collection, perhaps based on a franchise per area, these are matters that should be examined.  For now, customers and consumers should be very clear that the spirit of what the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, intended was not being adhered to.  Ministers met the waste companies and there is now a solution in place.  In the course of the coming months, reflection can be made on the waste management system generally for more effective waste collection and disposal which will reduce the impact of what is going into landfill.  Deputy Adams is aware that a number of landfill sites are at full capacity and that many areas around the country now have a shortage of capacity for landfill.  Everybody thinking about how they would dispose of waste generated in households will have an impact on that as well.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Adams wants to do away with all the incentives that have been there for ten or 12 years and which people are very pleased about and proud to participate in because it is good for the environment and for the extent of what goes into landfill.

Today, we see the publication of the summer economic statement.  In fact, I understand in five minutes' time the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will make that announcement outside the House.  It has been published without any consultation with the Members of this House.  Indeed, Members of the House got to read in this morning's newspapers that &euro;300 million is to be made available for additional tax cuts and &euro;600 million, apparently, to be devoted to additional expenditure next year.  According to the newspapers this morning, a total of &euro;900 million, therefore, is to be made available in what amounts to the determined fiscal space, a sum which the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has already described today as \"contractionary\".<\/p>  <p>  We will have a contraction in our economy next year, according to the projections, or at least those that we read about in the newspapers.  There is a train of thought among economists these days that because of the experiences of the past while, we should be very risk averse and that amounts apparently to prudence.  An aversion to risk must not put at risk the very factors that we need to invest in our economy, if we are to continue to grow and continue to provide jobs for our people.  That approach disregards the legitimate demands of the public that an improving economy will impact on their quality of life.  We argued in the last election that a ratio of at least 2:1 should be allocated between investment and tax reductions.<\/p><p>The ratio should probably be more than that to deliver what we need, such as smaller classes, a functioning health system, indexation of welfare payments and so on.<\/p> <p> There is a second aspect of today's coverage in the newspapers that also troubles me.  We read today that the Government intends to press ahead with the idea of a rainy day fund.  So when we have an urgent need for investment in infrastructure - whether it be broadband, schools, health services or roads - apparently the Government will effectively put money on deposit.  Even if it could be used to pay down debt, it would be more reasonable than simply leaving money on deposit.<\/p> <p> I have two questions for the Taoiseach.  Does he accept that investment in urgently needed infrastructure makes much more sense than simply creating this so-called rainy day fund, which, in effect, is leaving money unused on deposit with the Central Bank?

The first is to meet the domestic and EU fiscal rules and the summer statement sets out how that will happen.  The nominal budget will be balanced in 2018.  Second, there should be at least a split of 2:1 between spending and tax, and the projections are that this ratio is to be maintained each year.  The third is that there would be a spend of at least an additional &euro;6.75 billion in delivering additional public services by 2021, with current expenditure in that year projected to be 6.75% higher than 2016.  The fourth commitment is an additional &euro;4 billion in Exchequer capital investment up to 2021.  We would comply with and exceed the latter by making use of the favourable treatment of capital in the rules so that capital will increase by just over &euro;5 billion.  The fifth commitment is the establishment of a rainy day fund.  The Ministers responsible for both finance and public expenditure and reform have pointed out that &euro;1 billion per year will go to the fund in the period 2019 to 2021, with a commitment to bring forward proposals to the Oireachtas for discussion on that.  It would be a matter for the Government of the day as to whether that should continue beyond 2021 and how it should be used, depending on the circumstances that apply internationally or from an economic perspective.<\/p>  <p>  The total amount available to the Government over the five years is estimated to be a cumulative &euro;11.3 billion.  Critically, the space for 2017 has increased to &euro;1 billion, with &euro;1.2 billion available in 2018.  It means the Government can bring forward some spending for 2017 for the kind of issues mentioned by the Deputy, including infrastructure and social issues, that was not available even three months ago.  From 2019 to 2021, the increase will be of the order of &euro;3 billion per annum, arising after the balancing of the budget in 2018.  This means the additional capital for 2017 will be &euro;250 million, for 2018 it will be &euro;750 million, for 2019 it will be &euro;1.18 billion, for 2020 it will be &euro;1.38 billion and for 2021 it will be &euro;1.59 billion.  That is a cumulative &euro;5.14 billion over the period.  This means that many of the priority issues which must be addressed can be brought forward somewhat, as there will be an additional &euro;250 million available in 2017 that was not available in figures from just a few months ago.<\/p><p>Obviously, there is a space here and the Minister pointed out how the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council would be involved in discussions about the formation of a rainy day fund, how it might be used and what it would be used for and the opportunities to make proposals in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100008#F00200","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466516400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I asked about next year's budget.

We have notionally bank shares and so on that we will be able to sell, which means a sum of money will be available to the State to invest if we wish.  Surely it makes more sense to set up an ambitious capital programme for the next few years to address issues like broadband and the third level deficit and to make a significant spend in terms of education, finishing our road network and investing in health care and child care facilities.

Many people in this House have received correspondence and e-mails in regard to bin charges and that whole debacle.  I just want to read out one e-mail I got from a chap in the area I live in.  I cut it down a little bit.  It encapsulates everything that is wrong with these charges.<\/p><blockquote>I want to raise this issue of the new pay-by-weight bin charges announced by Greyhound and other bin companies.  I am a full-time carer for my sister, who has Downs syndrome and who suffers from adult urinary incontinence.  I need to use my bin daily to dispose of adult nappies and pads.  As a result of the new charges, my bin charges will increase from Euro 204 to Euro 304.60.  This is a price increase of 50% and in my opinion it is outrageous that this is allowed to happen.<br \/><br \/>[...]<br \/><br \/>The Dept of Environment stated that 87% of clients would see their bin charges fall.  This is clearly erroneous and misleading information.<br \/><br \/>I am a life-long environmentalist and I have a compost heap for my green waste.  I use my green bin to dispose of all plastics and paper.  There is very little else I can do to reduce my own personal liability.<br \/><br \/>I hope you can now influence this government to step in before July 1st and prevent this profiteering by these bin companies.<\/blockquote><p>I never thought I would end up in the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>But I am very proud to represent working people and one poster has stuck in my head for a very long time.  It read, \"We deserve to live, not just to exist\", and that is what is happening to working people in this country at the moment.  We talk about a dispensation in this House but there is a dispensation in society whereby working people will not take any more stealth taxes or fiascos such as Irish Water.  What is the Taoiseach going to do about this debacle?  Will he bring forward legislation to ensure it does not happen again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100009#G00400","speaker":"1299","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466516700,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Deputy Gino Kenny is welcome and he is as entitled to ask questions as anybody else.

I am glad the person points out the issues relating to the disposal of plastic, paper and cardboard in green bins and so on.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also spoke about working families and the Government is really interested in giving working families a break.  The former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, introduced a statutory instrument for that purpose so that people would consider very carefully how to dispose of the waste produced by each household.  By a better use of the brown and green bins, we can reduce what went into the black bins and, by reducing the weight of what was being disposed of in this way, we can reduce the overall charge.  That was not going to happen under the current regime so the Minister met all the waste management companies and put in place a price freeze, agreed with them, which recognises the particular health difficulties experienced by the person who sent the e-mail to the Deputy.  Some 60,000 HSE patients around the country have adult incontinence nappies and there is a substantial charge for sending them to landfill but the Government gives 100% to waste companies and 50% to the waste industry from the landfill levy.  This measure is a recognition of that person's willingness to comply with good environmental practices and takes into account such people's particular challenges.  From 1 January 2017, the person in question will get a dual bill setting out what he will continue to pay under the current regime and what he could save by better management of what is put into the black bin.  That is in keeping with the principle expressed by the writer of the e-mail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100010#H00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1466516700,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I do not think people are looking for a gentleman's agreement.

In many places there may be only one or two suppliers, while in others there may be three or four waste company lorries providing a service on any one road.

The murder of a public representative in a democracy is, thankfully, a very rare and shocking event.  It is extremely important that we condemn what has happened, but also reflect on it.  Quite clearly, the British Labour Party has lost a rising star, a person who was passionate and independent in mind and spirit, who, through her short life, made an extraordinary contribution before she entered politics through international affairs and through Oxfam.  She had a deep, passionate commitment to the refugee crisis and the situation in Syria and was a significant critic of the UK's foreign policy and successive British governments' handling of that issue.<\/p><p>I read an article by John Bew in the <i>New Statesman<\/i>about Jo Cox's political contribution and what an extraordinary individual she was.

Bew says, &quot;She was one of those rare people with a deep moral integrity but no interest in grandstanding or moralising herself.&quot;<\/p><p>In an era when politics can be debased and there is much dissolution about politics, it is very clear that, in the person of Jo Cox, politics gained somebody who was motivated by the very best interests of public good and community.  In many respects, she stood in stark contrast to some of the stereotyping of politicians that can go on in the modern world.  It is extremely important that we do not stigmatise politicians.  In many ways, politicians are overly stigmatised as a group and that can heighten extreme rhetoric which can lead to the most horrific consequences.

Since then, answers have been received on some parliamentary questions tabled that illustrate there are only 12 areas nationwide in which home help hours have not been cut.

However, those voters include Irish citizens living in Great Britain, voters in Northern Ireland and UK citizens living here.  As the UK's closest neighbour, Ireland has a unique perspective and interest in the outcome of the referendum.  The Government has made clear our hope that the UK will decide to stay in the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  I and other members of the Government have completed a targeted programme of outreach in Great Britain and Northern Ireland to Irish and Irish-connected citizens in the UK who have a vote.  Last week, I had engagements in Belfast and a programme of events in Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow, where I met with the Irish community.  I also attended a summit meeting of the British-Irish Council in Glasgow.  My programme coincided with the shocking death of Jo Cox, MP, in West Yorkshire, to whom we have just paid our respects.  Out of respect for her and her family and in light of the suspension of the two official campaigns, I refrained from issuing any public statements about the referendum.  I have no specific plans to visit Great Britain as of now.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will have a clear plan in place to deal with the implications of a UK vote to leave if that is the outcome, which I hope will not be the case.  The key priority for Government would be to protect and promote Ireland's interests to the greatest extent possible in the event that the UK votes to leave.  We have a whole-of-Government contingency framework which maps the key issues that would be most important to Ireland, dealing with the economy, trade and spending power in the days, weeks and months following a \"leave\" vote.  In the event of that becoming a reality, this would be the framework within which each Minister, Department and agency would manage the policy, operational and programmatic implications that could arise from a UK vote to leave the EU.  It will be capable of adapting to changing circumstances, depending on developments in the context of ongoing EU-UK negotiations on new arrangements and bilateral discussions between the UK and Irish Governments.<\/p>  <p>  A key priority would be to mitigate as far as possible any potential disruption to trade, investment and jobs.  In this regard, many commentators have suggested a period of volatility in the markets and suggested that sterling would suffer losses against the euro.  It remains to be seen if this is the case and the extent to which markets have already priced in any degree of risk.  However, if a sustained decrease in the value of sterling did transpire, clearly this would have serious implications for our exports.  Given the importance of the Irish enterprise sector, the enterprise agencies are factoring this issue into their own contingency planning and are tracking where potential impacts may arise.  Enterprise Ireland already has a significant number of programmes available to companies who face competitive threats from various sources.  In addition, a key policy priority in recent years for both the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Enterprise Ireland has been to support geographic market diversification.<\/p>  <p>  Our contingency framework also contains clear actions on communications and diplomatic contacts.  In this regard, I will travel to Brussels next week for the European Council meeting where EU leaders will have a first opportunity to discuss the referendum result, to assess its implications and to begin to chart a way forward.  I intend to make a more detailed statement on Ireland's position in my pre-Council statement to the House after the conclusion of these questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100019#R02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1466520300,"counter":178,"content":"<p>It is important to again put on the record of the House the enormity of the potential consequences for jobs, trade, travel, tourism and the agrifood sector in this country.  Trade between here and the UK accounts for almost 400,000 direct jobs, and 43% of our exports go to the UK.  We know that the ESRI has reported that there could be an immediate reduction in trade of up to 20% if the Brexit vote to leave is carried.  Teagasc has also reported that there could be a huge reduction in the value of Irish agrifood exports, ranging from &euro;150 million to almost &euro;800 million.  This puts it into context.<\/p>  <p>  When I talk to people about this matter, such as people in the business or farming community or members of the general public, they feel that the Government does not have a handle on the plan we will deploy if the vote to leave passes.

Are we hoping against hope that it will not happen?<\/p><p>Can the Taoiseach give us any kind of reassurance on the contingency planning that has happened?

The campaign run by the Taoiseach and other political leaders was interrupted by the murder of Jo Cox, which we spoke about earlier, and I offer my condolences to her family and community.  The European Movement office tells us of a huge British community here in Ireland that should have been influenced a little bit more.  The Irish community in the UK could also have been influenced a little bit more.

Most opinion polls suggest that the vote to leave the EU remains very strong and that the two sides are almost evenly split.  I spent Saturday In Belfast taking part in Sinn F&eacute;in's day of action across the North calling for a remain vote.  The murder of Labour MP, Jo Cox, cast a shadow over this but the response from those I met was very positive.  Sinn F&eacute;in has real concerns about some aspects of the European Union, particularly the democratic deficit in the decision-making processes.  We want a more democratic and social European Union.  Nevertheless, to have one part of this island inside the European Union and the other outside will not be good for the island.  It is not in Ireland's interest to have border posts or trade barriers.  It is also very much the case that the British Government wants either to do away with the human rights elements of the Good Friday Agreement or not to implement equality protocols which are central to it.  They will find this much easier to do if they are not part of the EU.  I do not know any more than anyone else what the outcome of the vote will be but if it is to leave, the two-year divorce period for the British to negotiate their withdrawal would also be hugely destabilising.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, we received a confidential briefing from officials from the Taoiseach's Department on the Government's approach and preparations and I thank the Taoiseach for facilitating that.  It emphasised the huge amount of confusion and uncertainty that exists around any process of Brexit.  Others in the Chamber have a different view, but for those of us who even reluctantly want to see people remaining in the European Union, we should use this opportunity to express our support for the remain side in the referendum.  It is well known that the only Brexit that Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see is a Brexit from Ireland of the British Government.  I reiterate our strong support for a referendum on Irish unity and our appeal to the Government to support this as part of the Good Friday Agreement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100020#S00200","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1466520900,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I have two Deputies to call.

I am very concerned about the absence of contingency planning.  In the discussions I had with the Independents on the formation of Government, it was very clear to us that very little scenario planning in terms of the economy or the impact on agriculture had been undertaken by Government Departments.  There have been some academic papers published but there would appear to be a lot of prayer and hope that it goes the right way as opposed to any considered contingency planning.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the European Council meeting next week, there are two responses - one in the event of a \"Yes\" vote for Brexit and the second in the context of a \"No\" vote.  If there is a \"Yes\" vote, it is extremely important that we have a prepared position as a country going into that council meeting.  Cool heads should prevail.  In the aftermath of Lisbon, we had to move in very quickly to the Foreign Affairs Council to make sure that hotheads did not get their day which would have set everybody back.  Likewise, whatever the result, we need cool heads and a considered and reflective view by the European Union and by this Parliament.  If a decision to break with the EU is taken, we need calm and cool heads in the aftermath of that and planning and proper preparation of the best strategy for Ireland.  Ireland will face unique challenges as a member of the European Union and because of its historical special relationship with Britain in terms of the common travel area, trade and exports which have to be protected in any new scenario.  If the vote is \"No\", which I hope it is, and Britain remains, I would equally suggest that we should seize the moment at the European Council meeting and say to our European colleagues that this is a moment for reflection and a moment when real lessons have to be learned about how Europe is going about its business.  There is significant disconnect between the citizens of Europe and the European institutions.<\/p>  <p>  I have been pointing at this over quite a number of years and there has been a lot of work and research done on this.  There have been attempts in terms of the democratisation of the parliament to make it more connected.  It is extremely important that the debate in Britain fuels a wider debate across Europe on how we can reconnect the values, principles and ideals of the European Union with citizens on the ground - in other words, the idealism and energy that led to the post-war leaders, the people who saw that nationalist or independent, isolationist pursuits led to conflict, coming together in international partnerships to prevent world wars and horrific consequences.  In the bigger picture, Europe has succeeded in that respect.  There is a lot of talk about subsidiarity in terms of decision making, but it has not happened.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the hierarchy of decision making, Europe is still involved too much at the lower level of minutiae and detail on the ground which should be left to national parliaments and national Governments.  There is a lot of work to be done at the European Council meeting.  Irrespective of the outcome, but particularly if it is a \"No\" to Brexit and Britain remains in the European Union, which is what I believe would be in the best interest of Britain, Ireland, Europe and the world, we should use it as an opportunity for really serious reflection by all across Europe to make sure that the idealism of the original concept is brought back to centre stage of European politics. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100020#S00400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1466520900,"counter":183,"content":"<p>We in People Before Profit want absolutely nothing to do with some of the vile and racist forces that are campaigning for an exit from the European Union in Britain, some of whom have stoked up the sort of racist conditions and sentiment that took the life of Labour MP, Jo Cox.  We must all dissociate ourselves from that.  Having said that, I disagree with the consensus in the House that the way to deal with the virulent rise of racism, prejudice, islamophobia and the growth of far right forces in Europe is to stay in the European Union in the hope of reforming it.  Is it not the case that the European Union is the architect of its own crisis and that it has caused the problems that have now produced such widespread disaffection?  This is summed up by the comments by Jean-Claude Juncker in January 2015, when the Syriza government was first elected, that, \"To suggest that everything is going to change because there is a new government in Athens is to mistake dreams for reality... There can be no democratic choice against the European treaties.\"<\/p><p>Is the problem not fundamentally that the leaders of the European Union are saying democracy has gone out the window with the European Union and that that has been compounded with the disgusting racist fortress-Europe policy that has led to the deaths of thousands of people trying to get into Europe?  While Europe parades as a beacon of progress, in fact, its own racists policies <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>desperate people fleeing from Syria involves throwing them back to the Turkish Government, which is now shooting them.  Last week, Syrian refugees were shot.  Europe has signed an agreement with Turkey to allow that to happen and it is throwing those desperate people back to Turkey to allow it to shoot them.  Is it those misguided undemocratic fortress-Europe policies and austerity policies that have created the crisis that is now consuming us?  In that context, would we be better off supporting not Brexit but the left exit campaign of saying we want European internationalism - in fact, we want comprehensive internationalism that goes beyond the boundaries of Europe - if we are to undermine and defeat the dangerous forces of racism and the far right that the European Union itself has helped to stoke up?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100020#S00500","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466521500,"counter":185,"content":"<p>In light of the importance and the currency of the issue, the Taoiseach may take two or three minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100021#T00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1466521500,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Deputies Niall Collins, Martin, Adams and Boyd Barrett raised a number of important questions.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Collins, there is a &euro;60 billion trade across the Irish Sea every year and, obviously, as the Deputy pointed out, 400,000 jobs at stake here - 200,000 on this side and 200,000 in Britain.  These are matters of great concern to Irish exporters, many of whom export heavy equipment to Britain and through Britain to other countries.  They make the point that if the British electorate were to vote to leave, this would cause an imposition in terms of paperwork, customs or whatever which would lead to inefficiency, time wasting, a lack of competitiveness and probably a lack of jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Another point is that while people might reflect between our position and Northern Ireland, it actually would be not an Irish border from Dundalk to Derry but a European border because we would be a member of the European Union and Britain would want to withdraw from it, if it made a decision to do so.  Obviously, as has been pointed out, that would carry its own implications.  It would be a European border as distinct from an Irish border.  In respect of Deputy Adams's point, I take that on board.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin raised the question of contingency planning.  I do not want to set out a strategy here that the Government or the people in Ireland believe that this will be a negative vote and that the British people will vote to leave the European Union because one must wait and see what the answer will be.  However, it is important to state that voting takes place on Thursday and it goes on until 10 p.m. that night.  The counting of votes starts immediately.  By 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. on Friday, one should be in a position to get a prediction of what might happen here.  There are no official exit polls being taken, although I understand many of the trading houses and financial institutions have been closely monitoring the situation.  I suppose the movement of sterling in itself would be an indication of the way that they may be thinking.  The announcement will be made from Manchester of the overall result.  Suffice to say that we have been considering all of this and that from 5 a.m. on Friday, the contingency framework that Ireland would put in place here would be considered.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make it clear again that I hope that the British electorate votes in favour of remaining as a member of the European Union.  In the past 48 hours, I feel some sense of a different reflection about this vote from the British electorate and, as I say, I hope they vote to remain.  I can assure the Deputies and the party leaders that there is a full-scale contingency programme in place which I hope that we do not have to use.  That programme would deal with headline issues, such as the calling of a Government meeting, if that were deemed appropriate, and contact with other leaders in other cities in Europe.  However, as Deputy Martin rightly pointed out, there is a need here for level-headedness and a measured response.  If the vote were to be to leave, it would not mean that Britain is gone from the European Union on Friday.  There is still a two-year window there of negotiations and complex discussions.  In respect of our response to such a vote, it would be about the economy, trade, jobs and investment and about whether sterling would remain strong or whether it would collapse, and if so, for how long, what that would mean for Enterprise Ireland and for agencies dealing with small and medium-sized enterprises, and how they would support diversification into the market and beyond through Europe.  These are issues that, obviously, would be considered as part of any contingency plan, were such to kick-in.<\/p>  <p>  I agree completely with Deputy Martin on the following point.  If this vote is to stay, and I hope it is, there is a lesson here for Europe too.  One cannot have a situation where the President of the Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, was found to have put in place an infrastructural fund of &euro;400 billion for major projects across Europe and that countries would have the right to draw on that under certain conditions but have the imposition of particular conditions set by EUROSTAT, which is an independent entity, that would mean there would be restrictions on what countries could do, when one can borrow money at a negative or very low interest rate to provide services and facilities for people, such as housing.  Approval for a case in Britain has been withdrawn.  This does not help the situation.  I agree that not everything about the European Union is perfect and that this is an opportunity, if the people in Britain vote to stay, to reflect on the structure of Europe and on when the European Council makes political decisions, how they should be implemented in the interests of their citizens.  That is an issue about which I have already written to the President of the Commission and to the leaders, that others are now taking up and that will become an issue for reflection there.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett quoted from a document.  If I heard the Deputy correctly, I think he stated that there was no choice in respect of the European treaties.  The treaties are approved or not by the people in the different countries.  We had a number of referenda here where the people voted twice in order to have a deeper reflection on the issue, whether on the Nice treaty, the Lisbon treaty or whatever.<\/p>  <p>  On the Turkish deal for migration, the problem here, to be quite straight with Deputy Boyd Barrett, was how was one to deal with all the people smugglers who have inveigled people to pay serious sums to get on rubber rafts or rickety boats to attempt the crossing to Greece and inevitably end up in the water with many drowned.  The intention was that people who would arrive as illegal asylum seekers or refugees would go back to camps in Turkey funded by the European Union but be replaced by legitimate asylum seekers who had moved to Turkey under the refugee or asylum programme.  The intention genuinely was around how to deal with the people smugglers who have no care or interest in respect of the many thousands who have drowned in the Mediterranean.  That was what the issue was about.  I note Deputy Boyd Barrett disagrees with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100021#T00300","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1466521500,"counter":187,"content":"<p>They are now being shot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100021#T00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1466521500,"counter":188,"content":"<p>In that sense, the focus of Europe was on how one deals with this when they are coming from the other side.

I took the opportunity in my remarks to outline the Irish Government&rsquo;s position regarding the imminent UK referendum on European Union membership.  I outlined our particular perspective on the issue, including the importance of avoiding any hardening of the Border in whatever form.  Following my speech, I took part in a panel discussion on the issues raised.<\/p>  <p>  While at the university I met the vice chancellor, Mr. Paddy Nixon, and I also met a number of community and non-governmental organisation representatives attending the conference, including some of those currently involved with the \"Stronger In\" referendum campaign.  I also visited the newly opened premises of CPL Recruitment at a networking event attended by business representatives.  I also took the opportunity at that event to ensure that the Irish Government's position on the forthcoming referendum was understood.<\/p>  <p>  I attended the 26th summit of the British-Irish Council on 17 June, hosted by the Scottish Government in Glasgow.  The heads of delegation were welcomed by First Minister Sturgeon on behalf of the Scottish Government.  She commenced the meeting with a minute's silence to mark the untimely death of Ms Jo Cox, MP.  The council reflected on priorities for member administrations and discussed how the council could continue to promote co-operation on issues of common concern.  The council also noted that there might be scope for new areas of co-operation based on emerging government and member administration priorities across these islands, many of which have had elections in recent times.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of current issues, the forthcoming UK EU referendum was discussed.  I clearly set out the Irish Government position and our programme of outreach to Irish citizens in Britain who have a vote.  The Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, met counterparts with particular responsibility for unpaid carers in advance of the summit to consider a detailed paper prepared by the council&rsquo;s social inclusion work sector.  The discussion was then taken forward by heads of administration, where the council agreed that carers are an integral and vital part of society, caring for family, friends and neighbours affected by physical or mental illness, disability, frailty or substance misuse.  It was agreed that further sharing of research and good practice in this important area will be pursued by member administrations.<\/p>  <p>  The Scottish Government updated the council on the work done in advance of the summit to take forward work being undertaken to review the operation of the council.  It also noted the secretariat's end of year report and agreed a new council communications plan for 2016 to 2018.  The council also approved publication of the British-Irish Council annual report for 2015, and the next British-Irish Council summit is scheduled for Wales in November 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100022#U00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1466522100,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I welcome very much the Taoiseach's visit to Belfast.  It is really important that the Taoiseach and other Ministers visit the North often and regularly and that they meet people in all the sectors.  During the Belfast visit, the Taoiseach went to the new Belfast office of CPL Recruitment and spoke to business leaders, among others, about the importance of encouraging economic growth on both sides of the Border.  This is a very important area of potential for people, no matter what part of Ireland in which we live.  I will concentrate, if I may, on that issue.<\/p>  <p>  There are significant similarities between the two economies on the island and all of us, including Unionists, accept that we work best when we co-operate.  They use the phrase, \"to our mutual advantage\".  There are also differences, largely as a consequence of partition, which mean we have two different currencies, tax systems and laws impacting on business.  There is a need to stimulate the economies of both parts of the island, which requires greater co-operation between the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government here.  In this respect, the work of the North-South Ministerial Council is of particular importance.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the last meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council was postponed.  Will the Taoiseach confirm when the next meeting will take place?  It was also agreed in December at a plenary session that a report would be prepared for the Narrow Water bridge project, to which the Acting Chairman has given his support.  The project will significantly enhance business and tourism opportunities between Louth, south Down and south Armagh, as well as the wider Border region.  Last week I visited the site of the proposed Narrow Water bridge with the Narrow Water Bridge Community Network, including Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane, MLA, Councillor John Loughran and the Executive finance Minister, Mr. M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Muilleoir.  I know the Taoiseach is aware there is very strong support for this on both sides of the Border and from all shades of political opinion.  It is across the Border and across communities.  It is also included in the Irish Government's capital investment plan for 2016 to 2021 and the Oireachtas committee for jobs, enterprise and innovation recently reported that the bridge is essential to the economic development of the region.  Will the Taoiseach confirm if the report for the North-South Ministerial Council has been completed?  Will it be published after the council meeting?<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach give some indication of the work that has been done on the issue of target investment in cross-Border economic infrastructure agreed in the Fresh Start agreement?  I will be as brief as possible but these include the M5, which will open the north west, including Donegal; the Ulster Canal project; and the north-west gateway.  Has there been any progress on sourcing further investment either from the European Union or the private sector for all-island infrastructural projects that would be to the mutual benefit of both economies on the island?  Is &eacute; sin an m&eacute;id.<\/p>  <p>  N&iacute; aonta&iacute;m leo si&uacute;d a mhol gur cheart na ceisteanna seo a ghlacadh le ch&eacute;ile.

Will the Taoiseach comment on the tenor of the debate?  It has, rightly, come in for widespread criticism.  It does not surprise me, given that one side is led by the leadership faction in the Conservative Party and the other side is led by the opposition faction in the Conservative Party, with the support of the UK Independence Party.  Disgracefully, we have seen finger pointing and blame laid at the feet of immigrants; the most disgusting example is Nigel Farage's UKIP \"Breaking Point\" billboard.  Both sides have framed the debate in such a way that they each speak of immigration and immigrants as though that were a problem.<\/p>  <p>  Many community and trade union activists and socialists are campaigning for an exit, but for very different reasons to those I outlined earlier.  Their motivation is to defend the welfare State and the National Health Service from the neoliberal drive being spearheaded by the EU, and to stand up against the race to the bottom in terms of wages and conditions in employment being promoted by the European Union elite.  I share the disappointment of those activists that the Labour leader, Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, has not pitched in on their side as had he done so the debate would have been decisively won for a \"leave\" position and immigration would be pushed back and less of an issue.  The \"leave\" side would win, first and foremost, on the basis of progressive politics.  Additionally, the Tory Government would be facing a shattering defeat and the likelihood of being driven from office.

Deputy Adams is aware there is &euro;3 billion on the table for peace and reconciliation and cross-Border activities for communities, etc.<\/p><p>No date has yet been fixed for the next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is going there in the next two weeks and I expect the date will be announced then.  That meeting will be hosted in Dublin, as the Deputy knows.  In regard to the infrastructure commitments under the Fresh Start agreement, the Irish Government reaffirmed in this agreement its existing commitment to providing<font color=\"#FF0000\"><\/font>&pound;50 million for the A5 western transport corridor serving the north west.  A further &pound;25 million was committed to ensure that phase one of the project can commence as soon as the necessary planning issues have been resolved by the Northern Ireland authorities.  The Government will provide this money in three tranches of &pound;25 million in 2017, 2018 and 2019.  The Government and the Northern Ireland Executive have agreed that construction on the first section of the A5 will commence in 2017, with a view to completion in 2019.  The first section will be the route between Newbuildings outside Derry to north of Strabane.<br\/><br\/>In respect of the Narrow Water bridge, the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed to undertake a review of the project, with a view to identifying options for its future development for consideration by the North-South Ministerial Council at its next meeting.  Initial discussions by a group of officials, North and South, took place in December.  Further meetings have taken place.  A report will be provided to the next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council.  In addition, officials from North and South met with people in Newry in April with a view to feeding local proposals into the review of the project.  I assure Deputy Adams that the Government remains committed to the concept of the Narrow Water bridge, which has the potential to create jobs on either side, but also to provide a real stimulus to both economies in terms of tourism and the opportunities that exist in that respect.<br\/><br\/>In respect of the Ulster Canal, the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed to undertake a review with a view to looking at how this might progress.  It is to be considered, again, by the North-South Ministerial Council at its meeting in Dublin.  The Government will continue to explore the development of further cross-Border greenways and blueways, leisure routes, including the Ulster Canal as it is a matter of considerable interest to us.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the north-west gateway, the Government provided &euro;2.5 million to support this initiative, which will be complemented by matching funding from the Executive in the North.  A report on the north-west gateway will also be provided at the next meeting.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Barry raised the question of the tenor of the debate.  At the debate of the British-Irish Council in Glasgow, people from Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man were very concerned that the British electorate would vote to leave the European Union, because this would create real difficulties for them as small economic entities and islands.  The debate in general was derailed in respect of the issues that were really at stake.  All 27 members of the European Council, apart from Britain, agreed on a number of issues to deal with the question of in-work benefits, which was and is an issue for people in Britain in respect of immigrants.  For years and years, Irish people who went to Britain began to work, paid their stamp and got their contribution.  It was clocked up for them in Newcastle and when people reached pension age or came back to Ireland before then, they were able to avail of that element of contribution, added to what they had from Ireland, to draw a pension or a proportion of the pension under a bilateral agreement.  However, in lower-paid jobs, immigrants were entitled to extra benefits from day one, which was a cause for concern among British people.  It was conceded by the European Council that this matter could be tapered over a period of four years.  Another question related to child benefit being paid at higher British rates than applied in many of the former eastern bloc countries, where children were not living in Britain but were living in their home country.  This issue was also raised in this House on many occasions.<br\/><br\/>On the question of ever-closer union, I agree.  I might not agree with everything that Deputy Barry and I have to talk about, but the debate in Britain was derailed.  It became very personal, very vindictive and very inter-party.  The debate should have focused on issues about the kind of Europe we want, who should constitute that, the potential of a market of 500 million and the potential for political decisions to be followed through to the benefit of the peoples of the 28 countries.  I hope when people vote on Thursday that the decision will be to stay.  I have seen a strong element of finger-pointing in some social media and in some of the print and spoken media.  Until the people actually vote, their decision is not counted.  I hope that by 5 a.m. we will have a pretty clear statement as to what they have decided on Thursday, 23 June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100022#U00900","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466522700,"counter":205,"content":"<p>In view of the fact that there is only short of three minutes left on this section, I propose to allow Deputies Adams and Murphy to conclude the debate.

I want to come back on the issue that was raised earlier regarding carers.  The social inclusion sector of the British-Irish Council had prepared a detailed paper on carers, which was supposed to have been published on the council's website, but it has not appeared on that website so far.  Could the Taoiseach either publish it or consider publishing it?  It is Carers' Week, which is why the British-Irish Council discussed this matter.  From our own experience in this State, the treatment of carers leaves much to be desired.  Did the Government make any commitments to improving the situation here at the council meeting?  For example, will it provide additional resources to ensure that waiting times for processing applications or appeals will be reduced?

Does the Taoiseach not agree at all that a Brexit vote could open up a significant question about what kind of Europe we have?  Does he not agree that it could put into sharp relief the fundamentally undemocratic and antidemocratic nature of the European Union, could provoke a crisis for the Tory Government in Britain and could be an opening to the kind of discussion we need to have about building the kind of Europe that does not just operate for the bankers, the bondholders and big business?  That is our concrete experience over the course of the crisis, as opposed to the abstract social Europe which we do not have but which people talk about.

Therefore, those who were representing the different areas gave an indication of the priorities of the new administrations and where they saw developments occurring.  In our case, we made the point that Government wanted to learn lessons and understands that many people in this country are still very much challenged in terms of the economic situation.  We are now trying to use the benefits of a strengthening economy to deal with social injustice, unfairness and disadvantage, as we have talked about in terms of inner cities and the requirement for infrastructure raised by Deputy Howlin in terms of capital investment.  These are things that improve the quality of people's lives and make the country a stronger and a better place.  At the meeting, I pointed out the priorities as we see them for the time ahead.  Then there was a discussion about carers, the need for support and protection of carers and of those for whom they care and the question of mental health and the difficulties that are experienced in many places and across all ages in this respect.<\/p><p>The meeting took place against the background of a minute's silence in respect of the late Jo Cox, and this tempered it.<\/p> <p> In answer to Deputy Paul Murphy's question, we will have to wait and see what is the outcome of the Brexit vote.

The outcome of the UK referendum will, of course, determine the focus of the meeting.  The current migration situation will also be discussed, as will a range of economic issues.  There will also be a discussion on some foreign and security policy issues which the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, will address in his closing remarks.<\/p><p>On Thursday, Britain will vote on whether to remain in or to leave the European Union.  Next week's meeting will provide a first opportunity for collective discussion of the referendum result and its implications.  Clearly the substance and significance of this discussion will depend on which way the vote has gone.  This has been a hard fought campaign on both sides.  The last few days have been overshadowed by the murder of Jo Cox last week.  I was in the UK when this happened and I would like, once again, to extend my sincere condolences to her family, friends and colleagues.  She was an exemplary public representative who lost her life doing one of the most important things all of us in this House do, namely, serving our constituencies.<\/p><p>From the outset of the EU negotiation process, Ireland committed to playing a supportive and constructive role.  In the same spirit, members of the Government have visited Britain to engage with Irish communities there, to encourage them to vote and to explain our perspective on the issues.  There have also been several visits to Northern Ireland, for which the stakes are particularly high.  I thank all Deputies, including those from the Opposition, who have involved themselves in this effort.  It is my hope, of course, that we will continue our EU journey with the United Kingdom, a journey that we began together over 40 years ago.<\/p><p>Whatever the outcome, however, we are ready.  In the event of a vote to remain, the next steps are relatively straightforward.  The agreement reached in February would take immediate effect and its various elements would be implemented.  A framework has been developed on a whole-of-Government basis to identify contingencies that could arise in the event of a vote to leave.  This would provide the basis for the intensive work which would be required over a lengthy period across very many sectors.  We would work with our EU partners and with the UK to achieve outcomes which protect Irish interests, including co-operation between North and South, as far as possible.<\/p><p>Were there to be a vote to leave, the European Union and the UK would be entering into a very different area indeed.  It would very probably take some time for the path forward to become clear.  An orderly and constructive process would be critical but, in all circumstances, Ireland will remain a committed member of the European Union.  As a competitive, diversified and global economy, we value our access to a single market of over 500 million people and the benefits our exporters derive from EU trade agreements with other countries.  More broadly, we greatly value being part of a Union with other like-minded democracies which share our values and interests.<\/p><p>The migrant and refugee situation rightly remains an issue of the highest priority.  At next week's meeting there will be another detailed discussion.  The EU has developed a range of measures, including resettlement and relocation measures, an EU-Africa fund and an EU-Turkish refugee facility.  There has been good progress on the establishment of a European coast and border guard, and a package of other measures agreed with Turkey.  Many of these measures are having a positive impact.  Reports indicate that the numbers crossing the Aegean Sea, for example, have reduced very substantially since the EU-Turkey deal was agreed in March and this is to be welcomed.  However, the route from Libya to Italy remains very perilous. Implementation of some of the measures has, for a variety of reasons, been far too slow.  A significant focus of next week's discussion, therefore, will be on implementation and there will be a major focus on the external dimension of the crisis.<\/p><p>The Commission's proposed migration partnership framework aims at ensuring coherence between EU migration policy and its external and development policies.  Overall, we welcome the framework and its focus on working even more closely with countries of origin and transit, as well as countries hosting large numbers of displaced people, and we support its intention to build on existing policies in this area.  Ireland continues to make its own contribution.<\/p><p>In September 2015, the Government decided to take up to 4,000 persons in need of international protection.  There has been good progress on the resettlement of refugees from outside the Union and we are on course to meet our target of 520 by the end of this year.  On relocation, progress has been slow, as it has been for all partners, for a variety of reasons outside of our control.  Thankfully, implementation here is at last beginning to speed up.  Today, I have been advised by officials that the next group of 28 individuals to arrive under this framework is <i>en route<\/i>from Greece.  We wish them well on their journey and look forward to welcoming them to our shores.  A further group of 40 individuals is expected to arrive next month.<\/p><p>In terms of humanitarian assistance, Ireland has provided over &euro;42 million in response to the Syria crisis since 2011, and has pledged a further &euro;20 million in 2016.  Last year, 8,592 men, women and children were rescued thanks to the efforts of our naval vessels in the Mediterranean.  The <i>LE R&oacute;is&iacute;n<\/i>has been on search and rescue missions from 12 May of this year and has rescued 893 people to date.  We are very proud of the efforts of her crew and I wish them well for the rest of their mission.<\/p><p>The June European Council will address a number of economic issues under the broad heading of jobs, growth and competitiveness.  One of these is the European semester and, in particular, the country-specific recommendations issued by the Commission in May.  Broadly speaking, Ireland accepts our three recommendations, which cover fiscal policies, jobless households and child care and non-performing loans.  We are also broadly supportive of the progress made in streamlining the European semester process.<\/p><p>The European Council will also discuss the Single Market.  The Commission strategy presented last October was a crucial initiative and was given a strong endorsement by the December European Council.  We must renew EU momentum as a crucial driver of jobs, growth and competitiveness.  This includes unlocking the full potential of the digital single market, which is the responsibility of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dara Murphy.  We want to press ahead with a high level of ambition, agreeing concrete timelines and delivering results, with the European Council continuing to take an overview of progress.  The European Council will also review progress on the European fund for strategic investments.  It appears to have had a positive impact but there is a sense that more can be done.  All obstacles to productive investment in the economy must be tackled.<\/p><p>Turning to deepening economic and monetary union, the European Council will look at progress on initial proposals made by the Commission last year, pending the publication of longer-term proposals next year.  Our overall position on EMU remains clear.  The focus needs to be on full and effective implementation of the wide range of reforms that have already been agreed over recent years.  There will be an update on the Union's efforts to combat tax avoidance.  Just overnight, Finance Ministers agreed an anti-tax avoidance directive.  Ireland has been to the forefront of the implementation of OECD recommendations on base erosion and profit shifting and we have supported the final compromise reached on this directive on the basis that it was consistent with the OECD BEPS report and should respect member state sovereignty on tax issues.  Finally, there will be further consideration of the difficult situation in the dairy and pigmeat sectors and Ireland will support efforts by the Commission to alleviate the serious problems faced by many farmers.<\/p><p>The June European Council will, therefore, address a number of issues of great importance.  Let us hope it will not have to spend too much time on the outcome of the UK referendum.  I will of course make a statement to the House following the meeting.  I look forward to hearing from Deputies and I will keep leaders updated as we go through Thursday and early Friday morning if there is anything about which they should know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100024#W00400","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1466523300,"counter":213,"content":"<p>It is important to express our solidarity with the family, community and political colleagues of Jo Cox.

The British Labour Party has lost a rising star who was passionate about politics and about issues outside purely party politics throughout her short life.  She was a committed supporter of the European Union and an internationalist who had a deep commitment to people all over the world, particularly refugees from Syria and the Middle East.<\/p><p>While the person who murdered her appears to have been acting alone, the need for us to stand up and defend the principles for which she stood is just as strong.  We must also remember that there is always a potential cost when one attacks and stigmatises public representatives as a group.  The heightened and extreme rhetoric that often accompanies advocacy in a serious referendum can also create an atmosphere in which people on the margins become more extreme.<\/p> <p> The vote this week is one of the most important referendums ever held, yet it is one in which we will have no voice.  It has the potential to ensure that European democracies move forward in constructive co-operation or it could set off a vicious circle of damaging competition and empower extreme nationalism.  It really is as important as that.  As a mark of respect for the late Jo Cox and the decision of the two sides to suspend campaigning, I cancelled a speech and door-to-door canvass scheduled last week in Belfast.  I would like to reiterate points that I intended making then and that I have made in a series of speeches and statements in recent years.  In addition, my party made it clear in its election manifesto that Ireland has a direct interest in the outcome of this referendum.  We must be clear on how we see the vote and on how we will react to the outcome.<\/p> <p> The stakes for progress on this island and between these islands are huge.  In the final days, everyone who has a vote should take the time to look at the fundamental issues involved and where the weight of evidence is.  Quite incredibly, one of the main leaders of the \"Leave\" campaign has said that experts should be ignored.  Michael Gove, Lord Chancellor and a long-acclaimed Tory intellectual, stated that the British people \"have had enough of experts.\"  Yes, each person has to make up his or her own mind, but to say that evidence and expertise are irrelevant is breathtakingly cynical.  The simple fact is that a vote to leave the European Union would be bad for this island, bad for the United Kingdom, bad for the democratic countries of Europe and, as all international bodies have said, bad for the wider world.  There is no upside to a \"Leave\" vote other than for the Little Englanders who think they can rescind the past 44 years and return to some illusory past idyll.<\/p> <p> For all of its many flaws, the European Union has enabled a model of progress among nations that is unprecedented in world history.  People can take this for granted if they like, but no one has produced any credible alternative way in which the immense violence and destruction of the world wars could have been overcome.  The leaders of the last century who committed us to working together with mutually agreed rules and enforcement knew what they were doing.  They saw how everybody standing alone would always end badly.  This was not just about leaders on the continent.  Look at the words of British and Irish leaders.  Look at the words of Se&aacute;n Lemass, who fought in the GPO in 1916, on how nations on the periphery could only promote their interests and generate prosperity through participation in a rules-based and strong European organisation.<\/p> <p> One of the things most often missed about why the European Union exists is that it is a construction of a deeply patriotic generation.  It was people who had fought and risked everything for the flags of their countries that created and built the European Union.  The only people in our countries who opposed membership were those committed to an extreme ideological position.  The phenomenon of countries jealously protecting every element of sovereignty, sharing nothing and rejecting international legal commitments is the very thing that caused the catastrophic conflicts of the 20th century.  The patriotic generation knew this and set out a different course, and they were vindicated in every way.<\/p> <p> This referendum is the logical outcome of 40 years of anti-European rhetoric from one group.  They have been relentless in attacking the union and claiming that it is responsible for every evil in the world.  They have caricatured and hyped every proposal.  They have used vivid language and worked tirelessly to set up the fundamentally false idea that one can be patriotic or one can be European but one cannot be both.  However, what they seem incapable of is addressing how 40 years of scare stories and predictions of the end of the nation state have been false.  Go into any supermarket in Belfast, Brighton or Brussels and one will find that the bananas still have a bend in them and one is still free to choose the basic direction of one's country.  The \"Project Fear\" being run by the \"Leave\" campaign and certain proprietors of London newspapers has involved talking about a tidal wave of foreigners about to land and fictional piles of money waiting to be repatriated and describing the EU as implementing Hitler&rsquo;s vision.  Without doubt, it is the most cynical and deceptive campaign of our times.  Of course, they scream every time the economic damage of a \"Leave\" vote is pointed out.<\/p> <p> I hope people will take the time to look at the positive case for a \"Remain\" vote in the next few days, because it is overwhelming.  In terms of economics, the simple and undeniable fact is that to have high employment and living standards we have to trade.  This is especially true for everyone living on an island on the edge of a continent.  We need guaranteed and fair access to trade.  This requires common rules so that companies cannot be artificially excluded and it requires a legal process where their rights can be enforced.  Outside the European Union, this right to trade is much weaker and enforcement almost non-existent.<\/p> <p> The investment case for being in the European Union is equally strong.  Every major international company has developed a base within the European Union.  European Union membership is an absolute requirement for many major job creation decisions.  So far not a single major investor has said it would increase investment if the vote is to leave, while many have said the exact opposite.<\/p> <p> The case for workers&rsquo; rights is unanswerable as well.  Many of the rules which most annoy the \"Leave\" campaigners involve basic protections for workers.  They prevent a race to the bottom and insist that core standards are protected for all.  Nearly all modern protections for women in the workplace have their origins in European legislation.  Europe is about trying to create high-wage jobs with decent standards.  Being outside the EU pushes the pressure the other way.<\/p> <p> In respect of the economy of this island, there is no possible positive result for a \"Leave\" vote.  It offers at the very least enormous risk and most likely a direct, severe and permanent setback.  Trade across the Border and outside the island will suffer.  Jobs will suffer and pressures on wages will all be downwards.  A tough period fiscally could well become an emergency if the predicted impacts on the Westminster budget happen.  One is free to say this does not matter, but one is not free to say it cannot happen.<\/p> <p> Whatever happens, we must be clear that Ireland will under no circumstance follow a \"Leave\" vote.  The European Union is now and will continue to be a fundamental part of our identity and policies.  We believe the two jurisdictions on this island are stronger working together in the European Union, but we will not sign up to the economically, socially and politically destructive anti-European Union agenda of the English anti-Europeans.<\/p> <p> We should note the strong leadership of the Scottish First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, in the \"Remain\" campaign and the broad and diverse coalition of groups and parties campaigning on this side.  It is also welcome that Sinn F&eacute;in has reversed its policy of opposing the EU in every vote taken in the past 44 years and that it has joined the SDLP, the Alliance Party and others in Northern Ireland on the \"Remain\" side.  As for the political case for membership, if one wants to have any influence whatsoever, there is no alternative to working closely with others.  Standing alone in glorious isolation, hoping to occasionally be allowed into a room where fundamental issues are discussed is a sure-fire way of being marginalised as a country.<\/p> <p> Ultimately, the \"Leave\" case demands that one sees the European Union as a threat to one's identity.  Whatever one's personal identity is, they claim that the EU is a threat to it.  As I have stated, the EU is actually the direct project of a patriotic generation which wanted to secure the future for their countries and identities and end the threat of extreme nationalism.  On an even more basic level, the fact is that no one else and no institution decides one's identity.  One decides it one's self, in one's family, community and wider society.  The issue is how we find ways of respecting each other's identities - that is, how we end the cycle of seeking supremacy over the identity of others.<\/p> <p> A rules-based organisation, founded on co-operation and mutual respect, is the only way of achieving this in the modern world.  Each country retains the fundamental ability to decide on its own successes and failures.  We still make mistakes at national level and we can also spark great progress.  Our future remains in our own hands.  The EU is about opening up new possibilities to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100024#W00500","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466523900,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100025#X00200","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1466523900,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I will just conclude, if I may.<\/p>  <p>  A vote for \"Remain\" is a vote for a positive vision of the future.

On Thursday, a crucial vote will take place on whether the North and Britain will remain in or leave the European Union.  A vote to leave, a so-called Brexit, would have big implications for the island of Ireland and for our two economies.  It would lead to the reintroduction of some form of border and customs controls.  Partition creates enough problems already without the need for the reintroduction of checkpoints and what some people have called a hard border.<\/p><p>In my constituency of Louth, partition creates serious difficulties for business development, investment, farmers, cross-Border shoppers and for communities who live on either side of the Border.  The Brexit debate has focused attention on these issues and I call on the Government and the other parties to keep that focus beyond the Brexit vote.  It is no coincidence that the Border region suffers most from disadvantage, high levels of unemployment and low investment and much more could be done to reverse this situation.<\/p><p>We know that more than &euro;1.2 billion is traded each week in goods and services between this island and Britain.  Much of that is agricultural produce and there is great potential in this sector.  However, farmers are currently facing huge difficulties.  Many farmers will find their livelihoods at risk if Brexit is the outcome of the debate and this referendum.  It would also mean an end to vital rural development funding, structural funds and PEACE II funding.  All of these funds are vital for small and medium sized businesses, community regeneration schemes and community groups.  I was at a conference on the Border recently organised by Sinn F&eacute;in and attended by people from south Armagh, south Down and north Louth where many of these issues were debated thoroughly.<\/p><p>I have already made the point that Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see a Brexit from Ireland.  However, in the meantime we also want to see an all-Ireland approach to the European Union and, unlike Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, we remain very critical of many aspects of the EU and in particular the profound lack of democracy at its core.  We want to see a social Europe, a Europe of equals, in which citizens, assemblies and parliaments have a greater say in formulating policy.  It is possible.  We want to see a European Union where the rights of citizens and member states are respected on the basis of equality.<\/p><p>The Council meeting next week will also provide political leaders with the opportunity to consider the outcome of the referendum, whatever it may be, and to determine how the EU should respond.  I look forward to a debate in this House next week also.<\/p><p>Yesterday was World Refugee Day and the United Nations has released data which shows the number of people displaced by conflict is at the highest level since records began.  The UN records estimate that 65.3 million people are either refugees, asylum seekers or internally displaced at the end of 2015.  Despite the Government&rsquo;s pledge in September 2015 to take in 4,000 refugees, so far I understand only one Syrian family has been resettled in the State under the EU&rsquo;s relocation programme.  If this is true then it is unacceptable.  In the face of such an unparalleled humanitarian crisis the Government needs to be doing more to ensure refugees have safe and legal routes to relocate in the State.<\/p><p>I join with the Taoiseach in commending the crew of the<i>LE R&oacute;is&iacute;n<\/i>for their valiant work in rescuing people who are in danger on the Mediterranean Sea.  However, despite the efforts of these crews, according to the UN over 10,000 people have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea since 2014.  Consider the figure of 10,000 people which is the size of a town and these include children and women.  Some 2,814 people have drowned this year.  That is the size of the crisis.  When I hear people talking about the virtues of the EU and I see it against the backdrop of this situation it is very heart wrenching especially when we think of what our own Nation went through with regard to coffin ships and all that went with that.  I note that Doctors Without Borders has announced it will no longer accept funds from the EU in protest at the EU's shameful policies on the refugee crisis, particularly the deal with Turkey.<\/p><p>I conclude by calling on the Taoiseach to raise once again the issue of Ibrahim Halawa.  He is the only EU citizen who is currently facing a trial such as that facing him in Egypt.  I wrote to the Taoiseach a few weeks ago on this issue.  Ibrahim should be at home with his family and friends.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could confirm that he will raise Ibrahim's case at the European Council meeting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100026#Y01600","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1466524500,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Taoiseach, the European Commission is expected to put forward a proposal in early July declaring the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA as an EU-only deal.  This means that the agreement, which will have serious ramifications for every EU member state, will only need to be passed by a qualified majority in the European Council and a simple majority in the European Parliament to be ratified.  This approach is an attack on democracy and undermines the sovereignty of member states.  It is an attempt to erode environmental, agricultural and labour standards in the EU without its citizens having any real say on the issue.<\/p>  <p>  The legal advice commissioned by Sinn F&eacute;in states that any implementation of CETA, which includes an investor state court, will necessitate the holding of a referendum.  Has the Taoiseach discussed this with the Attorney General and when does the Taoiseach envisage that this referendum will be held?  Perhaps the Taoiseach could clarify if Ireland will argue that CETA will be an agreement of mixed competence.  This would mean it will have to be ratified by national parliaments and in some countries by local parliaments.  The European Court of Justice has yet to give its legal opinion on the nature of a free trade agreement with Singapore, which will not be expected before 2017.  Surely it makes even more sense for the European Commission to make its decision on what type of agreement is being sought by CETA, which potentially is a groundbreaking agreement, after the court's judgment.  I ask that the Taoiseach follows through on this logic, acts on behalf of the Irish people at the European Council meeting and demands that CETA is not, as expected, provisionally applied.  This would be a logical position.<\/p>  <p>  I will now turn to Apple.  We have been told that the Apple tax case is due in early July.  If the case goes the same way as recent cases involving Luxembourg, for example, then the State could be in line for a financial windfall.  Tax would be due that should have been paid to the Irish Exchequer.  Am I correct in saying that this Government, like the last one, insists that it will appeal any decision that finds that State aid was granted illegally?  This is a bizarre approach and anybody who is listening at home might feel the same way given that the State could expect a financial return as high as &euro;16 billion.  Last week we had the farce of this Parliament, at the Government&rsquo;s behest, objecting to EU moves to create greater tax transparency and now we have the Government saying that Apple&rsquo;s legitimate tax should not be repaid to the Irish people if the European Commission finds for that.  If the Commission says that Ireland is due tax back then we should take it.  That would be the view shared by most people, particularly those who have been left with the financial burden of the bailout of banks, investors and speculators.  That approach would also be supported by most taxpayers.  Any other response is simply unacceptable especially when the State is seeing a lack of investment as was discussed in the House this morning.<\/p><p>If we want to reinvest we could consider other areas which have been favourable to Apple and its staff, such as water, health services, broadband, housing and transport.  There are many ways we can put this money back into the Irish economy, supporting many of these multinationals operating in Ireland whose staff are located here.<\/p> <p> The European Council will discuss EU-NATO co-operation ahead of the NATO summit in Warsaw on 8 and 9 July 2016.  This is against a backdrop of NATO&rsquo;s war games in Eastern Europe, which are at their most intense since the end of the Cold War.  The further militarisation of the EU and its gradual integration into NATO are ongoing, but many of us on the left would say NATO is a Cold War relic that needs to be decommissioned, instead of aggressively growing and encouraging more spending on weapons.  We need to examine this area of greater integration between the EU and NATO.  NATO needs to be stood down, decommissioned and consigned to the dustbin of history.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100026#Y01700","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466525100,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I am conscious that this debate is taking place in the shadow of the murder of Jo Cox, MP, last week, as she was one of those who had argued for a vote for Britain to remain in the EU in this week's referendum.<\/p><p>The European Union was founded in the aftermath of two dreadful world wars and a period of fascism which saw many millions of people killed.  The aim was to bring Europeans together to provide not just common markets but also a framework for prosperity and growth that would enable ordinary people in all European countries to live well and be employed and allow their children to get a decent education and progress.  Countries would focus on having good primary social services, whether in health or education, alongside economies that would thrive and include public and private sectors.  <\/p><p>What we have seen, and what faces the Taoiseach and his fellow members of the European People's Party, is a slow but steady drift of that broad European ideal to the right in several European countries in very difficult economic circumstances, the most scandalous and difficult of which is the widespread unemployment of young people.  Many of those countries are prosperous enough on paper and some, like ours, are either in recovery or still in the depths of economic crashes and difficulties.  It is understandable that people in many European countries feel that things they or their parents took for granted - constant and continuous incremental improvements in their lifestyle - are put under threat by changes that appear to come from a very remote location, Brussels, and from a leadership that is quite remote from most people, including those in their home countries.  It is difficult to convey to anyone who goes to Europe as a Commissioner, as many from here have, that it does not reach citizens and there is a need for a profound change of style in respect of the European leadership.  We have had so many and such frequent referendums in this country on major European changes that we are politically used to having to make the case, explain the advantages and likely disadvantages and help people weigh in the balance how they wish to cast their vote.  I hope a majority of citizens in the UK, including people of Irish extraction who may be voting this week, will vote to stay.  For many, given the difficulties they have experienced, it is a difficult choice and they feel threatened.<\/p><p>What is the Irish Government&rsquo;s plan B if the vote does not go as the majority of parties here have urged?  It will certainly cause a degree of shock and give rise to change.  While I know the Government has been active and I asked the Taoiseach some time ago to have debates here on Brexit, I wonder whether there is a plan B.<\/p><p>I mention the murder of Jo Cox because there has been a development in politics of a language of hate as opposed to a language of argument.  Everyone understands that politics involves argument, discussion, making choices and reaching decisions in everybody&rsquo;s best interests.  On the extreme right, however, no more than on the extreme left, there is a language of hate which is corroding most of our democracies and inhibiting good discussion that would help us reach better decisions.  I have spoken about the spaces on social media which have sought, for instance, to demonise women, in particular, from a wide range of parties who are involved in politics.  I know from extensive studies carried out by <i>The Guardian<\/i>under the campaign entitled The Web We Want that approximately 80% of hate posts are directed against female parliamentarians and approximately 20% against male parliamentarians.  If there is an opportunity to discuss this at Council level, it is important that we, as people involved in politics, think about how we might press the pause button on hate speech and vilification, which many - including, unfortunately, some in Ireland and indeed some who have been in the D&aacute;il - resort to, rather than reasoned argument, explanation or persuasion.  Argument can be very robust, but when we look back at the 1930s in Europe and the writers of that period and consider what gave rise to fascism, we see that much of what was said was to do with allowing a tone of hatred and vilification come to dominate public discourse.  In that case, all of the ills of the world, particularly in Germany, were identified as originating with people who were Jewish and the campaign of vilification and hatred at that time was towards Jewish people.  What will happen in respect of Europe this week is very important.  Whatever happens, whether it is a narrow win or a loss, the European Union will be changed forever.<\/p><p>Given that we are, in many ways, Britain's closest neighbour and have extremely close family ties, I would like to suggest to the Taoiseach that perhaps he should use the result, whatever it is, as an opportunity to have a discussion about where Europe is at now.  He should focus in particular on whether Europe is an entity that represents the aspirations of ordinary citizens or has been captured by people who are simply interested in business.<\/p> <p> Business has its place and is very important.  Foreign direct investment has been the keystone of the recovery of the Irish economy.  In fact, what distinguished Ireland from other economies during our recent difficulties was the fact that we continued to have a very active foreign direct investment programme into Ireland.  In many ways, it kept the Irish economy going, helped to improve it and enabled it to recover during the most difficult period. <\/p> <p> There needs to be a discussion because if the European Union put forward further referendum proposals to this country, based on some of the ideals that have been put forward over the past few years in terms of ever-closer union, I am genuinely not sure that people in Ireland would accept any of that.  Those of us who support the European Union, in particular women, are conscious of the fact that in a conservative society, as Ireland was in the 1970s, the ideas of the European Union, such as those relating to the equality and rights of women and workers, were an absolute breath of fresh air and were not deliverable at that time in an Irish context.  The European Council should pause for reflection.<\/p> <p> Europe has the resources to address the refugee crisis.  In the middle of the crisis, Angela Merkel chose to invite people to Germany and said in a very trenchant way that Germany could deal with the people coming in.  It is always difficult for people anywhere to have new people integrate among them but Angela Merkel is very clear-headed about that.<\/p> <p> There have been scenes on the borders of Europe which are not acceptable.  We have not seen such scenes since the height of the Second World War.  We need to ensure that we play our part.  When in government, I made a commitment that we would accept up to 4,500 asylum seekers and refugees and I regret to say that still has not been implemented.  I would like the Taoiseach to tell us when he envisages that we will take our responsibilities in that respect seriously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100027#Z00200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466525700,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I will speak for five minutes, during which time 125 people will be forcibly displaced from their homes, according to the UN report published yesterday, as a result of persecution, conflict, generalised violence and human rights violations.  They will form part of the 65.3 million people who have been forcibly displaced worldwide, a 50% increase over the space of only five years.  So many people have been displaced that if they made up a nation, it would be the 21st largest nation on earth.  They have been forcibly displaced as a result of crises which largely have their roots in a system of capitalism and imperialism.<\/p>  <p>  Forced migration is now a dominant feature of the world, driven by war.  We know 85% of migrants who come to Greece come from countries that have seen western military intervention.  The crisis is increasingly driven by climate change.  James Hansen, perhaps the most respected climate scientist in the world, according to Naomi Klein, said that at our current emissions trajectory, we face the loss of all coastal cities, most of the world's large cities and all of their history, not in thousands of years' time, but as soon as the end of the century.  Naomi Klein said if we do not demand radical change, we are headed for a whole world of people searching for homes that no longer exist.<\/p>  <p>  What is the response of the European Union to this crisis?  In this treaty, it says it is founded on the rule of law, respect for human rights and democracy.  The response is utterly disgusting.  Donald Tusk - not Donald Trump - told all potential illegal economic migrants, wherever they are from, not to come to Europe.  That is the message from the head of the European Union Council.  Even the UN was forced to criticise that, and said to call people illegal migrants is a shortcut by European leaders and that people are coming to Europe because of ongoing wars.<\/p>  <p>  The deal that has been concluded with Turkey is absolutely disgusting.  It is the implementation of Donald Trump's policy in Europe and, in effect, turns Turkey into a massive prison camp with walls.  Money from the European Union has been given to a major human rights abuser in order to keep migrants out of Europe.  So bad is the situation that it has been condemned by the United Nations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.  The decision taken by  M&eacute;dicine Sans Fronti&egrave;res to no longer accept desperately needed funds from the European Union because of these policies shows how bad the situation is.  Its international secretary general said the EU-Turkey deal goes one step further and has placed the very concept of refugee and the protection it offers in danger.  <\/p>  <p>  What is European Union doing?  It is making the Turkish model the generalised model.  This is about the externalisation of European borders.  The deal it did with Turkey it will now do with 17 other countries and this will be discussed at the European Council.  In a communication on the partnership framework with third countries under the European agenda on migration, the Commission states that increasing coherence between migration and development policy is important to ensure that development assistance helps partner countries to manage migration more effectively and incentivises them to effectively co-operate on the readmission of irregular migrants.  It goes on to say that the same should be true of trade policies, notably where the EU gives preferential treatment to its partners, and that migration co-operation should be a consideration in the forthcoming evaluation of trade preferences under GSB-Plus.<\/p>  <p>  Like the old deal with Gaddafi in Libya, the EU will pay 17 countries, many of which have human rights abuses, to deal with the migration crisis.  That pushes the problem further and further away.  The reality is that one cannot stop migration in a world of deep poverty, inequality, climate change and war.  If one tries to stop it, in reality all one will do is kill people.  Charles Heller was right about the withdrawal of Operation Trident, which was replaced with Operation Mare Nostrum, when he said that European policymakers have made themselves guilty of killing by omission.  It is even more generalised than that.  That is the end result of the policy, of which the blocking of aid to Calais is a microcosm.<\/p>  <p>  If we want a decent world where people are not forced to flee their homes, we have to stop the European Union policies and that of the dominant 1% right around the world.  We need to tackle the problems of climate change and end war and co-operation with NATO, which is strongly pointed at in the draft conclusions, and I am interested in hearing the comments of the Taoiseach on that.  We need to use the world's resources in the interests of the mass of people to raise living standards and ensure everybody has a decent standard of living.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100028#AA00200","speaker":"1308"},{"type":"speech","time":1466525700,"counter":237,"content":"<p>In the song \"Imagine\", John Lennon asked us to imagine if there were no countries and a brotherhood of man.  That is the view held by socialists.  We do not believe in national borders or frontiers.  We believe there is one race, the human race.  Frankly, I find it frustrating, to put it mildly, that a previous speaker suggested that those of us who are critical of the European Union and believe that we should exit it can somehow be associated with the vile xenophobia, racism and extreme forms of nationalism promoted by the fascist far right in Europe or the vile group UKIP, which happens to lead the campaign against the European Union and for exit, but on grounds with which we would have nothing to do.<\/p><p>We have nothing but contempt for UKIP and the far right.  It is most disingenuous for some to suggest that in supporting the existing European Union and arguing for staying in it somehow what we are doing is protecting some beacon of civilised values and tolerance, decency and anti-racism when the opposite is the truth.<\/p> <p> The European Union, as Deputy Paul Murphy has alluded to, is guilty of vile policies of racism against some of the most desperate people fleeing from countries outside Europe from war, poverty and famine and has developed an enormous machine to keep people out, to deny the brotherhood of man, to say Europe is only free if a person is white and European but if that person is not, we do not want him or her.  The European Union has developed a significant machine and architecture to keep people from Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere out.  Between 2002 and 2013, a total of 39 research and development programmes aimed at policing borders have been implemented by the EU and its affiliate, the European Space Agency, at a cost of &euro;250 million.  The projects have been for the development of fingerprint scanners, migrant detection drones, vehicles, satellite surveillance and overground and underwater border patrols, all designed to keep people out.  FRONTEX, the EU-wide project for establishing the external borders of the European Union, has spent &euro;1 billion, four times the other amount to which I referred, keeping immigrants out, supported by all the European Governments and European policy.  That figure is further dwarfed by the amount individual states have spent policing their own borders as part of fortress Europe.<\/p> <p> It is Europe itself that has given credence and opened up the ground for the far right by treating migrants, immigrants and refugees as if they are a problem, encouraging and giving solace to the more dangerous forces of the far right who then take it one step further.  The EU-Turkey agreement is the absolute embodiment of that.  It is a sickening agreement whereby we essentially outsource the border control of Europe to a nasty regime that is guilty of systematic, ongoing human rights abuses against its own population.  Since we signed the agreement whereby we expel immigrants from Syria and elsewhere back to Turkey, Turkey has started shooting those very people.  How could we be in any way surprised that it would do so?  We must end the hypocrisy and the tyranny of fortress Europe and give real meaning to words such as &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; and &ldquo;internationalism&rdquo; to which many look to the European Union to uphold but which the European Union has not matched with deeds but with the vile policies of fortress Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100028#AA00300","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466526300,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Clare Daly.

I was struck by a quote from it yesterday which said, &ldquo;The world commemorates the strength, courage and resilience of millions of refugees&rdquo;.  They are very fine words but the reality is suffering, hardship and terrible human rights abuses of those refugees.  The attitude of Europe also leaves a lot to be desired because Europe is pushing people and their suffering away from Europe.  In so many cases, it is the imperialistic policies of European countries that are the contributing factors to what is causing people to leave their homes in many countries.  It is also the inactivity of Europe, the UN and the role of certain other countries with vested interests that allows the Syrian situation to fester with such appalling results and with no end in sight.<\/p>  <p>  The EU-Turkey deal on migration is appalling.  What it means is thousands of refugees, especially unaccompanied minors, living in unacceptable humanitarian conditions, so much so that the reputable organisation, M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res, which has suffered so much itself, for example, when 22 of its personnel were killed in air strikes on its trauma centre in northern Afghanistan, that it refuses to take EU funding.<\/p>  <p>  Let us look at migration in a pragmatic way and examine whether, if the issues causing people to flee were addressed, people would want to stay in their country of origin.  We know that what causes people to leave is conflict, human rights abuses and food insecurity - often caused by famine due to climate change.  Food insecurity can also result from trade agreements, which brings me to the economic partnership agreements, EPAs, on which we got a full 20 minute debate in this House.  I had an opportunity to speak at the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, group of states joint parliamentary assembly with the EU some weeks ago where I met a number of African parliamentarians.  I was struck by two issues, first, the complete lack of knowledge of EPAs on the part of some parliamentarians.  They never heard of them yet they are sitting in parliaments that are going to ratify the agreements.  That is undermining European credibility that they expect that to happen.  Second, I met other parliamentarians who were very knowledgeable about EPAs and see positive aspects to them but they are also concerned that they will undermine sustainable livelihoods, increase food insecurity and the country&rsquo;s ability to feed itself and then instead of lifting people out of poverty it will plunge them further into poverty, increased dependency on aid and increase migration.<\/p>  <p>  By being more proactive about food security and ensuring that economic partnership agreements have the interests of developing countries at heart, and not just the driver being European economic growth, we can ensure better sustainable livelihoods for people living in developing countries.  If Europe is more proactive on human rights as well, that would play a significant part in people wanting to stay in their own countries.  It would also ensure a massive impetus in terms of youth employability which is causing many problems in developing countries.  People can have good lives in their own countries.  The European Commission must listen to the concerns on EPAs by national parliaments which have to ratify them.  I hope the parliaments that do not ratify the EPAs do not face possible fines.  European credibility is at stake and the European Council must rethink those matters.  I am struck by what President Higgins said yesterday about the European Union.  He said it must again come to represent a model of balance between market, society and the environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100029#BB00400","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1466526300,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Attempts to use the horrific murder of Jo Cox to drum up support against Brexit, as the leader of the Labour Party attempted to do, is reprehensible.  She seemed to be an incredibly decent human being whose values will be well remembered given her role in dealing with refugees.  Against that backdrop and in extending sympathy to her family and friends, we must mark the fact that the number of displaced persons on a global scale has reached 65 million.  That is an indictment of Western society in particular and of the European Union which has stood four-square behind US imperialism in intervening in the Middle East in particular.  I find it somewhat ironic that people are organising protests against the visit of Donald Trump, reprehensible and all as he is, but nonetheless he is an individual who has never been elected to office in the United States or here yet they allow the visit of Joe Biden, the associate of a war criminal, to come into this country without batting an eyelid.<\/p>  <p>  Could the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, clarify what we are saying when we go into EU meetings about refugees?  Points have been made about the deplorable agreement with Turkey and the scandalous role of that country in terms of human rights, such as building a wall along its southern borders, which makes it increasingly difficult for Syrians to seek safety.  We hear from Turkish diplomats that it is to stop extremists getting into Turkey but that does not tally with the brutal assassination and shooting dead of eight Syrians on the Turkish border, three children, four women and one man, last weekend.<\/p><p>It is known that when Syrians enter Turkey, the reality there is incredibly bleak.  While we are told they can get permits now and can get work, everyone is aware that the reality is otherwise.  It is that Syrians, many of whom are highly qualified and some of whom are children, are working for a pittance on the black market.  A total of 2.6 million registered Syrian refugees live in Turkey, more than half of whom are children.  According to UNICEF, more than 80% of those children are not in education, and some of them are working in sweatshops, farms and so on for slave wages.  This is the type of fortress Europe that is being built, and the EU-Turkey deal is absolutely draconian and incredibly regressive.  The Council of Europe even went so far as to state it &quot;at best strains and at worst exceeds the limits of what is permissible under European and international law&quot;.  In a further regressive move on Friday, the Greek Government sidelined members of an independent authority that had blocked the deportation of Syrian refugees.  The appeals committee had argued that Turkey does not uphold refugee law and therefore is not a safe country to which to return refugees, and I agree with that statement.<br\/><br\/>The EU-Turkey deal and the connected asylum proposals are part of a despicable and systemic attempt to push people and their suffering back off Europe's doorstep.  Only two weeks ago, <i>The Guardian<\/i>published the official European Union documents outlining what is a new migration strategy.  To stop refugees from reaching southern Europe from Africa, European leaders actually are proposing to partner with Sudan, the president of which is wanted for war crimes, and with Eritrea, the government of which is accused of crimes against humanity by the United Nations.  Is this the type of Europe with which the Government wants Ireland to be associated?  This is a replacement for Gaddafi's camps, which used to operate for the European Union.  On top of this, I refer to the EU's May proposals to deal with the perceived refugee crisis, which actually is a European crisis for refugees.  This is about clamping down on the free movement of people, no matter what the affront to international and human rights laws.  Some of the most repressive proposals centre on amendments to the Dublin regulation.  To give effect to new proposals, EU members will be obliged to exhaust all avenues to kick asylum applications back to the so-called safe third countries, which they are not, or the first countries of asylum.  Does the Minister of State seriously suggest that Sudan and Eritrea will suddenly be designated as safe countries despite clear evidence to the contrary?  It absolutely is against all best international human rights law, and, as other Deputies have stated accurately, we are outsourcing our migration control and setting a really poor example.  This is causing untold misery to refugees and does not stop them from leaving their countries of origin.  As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan noted, the only way to stop refugees is to stop interfering in their countries.  The first thing one can do is to end war and militarism, because nobody wants to move and leave his or her home.<br\/><br\/>All Europe is doing is enriching smugglers.  One need only read the report published in <i>The Guardian <\/i>at the weekend about the trafficking of young children in Calais and Dunkirk.  There have been appalling violations.  What is the Minister of State doing to further the proposition that Ireland could use a process of humanitarian visas?  It is a system that already exists and that could be put in place for unaccompanied minors, many of whom are almost on our shores in Calais and Dunkirk.  They have been through extreme trauma and are entitled to a safe passage and safe haven.  Why is Ireland not leading the charge in this regard?  Professor Catheryn Costello hit the nail on the head when she stated:<\/p><blockquote>By ignoring the predictable need for refuge, Europe creates a humanitarian crisis at its external borders, and a political one as arrivals continue to be chaotic and unmanaged. ... The alternative is to make humanitarian visas accessible, provide people with ... asylum and [so on].<\/blockquote><p>Is the Minister of State going out and sending his officials to invite people to seek safe haven in Ireland?  That is a policy with which Irish citizens would agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100029#BB00500","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466526900,"counter":244,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Eamon Ryan, who has ten minutes.

Consequently, I was glad to note in the Taoiseach's comments here that the number of people coming to Ireland under that process is starting to increase.  I would appreciate it were the Government to arrange for the relevant officials to brief my party in more detail as to how exactly this will work, obviously outside the confines of the Chamber.  I would appreciate acquiring a real and deep understanding of the process and would greatly appreciate it were the Minister of State to ensure this took place.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, the Council meeting will be dominated by the outcome of the Brexit referendum to be held in the United Kingdom next Thursday.  If I may, I will start thinking of what the debate might be about or what might be the approach at the Council should the United Kingdom vote to remain in the EU.  In preparing for this, I encourage the Taoiseach to consider some of the forthcoming items on the Council's agenda and to give thought to how he might use this as an opportunity for enhanced co-operation and for bringing some of those benefits that all Members present have sought from the Union but that are not always delivered.  I understand from listening to the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, over the years that he has a particular concern regarding the development of an integrated digital market and an integrated energy market in Europe.  These are often what he talks about as the benefits he wishes to take advantage of.  On both, I believe there are possible gains for Ireland in taking that agenda and running with it, supporting it or seeking to ensure it serves our needs.  As the Minister of State is aware, Ireland has a huge high-tech digital services industry.  He also is aware that to get that right, Ireland must be the very best in respect of the protection of citizens' rights, with an ethical digital regulatory system regarding data privacy issues, free access to information and an innovative culture which, in our case, is not simply serving the interests of large corporations or the State.  I believe we will work best and be most successful when we have a citizen-centred digital environment augmented by European rules that support it.  If there is agreement on Brexit whereby the UK decides to remain - God help us if there is not and it decides to leave, which is a very different scenario -  I argue the Taoiseach should seek to take the opportunity to consider that item on the agenda on opening up the full potential of the digital single market and making sure it is fashioned in a way that suits our purposes.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, I refer to the investment plan and the European Fund for Strategic Investments.  I must declare a certain interest in this because, for the past five years, before returning to this Chamber, I have been working on issues such as the development of the North Sea's offshore grid, which was the area with the largest allocation of funding for Irish projects within the European Fund for Strategic Investments.  It is clear that many of the investments for which we had been approved will now not happen because, in a sense, we have stalled in the development of our own clean energy programme.  Consequently, I believe there also is an opportunity in this area, should there be an agreement for the UK to stay, to work much more proactively with the UK in the development of a regional electricity market and common infrastructure.  In many ways, such development is connected to the digital single market issue because, if we develop such a co-ordinated energy market, there will be significant opportunities in digital services for energy efficiency and so on.  This is a second area in which I believe the Taoiseach, if he is proactive, could work with the Prime Minister of the UK to develop our European Union regional market in electricity, which also would benefit us in allowing us to tap into the strategic investment funds that are available.  More widely, I believe the Taoiseach should use the opportunity to seek much greater flexibility in the strategic investment area - for example, in the debate in the House last week on housing plans - as to how we would get Europe to agree to some of the investments that must be made.  I believe it should be possible for us to radically increase the capital funding for social housing using a cost rental model, which would have a fundable stream.  The Taoiseach should use this opportunity at the European Council, hopefully in a positive environment, to steer the European Fund for Strategic Investments in our direction.  I commend him to use that opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100030#CC00500","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1466526900,"counter":248,"content":"<p>It is fairly difficult to predict the agenda of the Council meeting because the Brexit referendum either will dominate or will not.<\/p><p>The concern is that it will dominate the agenda and overshadow some of the other issues which are of critical importance, none less so than the refugee crisis.  The handling of the crisis by Europe should be at the core of what is discussed along with changing the direction of how it has been handled.  The EU has faced two major challenges in recent years: the financial crash and now the refugee crisis.  One cannot but look and say it has failed miserably on both fronts.  It has failed because one of the founding principles of the EU, as opposed to the EEC, was solidarity, yet one is not seeing that in evidence, certainly in the case of the refugee crisis.  Neither was it seen in the response to the financial crash, which was very much about the intergovernmental approach, the strong and the idea of a collection of nation states, which was not what was intended.  The EU will fail if it proceeds in that fashion.<br\/><br\/>It is essential that the EU is democratic and that solidarity is at its heart.  I quote Mr. J&uuml;rgen Habermas, whom our President quoted in a speech he gave a few years ago to the European Parliament.  He was speaking prior to the refugee crisis. <\/p><blockquote>If one wants to preserve the monetary union, it is no longer enough, given the structural imbalances between the national economies, to provide loans to over-indebted states so that each should improve its competitiveness by its own efforts. What is required is solidarity instead, a co-operative effort from a shared political perspective to promote growth and competitiveness in the eurozone as a whole.<\/blockquote><p>We did not see that, but it is still possible to see it.  There is a willingness from those in power to distance themselves from the humanitarian crisis by referring to it more as a &quot;migrant crisis&quot;.  It is interesting that al-Jazeera, for example, has refused to use the term, preferring to use &quot;refugee crisis&quot;.  That is what it is: a refugee crisis.<br\/><br\/>There must be a complete shift.  Even our own very limited offering of assistance has not lived up to its expectations.  The decision to send refugees to Turkey was very shameful on behalf of the EU.  We might ask ourselves, &quot;What if it was us?&quot;.  It was us.  We have had big migrations.  One can look at the 19th century where people who were poverty-stricken and sick left this country and ended up in other countries, yet the narrative around refugees, migrants or the big exodus that is happening is all about negativity.  We celebrate our diaspora and talk about the positive contribution that they can make.  However, that narrative is not feeding into the discussions that are going on at the moment with regard to this refugee crisis.<br\/><br\/>In the short time that remains, I wish to talk about the European fund for strategic investments.  We had a debate here recently where there was a document sent.  It was a debate over a couple of days on the stability programme update.  Essentially, we told the European Commission that housing was a medium-term risk.  We have a housing crisis here and yet we did not properly reflect that in the documents that we sent to the European Commission.  Unless we call it what it is and share that information, we are going to run into some difficulties in resolving the problem.  Given the level of our indebtedness, we are simply going to have to leverage funds off balance sheet.  Some of the large-scale funds are obvious, such as the credit unions, which have money, and others.  The European Investment Bank is one of those areas.  It is also one of those areas in which we can make sure we do not incur costs on the other side.  For example, with regard to the climate issue, there is the choice between the obligation to spend money on fines or to plan not to have fines and do the right thing.  The European Investment Bank is going to be critically important in doing some of that work.  It is really important that we properly articulate what the needs of this country are and how that European Investment Bank can be something that would be productive and that can be used in solidarity for things that progress us as a people and a continent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100030#CC00600","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466527500,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I will start by addressing the request from Deputy Ryan for a briefing from the Department.  It would of course be the Department of Justice and Equality and we will see that it takes place and that it is in contact.  Many of the Members present would be European affairs spokespersons for their parties.  Perhaps it might be up to each party to see who they would send.  We will make sure that it happens.<\/p>  <p>  In the recent reappointments, the Deputy referenced the importance of the digital single market and the energy union.  The Deputy is absolutely correct, particularly with respect to energy union as a peripheral nation, as well as the digital single market.  They have huge potential for the country, the people who live here and the EU collectively.  Both issues have been supported by the UK in the past and we have shown good camaraderie in that space, irrespective of the vote on Thursday.  We will be pursuing both of them.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, we very much hope that the 28 member states will remain as members of the EU.  I acknowledge that, in the main, the cross-party support for that has been very significant.  I believe all of the largest of the political parties in this House have played a very measured role in making the case simply, fairly and in a measured way that it is important from an economic of view for our small country that the UK as our largest trading partner remains a member state.  More important than the economics are the strong relationship we have now, the difficult period we have travelled together with regard to Northern Ireland and the significantly improved relations.  The fact that potentially the only border between the EU and the UK could be in Northern Ireland is difficult and would present difficulties for us.  We have a common travel area.  We joined the EU together so we have never had a relationship where one was in and one was out of the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Most importantly of all, as many Members have said, the EU has been a journey that has been shared by many member states since its foundation.  We must remember the fundamental reasons for the establishment of the EU.  The reason for the first coal and steel agreement, following through to the set up of the European Economic Community, EEC, was to allow the countries to come together to try to work together and avoid a situation repeated in which Europe settles its differences by disputes.  To some extent, in that emotional argument, despite the acceptance that the EU has many failings - different parties disagree about those failings - we fundamentally believe that working together from the inside out is the way to work for the EU.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the points made about the EU-Turkey deal and the crisis, Deputy Murphy is correct about the distraction that the UK referendum has perhaps provided.  I can assure the Deputy and all Deputies of the House that the European Council will continue to focus, irrespective of the vote, on the migration crisis.  It is important to acknowledge, and we do acknowledge, that there are very significant issues involving elements of agreements with third countries and transit countries.  The deal between Europe and Turkey at its core was to break the business model of the traffickers who have previously been mentioned.  Since 1 May, daily arrivals into Greece are down from 1,700 to just 4% of that figure.  Since 20 March, seven lives have tragically been lost.<\/p><p>This is seven lives too many.  However, in January, 89 people lost their lives.  The purpose is to stop and break the business model of the smugglers and to discourage people from crossing the sea.  This is being done in the interest of trying to save lives.  It has not been completely successful but it has gone a long way in that regard.  Also, there is an acceptance that a move towards a fortress Europe would be misguided and would be unlikely to work.  It is for that reason that discussions with countries of transit and of origin are so important.  While some speakers said that countries are being paid off, the reality is that many of these countries are going through severe financial difficulty and money is required to support how they aid and assist migrants when they are in their countries.

It will be Tuesday week, because of the European Council, that the Taoiseach will be back to brief the House after the Council meeting.

Balancing recruitment and equipment investment was essential so as to ensure that the Defence Forces could continue to perform all the functions assigned to them by the Government.  Notwithstanding this the Defence Forces, uniquely within the public service, continued to recruit.  In addition, very significant investment was made in equipment replenishment, not least the procurement of new vessels for the Naval Service and a range of force protection equipment, including a fleet of light tactical armoured vehicles, for the Army.<\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces are currently engaged in a major programme of recruitment to bring the number of serving personnel back up to the authorised strength of 9,500.  More than 600 personnel will be recruited this year and it is planned to recruit 850 personnel in 2017.  However, given the numbers leaving, either on retirement or to avail of the opportunities their significant Defence Forces professional skills training offers them in the wider economy, it is likely that we will continue to turn over personnel on an annual basis.  As such, it will take time to return the Defence Forces to their full strength.<\/p>  <p>  Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel.  However, this is not new.  The Defence Forces have always had a large turnover of approximately 500 personnel annually.  Moreover, a certain level of turnover is necessary to maintain an appropriate age profile across the Defence Forces as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100032#EE00500","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1466528100,"counter":258,"content":"<p>The Minister's response appears to be that money has been spent on equipment, that recruitment has continued, albeit that it has clearly not been effective enough to reach the required personnel numbers, and that equipment has been provided for the Naval Service.  All of that is very much appreciated but my question was about the retention of personnel.  The Minister talked about recruiting personnel to bridge the gap but that is not prevention.  It is a cure for the numbers who have already left.  How do we keep the personnel we have, the people we have spent a great deal of money training?  There is great concern that the early departure of many personnel could affect our Defence Forces' capabilities and operations.<\/p><p>The exodus of officers from the Defence Forces could seriously affect our capabilities.  According to the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, 48 applications are being processed this year in addition to the more than 90 vacancies that already exist.  Last year, 76 officers left the Defence Forces.  This flight of talent was highlighted by RACO's magazine, <i>Signal<\/i>, with the general secretary saying that management has disappointingly failed to engage or constructively respond to issues and concerns raised at RACO's conference last year.  He also highlighted the pressing requirement to address family-friendly practices and policies to support officers who are continually being re-located.

It is very important that we invest in equipment because we must ensure the Defence Forces personnel have the capability to carry out their role in peacekeeping operations, training and so forth.  Equipment is important for that.<\/p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point that there has been a high number of departures.  However, in the last number of years, there has been an average trend in that regard and the number is not more now than it was in the past.  There are more opportunities for people in the private sector now.  The Deputy referred to the number of officers leaving the Defence Forces to go into the private sector.  I have raised this with the Department and the Defence Forces but it simply indicates how highly qualified the people who are trained by the Defence Forces are.

I welcome that; we need the equipment.  However, our people are our most valuable asset in the Defence Forces.  We are currently losing them at an alarming rate and the private sector is benefitting enormously.  We pay to train them but we are not doing enough to keep them in the Defence Forces.  To state simply that we have always had a high turnover does not justify the problem continuing to exist.  We must endeavour to tackle the problem now and ensure we retain those people in so far as we can.  Reports indicate that the Naval Service is short of marine engineers and electrical engineers.  It can take up to five years to train officers.  Many officers in the Air Corps who have amassed significant experience are being headhunted.  We are aware this is happening.  It is due to the fact that pay and conditions are not good enough to retain those people.  In addition, the loss of the western brigade has led to greater relocation of officers on a more regular basis, leading to less family-friendly working conditions.  Again, this is a contributing factor.<\/p>  <p>  We can and must take measures to address this.  I am not advocating that we do not spend money on equipment.  We must have equipment to ensure that people can work safely in their jobs.

In this regard, Ireland has worked to uphold the primary role of the Security Council when it comes to international peace and security.  This commitment has found expression in Ireland's long-standing tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping operations.  Participation in EU battle groups is another means for Ireland to express our commitment to the UN and its principles.<\/p>  <p>  At its meeting of 14 July 2015, the Government approved the participation of five members of the Permanent Defence Force in the UK-led EU battle group, which will be on stand-by for six months from 1 July 2016.  The resolution on Ireland's accession to the memorandum of understanding for the battle group was passed by D&aacute;il Eireann on 9 June.  The opportunity to deploy a small number of Irish personnel to the operational and force headquarters of the battle group will enable the Defence Forces to gain a greater insight into UK operations and command structures, with a view to potential future participation jointly with the UK in peacekeeping operations.<\/p>  <p>  The UK-led EU battle group will consist of participants from Ireland, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden and the UK.  Following a change of Government in May 2016, Cyprus, which had originally intended participating in this EU battle group by providing a small number of staff officers to the operational headquarters, has advised that it will not now be doing so.  It is important to note that each participating country retains the right to deploy or not to deploy its forces, irrespective of an EU decision to launch a battle group operation.  As such, any deployment of the Irish contribution as part of the battle group will still be subject to a UN mandate and Government approval.<\/p>  <p>  I recently gave an assurance to the House that, notwithstanding that D&aacute;il approval is only required in respect of deployments of 12 or more personnel, in the event that a decision by Government might be required on an actual deployment of the EU battle group, I will be happy to facilitate discussion in the House in such circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100039#MM00800","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1466532300,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I find the term battle group unsettling.

The participation in battle groups has no effect on our traditional policy of military neutrality.  A commitment to a battle group does not involve any commitment to common or mutual defence.  I will state again that any deployment of 12 or more personnel in a peacekeeping or peace enforcement operation will require a UN mandate as well as Government and D&aacute;il approval in accordance with the triple lock mechanism.

It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in the first year of secondary school.  I am aware of claims of an association between the HPV vaccine and a number of conditions being experienced by a group of young women.  I want to provide assurances to them and their families that they are eligible to seek medical attention and to access appropriate health and social care services irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The HSE is currently developing a care pathway for young people who are experiencing symptoms of this type and will be in a position to facilitate access to specialist services tailored to the needs of each individual.<\/p>  <p>  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the same time that they received the HPV vaccine and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their children's condition.  I wish to again emphasise why HPV was introduced in 2010.  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and there are approximately 70 deaths per year.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high-risk types of HPV that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  The vaccine used in the school immunisation programme is Gardasil and more than 200,000 girls have received it since its introduction.  Gardasil is a fully tested vaccine which was licensed by the European Medicines Agency in 2006.  While no medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised nationally and at EU level.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2015, the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review, in which the Health Products Regulatory Authority participated, focused on rare reports of two conditions, namely, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.  The review found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions.  On 12 January 2016, the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information, which is now binding in all member states.  Health care professionals are advised to continue using HPV vaccines in accordance with the current product information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100042#PP00100","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speech","time":1466534100,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response, which is very similar to one I received about two weeks ago to a written Parliamentary Question.  We could argue until the cows come home about whether the vaccine works and what causes the side-effects.  We will never know.  I want to be very clear: I am not advocating for people to avail of or refuse the vaccine.  I do not want to be responsible for someone not availing of a vaccine which could save her life down the road.  However, it is necessary that people be aware of those who have said they suffered side-effects.  I feel strongly about this because of the sheer number of people I have met who have linked the vaccine to their side-effects.  In the case of the MMR vaccine it was proved that there was no link to certain side-effects, but that does not mean it is not possible with the HPV vaccine.  I ask the Minister of State, who has responsibility for health promotion, to at least make sure that people are fully informed, not just in terms of what the manufacturers have stated but of the number of reported cases of possible links between the vaccine and side-effects.  The least people deserve is to be fully informed in their decision-making on what they think is right for their daughters or what girls think is right for themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100042#PP00200","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1466534100,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I ask that proper notification be given to parents in the future about possible side-effects.

It concerns a constituent of mine, the parent of a young boy who was in touch with me.  She has a very young family, all aged under seven years.  One of her sons, who is aged five, has had ongoing problems with his tonsils since he was approximately two years of age.  He has missed a lot of school and when his tonsils are very sore he gets sick constantly, which can go on for between one and three days depending on the severity of the illness.<\/p>  <p>  For a number of years his mother was told a viral infection was to blame, but some weeks ago a family doctor suggested that her son's tonsils needed to be removed.  To cut a long story short, she was advised that paying a private ear, nose and throat specialist in a private hospital would speed things up.  A tonsil checkup for two of her children cost &euro;350.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed that the specialist suggested that the tonsils need to be removed and that it would cost approximately &euro;3,000 to have the procedure undertaken privately; otherwise, her son would go on a waiting list.  The family does not have &euro;3,000.  The waiting list in Tallaght hospital is at least one year.  The principal of the local school wrote to me and the local hospital to outline the fact that the child has missed a lot of school due to sickness related to tonsillitis.  The child is falling behind in school and she is extremely concerned about him.  She has other children aged under 7 to care for. <\/p>  <p>  I have been in touch with Tallaght Hospital and have received correspondence from its chief executive about the patient.  The CEO acknowledged the facts around the case in terms of the waiting time.  He said a referral letter for the patient was received and reviewed on 13 April and that the referral was triaged as routine.  The current waiting time for a routine referral in the hospital is 17 months.  The hospital has recognised that this is an unacceptable length of time for anyone to wait for an appointment.  On top of this, the hospital is the only paediatric hospital on the south side of Dublin that is accepting routine ear, nose and throat referrals.  Demand for paediatric ear, nose and throat services has increased by 51% over the past two years.  Things will only get worse, not just for this child but for many others.<\/p>  <p>  The CEO confirmed that he has raised this issue with the HSE and, in fairness, a new paediatric ear, nose and throat consultant was approved, but the successful candidate withdrew from the recruitment process and the job is being re-advertised.  In addition to there being no locum available for this position, the paediatric sessions from a recent consultant retirement also remain unfilled.  The CEO stated that the children's hospital group has approached the HSE to seek support for an ear, nose and throat waiting list initiative with the private sector and is awaiting a response.<\/p><p>In conclusion, the CEO said the hospital cannot at this time offer the patient an appointment date, and the hospital apologised for that.<\/p> <p> I have a few questions for the Minister.  Under the supply and confidence arrangement between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, it was agreed that the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, would be reinstated.  Does the issue I raised come under the remit of the NTPF?  The CEO has approached the HSE to seek support for a waiting list initiative in that regard.  Tallaght hospital is part of the Dublin Midlands hospital group.  Is there any alternative hospital at which the parent in question can seek to get treatment for her son?  It is a shame the Minister cannot be here, but I accept that he is unable to be present.  What is his response to the issue and what advice can I, as the local Deputy, give to the distressed parent whose child may have to wait another 17 months, which I am sure the Minister of State will agree is completely unacceptable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100042#PP00500","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466534700,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lahart for raising this important issue today and for giving me the opportunity to update the House on it.  Tallaght hospital provides a full range of ear, nose and throat, ENT, services, including tonsillectomy services, for both adults and paediatrics, with the exception of paediatric ENT airway management.  Within the ENT services, tonsillectomy waiting times are not separately identified but are reported on as part of the ENT service overall.  As published by the NTPF, the most recent waiting times for ENT services at Tallaght show 278 children and 321 adults awaiting inpatient or day case treatments.  Of those, 87 adults and 64 children have been waiting longer than a year.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that the services are experiencing capacity challenges, which is of great concern to us all.  In order to address the challenges, I am advised that the hospital has been working with the HSE in relation to the recruitment of ENT consultants.  I am pleased to say that two consultant posts are currently in recruitment to fill vacant posts.  One of those is a replacement post, providing both adult and paediatric services, while the second is a new post to provide adult ENT services.  A further new paediatric consultant post has been re-advertised following a previously unsuccessful recruitment campaign.  The posts, when in place, will improve access to ENT services at Tallaght.  The hospital is also implementing other initiatives to optimise the capacity of the existing services, including nurse tonsillectomy triage and nurse-led grommets review clinics in paediatrics.<\/p>  <p>  In the health system as a whole there has been a considerable and increasing demand for care.  We are now seeing in a year approximately 3.2 million outpatient attendances at hospitals, while 100,000 patients have an elective inpatient procedure and more than 800,000 have a planned day case procedure.  Clearly, that has increased pressure on waiting times, as the Deputy will be aware, which means that a sustained commitment to improving waiting times for patients across the health service is urgently needed.  That is why the programme for a partnership Government commits to continued investment of &euro;50 million per year specifically for the purpose.<\/p>  <p>  A scheduled care governance group has been established in the HSE to co-ordinate key initiatives to reduce waiting times and the number of patients awaiting treatment.  Actions overseen by the group include driving greater adherence to chronological scheduling, relocation of low-complexity surgical procedures to smaller hospitals and administrative and clinical validation procedures to ensure that patients are available for treatment.  In addition, each hospital group has been mandated to designate a key person to lead and support waiting list management improvements in order to advance towards compliance with maximum waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to reassure the House that officials in the Department of Health are working with the NTPF and the HSE to urgently address waiting lists across the health service for those waiting longest.  The initiatives will be funded by the annual commitment of &euro;50 million, to which I have already referred.  The amount includes ring-fenced funding of &euro;15 million in 2017 for the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  That will allow us to balance demand and capacity in acute hospital services, including Tallaght hospital, and utilise primary, social and community care services to support the health of citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100043#QQ00200","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speech","time":1466534700,"counter":403,"content":"<p>The news is reasonable if one were to take a helicopter view of the situation, but the stark fact is in the first paragraph of the Minister of State's reply - that is, that a total of 64 children have been waiting longer than a year for ENT services.

I am sharing my time with my colleague, Deputy Fitzmaurice.<\/p>  <p>  On 15 June, last Wednesday, County Roscommon experienced another incident of torrential rain, which was also experienced in parts of some adjoining counties, including County Westmeath, where I was driving at the time and had to pull over.  The heavy deluge of rain caused widespread damage to a number of homes, roads and bridges, especially in areas such as Curraghroe, Scramogue, Culliagh and Doughill, which were badly affected.<\/p>  <p>  Flash floods have affected many communities that are just trying to recover from the heavy rainfall of 2015 and early 2016.  Late on Wednesday night I spent two hours visiting my neighbours and friends in the region.  At least half a dozen houses were quite badly affected in that kitchens, back kitchens, bathrooms and materials in them were damaged.  It is a nightmare situation for families and it is not the first time we have faced such difficulties in County Roscommon.  I am a resident of the area and my home was affected, but thankfully we kept the water from getting in the door.  It took a huge effort.  Those who witnessed the rain said it was the worst they had ever seen.  Reports from Met &Eacute;ireann suggest it was the heaviest rainfall on record, but that has not been clarified.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, water has flowed down from Sliabh B&aacute;n, where Coillte is involved in a wind farm development.  Even though the wind farm got full planning permission and the go-ahead from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, local people are concerned about what might be happening there.  I do not wish to take up any more time, as I wish to give time to my colleague.  I call on the Minister of State to address the issue and to assure me that everything has been checked to make sure the inflow of water is not due to drainage issues on Sliabh B&aacute;n.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100043#QQ00600","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1466535300,"counter":407,"content":"<p>As Deputy Eugene Murphy stated, a tsunami of water came down from Sliabh B&aacute;n last Thursday evening.  In fairness, the council was contacted that evening but one road was taken out completely, houses were flooded, as the Deputy also has noted, and there was chaos in the area.  Since then, no one from Coillte has visited the people who were affected by this event and I understand it could be another day or two before that happens.  There are many questions to be answered.  I walked that mountain last Sunday and while it was stated that one cannot go up the mountain or whatever, I went up through the trees and walked it.  Members must read the planning that is involved and to be frank, enforcement must be considered because while the Deputy is correct to state there was a lot of rain, part of that planning refers to events that happen once every 100 years and the amount of rain that was accounted for the other evening was far from that mark.  I have video footage and photographs of it and it broke the banks.  It came down through the trees and went straight down the mountain.  Were one to examine the planning that was meant to have been put in place, one would conclude that attenuation tanks must be placed in dangerous areas right around that mountain or people will live in fear.  An 82-year-old woman is unable to enter her house, and silt has gone down through drains for approximately one mile.  Farmers' meadows have been blown to the ground.  Water came down the main road from up that mountain.  Under health and safety and building regulations, there is a responsibility on any site to contain whatever water comes onto it and I seek the proper enforcement of this responsibility.  This is the biggest building site in County Roscommon and it must be done right because the people in the area cannot lie in their beds at night in fear of a repeat of what happened the other evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100044#RR00100","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1466535300,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I thank both Deputies for raising this important issue.  I got a chance to view the footage of the flooding in County Roscommon through the RTE website and I could see the devastation caused to families and their homes, as well as to the surrounding land.  There is no doubt that nothing worse can happen than being flooded, and plenty of Members present have experienced this in recent years.  It certainly is devastating and the Deputies are correct that all steps needed to prevent this must be implemented across whatever Departments or county councils are involved.  It is as simple as that and everything that must be done to prevent a recurrence undoubtedly must happen.<\/p>  <p>  As for my involvement and that of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, through the Department, I wish to take this opportunity to outline the provisions of the planning code in respect of development in general and of Deputy Coveney's role as Minister.  Proposals for wind energy developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Acts 2001 to 2015, as amended, and the planning and development regulations made under the Acts in the same manner as other proposed developments.  Planning applications are generally made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  However, in the case of wind development proposals such as this one, which meet the statutory threshold criteria for classification as strategic infrastructure developments under the Planning and Development Act, such applications are required to be submitted directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is a compulsory requirement, however, to undertake an environmental impact assessment in respect of wind farm development projects of a certain scale, that is, if they consist of five or more turbines or have a power output greater than 5 MW.  This ensures that all environmental impacts, including potential hydrological impacts, of a proposed development are fully considered and assessed prior to the making of determinations on individual planning applications.<\/p>  <p>  Planning authorities, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la, are further required to have regard to relevant planning guidelines issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  These include the Department's wind energy development guidelines, which were published in June 2006 and which provide advice to planning authorities on catering for wind energy development through the development plan process, as well as in assessing individual wind farm development proposals and all their effects on the surrounding area.  Furthermore, the planning system and planning guidelines on flood risk management published in November 2009 are designed to ensure that where relevant, flood risk is a key consideration in both the preparation of local authority development plans and local area plans and in the assessment of individual planning applications which may have a flooding risk.  In this regard, it is a matter for the relevant planning authority to make the appropriate determination on a planning application or appeal having regard to relevant planning guidelines issued by the Department.  These guidelines are issued for guidance purposes to assist planning authorities in the performance of their functions.  Ultimately, planning authorities, be they the local planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, will make their own decision based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.<\/p>  <p>  The role of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, with regard to the planning system is primarily to provide the policy and legislative framework which comprises the Planning and Development Act, the planning and development regulations and a suite of planning guidelines to which, as I have outlined, planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are obliged to have regard in the exercise of their statutory planning functions.  The day-to-day operation of the planning system is, however, a matter for the planning authorities themselves.  Furthermore, under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Minister is specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in respect of any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned.<\/p>  <p>  On the matter of flooding, my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, OPW, and flood relief, Deputy Canney, has lead and primary responsibility for the co-ordination and implementation of Government policy on the management of flood risk.  The core strategy for addressing the significant flood risks nationally is the OPW's catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, which I understand is being taken forward in partnership with the local authorities at present.  In this connection, I am informed that approximately 300 locations nationwide that are being assessed under the programme have been designated to be at potentially significant flood risk.  This programme also has been discussed with Deputies at other stages.  This involves flood mapping for each of these 300 locations, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and ultimately, the production of flood risk management plans.  This programme of draft flood mapping is now in the process of being finalised following completion of the national statutory public consultation phase on 23 December 2015 and work on the options to address flood risk in these locations is under way at present.  I am unsure whether the area in question is part of that process but this is a matter Deputies certainly could raise directly with the relevant Ministers and authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100044#RR00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1466535300,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100044#RR00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1466535300,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I wish to make one further point and will cut it short.

Ministers are meeting on a cross-departmental basis to ascertain whether there is a way to fast-track and to spend this investment and the Minister of State sitting to my right, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, also has been involved in those meetings to try to free up resources where they are needed.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to local flooding issues, including those in County Roscommon raised today by Deputies Eugene Murphy and Fitzmaurice, these are a matter in the first instance for each local authority to investigate and address.  Local authorities are empowered to carry out flood mitigation works using their own resources where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  To conclude, the OPW also funds local authorities for small-scale flood relief studies and works up to a cost limit of &euro;500,000 under the minor flood mitigation works scheme.

I am from a construction background and will state clearly that if one takes out 40 ha or 50 ha of trees, if one puts in place 25 m roads and if one brings some of these roads to areas such as those that were earmarked in submissions as being in danger of flooding, one increases the risk.<\/p><p>It was put into the plan that up to 85 mm of rain needed to be accounted for in areas.  We did not have that.  That is guaranteed.  However, it was not contained on the site and that is the bottom line.  There is now silt down the drains.  There is a council road completely busted out of it.  Someone has to account for it.  We need the council to carry out enforcement on this because what has gone on is intolerable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100044#RR01200","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466535900,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I think it is quite clear.  Naturally, any planning application judge has to assess all the associated procedures to ensure that all the environmental impacts, including any potential hydrological impacts, are fully considered and assessed in the consideration of individual planning applications.  I can only assume that was done.  It should have been done.  The regulations are there.  That is why they are put in place and what the policy is there for.  There is local authority planning and there is An Bord Plean&aacute;la and it is their job to follow through on procedures.  I agree with the Deputy.  They need to investigate whether every planning procedure and regulation was followed and whether every condition was adhered to.  Deputy Fitzmaurice raised the conditions in this case.  Naturally, if one is going to have any construction in an area it is going to have a knock-on effect.  That has to be fully investigated.  That is what planning laws are there for.  That is what the Department is very proactive about.<\/p>  <p>  It is a local conversation.  From what I can see, if Coillte is involved in discussions, I do not know if the site affects it or not.  It is alleged that there are impacts from wind farms on localised flooding in Roscommon.  From what I have seen, Coillte is dealing with the local authority to see if its site is in any way involved.  It will take corrective action where necessary.  Deputy Fitzmaurice has specific planning details and I hope he liaises with the local authority, which is in charge of enforcement.  Local authorities have a budget for enforcement.  That is their job.  As a Minister of State in this Department, I feel very strongly that we have to have enforcement.  It is something we have to have.  There is no point in having planning laws if we do not enforce them.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, as I have outlined, it is a matter for the relevant planning authority to make the appropriate determination with regard to a planning application or appeal, having regard to relevant planning guidelines issued by the Department based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.  The Minister is specifically excluded from exercising any power or control with regard to any particular case, but it is important that all regulations are checked and enforced.  On the matter raised by Deputies Murphy and Fitzmaurice regarding flooding in Roscommon, my colleague, the Minister of State with special responsibility for the OPW, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, has lead responsibility and is working on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  Much work was carried out on the CFRAM process and we discussed it on many other occasions as well.  Very often, there are simple solutions.  The Deputy said that most of the cases in Roscommon would cost about &euro;11 million.  Over half a billion euro has been allocated to be spent on flood relief over the next three or four years.  That needs to be spent as quickly as possible and we need to work with locals on the ground to spend it and not have any delays.<\/p>  <p>  We have the term \"one-hundred-year flood.\"  That is possibly going to change.  We have had a lot of rainfall this year and we are well ahead of once in 100 years.  I assume that all involved in flood relief prevention measures for the future are updating the technology and information in conjunction with our weather services.  I imagine that is happening.  I will certainly check that, because the one-hundred-year event is becoming too common.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100045#SS00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Data","time":1466535900,"counter":421,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100045#SS00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1466535900,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I have been raising an issue with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, for quite some time now, seeking to get accurate information on the macro-prudential limits on mortgage lending that were introduced by the Central Bank on 9 February 2015.  Obviously, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is aware that the Central Bank called for submissions last week with regard to the review it is carrying out on these limits, as well as submissions on the loan-to-value and loan-to-income limits that it introduced.  I ask the Minister to facilitate the publication of the most important evidence there is of the working of these rules, which is the amount of leeway on loan-to-income and loan-to-value that the rules allow for that the banks are actually using.  That is critical.  Under the existing rules, 15% of qualifying loans can be dealt with as exemptions from the loan-to-value limit and 20% as exemptions from loan-to-income limit.  What does this mean?  It means, if one looks at AIB as an example, that AIB could have issued &euro;400 million worth of mortgages in 2015 that did not comply with the loan-to-income rules.  That is what 20% of their mortgage lending would have been.  It would have been about &euro;300 million if it was solely on loan-to-value.<\/p>  <p>  What we need to know is whether this flexibility that is built into the rules is being used by the financial institutions and whether it is being completely used.  They are sensible rules in my view and should be used to the maximum of their ability in terms of the exceptions that are there.  In my view, it is those on lower incomes whom the rules narrowly disqualify, rather than a large number of bigger loans, who should be availing of these exceptions.  Thanks to my persistence in seeking replies to parliamentary questions, we see that 11% of the qualifying loans issued by Permanent TSB in 2015 were under the loan-to-value exception, while the Central Bank rules allow for 15%.  The Minister has refused to direct AIB to publish its figures.  I cannot see why that is the case, because we need all of the information available.  Both Permanent TSB and AIB should be publishing these figures in a way that is very easily digestible to the public and that can feed into the review by the wider public and by Members of this House in terms of the evidence-based review that the Central Bank has called for.  As long as these figures are unpublished, there must be questions about whether the banks are simply using the rules or whether they are hiding behind the rules and the real problem is that they are simply not lending.  We will not know that until we know that they are using the 20% exception on loan-to-income ratios and the 15% exception on loan-to-value ratios to the maximum ability and that they are using them for a large number of people on low incomes instead of for the bigger loans, which would use up a lot of the percentage base.<\/p>  <p>  There can be no evidence-based submission without evidence.  That is what goes to the core of this issue.  We need to be empowered with regard to making an accurate submission.  I do not see how I could make a submission not knowing if this exemption is being used or not.  If the Central Bank does not want to be accused of running a sham exercise, it must work with the Department of Finance to release these figures.  Following the Minister's refusal when I asked again that he direct AIB to release these figures, I wrote directly to the Central Bank and it provided an ambiguous reply saying that it had obligations under section 33AK and EU law, but it went on to suggest that it would publish the figures that I am calling for now so that we can feed into an evidence-based review.  The Central Bank says it will publish the figures after the review and the submissions are concluded.  I ask the Minister of State if he will facilitate me and anybody else who wishes to have an input into this important review by supplying a crucial part of the evidence, which is whether the banks are using the exceptions that are available to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100045#SS00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1466535900,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and I am aware of his interest and persistence on this matter.  I am glad that he acknowledges that the rules are sensible.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank's macro-prudential limits on mortgage lending came into effect on 9 February 2015.  The policy sets restrictions on the loan-to-value, LTV, and the loan-to-income, LTI, ratios on products that can be offered by mortgage providers.  The Central Bank has an independent mandate to promote and protect financial stability and these residential mortgage lending macro-prudential measures were put in place by the Central Bank with the objective of increasing the financial resilience of the banking and household sectors and reducing the risk of bank credit and house price spirals in the future.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of exemptions allowed for within the Central Bank guidelines - for example, for mortgage switchers or forbearance cases.  The banks are at liberty to use these exceptions to the extent they see fit and will likely do so with consideration to their risk appetite, lending policies and overall strategy.  The measures provide that residential mortgage loan approvals issued after 9 February 2015 will be subject to specified LTV and LTI restrictions.  Any mortgage loans sanctioned prior to that date are not affected by the new rules even where the mortgage is drawn down after 9 February.<\/p>  <p>  Subject to certain exceptions, the restrictions that apply to mortgage lending are: a maximum LTV mortgage of 80% of the value of a principal dwelling house for non-first-time buyers; a maximum mortgage LTV of 90% for a property valued up to &euro;220,000 for first-time buyers, subject to an 80% LTV on any excess value above that amount; a limit of 70% LTV on buy-to-let mortgages; and an LTI limitation of three and a half times a gross annual income for loans only.<\/p>  <p>  Certain other types of primary home residential lending fall outside the scope of the new rules.  The LTV and LTI limits do not apply to the refinancing of housing loans, switcher mortgages or housing loans entered into in order to address arrears or pre-arrears.  Housing loans for borrowers in negative equity who wish to obtain a mortgage for a new property are not in the scope of the LTV limits.  However, lenders can exceed the above LTV and LTI thresholds in respect of a certain limited proportion of the overall amount of residential lending, as the Deputy has pointed out.  For primary home mortgage lending, up to 15% of new lending as drawn down can exceed the LTV threshold limits in an annual period and up to 20% of new lending can exceed the LTI threshold.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062100045#SS00500","speaker":"1295"}]
