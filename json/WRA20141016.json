However, 60% of on-line purchases made by Irish consumers currently go abroad.<\/p><p>  Only 23% of companies trade on-line.  Therefore, it is imperative that we encourage more businesses to trade on-line in order to save jobs in the face on on-line competition from abroad.  <\/p><p>  E-commerce should be an element in every enterprise's business.  All of the Agencies under the aegis of our Department actively support enterprises in developing such business plans.  The Local Enterprise Offices have been supporting enterprises in this area for several years.  They provide mentoring support and other practical assistance.  The NSAI have encouraged businesses to adapt new technologies through iSwift.  Solas has developed specialist courses in managing ecommerce for SMEs.  Many of our start-ups facilitated by EI are specifically using E-commerce as the platform to drive their business models.  Enterprise Ireland's Internet Marketing Unit is focused on helping export-focused clients across all sectors to exploit the internet as a route to market and to assist them in developing a strategy that will shape how they do business online.  <\/p><p>  Encouraging more companies to conduct their business through e-commerce is also one of the key strands of the Government's National Digital Strategy, which falls under the remit of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Alex White, TD.  The National Digital Strategy envisages that an awareness and promotion campaign, highlighting the value to business of trading on-line, will be developed in partnership with industry, community stakeholders and Ireland's Digital Champion, David Puttnam.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources also supports internet start-up companies through the Digital Hub Development Agency and the National Digital Research Centre.  The Deputy will of course also be aware of that Department's ongoing development of the National Broadband Strategy.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy acknowledges we have introduced a Trading On-Line Voucher scheme as a specific measure to encourage a step-change in Irish business' engagement with E-commerce, which is administered by the Local Enterprise Offices, forms part of the Government's programme to get more businesses selling their products and services over the internet.  The scheme will support 2,000 small businesses to trade on-line over a period of two years.  However, we expect that these businesses will act as exemplars for other small companies to start trading on-line.  <\/p><p>  Preliminary feedback from the first 50 companies that took part in the pilot in Dublin indicates 70% of companies are getting more customer inquiries, 55% have had - or are expecting - more sales, and 60% expect to recruit extra staff within 12 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600050#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1078"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Action Plan for Jobs","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600050#WRA00600"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[39072\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600050#WRA00700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will report on the progress of the actions within the Action Plan for Jobs concerning his Department and its constituent groups to create competitive regions, including but not limited to building new manufacturing and office space facilities and the development of a regional enterprise strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>The aim of the Action Plan for Jobs is to help enterprises to create employment in all regions of the country.

The Report of the Entrepreneurship forum, which led to the new National Policy Statement also considered a number of social protection issues, including this one, and recognised the complex nature of the factors involved in making changes in this area. <\/p><p>  In September 2013, the T&aacute;naiste published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4%.<\/p><p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments provides adequate cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. <\/p><p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points. <\/p><p>  There are positive and negative implications for job-creation and entrepreneurship of increasing the self-employed PRSI rate by 1.5% to fund the extension of Invalidity Pension entitlement to the self-employed on a revenue neutral basis.  On the positive side, entrepreneurs would be provided with an additional safety net.  On the negative side, higher marginal personal tax rates can act as a disincentive towards Job Creation and Entrepreneurship.  <\/p><p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person. <\/p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I will reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report.  This discussion will feed into the Action Plan for Jobs process, which underpins the importance of fostering an environment that supports entrepreneurial activities and assists small businesses to expand, create jobs and contribute to national economic growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600052#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Low Pay Commission Establishment","counter":82,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600052#WRC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":83,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[39070\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600052#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide an update on the status of the Low Pay Commission; when it will be established and when it is due to report back; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":84,"content":"<p>There is a commitment in the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 to establish a Low Pay Commission (LPC) on a statutory basis as an independent body to make annual recommendations to the Government about the appropriate level of the minimum wage and related matters.<br\/><br\/>The Minister for Business and Employment is currently developing proposals to implement that commitment.<br\/><br\/>Issues being developed to this end include, <br\/><br\/>-the detailed role and mandate of the LPC<br\/><br\/>-its size and composition<br\/><br\/>-resourcing requirements and<br\/><br\/>-legislative changes to National Minimum Wage Act 2000.<br\/><br\/>In addition to establishing the LPC on a statutory basis and progressing the legislative process, consideration is being given to establishing the LPC on an interim administrative basis to ensure that the Commission is in a position to carry out its functions as early as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600052#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Construction Contracts","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600052#WRC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[39262\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600052#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his plans to reintroduce direct labour on building sites, particularly on Government funded projects and then roll out to private building contracts.","asker":"1193","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":87,"content":"<p>I have no plans to introduce legislation to require the use of direct labour in the construction sector, either in respect of Government funded projects or in respect of private building contracts. <br\/><br\/>As with all such processes, it is a matter for the parties to agree voluntarily between themselves the most appropriate manner in which a contract should be performed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600052#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":89,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600052#WRC01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Data","counter":88,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600052#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[39640\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600052#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which economic and or unemployment black spots have been identified throughout the country; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":90,"content":"<p>The geographical distribution of the Department of Social Protection resources is matched to the variation in demand including unemployment black spots around the country.  Our labour market activation strategy, Pathways to Work, targets resources at helping the long-term unemployed and those at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.  Targeting those most at risk of long-term unemployment, by definition, focuses resources on the worst-hit areas. The roll-out of the profiling system at our Intreo offices has enhanced this effect as one of the main variables in the profiling system is geographical location. In other words, if someone comes from an area of high unemployment, s\/he will, all other things being equal, receive more targeted assistance. <\/p><p>  In addition, the geographical distribution of places on employment programmes such as CE and T&uacute;s &amp;amp; training programmes has been highly correlated with unemployment rates for each region.  Within the T&uacute;s programme there is a specific area-based approach to the allocation of places.  Places on the T&uacute;s programme are allocated to community and voluntary organisations involved in the delivery of local services in urban and rural areas.  The allocation is based on the numbers of eligible unemployed people in each local development company or &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta area.   <\/p><p>  Other than through administrative mechanisms like those described, it is difficult to identify and target specific unemployment black spots at a very local level.  The most frequent unemployment data come from the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS); as a sample survey, the QNHS provides reliable data at a regional, but not at a local level.  Small-area statistics are collected in the Census, but these are available only at five-year intervals, and the unemployment concept underlying them does not correspond exactly with that used in the QNHS.   <\/p><p>  However, the Government&rsquo;s policy of targeting resources at those most at risk of long-term unemployment overcomes this statistical deficit and ensures those areas that are most in need of assistance are prioritised.  The Department works primarily at a local level and is acutely aware of the differentiated impact of unemployment across local areas.  The Live Register figures by office are closely monitored and are an important consideration for the provision of our activation services.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that our approach to prioritise the support of individuals most at risk of long-term unemployment is effective in targeting unemployment black spots.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600052#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600052#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":92,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[39641\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600052#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which she expects job creation efforts in the future to focus on the long term and youth unemployed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":93,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to reduce unemployment has been through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.

It is intended that the Charter will initially be signed by the 200 largest companies in the State who will then be able to use the skills of the unemployed\/long- term unemployed. <br\/><br\/>The Labour Market Council has also supported the Department in a number of activities to build relationships with employers including briefings and consultations with employer stakeholder groups, job fairs, the production and distribution of employer-focused promotional materials, direct engagement with employers at national and regional level, the development and launch of new employer recruitment incentives and the design and implementation of bespoke training and recruitment solutions.  This has, inter alia, served to raise employer awareness about initiatives, such as JobsPlus and JobBridge.  In the case of JobsPlus, over half the persons recruited through this employer subsidy scheme have been out of work for more than two years.<br\/><br\/>With specific regard to youth unemployment, the Government will be implementing the Youth Guarantee to ensure that young people are supported and positioned to benefit from the recovery in employment.

Accordingly, 65% of applications processed to date in 2014 have been awarded at decision stage.  In addition, approx. 50% of those who appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office are successful with 573 DCA appeals allowed to date in 2014.<\/p><p>  In early 2014 a revised DCA application form was introduced, together with a designated additional medical information form for children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) to be completed by the specialist treating the child.  This is particularly useful in cases were the child&rsquo;s condition may need more detailed assessment.  It is hoped that the introduction of this revised application form, together with the provision of complete information by parents\/guardians at the earliest opportunity will result in an increase in the number of applications being awarded at initial assessment stage, with a corresponding reduction in the number cases going to appeal.<\/p><p>  When a DO considers that the qualifying conditions for DCA have been met, they award the allowance and also consider setting a review date based on the recommendation of the Medical Assessor.  Recommended review dates can vary from a &ldquo;do not review again&rdquo; status, where the child&rsquo;s condition is unlikely to improve before they are 16 years to between 1-10 years where there is potential for the child&rsquo;s condition to improve to the extent that they may no longer need the level of care and attention required to satisfy the qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Some 16% of the 28,574 children currently in receipt of DCA have a &ldquo;do not review&rdquo; status.<\/p><p>  An entitlement review of DCA was one of the issues considered by the DCA review group in their 2012 report. The review group accepted that all schemes operated by DSP should have a review policy and that this is a requirement in order to satisfy the C&amp;amp;AG that appropriate controls are in place and to meet the Secretary General&rsquo;s obligations as accounting officer.<\/p><p>  The group acknowledged that there is a need to review cases in an appropriate timeframe. i.e. children with treatable conditions may only require the allowance for one or two years, while in the majority of cases it may be appropriate to review cases every 3-5 years. New procedures have been devised that will provide parents with significant advance notice of an upcoming review, allowing them time to obtain any supporting documentation they may wish to provide to allow their continued entitlement to be quickly and easily confirmed.<\/p><p>  In any event no scheduled reviews on medical entitlement have been conducted since May 2012, when they were suspended following the announcement of the review of the DCA scheme. The re-introduction of scheduled reviews has been further postponed pending the outcome of an appeal to the Supreme Court in relation to a Judicial Review decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600053#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Support Services","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600053#WRD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[39523\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600053#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she shares the views of the Ombudsman for Children, that services and welfare entitlements for persons with disabilities should be ring-fenced and protected by future Government regardless of the economic climate; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":105,"content":"<p>While services for people with disabilities are the responsibility of the Department of Health and the HSE, in relation to income supports for people with disabilities, in framing budgetary adjustments over the past number of years, the primary concern of the Department has been to protect primary social welfare rates including disability payments, pensions and carer&rsquo;s allowance, and this policy approach  has been maintained in this budget. <br\/><br\/>I should point out for information that expenditure on the Illness, Disability &amp;amp; Carers programme is estimated to be <b>&euro;3.33 billion<\/b>in 2014 which represents <b>17.0%<\/b>of total Departmental expenditure (Vote &amp;amp; SIF).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600053#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Eligibility","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600053#WRD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[39566\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600053#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a person in receipt of carer's allowance may apply to work on a community employment scheme with reduced hours, or if there is any similar type scheme which a person in receipt of carer's allowance would qualify for as permitted by the conditions attached to the carer's allowance payment.","asker":"1048","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":108,"content":"<p>To qualify for the carer&rsquo;s allowance payment, a person must meet certain conditions.

","asker":"1066","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":115,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 to 51, inclusive, together. <\/p><p>  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 73,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. <\/p><p>  I can confirm that I have no plans to increase a person&rsquo;s minimum contribution under the rent supplement scheme, that is, the amount that a person is required to pay towards their accommodation from their own resources. <\/p><p>  Considering the unprecedented pressures on supply in the private rented market, particularly in areas of high demand, increasing rent limits at this time will only serve to place higher pressure on rental prices nationally, exacerbating what already is a very difficult situation for all persons renting.  I am concerned that raising rent limits may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers and their families and students. I plan to keep the matter under close review.<\/p><p>  Analysis shows that the impact of increasing limits will yield only a very marginal increase in available supply for rent supplement recipients with the only certainty that raising limits will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to new recipients.<\/p><p>  Increasing both public and private housing supply and the reactivation of the construction activity is a critical issue for Government at this time and the resolution of the housing supply situation is a key element in restoring stability to the rental market.  The Government has recently launched its Construction  Strategy 2020.  This provides for a strategic approach to returning the construction sector, in a sustainable fashion, towards the provision of housing based on real and measured demand and addresses the full range of relevant issues including the planning process, financing, access to mortgage finance and the construction workforce.<\/p><p>  Government is determined to meet the scale of social housing need and has announced, as part of Budget 2015, significant capital investment of over &euro;2.2 billion for social housing for the next three years.  In 2015, over &euro;800 million will be invested in a range of housing programmes which represents the first major investment in housing since 2009.  <\/p><p>  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Alan Kelly TD, is also due to shortly publish a Social Housing Strategy which will propose a range of approaches and reforms that are innovative and challenging and that will provide a basis for an improved and sustainable approach to the provision of social housing supports in Ireland. <\/p><p>  I am fully aware of the difficulties people are experiencing in maintaining affordable rented accommodation, including those in receipt of rent supplement, in the current market particularly in areas of high demand.  I want to assure the Deputy that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and will continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.  Discretionary powers are available to staff to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant. A notice reminding staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated earlier this year.  <\/p><p>  In view of the particular supply difficulties in Dublin, the Department has agreed a tenancy sustainment protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf.  Since the launch of this initiative in mid-June 2014, almost 140 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department.  I have no plans to extend this protocol at this time but will continue to review the situation towards the end of the year and into 2015. <\/p><p>  Finally, in order to qualify for rent supplement, the tenant, landlord or landlord&rsquo;s agent must complete the rent supplement application form declaring that the information, including the amount of rent, provided is accurate. The form clearly states that making a false statement or withholding information may lead to prosecution. It is very difficult for the Department to identify top up payments when both the tenant and landlord are in collusion and if the top up payment is being made in cash. In such cases the Department&rsquo;s representative will discuss the circumstances of the case with the tenant before making any decision in relation to ongoing entitlement. The primary concern in dealing with such cases is to protect the tenant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600053#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Eligibility","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600054#WRE00100"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[39585\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600054#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if mortgage repayments are taken into consideration when a means assessment is carried out for jobseeker's allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>Jobseeker's allowance is a means tested social assistance scheme.

Additionally, where a residential property is occupied by an individual who is permanently and totally incapacitated, the property may be exempt from LPT. These two LPT reliefs are outlined below.<br\/><br\/>Section 15A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a reduction in the market value for LPT purposes of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided, or approved for grant aid, by a local authority and where the adaptation increases the market value of the property. The person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  Under the Disability Act 2005 disability means &quot;a substantial restriction in the capacity of an individual to carry on a profession, business or occupation in the State or to participate in social or cultural life in the State by reason of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Section 10B of the LPT Act provides that an exemption from the charge to LPT may apply to a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individual as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Injuries Board (formerly known as the Personal Injuries Assessment Board) or a court, or where a trust has been established, specifically for the benefit of such individuals.  In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption only applies where the cost of the adaptation work exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before it was adapted.<br\/><br\/>Entitlement to the exemption provided for in section 10B will depend on whether the extent of a person's disability is such that they are permanently and totally incapacitated from being able to maintain themselves.  &quot;Maintain&quot; in this context means a person's ability to support themselves by earning an income from working.  Total incapacity in this context means that the individual is not capable of earning a living from any kind of work.  The incapacity must also be permanent, that is, there must be no prospect of the individual recovering, or of the condition improving, to the extent that they become capable of maintaining themselves.<br\/><br\/>I am also advised that whether households, which care for one or two disabled persons, qualify for relief under section 15A, or for exemption under section 10B, will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy may be aware that following representations and a review of the reliefs, I announced on 2 May 2014 that I intend bringing forward legislation amending section 15A to remove the requirement that any adaptation work on the residential property must be grant-aided, or has been approved for grant-aid, by a local authority as one of the qualifying conditions for the tax relief.  I also intend to remove the requirement, by way of legislation amending section 10B, that a permanent and totally incapacitated person must have benefitted from a Court or Injuries Board award or a public trust fund, to qualify for the exemption.<br\/><br\/>My officials wrote to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners advising her of my intention to retrospectively amend the legislation. In view of this, the Chairman has advised me that Revenue will apply the exemption and the tax relief in line with the proposed revised legislation.  The Commissioners have published detailed guidelines which describe how a residential property qualifies for the reduction in market value or the exemption under the new arrangements, and how liable persons should make their application to Revenue.  The Guidelines are available on their website at: .<br\/><br\/>Under the new arrangements, applications for the reduction in market value should be made on .  Applications for the exemption should be made on or, where the application concerns a permanently and totally incapacitated child for whom the Department of Social Protection pay a Domiciliary Care Allowance should be completed.  Applications should be sent to the Revenue Commissioners, LPT Branch, PO Box 1, Limerick.

In order for developers to be supported, they need confidence that customers will be capable of accessing finance to purchase new houses.  This means mortgage products being available to potential purchasers with an ability to support repayments.  As part of this process, an examination of some proposals for additional models of mortgage finance, including the concept of a mortgage insurance scheme, has been undertaken.<br\/><br\/>As the Deputy will be aware, Budget 2015 contains a number of measures to support\u00a0a functioning\u00a0housing market.

Part VIII of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 (as amended) sets out the Central Bank's powers, duties and responsibilities in relation to the granting or refusal of a moneylender's licence and in relation to their regulation when such a licence is granted. <br\/><br\/>The Central Bank has advised me that there is a rigorous process involved in the granting or renewal of a licence.  The Central Bank can refuse to grant a moneylender's licence on a number of grounds. One of these grounds is:<br\/><br\/>- where, in the Central Bank s opinion, the cost of credit to be charged is excessive, or where any of the terms and conditions attaching thereto are unfair.<br\/><br\/>Each application for a moneylending licence is individually assessed. <br\/><br\/>The Central Bank publishes a register of licensed moneylenders on its website.\u00a0 This register includes the <b>maximum<\/b>Annual Percentage Rate (APR) that each moneylender is authorised to charge.  The maximum APR charged by a licensed moneylender has not increased since the Central Bank assumed responsibility for the licensing and regulation of moneylenders in 2003.\u00a0 APRs on moneylending agreements range from\u00a023% to a maximum of 188.45%, excluding collection charges.  The highest APR including collection charge is 287.72%.\u00a0 APRs vary significantly, depending on the\u00a0duration of the loan. <br\/><br\/>Each licensed moneylender is also required to display a copy of its licence in its business premises.\u00a0 The licence contains a schedule of each product which the moneylender is entitled to offer, together with details of the related cost per &euro;100 borrowed, the collection charge (if applicable) and the APR.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>I appreciate that vulnerable consumers, sometimes as a last resort, are using licensed monelylenders and therefore, consumer protection is crucial.  The Central Bank's authorisation regime and its Code of Conduct provide a significant degree of protection to these consumers.  My Department is also significantly engaged with\u00a0other consumer protection measures in the financial services area which include the proposed legislation to protect consumers on the sale of loan books, the transposition of\u00a0both the Mortgage Credit Directive and the Payment Accounts Directive into Irish law as well as the implementation of the Credit Reporting Act 2013 and ongoing work in relation to mortgage arrears. <br\/><br\/>I note from the topical issues debate last week on the matter of moneylenders\u00a0that the Deputy referred to the situation in other European countries where usury rules prevail.  EU consumer credit legislation does not specify the rate of interest which a moneylender may charge although moneylenders are of course\u00a0subject to the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010 (Statutory Instrument 281 of 2010) which transposed the Consumer Credit Directive. As was indicated last week, the setting of a cap on interest rates (sometimes used as a target, and not a cap) may not achieve the objective of lowering the total cost of credit and\u00a0could result in excluding low income households from access to credit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600056#WRG01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[39740\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600056#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the sanctions applied by the Central Bank of Ireland on moneylenders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":195,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[39741\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600056#WRG01850","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide examples of the Central Bank of Ireland refusing to grant moneylender licences at annual renewal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":196,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 79 together.<br\/><br\/>Compliance with supervisory and legislative requirements is monitored by the Central Bank on an ongoing basis through a robust annual licensing process, advertising and market intelligence monitoring and themed and institution-specific inspections.  Issues identified are addressed with the relevant firms. <br\/><br\/>The Central Bank has drawn my attention to two cases in which it reached settlement agreements with moneylenders.  These are available in .  In one case\u00a0dated 10 July 2007, the moneylender was reprimanded and it\u00a0ceased collecting repayments in respect of some credit agreements bought from an unauthorised credit provider.  In the other case dated 18 September 2013, the Central Bank reprimanded the moneylender and required it to pay a monetary penalty of &euro;8,000. <br\/><br\/>Firms considering applying for a moneylending licence will usually discuss their proposed application with the Central Bank with a view to identifying all legislative and supervisory requirements relating to such a licence.  As a result of this interaction, a refusal of an application will not generally arise as perceived difficulties will usually result in the non-submission\/withdrawal or modification of an application.  The renewal process is similar and issues may be resolved without a formal refusal.

Ireland has benefitted much through the opening up of EU and world markets in terms of having access by indigenous firms to bigger export market and also through multi-national firms setting up here to export into them. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation together with its enterprise development agencies and bodies such as the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs is engaged in a continuous process of scanning the external environment for changes in technology, business models and enterprise requirements and developing policy responses to ensure Ireland remains at the forefront internationally as a location from which to trade and to invest and grow jobs. <br\/><br\/>There are several global drivers of change impacting on the international market for goods and services including:<blockquote>-  Globalisation which has led to a growth in global manufacturing value chains sited in different locations world-wide in the pursuit of the most competitive costs.<br \/><br \/>-  Technological advances including advanced materials, nanotechnology, biotechnology, and advanced manufacturing which are giving rise to a wider range of innovative products and processes. <br \/><br \/>-  Shifting demographics which is resulting in a strong demand for health and lifestyle products and services.<br \/><br \/>-  Changing consumer preferences which are raising the complexity of demand for manufactured goods, particularly for electronics, communications and transport. <br \/><br \/>-  Energy and environmental concerns and rising energy prices are resulting in firms striving for greater efficiencies in energy and waste. <\/blockquote>The globalised nature of the world economy requires employees to acquire a range of international business and technical skills and an understanding of cultural differences and working practices.  The ongoing globalised nature of the world economy means that Ireland has to continually establish its niche as a high performing, productive and innovative country. For Ireland to compete effectively in the global market place, it is important to enhance the skill levels of the working population. World class skills, education and training have been identified in the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) as a key area where Ireland can continue to develop competitive advantage in building sustainable enterprises.<br\/><br\/>The standard of living achieved in Ireland can only be maintained and improved upon, through high productivity and innovation which in turn is supported by high levels of education and training attainment. The skills requirements of the economy are not static. This has implications for the skill profile of those at work &ndash; with a need for all to upskill. <br\/><br\/>All occupations are becoming more knowledge-based, requiring an increasing breath of knowledge, rising technical, qualification, regulatory requirements and continual learning. There is an increasing emphasis on generic skills in both new and existing jobs. There are basic skills which everyone will require to access the labour market and increasingly to participate in society. These include literacy, numeracy, and using technology. There is also an increasing emphasis on people related skills such as communication, interpersonal skills, team working and customer service skills, and for conceptual skills such as problem solving planning and organising and learning to learn. The trends show that an Increasing breadth of knowledge will be required. For example software engineers now need more than just programming skills; they also need an understanding of the business domain that their research is intended to target.  Food operators are increasingly required to update their skills to meet food safety requirements. <br\/><br\/>The development of appropriate skills for the workplace has implications for curricula, programme design and teaching methodologies at all levels of the further education and training and third level education system. The programme of reform which is being rolled out across all the education and training system seeks to further improve the quality of the teaching and learning experience for job seekers and students and to ensure the ongoing supply of high quality entrants for the workforce.  It also seeks to improve the employability prospects of those unemployed in re-entering the workforce. At the primary education level a key focus of reform is on developing the key skills of literacy and numeracy through the implementation of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy and at second level Junior Cycle reform is embedding key skills throughout the curriculum. <br\/><br\/>Ireland has led the way in developing a National Framework of Qualifications that incorporates vocational and academic qualifications into a single framework. There is a need to ensure that state funded education and training leads to accreditation and qualifications. Qualifications help the labour market communications process. Individuals can communicate to employers the skills that they have. Employers can identify the skills available and do a better job of skills matching.<br\/><br\/>The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs plays a key role in advising on future enterprise skills needs. The head of the EGFSN secretariat responsible for the groups research, analysis and publications is within the Strategic Policy Division, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Industry representative bodies companies and senior executives from IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland along with officials from the Departments of Education and Skills and Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, the HEA and further and higher education and training providers participate in the EGFSN. Specific sectoral studies are advised by a steering group which is comprised of companies from within the sector.

The role of my Department is to verify compliance by the food business operators with this requirement.  I am satisfied that the traceability requirements in place are sufficient to ensure the safety of the product while also providing information to consumers and retailers.  This is borne out by the successful audits of our traceability systems from the many third countries who have opened their markets to Irish beef in recent years.  Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002, which sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law, stipulates, among other things, that food business operators at all stages of production, processing and distribution within the businesses under their control must ensure that foods satisfy the requirements of food law.  Specifically in regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators must have systems in place to be able to identify any person from whom they have been supplied with a food.  They must also have a system in place to identify the other businesses to which their product has been supplied.  In other words, a food business operator at each and every stage in the food chain must be able to identify the source of its inputs as well as having details of the first recipient of its output.   <\/p><p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all DAFM approved slaughter plants.  Controls at stand-alone secondary processing plants are carried out at a frequency which is based on an annual risk assessment for each plant.  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each DAFM approved meat plant.  The audit includes physical identity, labelling and document checks and concerns product originating both in EU Member States and third countries.  In addition, labelling and documentary checks form part of the routine procedures conducted by Department officials. <\/p><p>  Rules on the labelling of meat and meat products\u00a0are laid down in EU legislation.  For beef, the current rules require compulsory origin labelling, with place of birth, rearing and slaughter specified as well as the approval number of the slaughterhouse and cutting hall.  Currently there is no obligation under EU law to identify bovines using DNA testing.  The tagging system for bovines is based on Council Regulation 1760\/2000 which requires all bovines to be identified with 2 matching ear tags within 20 days of birth and to register the calf within 7 days of tagging on the AIM database.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  I am not aware of any plans at EU level to amend Regulation 1760 of 2000 to facilitate the introduction of DNA testing for bovine traceability purposes.  The introduction of such a measure would certainly entail extra costs which, ultimately, would be borne by the consumer.  Consideration would need to be given to the impact this might have on the price of the final product and the competitiveness of our beef exports. <\/p><p>  I have of course recently launched a Beef Genomics Scheme which, on a voluntarily basis, will require participating farmers to take a tissue sample from specified animals for genotyping.

The Department of Health is responsible for oversight of the governance of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). The Department has no role in setting or approving registration fees.<br\/><br\/>The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 2014 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.<br\/><br\/>It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6 million would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013\/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17th September, 2014.

These are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and often on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). <br\/><br\/>The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Eculizumab in the community drugs schemes. The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed in 2012 by my Department and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA).<br\/><br\/>  In accordance with these procedures, the NCPE conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Eculizumab and concluded that, at a total cost per patient per year of &euro;437,247 and a cumulative gross budget impact over 5 years estimated at &euro;33 million, the therapy did not represent value for money for the treatment of patients in the Irish healthcare setting. In addition, the manufacturer did not include an economic model as part of their submission and failed to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of this therapy. Consequently, the NCPE was unable to recommend reimbursement of the product under the community drug schemes. The report is available on the NCPE's website .<br\/><br\/>Many countries have struggled to accept the pricing point put forward by Alexion.  The HSE continues to try to engage with the pharmaceutical company to arrive at a pricing point that would assist it in its efforts to fund this medicine for as many patients as possible.

Some 69 written submissions were received by the review group in that context.

Recommendations were also made in relation to current apprenticeships.<\/p><p>  Following on from the Review an Apprenticeship Implementation Plan was published on 30 June 2014.  As part of this plan a new Apprenticeship Council is in the process of being established.

The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school management annually and are available on the Department website.In accordance with these rules each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. <\/p><p>  As education at post-primary level is on the basis of subjects, the situation is complex and therefore difficult to predict and plan for. Post-primary teachers are generally qualified to teach more than one subject but may not be deployed to teach these in equal measures at school level. School management authorities have the flexibility to deploy teachers to meet demands. Schools are also responsible for deciding what subjects and programmes to offer and this can vary from school to school in accordance with local need. This in turn, determines the type of teacher competencies\/specialisms required. While the numbers of PDE (formerly the H.Dip) places have remained fairly constant over recent years, there can be particular subjects which, over time, become more or less in demand and this can lead to a surplus or deficit of teachers of that discipline.<\/p><p>  While teaching posts funded by the state continue to increase I understand that there are newly qualified teachers not yet holding teaching positions in schools.

This policy direction addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including the provision of a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply and a free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as the child benefit allowance while customers with specific medical conditions which require increased water consumption will have their charges capped.<br\/><br\/>In its determination, the CER has decided that all customers will have their total water charges capped at the unmetered &ldquo;assessed charge&rdquo; for 9 months.  The cap will apply from the start date of the next billing period after installation of the meter or 1 October 2014, whichever is the later.<br\/><br\/>In addition, the Government is putting in place further affordability measures to assist pensioners, people with disabilities and carers who are in receipt of the Household Benefits Package and this support has been further extended in Budget 2015 to cover all Fuel Allowance recipients who do not already receive the household benefits package.

The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.<br\/><br\/>Up to 300,000 households may not be metered in the initial domestic water metering programme due to either the high cost or the technical difficulty of doing so. Irish Water has commissioned a study on possible approaches to metering properties that are not part of the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections. On the basis of this report, it has been agreed to incorporate 48,000 apartments, identified by the report as being easily metered, into the current metering programme. The advancement of any further phase of metering will be a matter for consideration by the CER based on proposals from Irish Water. The same regime of assessed charges, based on occupancy, will apply to apartments which are not metered, as applies to other unmetered dwellings.<br\/><br\/>The approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. The CER has now issued a determination on the water charges plan. Full details and associated documentation are available on the CER website at:<br\/><br\/>.<br\/><br\/>In making its determination on the water charges plan, the CER had to take account of the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water and a direction made under Section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 in July 2014. This policy direction addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including the billing of properties not connected to a meter on the basis of a scheme of assessed charges based on occupancy. The policy direction also requires the CER to review assessed charges in the light of emerging data on metered consumption to ensure that the assessed charges remain as close a proxy for actual usage as possible.<br\/><br\/>In its determination on the water charges plan, the CER has decided that all customers will have their total water charges capped at the unmetered &ldquo;assessed charge&rdquo; for 9 months. The cap will apply from the start date of the next billing period after installation of the meter or 1 October 2014, whichever is the later.<br\/><br\/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. They may be contacted via email at or by telephone on 1890 278 278.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600072#WRX01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Remit","counter":607,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600072#WRX01050"},{"type":"question","counter":608,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[39680\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014101600072#WRX01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if Irish Water is delaying or has the capacity to delay the taking in charge of estates by local authorities; if so, whether this will be corrected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":609,"content":"<p>Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, sets out the process by which local authorities can take in charge housing estates.
