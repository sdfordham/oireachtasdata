In this regard, the level of remuneration in the Defence sector has maintained relativity with the levels available in other related public sector employments.<\/p><p>  A Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for members of the Permanent Defence Force was established in 1993.  It provides a formal mechanism for the representative Associations, RACO and PDFORRA, to engage with the Official side. The purpose of the scheme is to provide a means for the determination of claims and proposals from the Associations relating to remuneration and conditions of service.  Since 1993, there have been significant developments and improvements in the pay and conditions of military personnel.  The Representative Associations have been to the fore in advancing the interests of their members in this regard, bringing them in line generally with the pay and conditions available in other public service employments.  <\/p><p>  As the Deputies will appreciate, it has proved necessary to take very significant action in terms of adjusting downwards the pay and conditions for staff right across the Public Service.  The Defence Forces cannot be immune to these changes and indeed have had similar pay cuts and a radical reorganization of the Defence Forces structures, which has reduced numbers serving and promotional opportunities for personnel.  As a result of the continuing economic challenges facing the country and the requirement for further measures to restore fiscal sustainability, discussions have opened with the public sector trade unions affiliated to ICTU about mechanisms to deliver required savings of up to &euro;1 billion in the public sector pay bill in the period 2013 - 2015.

Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking.<\/p><p>The Naval Service, as a member of the Joint Task Force, is also committed to an international initiative, the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &ndash; Narcotics, (MAOC-N).

MAOC-N was set up by seven European countries and is designed as an international co-ordination force with access to national tasking agencies and requires participation and resources from all active members.An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service have full-time officers based at its Centre in Lisbon.

In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes. These include long-term payments such as the Disablement Benefit, the State Pension, Widows, Invalidity and Blind Pensions, Carers Allowance and the One Parent Family Payment as well as short term benefits such as Job Seekers Benefit. Treating these payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends on the level of income that a recipient has in a tax year.  If there is no other income besides the social welfare payment, the basic personal credits in force can be expected in most cases to ensure that no tax arises on the social welfare income itself.<\/p><p>  In addition, prior to the Budget day measure to treat maternity benefit as a taxable source of income, there were situations where an employee continued to be paid by her employer, in full, while on maternity leave and, based on her PRSI contributions, was entitled to Maternity Benefit from the Department of Social Protection and the previous non-taxation of such benefit resulted in an employee having a greater net take-home pay for the period of maternity benefit, than applied if she was at work.<\/p><p>  The rates of Maternity Benefit are earnings-related and are set to reflect post-tax income. It was never intended that a mother gain financially by being on maternity leave. The previous system that allows for a gain, for some recipients, was anomalous and not sustainable given the current budgetary constraints, hence the need to introduce taxation measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Rebates","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRB02300"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[55762\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of money the Revenue repaid in tax refunds under maternity benefit rates in 2011 and to date in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":95,"content":"<p>The position is that maternity benefit paid by the Department of Social Protection is not regarded as income for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts for 2011 and 2012 and is disregarded for all tax purposes.

The tax liability is calculated by applying the tax rate to the mid-point of the band.   For residential properties valued over &#8364;1m banding will not be applicable. The rate will be 0.18% of actual market value for the first &#8364;1m with a rate of 0.25% applying to any excess value over &#8364;1m. A half-year of LPT will be payable in 2013 with a full year payable in subsequent years. The revenue expected to be raised in 2013 is &#8364;250m. The revenue expected to be raised in 2014 is &#8364;500m. However the Household charge will be abolished in 2013 and the Non Principal Private Residence charge (NPPR) will be abolished in 2014. Arrears of both will continue to be collected.<\/p><p><b>Deposit Interest Retention Tax and Exit Taxes on Life Assurance Policies and Investment Funds<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The rate of retention tax that applies to deposit interest, together with the rates of exit tax that apply to life assurance policies and investment funds, are being increased by 3 percentage points and will now be 33% for payments made annually or more frequently and 36% for payments made less frequently than annually. The increased rates will apply to payments, including deemed payments, made on or after 1 January 2013. The revenue expected to be raised from the increase to DIRT is &#8364;47m for 2013 and is &#8364;60m for 2014. The revenue expected to be raised from the increase on exit taxes is &#8364;3m for 2013 and &#8364;4m for 2014.<\/p><p><b>Capital Gains Tax<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The current rate of 30% is being increased to 33%. This increase applies in respect of disposals made after 5 December 2012. The yield is estimated at &#8364;47m in 2013 and &#8364;48m in 2014.<\/p><p><b>Capital Acquisitions Tax<\/b><\/p><p>The current rate of 30% is being increased to 33%.  This increase applies in respect of gifts or inheritances taken after 5 December 2012. The measure is expected to yield &#8364;18m in 2013 and &#8364;27m in 2014. The current group tax free thresholds are being reduced by 10%. This reduction applies in respect of gifts or inheritances taken after 5 December 2012. This is expected to yield &#8364;10m in 2013 and &#8364;15m in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[55803\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRB03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the revenue that would be raised for the Exchequer by increasing the rate of universal social charge by 3% on income earned in excess of &euro;100,000 per annum for PAYE workers; and by increasing the rate by 3% for income received in excess of &euro;100,000 for the self-employed.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":110,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, assuming the enactment of changes announced in the 2013 Budget, the full year yield, estimated by reference to 2013 incomes, from increasing the rate of universal social charge by 3% on income earned in excess of &euro;100,000 per annum by PAYE and self-employed income earners would be of the order of &euro;71 million and &euro;130 million respectively.

The estimation approach in the Thornhill report was used to illustrate indicative yields only, using unpublished Central Statistics Office (CSO) data based on mortgage transactions and the CSO&rsquo;s property price index. In making the Budget forecast this was updated to include regional variation in house prices and stock using data for county level housing stock, and regional variation in values from the CSO property price index. This results in a higher yield because of the higher weighting of higher value properties in counties with larger volumes of properties.<\/p><p>  In Autumn 2012, a national register of property values was published for the first time based on Stamp Duty data from the Revenue Commissioners on actual transactions in the years 2010-2012. The register is updated on an on-going basis. The distribution from the register results in a higher incidence of higher value properties. Using the same indicative rates an analysis based entirely on the register would result in a much higher yield compared with the method above.  However, caution has been applied to this approach given the low number of transactions, the high percentage of non-mortgage (i.e. cash transactions) and the possible bias in recent transactions towards transactions of higher quality housing stock which may not represent the generality of housing valuations in the State.<\/p><p>  A final method of estimation is based on the ESRI tax-benefit model SWITCH. In the SWITCH model, data on house prices come from the self-assessed value provided by the respondents to the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) in 2010 with these values indexed to adjust to 2012 prices.  The SILC data are based on a sample of all private households, giving it the potential to provide a broader picture than one based on transactions or mortgages.  The SWITCH model produces an estimate lower than the first method.  <\/p><p>  The overall projections for revenue are a blended average of the approaches described above.<\/p><p>  As indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 55934\/12, answered on 11 December 2012, the Property Price Register shows a higher percentage of houses valued over &euro;1m (c. 1% of the housing stock) than does the Thornhill Report.  However, the overall yield estimate does not solely rely on this data source for the reasons given above, in particular because properties which changed hands in the last two years are not necessarily representative of the overall stock of residential properties in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":151,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRC02350"},{"type":"question","counter":152,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[56299\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if temporary promotions or acting-up allowances have not been a feature of the staffing arrangements for this EU Presidency, if he will confirm that his Department has been given sanction to make such arrangements detailing the number by grade involved, and the date sanction was sought and the date it was given.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":153,"content":"<p>My Department has not awarded temporary promotions or acting-up allowances to any staff member for Presidency related work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":155,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRC02600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Applications","counter":154,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRC02550"},{"type":"question","counter":155,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[55715\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRC02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a Student Universal Support Ireland grant will be allocated in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Laois; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":156,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department have confirmed with Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) that further documentation was received from the student referred to by the Deputy on 1st December 2012 and this documentation is currently awaiting review.

While it would be preferable not to have to make any changes, it is hard to justify providing more generous pupil-teacher ratios to PLCs which educates adults, than second-level schools which cater for teenagers. This change will reduce the number of teaching posts by 200 in PLC courses and may lead to some reduction in subject choices for students. The further education sector has expanded rapidly over the past few decades, developing many innovative programmes for its students. It is now up to the CEOs of each VEC to look at the resources available to them and to work with their Principals and staff to ensure they can continue to deliver programmes which closely meet the needs of both students and employers.PLC providers have been enrolling significantly above their allocation of places in recent years, and I do not expect that this measure will impact on the number of PLC places available.

As the change will be introduced at the start of the academic year in September 2013 the savings from Sept to Dec 2013 will be &euro;4mn.

In order to protect core weekly payments which people receive such as pensions, disability and carer&rsquo;s allowance we had to look very carefully at other additional payments such as the respite care grant.<\/p><p>  The respite care grant is paid to approximately 70,000 people each year, with some 5,000 people in receipt of more than one grant as they care for more than one person.  52,000 people are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and 26,000 in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance (DCA).  There are also 1,300 in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  They receive the respite care grant automatically in June.  Persons who are in receipt of both DCA and carer&rsquo;s allowance receive one respite payment.  5,000 carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment receive the grant.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the revised rate of the respite care grant of &euro;1,375 will still be more than what it was in 2006 when the rate was &euro;1,200.  The estimated expenditure on carers in 2012 is over &euro;771 million: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance, &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit, &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance (DCA).  This represents an increase of almost &euro;20 million on expenditure in 2011.

Out of the 2,544 applications received in my Department under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, 1,784 applicants have opted for financial compensation and 760 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation.<\/p><p>To date, a total of 2,105 payments and 180 turf deliveries have been made to applicants at a total cost of &euro;3,409,000.  A cost of &euro;51,000 was incurred in 2011 with the remaining cost of &euro;3,358,000 being incurred in 2012.<\/p><p>The scheme is comprised of a payment of &euro;1,500 per year, index linked, for 15 years or, where feasible, relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs where they can continue to cut turf.<\/p><p>Payments and turf deliveries have been made on the basis that applicants have indicated in their application forms that they fulfil all the qualifying criteria of the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme. My Department has been checking, and will be continuing to check, that all of the qualifying criteria of the scheme have been met in each case.<\/p><p>I am advised that at this stage one applicant has been informed that he does not fulfil the qualifying criteria. He has requested a Departmental review of the decision. Arrangements are also being considered by the Peatlands Council to put in place an appeals system where applicants wish to appeal the outcome of a review by the Department. While it may be anticipated that there will be further instances where applicants do not qualify, priority has been given to processing payments to those who clearly appear to meet the qualifying criteria on the basis of the information provided in their application forms.<\/p><p>3 applicants have been rejected because the areas on which they have been cutting turf are not within a raised bog special area of conservation.<\/p><p>An additional once-off payment of &euro;500 for qualifying turf cutters will be provided where legal agreements are signed with me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. To date, no such payments have been made as my Department has been giving priority to processing the &euro;1,500 per annum payments and requests for the delivery of turf. Based on the number of applicants who have received compensation under the scheme to date, it is estimated that the total cost of the once-off payment will be of the order of &euro;900,000.<\/p><p>Sites nominated for designation between 1997 and 1999<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Site Code<\/th><th>Name<\/th><th>County<\/th><th>No. of Applications Received<\/th><th>No. Opting for

However, it should be noted that in the same period, a total of &#8364;12,833,000.00 worth of fines imposed were reversed as a result of a further application to court.  Fines imposed by courts are criminal sanctions generally payable to the Exchequer or, failing this, to the appropriate agency or authority nominated within the specific legislation that was breached and gave rise to a fine.  Fines are not paid to charities and no fines monies were paid to the Garda Benevolent Fund in 2011.<\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy will be aware, funds are also paid from time to time to charities from the court&#8217;s poor box.  The court poor box is a non-statutory system used mostly by the District Courts to impose a financial charge on a defendant to be used for a charitable purpose, usually instead of imposing a criminal conviction.  Payments made to the court poor box are accounted for by the court office concerned and the accounting procedures are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Generally, charities are the recipients of poor box contributions but the decision is solely at the discretion of the Judge who is independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  I am informed by the Courts Service that in 2011, &#8364;1,733,641.85 was paid into court as a result of poor box orders and of this amount, &#8364;28,138.00 was paid to the Garda Benevolent Fund.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2005, the Law Reform Commission examined the matter in its report entitled <i>The Court Poor Box: Probation of Offenders<\/i>   (LRC 75-2005).  The Commission recognised both the negative and positive aspects of the court use of the poor box and accordingly recommended that the court poor box be replaced by a statutory reparation fund.  A key element of the LRC recommendation was that the reparation fund should be ringfenced and used to assist programmes aimed at preventing offending behaviour and for the purpose of assisting victims of crime.  The Commission was of the view that the reparation fund should remain linked to the criminal justice process and thus broadly adhere to the principles of restorative justice.  I intend to bring forward legislation in the near future to replace the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 with modern provisions dealing with community sanctions and the role of the Probation Service in the criminal justice system.  In the context of that legislation, the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in relation to the court poor box are being examined by my Department with a view to bringing forward proposals for a transparent statutory retribution scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRK01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":441,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRK01750"},{"type":"question","counter":442,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[55833\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide details of each service in his Department that is currently outsourced; the company that provides such services and the total cost for these services; the other services which may be outsourced in the future that are currently being run in his Department; the names of the companies, fees paid and nature of service for all contracts awarded from his Department excluding legal, accounting, PR or building refurbishment related services since March 2011","asker":"1078","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":443,"content":"<p>My Department has entered into no new contracts for new externally delivered services since March 2011.

It is very regrettable that this highly beneficial resource is abused in that way, causing great distress to many people. <\/p><p>  There are two approaches to tackling cyberbullying, that is to say, bullying over the internet, by mobile phone or by other technological devices. In the first instance, we must educate and alert people to the problem, how to detect it and how to overcome it. Everyone has a role to play, whether they are parents, teachers, classmates, work or team colleagues or mere 'bystanders'. <\/p><p>  I draw attention to the services available from the organisations participating in the Safer Internet Ireland Project, coordinated by my Department's Office for Internet Safety. The www.webwise.ie site provides valuable information and advice as well as links to other relevant sites.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy refers in particular to social networking sites. They have become very popular especially among younger people. Users need to be aware that those sites have their own rules. They usually have various options such as privacy settings and complaints procedures which may be availed of to prevent any unwanted access. Most of the major social networking sites have signed up to the EU's Safer Social Networking Principles. The Principles promote good practice with an emphasis on enhancing the safety of younger users. <\/p><p>  The second approach entails pursuing perpetrators under the criminal law. The current law has a number of relevant provisions.  Two sections of the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 are especially relevant. Section 5 deals with the offence of threatening to kill or cause serious harm. It has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years. Section 10 provides for the offence of harassment. The section includes harassment 'by any means including by use of the telephone'. This offence attracts a maximum penalty of imprisonment of up to 7 years. <\/p><p>  At my request, the Law Reform Commission is examining an aspect of the requirements in section 10, namely the need to demonstrate persistence in the harassment. I await its conclusions.<\/p><p>  The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 may be relied upon in cases where the cyberbullying entails incitement to hatred on account of race, religion, nationality or sexual orientation.<\/p><p>  The Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 is relevant to the investigation and prosecution of the offences under the 1997 Act. It permits the retention of and access to data for those purposes where the offence is a serious one. In that regard, the Act identifies some specific offences but adds that the term also applies to any offence having a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment or more. The offences in sections 5 and 10 of the 1997 Act meet that criterion. <\/p><p>  While I can understand their reluctance to do so in many instances, victims, their families and friends must realise that their active participation is required if attempts to defeat the cyberbullies are to succeed. They can follow the simple but effective advice on how to deal with unwanted messages and they must assist the Garda&iacute; by reporting cases to them. The criminal law can be employed only when victims come forward and assist the Garda&iacute; in building a case against their tormentors.<\/p><p>  I have no immediate plans for new, more targeted, legislation but I will be keeping the matter under review. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRL00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":465,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRL00400"},{"type":"question","counter":466,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[56303\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRL00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if temporary promotions or acting-up allowances have not been a feature of the staffing arrangements for this EU Presidency, if he will confirm that his Department has been given sanction to make such arrangements detailing the number by grade involved, and the date sanction was sought and the date it was given.","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":467,"content":"<p>I have been advised that 11 temporary in nature promotions have been made in my Department as part of the preparation for the EU Presidency in the following grades; 1 Principal Officer; 4 Assistant Principal Officers; 4 Higher Executive Officers and 2 Executive Officers.

The second ship will follow one year later.<\/p><p>  On the issue of Naval Service training and associated technologies, I am satisfied that Naval Services training techniques and the technologies involved are up to date in all respects. The Naval Service training plan is structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned to the Naval Service by Government.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the equipment issued to the Naval Service is in keeping with the most modern requirements and the highest international standards.

However, it is imperative that the Department and the Defence Forces, similar to all other Government Departments, must take into account the current difficult economic environment we are now operating in. The budgetary situation will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment and upgrades. Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces. <\/p><p><br \/>  I am advised that military training techniques are up to date in all respects. Defence Forces training plans are specifically structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned to them by Government. The challenges of preparing military units for participation in international peace support operations constitute the major dimension of Defence Forces collective training. The primary focus of this training is the attainment of a capability for military interoperability in order to conduct peace support operations to international standards. Training standards in the Defence Forces are constantly benchmarked against best international practice and Defence Forces personnel have full access to the best international training standards available. <\/p><p><br \/>  A particular focus is maintained in ensuring that modern and effective equipment is available for overseas peace support operations. In this regard, the personal equipment, which the individual soldier has at his\/her disposal in Lebanon and on other overseas missions is second to none and compares very favourably with the equipment in use by other countries.  <i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRL02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Army Reserve Training","counter":485,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRL02400"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[55031\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRL02500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if sufficient resources remain available to ensure training and upgrading of the Army Reserve; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":487,"content":"<p> The central recommendation from the Value for Money Review of the Reserve Defence Force was for the retention of the Reserve with 4,000 personnel spread countrywide to be based in barracks and in 16 other locations.

The SCP is a key programme under the Department of Education and Skills' DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) action plan.<\/p><p>  I wish to inform the Deputy that &euro;26.456m is being allocated to the programme in 2013.  The allocation is in line with the proposals in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure for savings of 6.5% per annum in the SCP for the years 2012-2014.  In September 2012, the Local Management Committee responsible for each individual project was notified that a reduction on last year&rsquo;s allocation would apply for the coming academic cycle.  The full year budget for the SCP was confirmed earlier than in previous years to assist local committees to effectively refine programmes and deliver targeted interventions within budget.<\/p><p>  Each Committee was requested to review its Retention Plan to support young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage in their school, home and community life, to remain in education and to finalise a programme of supports to effectively target available resources to meet local needs.  Projects were advised to scrutinise all elements of expenditure and to seek to reduce costs and achieve efficiencies while prioritising evidence based services to support children&rsquo;s educational outcomes.<\/p><p>  The NEWB, which is responsible for the operational management and direction of the SCP, has made assistance available to each local project to review its planned programme.  The NEWB continues to work closely with management committees, schools and local SCP co-ordinators to ensure student supports are tailored to meet local needs.  The adjustment identified in CRE for 2013 and 2014 will be further considered in the context of a review of the programme to be undertaken in 2013.  This review will address the potential to achieve greater consistency in programme delivery, administration and other costs amongst the 124 local projects and related initiatives.  A core objective of the review will be to ensure that available funds are appropriately targeted to support those most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRN02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education Programme","counter":582,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRN02150"},{"type":"question","counter":583,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[55934\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRN02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the required fields in which a potential pre-school leader must have achieved a level seven major award or equivalent in order to successfully receive the higher rate of capitation under the early childhood education programme; if there is a list of approved qualifications offered by Irish institutions in respect of this; if she will provide this list; if specifically any undergraduate degrees in psychology with significant modules on early childhood learning do qualify; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":584,"content":"<p>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 with the objective of providing one free pre-school year for all eligible children prior to commencing primary school.

In keeping with the Government's commitment to increasing standards in the pre-school sector, a higher capitation payment of &euro;73 per week is available to childcare services in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme.

The CETS<b><\/b>programme provides &#8364;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services for trainees and students who are deemed qualified by F&Aacute;S or the VEC.

An effective and robust RES is required in the Irish private health insurance market in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012 is now currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Scheme will take effect from 1 January 2013. The legislation provides for a range of credits to be payable to insurers on behalf of insured persons.  I recently announced the rates of risk equalisation credits to apply in 2013 at the Committee Stage debate on this Bill. <\/p><p>  The rates are funded by a stamp duty payable by all insurers in respect of each insured person. The credit is provided at source &ndash; that is, the cost of the policy is reduced by the amount of the risk equalisation credit. The measures are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums paid in the market and to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, as well as the old and the young. This action is in line with plans to move to Universal Health Insurance, under which everyone will be insured for health care. A strong system of risk equalisation must be in place in order for this to be achieved. A more efficient, cost effective market will lead to greater competition and will encourage people to take out health insurance. The introduction of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012 fulfils the commitment made in the Programme for Government to introduce a system of risk equalisation for the private health insurance market, as we move to develop a new system of universal health insurance.<\/p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, I announced further detail on legislation to provide for the charging of all private patients in public hospitals. Primary legislation will be introduced during 2013 to provide for charging of private in-patients in public hospitals where they are not in a designated private bed.  On that basis, Budget 2013 has provided for additional patient income of &euro;60 million in 2013.  The implementation date will be announced during 2013 when the new legislation is in place.  In the meantime, the maintenance charges for private in-patients in public hospitals remain unchanged. An additional &euro;5 million in patient revenue during 2013 arises from increasing the daily in-patient charge by &euro;5 from &euro;75 to &euro;80. The date of implementation will also be announced later in 2013. These measures are designed to recoup some of the cost of treating private patients in public hospitals and to generate much needed income for the public hospital system. <\/p><p>  The Government remains committed to keeping down both the cost of health insurance, so that it is affordable for as many people as possible, and the general cost of healthcare delivery, as part of measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to a UHI system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRP01600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Care of the Elderly","counter":635,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRP01700"},{"type":"question","counter":636,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[55711\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the additional funding that will be provided for the care of older persons in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":637,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[55712\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRP01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the additional home care packages that will be provided in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":638,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[55713\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200075#WRP02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the additional home help hours that will be provided in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":639,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 to 224, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  Protecting the vulnerable, including supporting older people to remain at home and in their communities for as long as possible, is a priority for this Government.

The estimation approach in the Thornhill report was used to illustrate indicative yields only, using unpublished Central Statistics Office (CSO) data based on mortgage transactions and the CSO&rsquo;s property price index. In making the Budget forecast this was updated to include regional variation in house prices and stock using data for county level housing stock, and regional variation in values from the CSO property price index. This results in a higher yield because of the higher weighting of higher value properties in counties with larger volumes of properties.<\/p><p>  In Autumn 2012, a national register of property values was published for the first time based on Stamp Duty data from the Revenue Commissioners on actual transactions in the years 2010-2012. The register is updated on an on-going basis. The distribution from the register results in a higher incidence of higher value properties. Using the same indicative rates an analysis based entirely on the register would result in a much higher yield compared with the method above.  However, caution has been applied to this approach given the low number of transactions, the high percentage of non-mortgage (i.e. cash transactions) and the possible bias in recent transactions towards transactions of higher quality housing stock which may not represent the generality of housing valuations in the State.<\/p><p>  A final method of estimation is based on the ESRI tax-benefit model SWITCH. In the SWITCH model, data on house prices come from the self-assessed value provided by the respondents to the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) in 2010 with these values indexed to adjust to 2012 prices.  The SILC data are based on a sample of all private households, giving it the potential to provide a broader picture than one based on transactions or mortgages.  The SWITCH model produces an estimate lower than the first method.  <\/p><p>  The overall projections for revenue are a blended average of the approaches described above.<\/p><p>  As indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 55934\/12, answered on 11 December 2012, the Property Price Register shows a higher percentage of houses valued over &euro;1m (c. 1% of the housing stock) than does the Thornhill Report.  However, the overall yield estimate does not solely rely on this data source for the reasons given above, in particular because properties which changed hands in the last two years are not necessarily representative of the overall stock of residential properties in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200076#WRC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":780,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200076#WRC02350"},{"type":"question","counter":781,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[56299\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200076#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if temporary promotions or acting-up allowances have not been a feature of the staffing arrangements for this EU Presidency, if he will confirm that his Department has been given sanction to make such arrangements detailing the number by grade involved, and the date sanction was sought and the date it was given.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":782,"content":"<p>My Department has not awarded temporary promotions or acting-up allowances to any staff member for Presidency related work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200076#WRC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":784,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200076#WRC02600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Applications","counter":783,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200076#WRC02550"},{"type":"question","counter":784,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[55715\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200076#WRC02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a Student Universal Support Ireland grant will be allocated in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Laois; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":785,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department have confirmed with Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) that further documentation was received from the student referred to by the Deputy on 1st December 2012 and this documentation is currently awaiting review.

While it would be preferable not to have to make any changes, it is hard to justify providing more generous pupil-teacher ratios to PLCs which educates adults, than second-level schools which cater for teenagers. This change will reduce the number of teaching posts by 200 in PLC courses and may lead to some reduction in subject choices for students. The further education sector has expanded rapidly over the past few decades, developing many innovative programmes for its students. It is now up to the CEOs of each VEC to look at the resources available to them and to work with their Principals and staff to ensure they can continue to deliver programmes which closely meet the needs of both students and employers.PLC providers have been enrolling significantly above their allocation of places in recent years, and I do not expect that this measure will impact on the number of PLC places available. This necessary change will result in an estimated saving of &euro;12mn in a full year. As the change will be introduced at the start of the academic year in September 2013 the savings from Sept to Dec 2013 will be &euro;4mn.

In order to protect core weekly payments which people receive such as pensions, disability and carer&rsquo;s allowance we had to look very carefully at other additional payments such as the respite care grant.<\/p><p>  The respite care grant is paid to approximately 70,000 people each year, with some 5,000 people in receipt of more than one grant as they care for more than one person.  52,000 people are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and 26,000 in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance (DCA).  There are also 1,300 in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  They receive the respite care grant automatically in June.  Persons who are in receipt of both DCA and carer&rsquo;s allowance receive one respite payment.  5,000 carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment receive the grant.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the revised rate of the respite care grant of &euro;1,375 will still be more than what it was in 2006 when the rate was &euro;1,200.  The estimated expenditure on carers in 2012 is over &euro;771 million: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance, &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit, &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance (DCA).  This represents an increase of almost &euro;20 million on expenditure in 2011.

Out of the 2,544 applications received in my Department under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, 1,784 applicants have opted for financial compensation and 760 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation.<\/p><p>To date, a total of 2,105 payments and 180 turf deliveries have been made to applicants at a total cost of &euro;3,409,000.  A cost of &euro;51,000 was incurred in 2011 with the remaining cost of &euro;3,358,000 being incurred in 2012.<\/p><p>The scheme is comprised of a payment of &euro;1,500 per year, index linked, for 15 years or, where feasible, relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs where they can continue to cut turf.<\/p><p>Payments and turf deliveries have been made on the basis that applicants have indicated in their application forms that they fulfil all the qualifying criteria of the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme. My Department has been checking, and will be continuing to check, that all of the qualifying criteria of the scheme have been met in each case.<\/p><p>I am advised that at this stage one applicant has been informed that he does not fulfil the qualifying criteria. He has requested a Departmental review of the decision. Arrangements are also being considered by the Peatlands Council to put in place an appeals system where applicants wish to appeal the outcome of a review by the Department. While it may be anticipated that there will be further instances where applicants do not qualify, priority has been given to processing payments to those who clearly appear to meet the qualifying criteria on the basis of the information provided in their application forms.<\/p><p>3 applicants have been rejected because the areas on which they have been cutting turf are not within a raised bog special area of conservation.<\/p><p>An additional once-off payment of &euro;500 for qualifying turf cutters will be provided where legal agreements are signed with me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. To date, no such payments have been made as my Department has been giving priority to processing the &euro;1,500 per annum payments and requests for the delivery of turf. Based on the number of applicants who have received compensation under the scheme to date, it is estimated that the total cost of the once-off payment will be of the order of &euro;900,000.<\/p><p>Sites nominated for designation between 1997 and 1999<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Site Code<\/th><th>Name<\/th><th>County<\/th><th>No. of Applications Received<\/th><th>No. Opting for

However, it should be noted that in the same period, a total of &#8364;12,833,000.00 worth of fines imposed were reversed as a result of a further application to court.  Fines imposed by courts are criminal sanctions generally payable to the Exchequer or, failing this, to the appropriate agency or authority nominated within the specific legislation that was breached and gave rise to a fine.  Fines are not paid to charities and no fines monies were paid to the Garda Benevolent Fund in 2011.<\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy will be aware, funds are also paid from time to time to charities from the court&#8217;s poor box.  The court poor box is a non-statutory system used mostly by the District Courts to impose a financial charge on a defendant to be used for a charitable purpose, usually instead of imposing a criminal conviction.  Payments made to the court poor box are accounted for by the court office concerned and the accounting procedures are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Generally, charities are the recipients of poor box contributions but the decision is solely at the discretion of the Judge who is independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  I am informed by the Courts Service that in 2011, &#8364;1,733,641.85 was paid into court as a result of poor box orders and of this amount, &#8364;28,138.00 was paid to the Garda Benevolent Fund.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2005, the Law Reform Commission examined the matter in its report entitled <i>The Court Poor Box: Probation of Offenders<\/i>   (LRC 75-2005).  The Commission recognised both the negative and positive aspects of the court use of the poor box and accordingly recommended that the court poor box be replaced by a statutory reparation fund.  A key element of the LRC recommendation was that the reparation fund should be ringfenced and used to assist programmes aimed at preventing offending behaviour and for the purpose of assisting victims of crime.  The Commission was of the view that the reparation fund should remain linked to the criminal justice process and thus broadly adhere to the principles of restorative justice.  I intend to bring forward legislation in the near future to replace the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 with modern provisions dealing with community sanctions and the role of the Probation Service in the criminal justice system.  In the context of that legislation, the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in relation to the court poor box are being examined by my Department with a view to bringing forward proposals for a transparent statutory retribution scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200083#WRK01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":1070,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200083#WRK01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1071,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[55833\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200083#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide details of each service in his Department that is currently outsourced; the company that provides such services and the total cost for these services; the other services which may be outsourced in the future that are currently being run in his Department; the names of the companies, fees paid and nature of service for all contracts awarded from his Department excluding legal, accounting, PR or building refurbishment related services since March 2011","asker":"1078","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1072,"content":"<p>My Department has entered into no new contracts for new externally delivered services since March 2011.

It is very regrettable that this highly beneficial resource is abused in that way, causing great distress to many people. <\/p><p>  There are two approaches to tackling cyberbullying, that is to say, bullying over the internet, by mobile phone or by other technological devices. In the first instance, we must educate and alert people to the problem, how to detect it and how to overcome it. Everyone has a role to play, whether they are parents, teachers, classmates, work or team colleagues or mere 'bystanders'. <\/p><p>  I draw attention to the services available from the organisations participating in the Safer Internet Ireland Project, coordinated by my Department's Office for Internet Safety. The www.webwise.ie site provides valuable information and advice as well as links to other relevant sites.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy refers in particular to social networking sites. They have become very popular especially among younger people. Users need to be aware that those sites have their own rules. They usually have various options such as privacy settings and complaints procedures which may be availed of to prevent any unwanted access. Most of the major social networking sites have signed up to the EU's Safer Social Networking Principles. The Principles promote good practice with an emphasis on enhancing the safety of younger users. <\/p><p>  The second approach entails pursuing perpetrators under the criminal law. The current law has a number of relevant provisions.  Two sections of the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 are especially relevant. Section 5 deals with the offence of threatening to kill or cause serious harm. It has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years. Section 10 provides for the offence of harassment. The section includes harassment 'by any means including by use of the telephone'. This offence attracts a maximum penalty of imprisonment of up to 7 years. <\/p><p>  At my request, the Law Reform Commission is examining an aspect of the requirements in section 10, namely the need to demonstrate persistence in the harassment. I await its conclusions.<\/p><p>  The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 may be relied upon in cases where the cyberbullying entails incitement to hatred on account of race, religion, nationality or sexual orientation.<\/p><p>  The Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 is relevant to the investigation and prosecution of the offences under the 1997 Act. It permits the retention of and access to data for those purposes where the offence is a serious one. In that regard, the Act identifies some specific offences but adds that the term also applies to any offence having a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment or more. The offences in sections 5 and 10 of the 1997 Act meet that criterion. <\/p><p>  While I can understand their reluctance to do so in many instances, victims, their families and friends must realise that their active participation is required if attempts to defeat the cyberbullies are to succeed. They can follow the simple but effective advice on how to deal with unwanted messages and they must assist the Garda&iacute; by reporting cases to them. The criminal law can be employed only when victims come forward and assist the Garda&iacute; in building a case against their tormentors.<\/p><p>  I have no immediate plans for new, more targeted, legislation but I will be keeping the matter under review. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200084#WRL00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":1094,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200084#WRL00400"},{"type":"question","counter":1095,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[56303\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200084#WRL00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if temporary promotions or acting-up allowances have not been a feature of the staffing arrangements for this EU Presidency, if he will confirm that his Department has been given sanction to make such arrangements detailing the number by grade involved, and the date sanction was sought and the date it was given.","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1096,"content":"<p>I have been advised that 11 temporary in nature promotions have been made in my Department as part of the preparation for the EU Presidency in the following grades; 1 Principal Officer; 4 Assistant Principal Officers; 4 Higher Executive Officers and 2 Executive Officers.

The first ship is scheduled for delivery in early 2014. The second ship will follow one year later.<\/p><p>  On the issue of Naval Service training and associated technologies, I am satisfied that Naval Services training techniques and the technologies involved are up to date in all respects. The Naval Service training plan is structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned to the Naval Service by Government.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the equipment issued to the Naval Service is in keeping with the most modern requirements and the highest international standards. The ongoing investment in the Naval Service will ensure that this remains to be the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200084#WRL02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Army Equipment","counter":1111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200084#WRL02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1112,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[55030\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200084#WRL02200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he is satisfied, notwithstanding the economic exigencies within which he must operate, that sufficient resources remain available for training, updating and upgrading of equipment and technology of the regular Army; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1113,"content":"<p> I am satisfied that the level of resources available to the Defence Forces, including equipment and training resources, enables the Defence Forces to carry out their roles both at home and overseas.<\/p><p><br \/>  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a focus for me as Minister for Defence. However, it is imperative that the Department and the Defence Forces, similar to all other Government Departments, must take into account the current difficult economic environment we are now operating in. The budgetary situation will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment and upgrades. Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces. <\/p><p><br \/>  I am advised that military training techniques are up to date in all respects. Defence Forces training plans are specifically structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned to them by Government. The challenges of preparing military units for participation in international peace support operations constitute the major dimension of Defence Forces collective training. The primary focus of this training is the attainment of a capability for military interoperability in order to conduct peace support operations to international standards. Training standards in the Defence Forces are constantly benchmarked against best international practice and Defence Forces personnel have full access to the best international training standards available. <\/p><p><br \/>  A particular focus is maintained in ensuring that modern and effective equipment is available for overseas peace support operations. In this regard, the personal equipment, which the individual soldier has at his\/her disposal in Lebanon and on other overseas missions is second to none and compares very favourably with the equipment in use by other countries.  <i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200084#WRL02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Army Reserve Training","counter":1114,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200084#WRL02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1115,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[55031\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200084#WRL02500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if sufficient resources remain available to ensure training and upgrading of the Army Reserve; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1116,"content":"<p> The central recommendation from the Value for Money Review of the Reserve Defence Force was for the retention of the Reserve with 4,000 personnel spread countrywide to be based in barracks and in 16 other locations.

The SCP is a key programme under the Department of Education and Skills' DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) action plan.<\/p><p>  I wish to inform the Deputy that &euro;26.456m is being allocated to the programme in 2013.  The allocation is in line with the proposals in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure for savings of 6.5% per annum in the SCP for the years 2012-2014.  In September 2012, the Local Management Committee responsible for each individual project was notified that a reduction on last year&rsquo;s allocation would apply for the coming academic cycle.  The full year budget for the SCP was confirmed earlier than in previous years to assist local committees to effectively refine programmes and deliver targeted interventions within budget.<\/p><p>  Each Committee was requested to review its Retention Plan to support young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage in their school, home and community life, to remain in education and to finalise a programme of supports to effectively target available resources to meet local needs.  Projects were advised to scrutinise all elements of expenditure and to seek to reduce costs and achieve efficiencies while prioritising evidence based services to support children&rsquo;s educational outcomes.<\/p><p>  The NEWB, which is responsible for the operational management and direction of the SCP, has made assistance available to each local project to review its planned programme.  The NEWB continues to work closely with management committees, schools and local SCP co-ordinators to ensure student supports are tailored to meet local needs.  The adjustment identified in CRE for 2013 and 2014 will be further considered in the context of a review of the programme to be undertaken in 2013.  This review will address the potential to achieve greater consistency in programme delivery, administration and other costs amongst the 124 local projects and related initiatives.

In keeping with the Government's commitment to increasing standards in the pre-school sector, a higher capitation payment of &euro;73 per week is available to childcare services in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme.

The Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place. This is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market.  <\/p><p>  I was pleased, therefore, to recently publish the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012 on 18 October, to give effect to a new Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) to be applied from 1 January 2013. An effective and robust RES is required in the Irish private health insurance market in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012 is now currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Scheme will take effect from 1 January 2013. The legislation provides for a range of credits to be payable to insurers on behalf of insured persons.  I recently announced the rates of risk equalisation credits to apply in 2013 at the Committee Stage debate on this Bill. <\/p><p>  The rates are funded by a stamp duty payable by all insurers in respect of each insured person. The credit is provided at source &ndash; that is, the cost of the policy is reduced by the amount of the risk equalisation credit. The measures are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums paid in the market and to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, as well as the old and the young. This action is in line with plans to move to Universal Health Insurance, under which everyone will be insured for health care. A strong system of risk equalisation must be in place in order for this to be achieved. A more efficient, cost effective market will lead to greater competition and will encourage people to take out health insurance. The introduction of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012 fulfils the commitment made in the Programme for Government to introduce a system of risk equalisation for the private health insurance market, as we move to develop a new system of universal health insurance.<\/p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, I announced further detail on legislation to provide for the charging of all private patients in public hospitals. Primary legislation will be introduced during 2013 to provide for charging of private in-patients in public hospitals where they are not in a designated private bed.  On that basis, Budget 2013 has provided for additional patient income of &euro;60 million in 2013.  The implementation date will be announced during 2013 when the new legislation is in place.  In the meantime, the maintenance charges for private in-patients in public hospitals remain unchanged. An additional &euro;5 million in patient revenue during 2013 arises from increasing the daily in-patient charge by &euro;5 from &euro;75 to &euro;80. The date of implementation will also be announced later in 2013. These measures are designed to recoup some of the cost of treating private patients in public hospitals and to generate much needed income for the public hospital system. <\/p><p>  The Government remains committed to keeping down both the cost of health insurance, so that it is affordable for as many people as possible, and the general cost of healthcare delivery, as part of measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to a UHI system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200088#WRP01600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Care of the Elderly","counter":1264,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200088#WRP01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1265,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[55711\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200088#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the additional funding that will be provided for the care of older persons in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1266,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[55712\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200088#WRP01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the additional home care packages that will be provided in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1267,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[55713\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121200088#WRP02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the additional home help hours that will be provided in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1268,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 to 224, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  Protecting the vulnerable, including supporting older people to remain at home and in their communities for as long as possible, is a priority for this Government.
