The number of people claiming illness benefit and other disability payments has increased greatly in the past 10 years &ndash; a 44% increase from some 170,000 to some 247,000 between 2001 and 2010.   Alongside those figures, the House will be aware that the Social Insurance Fund, from which illness benefit payments are made, is seriously in deficit, to the tune of some &euro;1.5 billion in 2011.  That is the background against which the question of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay for both the public and private sectors is being considered. <\/p><p>  As well as contributing to tackling the deficit in the social insurance fund, a statutory sick pay scheme would help to limit progression from short-term illness to long-term illness or disability.  It would also serve to bring Ireland into line with practice in other countries in this area.  And, finally, it would contribute towards enhancing the health of the workforce more generally and addressing levels of absenteeism.  As has been pointed out by the OECD, where the State bears all the costs of illnesses, there is less incentive for employers (whether in the private or public sector) to engage actively in managing the costs involved.<\/p><p>  In considering this question, I have to say again that I, along with my colleagues in Government, am acutely conscious of the pressures facing employers in the current economic climate, and in particular, the pressures facing smaller and medium-sized enterprises.  The Government is equally conscious of the need to maintain competitiveness, facilitate business opportunities and generate sustainable employment.  In this regard, I should emphasise that the three day waiting period which currently applies in respect of Illness Benefit would also apply in any scheme of statutory sick pay.<\/p><p>  The question of providing for possible compensatory mechanisms for particularly vulnerable employers is just one of a range of complex issues that need to be addressed before any decision could be taken by Government on the possible introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme.  In the event that Government were to decide to proceed with a scheme of this nature, an impact assessment would form part of the preparatory measures. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600053#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"One-Parent Family Payment Applications","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600053#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[44423\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600053#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she is considering changing the inclusion of child support in the calculation of means in lone parents allowance applications; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>The Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure of &euro;1,062 million on the one parent family payment scheme in 2012.  One parent family payment is a means tested social assistance payment for men and women who are bringing up a child or children with the support of a partner.  There are currently over 89,000 people receiving this payment.  The weekly amount of the payment to each recipient depends on the weekly means of the parent.   When assessing means for the one parent family payment, account is taken of all cash income which the person is receiving.  Thus, for example, where a recipient has earnings from employment, the first &euro;130 per week is disregarded and the balance is assessed at 50%.<\/p><p>  Where a recipient is in receipt of a maintenance payment, this payment is also assessed as means.  Initially, a person&rsquo;s housing costs, if any, of up to &euro;95.23 per week are disregarded for those who pay rent or a mortgage.  Maintenance above this level is assessed at 50%.  Similar arrangements apply across a range of other social assistance schemes such as disability allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.<\/p><p>  As a result of this approach, a recipient will always retain at least half of any maintenance paid.

There are currently approximately 90,000 customers in receipt of this payment.   <\/p><p>As the Department currently funds approximately 30% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review and reflect current market conditions.  New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in place until June 2013.  These new limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available.  For all counties, major urban population centres were tested as part of the rents review to ensure that rent supplement applicants can access temporary housing arrangements whilst seeking employment opportunities.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation. <\/p><p><br \/>  The revised limits are applicable to new rent supplement tenancies from January 2012 and existing tenancies on review.  Approximately 40,000 rent supplement claims have been awarded in 2012 indicating that accommodation can be secured within the new limits.  Where rents are in excess of the limit, customers are being asked to contact their landlord and renegotiate the rent.  Where landlords do not agree to reduce the rent within the limits, staff will discuss the options open to the tenant, including seeking alternative accommodation. <\/p><p><br \/>  Officials administering the scheme advise that customers are securing alternative accommodation within their locality.

The Commission is currently reviewing relevant youth policies across the Member States with a view to making its proposals.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals are expected to be published in December, and achieving political agreement on these proposals in the Council will be a major objective of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency in the first half of 2013.<\/p><p>  In the broadest terms, discussions to date indicate that a guarantee approach would involve identifying a specific target group of young people and ensuring that, within some specified time period after entering unemployment, each of them had either found a job or been placed in an appropriate education, training or work experience programme. <\/p><p>  However, there is considerable variation among Member States with regards to the possible implementation of any such guarantee, in terms of the target groups covered and the extent and nature of the policy commitments made.  The target group may include all persons aged under 25 who become unemployed, or be limited only to those who leave school with low qualification levels and remain &quot;not in employment education or training&quot; (NEET). The specified time period to which the guarantee relates may also vary, as may the type of intervention that is seen as meeting the guarantee.  Experience suggests that the core of any &quot;guarantee&quot; approach requires detailed and human-resource intensive administrative processes and information systems, usually within the public employment service.<\/p><p>  The Department is reviewing arrangements here in the light of these various approaches.  In particular, we are currently assessing the possible implications of any proposal in terms of the administrative, financial and programme resources that would be required.  These resource demands are likely to be particularly acute in Ireland given the current scale of youth unemployment.  However, more precise estimation will not be possible until the details of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals are finalised. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600053#WRA03400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Applications","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600053#WRA03450"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[44553\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600053#WRA03500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to confusion regarding the new process in respect of applying for rent supplement; her views on whether the change whereby persons can no longer make their urgent applications face to face to a community welfare officer but instead have to fill out forms and send these with documentation to a PO box is a backward step; if her attention has been further drawn to the fact that persons are being told they will not receive a decision on their application for months; and if she will reverse this policy and insist that community welfare officers continue to deal with these applications.","asker":"1008","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.

As a result of the large increase in claims being made in recent years, with the number of persons in receipt of the allowance increasing by 62% during the period from 2007 to 2011, it was considered that the processing of rent supplement claims could be delivered more efficiently through centralised units in some areas.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.

The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.

In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.

INTREO is the name for the new service model of the Department integrating the employment services and community programmes formerly of F&Aacute;S, and the Community Welfare Services (CWS) formerly of the HSE and the income support services provided by the Department itself.  <\/p><p>  The integration of functions and the transformation of the way the Department delivers its services were always envisaged as a multi-annual and iterative process of transformation.  The launch of INTREO in Sligo on Monday is a key milestone in that transformation process.<\/p><p>  Building upon the skills and processes in the enlarged Department, a new activation concept, the one-stop-shop has been developed and has been rolled out in four pilot offices, Sligo, King&rsquo;s Inns Parnell Street, Dublin  Arklow and Tallaght.   <\/p><p>  Other offices in Ballymun, Kilkenny, Buncrana, Coolock,  Finglas and Dundalk will go live before the end of the year.

Already clients are seeing the benefits of the integrated decisions process in terms of shorter decision times and in the reduced recourse to supplementary payments in offices where integrated decisions are in operation.  <\/p><p>  On being awarded a claim, the client will also be asked to sign a &lsquo;social contract&rsquo; with the Department.  The client acknowledges their responsibility to work to secure employment at the earliest possible opportunity, on the understanding that failure to adhere to those undertakings may result in the reduction or withdrawal of income support payments.<\/p><p>  The most significant demands of the Pathways approach are i) profiles of clients to inform the approach taken to activation; ii) Early engagement with clients through group engagement sessions; iii) One to one interviews with case managers.<\/p><p>  Progress under each of these headings is as follows (a) the Profiling of all new claimants has been operating in the four pilot one-stop shop locations and is now also operating in all other DSP offices. The roll-out programme has been completed ahead of the December 2012 target; (b) The Department targeted to involve 30,000 clients in group engagements with 20,500 by the end of August.  In fact, more than 42,000 clients had been involved in group engagements by that time; (c) The Department committed to holding 90,000 initial one-to-one guidance interviews with clients by the end of August 2012 but almost 110,000 had been held by that date.  That figure doesn&rsquo;t include the 98,000 follow-up meetings held by the end of August.<\/p><p>  INTREO is also refocusing the Department&rsquo;s relationship with employers. <\/p><p>The level of contact with employers at national and local level is already increasing.

The existence of the Funding Standard itself is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded. Rather the responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed. However, the Funding Standard does provide the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a scheme can live up to the &ldquo;promised&rdquo; level of pension benefits.   The fundamental problem facing pension schemes is that pensions have become significantly more expensive, because of increasing life expectancy and lower than expected investment returns which are reflected in increased annuity rates. The recent facility to purchase sovereign annuities will enable a higher rate of return to apply, but only in the case of those schemes which actually purchase the bonds\/annuities.  <\/p><p>  While it is acknowledged that increased annuity rates are causing significant problems for pension schemes, this reflects the real cost of benefits. If the Funding Standard is changed in such a way that understates the cost of the benefits (by using prescribed non-market rates, or by using sovereign bond rates without a corresponding commitment to buying sovereign annuities on wind-up), then the members may be misled about the ability of the scheme to meet its obligations, and the on-going funding of the scheme will not be enough to close the deficit. This would be likely to make things worse, as future benefits would accrue at a faster rate than they were being paid for. <\/p><p>  The requirement for a risk reserve is being introduced from 2016, to provide a level of protection for scheme members against future volatility in financial markets. It is accepted that the requirement for a risk reserve presents an added challenge for schemes, however, guidance issued by the regulator identifies options which the scheme can consider in meeting this requirement by 2023.<\/p><p>The Pensions Board recently announced that the timeframe for pension schemes to submit funding proposals has been extended to 30 June 2013.

It should be noted that expenditure this year on child benefit, qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments, the family income supplement and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is estimated to be just over &euro;3 billion. The Government is conscious that these payments are an important source of income for families, particularly during a time of recession and unemployment. Furthermore, the Government is committed to tackling Ireland&rsquo;s economic crisis in a way that is fair, balanced, and which recognises the need for social solidarity. In addressing the problems with the public finances, the Government will seek to ensure that resources are allocated fairly and that less well-off families are protected in so far as possible.  Furthermore, the Government is acutely aware of the need to address child poverty as a priority as part of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAPSincl) and in the Programme for Government. The recently completed review of the national poverty target also highlights the importance of addressing child poverty and will be published shortly.<\/p><p>  I assume that the statistics cited by the Deputy relate to the recently published CSO report entitled &ldquo;Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC): Thematic Report on Children 2004 &ndash; 2010&rdquo;.  The report publishes data related to household incomes for seven-year period up to 2010 and is derived from the CSO&rsquo;s annual Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) from which data in relation to poverty up to 2010 had already been published.   The report therefore covers a period before this government&rsquo;s term of office began.<\/p><p>  The Department is aware that the publication shows that average weekly gross income for all households with children less than 18 years did fall from &euro;1,288.33 in 2009 to &euro;1,184.00 in 2010 or a fall of 8.1% in the year. I am also aware that the corresponding data for households without children under 18 years were &euro;924.65 and &euro;902.23 respectively representing a fall of 2.4% in the year. <\/p><p>  It should be borne in mind that these trends largely reflected the decline in household incomes generally, as a consequence of the economic downturn.  Direct income of households with children (largely income from employment and self-employment) fell by almost 11% in the year 2010.  In fact, it was an increase in average transfer payments of almost 2% that moderated the loss of gross income for such households to 8.1%.   The operation of the tax and social contribution system served further to moderate this loss in net incomes to 7.4% compared to 2.3% for households without children.<\/p><p>   While we must acknowledge this considerable loss in purchasing power, the moderation in the loss from direct to net incomes is largely due to the relative effectiveness of the social welfare system and the effect of family related social transfers.  It  can also be observed from CSO data in how the at risk of poverty rate for people living in households with children in 2010 decreased from 49.4 per cent when all social transfers were excluded to 18.7 per cent when all social transfers were included: a reduction of nearly 31 percentage points. This clearly demonstrates the role that social transfers, play in protecting people in households with children from poverty. More generally, the SILC data from this report also shows that the poverty reduction effect of social transfers for children has risen continuously from around 40% in 2004 to over 60% in 2010 as the social welfare system became more effective in addressing poverty in households with children. <\/p><p>  Nonetheless, I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports raises complex issues about the effectiveness and efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will assist the Government in considering the effectiveness and efficiency of the current system of child income supports.<\/p><p>  Any plans to change child and family income support payments will be a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day. As the Government meets and acts collectively, Ministers regularly consult with their colleagues in Government on policy proposals and any implications that they might have in terms of children&rsquo;s rights.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600054#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Review","counter":110,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600054#WRB02550"},{"type":"question","counter":111,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[44551\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600054#WRB02600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will reconsider the decision to limit participation on community employment schemes to one year as the general rule in view of (details supplied)","asker":"1066","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":112,"content":"<p>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary, fixed term basis.

There are no plans to extend the time limits on CE. The emphasis on shorter-term interventions on CE as part of the Pathways to Work Initiative is to assist the maximum number of eligible persons via participation on the scheme.

All payments are made from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).  There are two types of redundancy payment made from the SIF - rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and\/or in receivership or liquidation.  <\/p><p>  It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all their eligible employees.  An employer who pays statutory redundancy payments to their employees is then entitled to a rebate of a portion of that payment from the State.  Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  <\/p><p>  Significant and increasing amounts have been paid out in redundancy rebates to employers from the SIF in recent years.  While the SIF is constituted primarily from employer contributions, the taxpayers&rsquo; contribution is also significant.  One of the factors which influenced the Government&rsquo;s decision to revise the rebate rate was the increasing cost of rebates in recent years.<\/p><p>  I am very concerned about the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund.   In term of redundancy rebate payments to employers, &euro;152.2 million was paid out in 2006; &euro;167.4 million in 2007; &euro;161.8 million in 2008; &euro;247.9 million in 2009; &euro;373.2 million in 2010 and &euro;185.3 million in 2011.

The new changes apply where the date of dismissal by reason of redundancy occurs on or after 1 January 2012.  <\/p><p>  I do not see why this country should continue to borrow money to plug the hole in the Social Insurance Fund in order to fund the cost of making people redundant &ndash; often from very profitable companies.  <\/p><p>  As part of the deliberations on Budget 2012, the approach taken in other countries was examined and it was decided that the 60% level of rebate is not sustainable in the current economic climate.

The number of rental properties available in North Kildare is somewhat lower than the numbers available in the rest of the county and therefore impacts on the number of accommodation units available for rent supplement.

Seven staff from my Department availed of the civil service special incentive career break scheme which was introduced for a limited time in 2009.

Most of the expenditure on advertising related to public notices for the National Day of Commemoration, and to the Department&rsquo;s entry in the State Directory pages of the phone books.

The Government decided in December 2011 to allocate a budget in the order of &euro;60m over 2012 and 2013 to resource the Presidency, which excludes security costs. This budget is broadly in line with budgets for recent Presidencies and is less than the budget for the Irish Presidency in 2004 where total expenditure was in excess of &euro;93 million.<\/p><p>  An effectively managed Presidency will deliver long-term reputational benefit for Ireland.  Short-term benefits include significant benefits for the local economy from an influx of up to 15,000 delegates, press and representatives of NGOs who will use local services including hotels, restaurants, taxis etc. over the six month Presidency period.  The use of Dublin Castle and a small number of other state-owned venues mainly in Dublin to host most Presidency meetings will reduce venue hire, transport and set-up costs, not to mention significantly reducing the &ldquo;carbon footprint&rdquo; of the Presidency.  To date, expenditure on Presidency related items by all Departments is just over &euro;4.2 million. However, that figure is expected to rise rapidly as additional staff is deployed to the Presidency and payments to service providers and suppliers begin to fall due over the coming months.<\/p><p>  The procurement of most logistical requirements for the Presidency is being centralised to reduce costs, reduce administrative burden, and increase efficiencies. Procurement is being carried out on a collaborative basis involving principally my Department, the National Procurement Service and the Office of Public Works. Purchasing is being conducted in a transparent and competitive basis in compliance with relevant EU and national rules which, among other things, require that contracts over certain value thresholds (&euro;130,000 for goods and services) be advertised and open to EU-wide competition.  It is too early to say at this stage how much of the procurement spend will accrue to domestic firms, but I can confirm that domestic suppliers and service providers are actively and successfully competing for tenders to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600055#WRC04400","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illegal Israeli Settlements","counter":201,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600055#WRC04450"},{"type":"question","counter":202,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[44337\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600055#WRC04500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on whether the EU Council of Foreign Ministers should adopt an EU wide policy preventing Israeli settlement products being sold in the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1007","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":203,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[44345\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600055#WRC04600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will end trade with illegal Israeli settlements; and also highlight ongoing human rights abuses in Palestinian territories (details supplied).","asker":"1017","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":204,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 131 together.<\/p><p>  I have answered many questions on the issue of settlement products and the situation has not changed.

To successfully deliver on that objective we need to tackle the ongoing financial crisis, and restore stability to the Euro zone, but the focus must be on generating growth in the EU economy and getting Europe back to work.  <\/p><p>  During the Presidency the Government will deliver on its ambitions through a range of policy and legislative measures that cut across a broad range of policy areas which will push forward the growth and jobs agenda.  As an export-driven economy, Ireland has reaped the benefits of the European Single Market, but the global economy has evolved.  One of the aims of the Single Market Act II, which was published by the European Commission on 3 October, will be to respond to changes in the economy, particularly by exploiting the potential of the digital economy for business and consumers.  <\/p><p>  As Presidency Ireland will work to underpin and stimulate research and innovation across the EU for the coming decade by advancing agreement on the Horizon 2020 framework programme which can play an important role in boosting the EU economy, generating smart and sustainable growth and jobs, and strengthening the Union&rsquo;s global competitiveness.  The Presidency will deliver a major effort in the field of research and innovation with a range of thematic events planned and a commitment to advance decisions on key legislation in this rapidly growing area where the EU can become a global leader.  <\/p><p>  Ireland will make significant advances in the external trade agenda during its Presidency and will hold a meeting of Trade Ministers in Ireland during the Presidency which will focus on the EU-US trade relationship.  <\/p><p>  The Presidency will make special efforts to address the problem of youth unemployment across the EU and will work closely with partners to seek solutions to tackle this fundamental challenge.  <\/p><p>  Europe&rsquo;s economy can only grow if there is stability and confidence in the EU economy.  For this reason, the Irish Presidency will work to ensure the effective implementation of recent economic governance measures, and to make progress on the Banking Union proposals.  The third main priority of the Irish Presidency will be the EU&rsquo;s future budget to underpin growth and to sharpen Europe&rsquo;s global competitiveness.  The Irish Government supports the Cyprus Presidency in its efforts to reach agreement on the MFF and stands ready to take forward the necessary implementing legislation to ensure that the EU has a budget to support programmes that are of major economic importance to Member States such as CAP, CFP and Horizon 2020 (the EU's future framework programme for research and innovation) for the 2014-2020 period.  These programmes can play a key role in spurring economic growth and creating employment.  <\/p><p>  Work on the Irish Presidency is a top priority across all Departments as the Presidency nears.  The Government met with the College of Commissioners on 3 October in Brussels and the President of the European Parliament also visited Dublin on 3-4 October.  We were pleased with the outcomes of the both meeting which confirmed that there is broad agreement between the Government and partners on the main priorities and objectives that we have identified at this stage of planning for our Presidency.  Issues discussed at the meetings will feed into the drafting of the Presidency programme which will be published in December.  <\/p><p>  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600056#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":228,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600056#WRD01750"},{"type":"question","counter":229,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[39026\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600056#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he intends to discuss at the next EU Council meeting the ongoing situation in Syria which has resulted in thousands of lives being lost; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":230,"content":"<p>The deeply worrying situation in Syria was one of the principal items addressed at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg on 15 October which I attended. Discussion focussed on the heightened tensions currently existing between Syria and Turkey and the dangers of the conflict spreading into the wider region. Considerable attention was also devoted to the worsening humanitarian situation, with 1.5 million Syrians internally displaced and an estimated 300,000 refugees having fled to neighbouring countries.   Syria was also discussed at a dinner meeting which I and my EU counterparts had with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov last Sunday evening, prior to the Council. I had already met with Foreign Minister Lavrov while attending the UN General Assembly in New York last month and had discussed Syria in detail at that stage and encouraged Russia to use its considerable influence on the situation to end the violence and promote a meaningful political transition in Syria.<\/p><p>  The Foreign Affairs Council agreed detailed Conclusions on Syria which made clear that the EU continues to stand by the Syrian people in their courageous struggle for freedom, dignity and democracy. The Council also expressed deep concern concerning the spill-over effects of the Syrian crisis in neighbouring countries and strongly condemned the shelling by Syrian forces of Turkish territory, including the attack on the border town of Akcakale on 3 October.<\/p><p>  The absolute priority remains stopping all violence and ending oppression and, in this regard, the Council once again warned against the dangers of further militarisation and radicalisation of the conflict. The Council also expressed its full support for the efforts of the UN\/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, to secure an early ceasefire and promote an overall political settlement. <\/p><p>  The Council also addressed the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation and recalled the moral imperative for the international community to step up assistance to all affected populations in Syria and neighbouring countries. Ireland, for its part, is already making a substantial contribution to humanitarian relief efforts, having provided &euro;2.45 million in assistance to date, principally channelled through UNHRC, ICRC and WHO. Development Minister Costello also visited Zatari refugee camp in Jordan at the end of August.<\/p><p>  I have consistently reiterated that there needs to be accountability for all the very many serious human rights violations committed in Syria and that is why nationally we support referral of the situation by the UN Security Council to the International Criminal Court. The Council for its part equally reiterated that all those responsible for serious human rights abuses must be held accountable and welcomed the extension of the mandate of the UN Commission of Inquiry investigating such events in Syria.<\/p><p>  The Council also approved a further round of restrictive measures targeted against the Assad regime and it supporters, giving the Syrian government&rsquo;s continuing clear failure to end repression and desist from waging war and inflicting horrendous suffering on its own people. While EU sanctions have been effective in increasing pressure on the Assad regime, I continue to believe the most effective measure which could be taken now to end the violence in Syria would be the imposition of a comprehensive arms embargo by the Security Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600056#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Issues","counter":231,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600056#WRD01950"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[39019\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600056#WRD02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he is concerned about the violence that erupted in north Belfast when members of the PSNI were injured; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[39020\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600056#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on whether enough is being done by the Northern Ireland executive in order to prevent violence in north Belfast reoccurring","asker":"992","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":234,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 140 together.<\/p><p>  This summer's parades in Northern Ireland were once again marred by outbreaks of violence, most significantly in North Belfast where there were serious disturbances in the Ardoyne on 12 July and in the Carrick Hill\/Carlisle Circus area over several evenings in late August and early September.  Such violence is totally unacceptable.  The disturbances in Carrick Hill\/Carlisle Circus resulted in injuries to 65 PSNI officers.  I condemn those involved in violence against the police service and I am pleased to note that charges have been brought in a number of cases. <\/p><p>These riots caused serious concerns regarding community relations in advance of the parades commemorating the centenary of the signing of the Ulster Covenant, which took place on Saturday 29 September. In the event, the parades, which involved 208 bands and over 30,000 marchers, passed off without violence, following extensive behind-the-scenes efforts, although several breaches of the Parades Commission determinations were reported to the authorities. <\/p><p>  I commend the First Minister and Deputy First Minister for moving quickly to defuse the situation and using their offices to liaise with the various interested parties, as well as the efforts of MLAs, Councillors, the churches and community representatives.   <\/p><p>  Respect is the key to preventing and resolving violence related to parades and sectarianism, and I applaud efforts to facilitate dialogue between residents and parade organisers. I have discussed this matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on a number of occasions since she took up office, and we agreed to work together to support efforts to address division and sectarianism and to help promote the shared future agenda.<\/p><p>I would like to welcome the apology provided by the Royal Black Institution for the incident outside St Patrick&rsquo;s Church in Carrick Hill on 25 August, and hope that this will clear the way for further progress in relation to parades in Belfast.  <\/p><p>  Irish Government officials monitored events leading up to the Covenant parade closely and used every opportunity to underline the importance of dialogue and respect. They remained in regular contact with local residents and clergy in advance of the parade, as efforts were made to address residents' concerns. At the request of the residents, the feeder parades were monitored on the ground by my officials. Both the Taoiseach and myself were fully briefed as the situation evolved, and I was heartened that the parade passed off peacefully. <\/p><p>  It must be recognised that the Parades Commission also played a key role in working to promote a peaceful outcome to the Covenant parade. It continues to work to address the parades issue in a very challenging environment, and it is essential that the determinations of the Parades Commission are respected and upheld as the rule of law.<\/p><p>  The scenes of rioting in early September made international headlines and underlined the urgent need to address the root causes of division and sectarianism in Northern Ireland. They also underlined the potential for sectarian acts to destabilise the situation generally and for new flashpoints to emerge. In the absence of a clear strategy to address the causes of division in Northern Ireland, events such as those we have seen in recent weeks risk damaging community relations in general, undermining economic regeneration strategies for Belfast and tarnishing Northern Ireland&rsquo;s improving international reputation for stability and political progress. <\/p><p>  These events underline the importance and urgency at this time of the Northern Ireland Executive delivering on and implementing an agreed Strategy for Cohesion, Sharing and Integration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600056#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"North-South Implementation Bodies","counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600056#WRD02250"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[40261\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600056#WRD02300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the proposals he has made for developing cross-border institutions.","asker":"992","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":237,"content":"<p>The Government is firmly committed to developing cross border cooperation in every possible respect.

This body will meet twice yearly on a rotational basis and I am confident that it will add to the momentum for closer cooperation. <\/p><p>  There has been valuable progress in cooperation through the North-South Ministerial Council and the North South Implementation Bodies.  <\/p><p>  Across a range of issues, the NSMC is facilitating economic and social sector activities on a cross-border, all-island basis.

However progress on the Second and Third Terms of Reference of the Review, which include the case for additional bodies and areas of co-operation within the NSMC, has been disappointingly slow.

In addition, the planning approach agreed foresees the provision of centralised services to Departments for the Presidency where it is advantageous to do so. <\/p><p>  This centralised approach, led by my Department, is being adopted in order to reduce overall resource costs, to ease the administrative burden for other Departments and to avoid duplication of effort.

Revenue has an enforcement presence at all key airports and ports and at other strategic locations throughout the State.  Enforcement strength at particular locations is regularly augmented with additional personnel on a risk-assessment basis, or when particular operations are taking place. Revenue enforcement officers also target the illicit tobacco trade at the post-importation level at inland locations.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy will appreciate that for reasons of operational sensitivity the Commissioners are not in a position to provide details of enforcement deployment at any given location.  The Deputy will be aware that Revenue&#8217;s overall staff numbers have been reduced over the past two years in the context of Government policy on civil service numbers.  However, the Revenue Commissioners assure me that their enforcement resources have been prioritised and are reinforced as necessary for particular operations.<\/p><p><br \/>  Revenue employs a broadly based strategy in order to intercept illegal tobacco product and to prosecute those involved in the trade.  This involves the optimal deployment of enforcement resources at points of importation and inland through the use of risk analysis and profiling methods and the employment of modern detection technologies.  A key element in this strategy is the development and sharing of intelligence between enforcement agencies at a national, EU and international level.  Revenue enforcement officers target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises, in order to disrupt the internal distribution network for illicit tobacco.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In 2011, a total of 109.08m cigarettes and 11,158 kgs of tobacco, with a retail value of &#8364;49.95m, was seized by Revenue.  There were 160 court convictions for cigarette smuggling and illegal selling of tobacco products, resulting in 45 custodial sentences, some of which were suspended, 10 community service orders and &#8364;254,650 in fines imposed.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2012 to date,<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>a total of 89.8m cigarettes and 3,402 kgs of tobacco, with a retail value of &#8364;41.76m,<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>have been seized.  There have been 101 court convictions for cigarette smuggling and illegal selling of tobacco products, resulting in 41 custodial sentences, some of which were suspended, 3 community service orders and &#8364;174,550 in fines imposed. <\/p><p><br \/>  Revenue avails of media reporting of major illegal tobacco seizures to remind persons tempted to buy cheap cigarettes from an irregular source of supply that there is a high possibility they are buying counterfeit goods, which provide an unknown set of health risks as the product is not the subject of quality control.  The illegal tobacco trade also takes much needed funds from the exchequer, hurts legitimate trade and funds criminal activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600057#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Residency Rules Review","counter":297,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600057#WRE02150"},{"type":"question","counter":298,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[44163\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600057#WRE02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the date on which the outcome of the public consultation on tax residence will be made known; if the recommendations of this review will be made in time to form part of Budget 2013 to ensure that tax exiles make a fair contribution to the Exchequer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1023","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[44164\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600057#WRE02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of submissions received in relation to the recent public consultation on tax residence rules; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1023","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":300,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[44165\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600057#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether a test based on a persons centre of vital interests should be used when determining their tax residence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1023","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":301,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166 to 168, inclusive, together. <\/p><p>  The Programme for Government update in March 2012 confirmed the commitment to undertake a consultation process on residence issues in 2012 to inform preparation for possible further changes in 2013.  I launched the public consultation on tax residence rules in May this year, wherein I invited interested parties to make submissions on possible revisions to the current residence rules for the taxation of individuals.<\/p><p>  This consultation process has now concluded.  A total of eight submissions have been received and these will be published in due course, as indicated when the consultation was announced.  My officials are considering the submissions and will be advising me on possible further changes as part of the preparations for Budget 2013.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government indicated that, as part of its fiscal policy, the Government will ensure that &ldquo;tax exiles&rdquo; make a fair contribution to the Exchequer.  In Budget 2012 I abolished the &ldquo;citizenship condition&rdquo; for payment of the Domicile Levy to ensure that individuals could not avoid the levy by renouncing their citizenship.  I also stated that I intend to keep the contentious issue of the tax treatment of &ldquo;tax exiles&rdquo; (which is linked to the tax residence rules) under constant review.  <\/p><p>  While the application of the rules in particular circumstances is being considered, the taxation of individuals in the State is broadly in line with the system prevailing in most other OECD jurisdictions, that is to say &mdash; <\/p><p>(a) individuals who are resident in the State for tax purposes are taxable here on their worldwide income; and <\/p><p>(b) individuals who are not resident for tax purposes pay tax here only on income arising in the State and on income derived from working here.<\/p><p>  The OECD model tax convention describes a &lsquo;Centre of Vital Interest&rsquo; test as one of the criteria used to resolve the problem of dual residence of individuals.  It refers to the place where the taxpayer's personal and economic relationships are closer.  It is one of the criteria used as a &ldquo;tie breaker&rdquo; in Double Taxation Agreements to determine in which state an individual is resident.  Specific mention was also made in the consultation document to its use as an additional criterion on other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>  The application of the residence rules and all related matters are under consideration in the run up to Budget 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600057#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates Issues","counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600057#WRE02550"},{"type":"question","counter":303,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[44171\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600057#WRE02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the recent decision by Allied Irish Bank to increase the interest rates on their variable rate mortgages; if he has had any contact with the bank since the decision was made; and his views on whether this decision will further add to the problem of mortgage arrears.","asker":"1178","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":304,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Bank&#8217;s policy in relation to interest rates is a matter for the management and board of the institution.

A review of the provisions contained in the switching code, with a view to making  any necessary enhancements, will be carried out by the Central Bank and  concluded by end Q2 2012&quot;<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  In December 2011, under  the EU Commission decision (SA.33443) approving the Bank of Ireland revised restructuring plan, the Irish authorities committed to undertake a revised package of alternative measures in order to restore the competition in the Irish banking market by facilitating entry and expansion of competitors and enhancing the consumer protection in the financial sector.  In particular, Ireland committed to carry out specific measures in order to enhance: <\/p><p>&quot; (a) Customer mobility and protection (provision of information; transparency to facilitate consumer decision making; financial inclusion); <\/p><p>(b) Entry of competitors (electronic banking, SEPA migration, quality and availability of credit history information and reporting by banks);<\/p><p>(c)   Corporate governance.&quot;<\/p><p><br \/>  The specific commitment agreed in relation to switching is:  <\/p><p><i>&quot; The Central Bank of Ireland will:<\/i><\/p><p><i>(i) carry out a review of the provisions contained in the Code of Conduct on the Switching of Current Accounts,<\/i><\/p><p><i>(ii) ensure that any necessary changes to the Code of Conduct on the Switching of Current Accounts following its review will be published by end Q2 2012.&quot;<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  I am informed by the Central Bank that the obligation under the first part of the initial commitment was met with the publication, of the Code of Conduct on the Switching of Current Accounts with Credit Institutions (the Switching Code) on 1 October 2010.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In 2011, the Central Bank began its review of the Switching Code with a theme-based inspection and mystery shopping exercise (the 2011 Review).  The inspection was aimed at assessing how well the switching process works in practice for consumers.  The mystery shopping exercise was undertaken to determine the awareness and understanding of the Switching Code amongst frontline bank<font color=\"#008250\"> <\/font>  branch staff.  The 2011 Review confirmed that once a consumer began the switching process, it generally ran smoothly.<\/p><p><br \/>  In June 2012  the Central Bank published a Discussion Paper<font color=\"#104160\"> <\/font>outlining the outcome of the review undertaken by the Bank on the operation of the Switching Code together with possible enhancements to the Switching Code as a result of that review. The Discussion Paper posed a number of questions to interested parties on issues connected with switching and how the Switching Code could be further enhanced or expanded to support the switching process. Interested parties were invited to respond the questions posed in this Discussion Paper by 30 September 2012<b>.  <\/b>  A total of 4 submissions were received in response to the Discussion Paper, all of which will be published on the Central Bank's website in the coming weeks.

ARFs are not pension schemes per se. They are investment options into which the proceeds of certain pension arrangements can be invested on retirement. Under the &ldquo;ARF option&rdquo; individuals are entitled to take their retirement lump sum and, with the balance of their pension fund, purchase an annuity, invest in an ARF or take the balance in cash subject to tax.  Where the ARF route is chosen, beneficial ownership of the assets in the ARF vests in the individual.    ARFs are managed by Qualifying Fund Managers and any investment income or capital gains arising are exempt from tax while the funds are invested in the ARF. There is no requirement on Qualifying Fund Managers who hold and manage ARFs on behalf of individuals to provide data to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the value of ARF assets, the numbers of ARFs held by them or, in the context of the question, on the accrued income or gains arising from the investments in such funds. I am not, therefore, in a position to provide the definitive statistical data requested by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  Electing to invest in an ARF or to receive the balance of a pension fund in cash are subject to conditions. The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed level of pension income (&ldquo;specified income&rdquo;) actually in payment for life at the time the option is exercised.  <\/p><p>  Finance Act 2011 increased the &ldquo;specified income&rdquo; limit from the previous fixed amount of &euro;12,700 introduced in 1999, to a variable amount equal to 1.5 times the maximum annual rate of the State Pension (Contributory) at the time the option is exercised, bringing the &ldquo;specified income&rdquo; limit to &euro;18,000 per annum at present.  This is the only income requirement attaching to the qualifying conditions for an ARF at retirement.<\/p><p>  I should point out that sums withdrawn from an ARF are subject to tax at the individual ARF-owner&rsquo;s marginal income tax rate. The 2006 Budget and Finance Act introduced an imputed or notional distribution of 3% of the value of the assets in an ARF on 31 December each year, which notional amount is taxed at the ARF owner&rsquo;s marginal income tax rate. This measure was introduced because the internal review of tax relief for pensions provision undertaken by the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners in 2005 found that the ARF option was largely not being used, as intended, to fund an income stream in retirement but, in certain cases, was being used to build up substantial funds in a tax-free environment over the long-term. The imputed distribution measure is designed to encourage the use of ARFs, as intended, in the way of actual draw downs being made which are subject to tax.<\/p><p>  The annual imputed distribution of ARF assets was increased from 3% to 5% in Budget and Finance Act 2011 in respect of asset values as at 31 December 2010 and future years. It was further increased from 5% to 6% for ARFs with asset values in excess of &euro;2 million at 31 December 2012 and future years.

The corresponding full year yield from increasing the average effective tax rate of the top 10% of income earners (which clearly includes the top 5% of income earners referred to above) from the existing average rate of 33% to 40%, would be of the order of &euro; 1.9 billion.<\/p><p>  The Deputy should note that to increase the effective tax rate to 50% and 40% for the top 5% and 10% of income earners respectively would mean having to increase the top marginal rates of tax significantly and would also involve restricting access to the basic tax credits and tax bands as well as all tax reliefs in addition to the restrictions that are already in place for certain categories of higher income earners.  The top marginal rates of tax are currently 52% and 55% for PAYE workers and self-employed respectively.  While it is not possible to be precise the top marginal rates of tax would increase to in excess of 70%.  <\/p><p>  The marginal tax rate is described as the tax rate that applies to the last euro of the tax base.  Marginal tax rates are important because they influence individual decisions to work more or indeed to work at all.  The OECD working paper Tax and Economic Growth indicates that &ldquo;there is also the possibility that high top marginal rates will increase the average tax rates paid by high-skilled and high-income earners so much that they will migrate to countries with lower rates resulting in a brain drain which may lower innovative activity and productivity&rdquo;  . Higher marginal tax rates for earners may also incentivise a greater level of tax evasion and contribute to the development of a shadow economy.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the top 5% of income earners earn 24% of the total gross income and already pay 43% of the total income tax and 39% of the total income tax, USC and PRSI. While the top 10% of income earners earn 35% of the total gross income and pay 59% of the total income tax and 53% of the total income tax, USC and PRSI.   <\/p><p>  The yield figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2009 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim. These are, therefore, provisional and likely to be revised. In addition, it should be noted that Gross Income is as defined in Revenue Statistical Report 2010.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600058#WRF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":355,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600058#WRF01850"},{"type":"question","counter":356,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[44304\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600058#WRF01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of profits made by companies registered here in 2011; and the total amount of tax paid and to break down the profits and tax paid into bands starting from &euro;0 to &euro;100,000, &euro;100,000 to &euro;500,000, &euro;500,000 to &euro;1 million, &euro;1 million to &euro;5 million, &euro;5 million to &euro;20 million, &euro;20 million to &euro;100 million, &euro;100 million to &euro;500,000 million, &euro;500,000 to &euro;1 billion and more than &euro;1 billion.","asker":"1003","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[44305\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600058#WRF02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of companies that pay tax in each of the corporate tax brackets; the amount of profits they declare; the amount of tax they pay and the average effective tax rate in tabular form.","asker":"1003","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 190 together.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the relevant information is contained in Table CTS 1 of the Statistical Reports published annually by the Commissioners and which can be found on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie.

would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the  Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; obligation to observe confidentiality in relation to the taxation affairs of individual taxpayers and small groups of

Accordingly, they are not in a position to provide a breakdown in relation to incomes exceeding &euro;10 million as requested, due to the relatively small numbers of companies with incomes in excess of that level.<\/p><p>Regarding the tax rates, all companies operating in Ireland are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on their trading profits.  A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits. This rate also applies in respect of certain petroleum, mining or land dealing activities.  Companies&rsquo; capital gains are effectively chargeable at the capital gains tax rate and the rate was increased; from 20 per cent to 22 per cent for disposals on or after 15 October 2008; to 25% for disposals on or after 8 April 2009 and; to 30 per cent for disposals on or after 7 December 2011.<\/p><p>With regard to the effective tax rate, the Deputy has been advised in my previous replies to his questions on this subject that there are different ways of measuring the effective rate of corporation tax depending on the variables that are used.  As there is no single internationally agreed comparative measure in place, I am not in a position to provide such a measure.<\/p><p>That said, when responding to questions in the House last year, I did mention that one estimate of the effective rate of corporation tax in Ireland is 11.9%.  This figure came from a 2011 <i>Paying Taxes<\/i> study produced by the World Bank and PriceWaterhouseCoopers as part of an annual <i>Doing Business<\/i>   report and includes a measurement of effective tax rates across 183 countries. This effective tax rate was calculated based on the tax obligations of a standardised company operating in each country of the study and using standard assumptions regarding exemptions, deductions and allowances.<\/p><p>Another recent study by the European Commission &ndash; <i>Taxation Trends in the EU 2011<\/i>   - also indicates that Ireland has an effective corporate tax rate which is close to, or indeed higher than, the statutory 12.5% rate (the rate identified is, in fact, higher than 12.5% perhaps because of the higher 25% tax rate that applies, generally, to non-trading profits).<\/p><p>The above calculations are to give the Deputy examples of the differences that exist in comparative studies on effective tax rates, depending on how the rate is calculated or who carries out the calculation.  However, the fact that these effective tax rates are close to our headline rate is reflective of the strong transparency around Ireland&rsquo;s 12.5% corporation tax regime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600058#WRF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treasury Management Agency Staff","counter":359,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600058#WRF02150"},{"type":"question","counter":360,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[44340\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600058#WRF02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of staff members in the National Treasury Management Agency and its constituent bodies that are on secondment from the private sector or publicly controlled financial institutions whether bank or insurance company; if he will list their current duties; the institution or business from which they transferred; their previous duties before secondment; how the NTMA controls for conflict of interest; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":361,"content":"<p>The following table details the staff members of the National Treasury Management Agency who are on secondment from the private sector:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Organisation \/ Business Unit<\/th><th>Number of Staff on Secondment<\/th><th>Institution on Secondment from:<\/th><th>Current duties within NTMA<\/th><th>Previous Duties before Secondment<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>NAMA<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td>KPMG<\/td><td>Provision of specialist tax services to NAMA.<\/td><td>Prior to secondment, the duties of the secondee included the provision of tax advisory services to the firm&#8217;s clients. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td>McCann Fitzgerald<\/td><td>Provision of specialist legal services to NAMA.<\/td><td>Prior to secondment, the duties of the secondee included the provision of legal services to the  firm&#8217;s clients.  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><td>Grant Thornton<\/td><td>Provision of specialist accountancy services to NAMA.<\/td><td>Prior to secondment, the duties of the secondees included the provision of accounting and transactional services to the firm&#8217;s clients.   <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NTMA Legal Unit <\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><td>A&amp;L Goodbody Solicitors<\/td><td>Provision of legal advice to the NewERA Unit.<\/td><td>Associate within Projects and Construction Department. <\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>With regard to control procedures concerning conflicts of interest, secondees sign an undertaking that they will comply with the NTMA&rsquo;s Code of Practice on Confidentiality and Professional Conduct for Secondees.

Revenue&rsquo;s tax and duty compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow\/hidden economy.  I am advised that Revenue tackles the problem of tax and duty evasion through their range of compliance and audit interventions including through targeted special projects. Case interventions are undertaken based on Revenue&rsquo;s assessment of compliance risks, the level of those risks and other relevant information available.

Lump sum amounts up to &euro;200,000 are paid free of tax. They are also paid free of USC. The portion of a lump sum between &euro;200,001 and &euro;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%. This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum. No USC is chargeable. Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &euro;575,000 is taxed at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available). In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess. These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums aggregating with later lump sums.    I assume from the Deputy&rsquo;s question that he is proposing that retirement lump sums in excess of &euro;100,000 be taxed as outlined above. As there is no general requirement for data on the number of persons who are receiving payments of retirement lump sums of less than &euro;200,000 to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to provide definitive figures on the Exchequer impact of reducing the tax-free retirement lump sum amount from &euro;200,000 to &euro;100,000.<\/p><p>  As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the savings involved, it is estimated that just over 33,000 individuals in the public service would be on salaries of over &euro;67,000 and less than &euro;133,500 which, under existing pension scheme arrangements generally applying across the public service, would deliver retirement lump sums of between &euro;100,000 and &euro;200,000 to persons retiring after a full 40 year career. If it is assumed that these individuals would retire in line with retirement trends from the public service in a normal year (about 2.5%), then the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums in excess of &euro;100,000 at 20% could be about &euro;8 million in a full year.<\/p><p>  I have no data on which to provide a similar estimate in relation to the private sector. I should point out, however, that one significant difference between public sector and private sector pension schemes is that private sector schemes invariably allow scheme members the option of commuting part of their pension fund for a tax-free lump sum. The option of receiving benefits in the form of pension only is not available to members of public sector schemes. Depending on the impact of any tax charge on retirement lump sums, the option to commute part of a pension fund may no longer be exercised by private sector pension scheme members or may be exercised in a manner that reduces the value of the lump sum taken to minimise or avoid any immediate tax charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600058#WRF04500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":397,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600059#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":398,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[44516\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600059#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount that could be raised for the Exchequer if the imputed distribution percentage on approved retirement funds was increased from 6% to 7% for ARFs with assets of &euro;1 million or more.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":399,"content":"<p>An annual imputed distribution rate of 5% applies to approved retirement funds (ARFs) with asset values of &euro;2 million or less and, from this tax year, to &lsquo;vested&rsquo; Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs where benefits have commenced) on the same basis. A higher imputed distribution rate of 6% applies from this tax year to ARFs and\/or &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs with asset values of more than &euro;2 million. I assume the Deputy is suggesting an increase in the imputed distribution from 6% to 7% for ARFs and\/or &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs of more than &euro;2 million in value and an increase from 5% to 7% where the asset values are greater than &euro;1 million and less than &euro;2 million.   I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information provided to them in the context of the tax paid on these deemed or imputed distributions does not include information on the value of the ARFs out of which the distributions are deemed to arise. There is therefore no basis on which a definitive estimate of the impact on the Exchequer of the change mentioned in the question could be compiled. <\/p><p>  As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the additional tax yield involved, data made available to my Department from private sector sources provides a breakdown of ARFs by value in respect of a number of providers representing an estimated 40% of the ARF market. There is no similar data available in relation to &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs.<\/p><p>  Out of a total value of some &euro;2.4 billion in ARFs under management by these providers where the average ARF value was just over &euro;127,000, the total value of those ARFs representing individual funds of over &euro;1m and under &euro;2 million was &euro;274 million. The total value of those ARFs representing individual funds of over &euro;2m was &euro;137 million. Based on a very rough extrapolation of these figures to arrive at a broad potential estimate for the total value of ARFs with assets in excess of &euro;1 million, the estimated additional tax yield from applying increased imputed distribution rates to such ARFs as set out above would be about &euro;6.5 million in a full year. <\/p><p>  It is important to note that the deemed or imputed distribution measure is designed to encourage draw downs from ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs so that they are used, as intended, to fund a stream of income in retirement in the same way as a retirement annuity, for which ARFs are supposed to operate as a more flexible alternative. The measure, in itself, does not give rise to significant tax revenues as it does not apply to actual draw-downs from ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs, which are taxed in the normal way. Moreover, increasing the annual percentage notional distribution for ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs as suggested in the question would further increase the risk that the retirement income derived by the owners from such funds could be depleted before death.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600059#WRG00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Statistics","counter":400,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600059#WRG00350"},{"type":"question","counter":401,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[44536\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600059#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his forecasts for each year out to 2016 for nominal GDP, GDP growth, nominal GNP, GNP growth, nominal General Government Deficit, GGD as a percentage of GDP, nominal cost of interest on the national debt, cost of interest on the national debt as a percentage of GDP, and the assumed average interest rate on the overall national debt underpinning these latter assumptions, the assumed average interest rate on that part of the national debt issued in the relevant year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":402,"content":"<p>The data requested by the Deputy for the period 2012-2015 are set out in the table below.

This working group had a series of meetings to discuss issues of concern to the haulage industry including the matter of an essential users rebate. I have recently received a submission from the group and I am considering the matters raised. <\/p><p>  On the matters of green diesel and fuel laundering, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are very conscious of the threat posed by the illicit trade in mineral oil products, and in particular by the laundering of markers from diesel. They have, therefore, made action against this criminal activity one of their priorities.<\/p><p>  Enforcement action is taken at all stages of the fuel supply chain, targeting both those involved in laundering and those who sell laundered fuel, and notable successes have been achieved. Between 2010 and the present, 18 oil laundries and 583,000 litres of oil have been seized, along with oil tankers and other vehicles. In addition, some 1.3 million litres of illicit fuel have been seized, the large majority from retail outlets or in the course of delivery to such outlets. As well as this, the licensing regime for the sale of road fuels has been tightened up to make it more difficult for launderers to get their product onto the market. Revenue has undertaken a vigorous campaign to close unlicensed outlets and outlets that are not complying with licensing requirements. 32 filling stations were shut down in 2011 either because they didn&rsquo;t have a licence or were in breach of licence conditions, and a further 24 have been closed to date this year.<\/p><p>  I wish to inform the Deputy also that legislative action has been taken that will provide improved underpinning and support for action to control and supervise the fuel supply chain and in that way restrict the ability of launderers to source marked fuel for laundering and also restrict their ability to get their illegal product onto the market. As well as a strengthening of the licensing requirements for the sale of auto-fuel, a new system of licensing for the sale of marked fuels came into operation on 1 October. Revenue has power to refuse a licence where the applicant does not show to their satisfaction that any condition they may attach to the licence can be satisfied, and to revoke a licence if the holder fails to comply with any of its terms.<\/p><p>  There will also, from the start of 2013, be a new requirement for all fuel traders to make monthly returns to Revenue detailing their fuel transactions. This will be an important new source of information on the fuel supply chain and will, for example, assist in the identification of unusual or suspicious patterns of activity.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners are working closely with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs in the UK on the development of a more effective fuel marker. An Invitation to Make Submissions was issued jointly by the two organizations in June. This has generated considerable interest across a number of countries and I am advised that the indications are that a significant number of proposals will be submitted by the closing date of 30 November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600059#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Applications","counter":418,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600059#WRG01650"},{"type":"question","counter":419,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[44605\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600059#WRG01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when he expects the interdepartmental working group that has been established in relation to the matter of compensation for businesses affected by the recent flooding in County Cork to conclude their report; when he will be in a position to make an announcement in relation to any such scheme.","asker":"994","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":420,"content":"<p>A report on the response to flooding in the Cork area on 28 June 2012 was presented to the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning at its meeting on 24 September 2012.

The Minister for Justice and Equality is responsible for legislation - the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 - which applies to all debt collectors that operate across any or all sectors of the economy, including private individuals and debt collecting firms.

The Deputy might wish to note that in the case of financial institutions which use debt collection firms, the Central Bank has imposed requirements that offer protection to consumers under its revised Consumer Protection Code.  The code obliges the regulated entities it covers to ensure that any outsourced activity, such as debt collection, complies with the requirements of the code.  This means that outsourced activity should uphold principles in the code such as the requirement for institutions not to exert undue pressure or undue influence on a customer, to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of customers, to act with due skill, care and diligence in the best interest of its customers and to prohibit personal visits or oral communications except in specified circumstances.

The Government recognises the important role of Credit Unions as a volunteer co-operative movement and the distinction between them and other types of financial institutions.  The Commission on Credit Unions was established to review the future of the credit union movement and make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for Credit Unions, taking into account their not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors savings and financial stability.  The Commission published its Report in April 2012.  The Report of the Commission was agreed by all members including the Irish League of Credit Unions.  If we are to build confidence in credit unions, it is important that all those who wrote and agreed the Commission report continue to stand behind it.  The Credit Union Bill 2012 reflects the recommendations made by the Commission on Credit Unions and provides legislative basis for over 60 of those recommendations.  The Government has already shown its commitment to the sector.  A figure of &euro;500 million has been put aside for the restructuring and stabilisation of credit unions at a time when the Government faces difficult budgetary choices and competing needs for scarce resources.  There is an onus on the credit union movement to embrace the necessary changes to ensure this commitment on behalf of the taxpayer delivers a viable sector into the future.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to implementing the Commission Report is backed by solid early delivery of major elements of it - the publication of the Credit Union Bill 2012, the commencement of fitness and probity and contributions under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme and the appointment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board and early commencement of its work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600060#WRH01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Banking","counter":454,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600060#WRH01850"},{"type":"question","counter":455,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[44849\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600060#WRH01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form if possible, a list of the bank accounts used by his Department and separately any agencies within the remit of his Department; the purpose of each bank account and the financial institution the bank account is with; the total amount of any interest charged or bank fees incurred by his Department and separately by each agency in 2011 and anticipated figure for 2012; the percentage of payments issued by his Department and each agency which are issued electronically and if the Department agency has any special arrangement in place on the issue of bank charges and fees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":456,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the table that follows this reply.

Ensuring that more micro and small businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of our plans for jobs and growth.

This will include: The development of a new Small and Micro Business Division within Enterprise Ireland (EI) as a centre of excellence in the provision of supports to the small and micro enterprise sectors;The dissolution of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), of which Meath CEB is one, and the transfer of their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland (EI), and;The establishment of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to provide a high quality, innovative, &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; support service for small businesses within Local Authorities, and providing early access to the services of national bodies; Integration of key local authority business services into the Local Enterprise Office and promotion of a local environment in which enterprise can thrive.<\/p><p>  Not only is it important that this restructuring is conducted as a priority, we must ensure that the new model is fit for purpose. A high level Implementation Working Group (IWG) Chaired by my Department is currently progressing the range of issues involved, including a focus on functions, structures and staffing, all of which will form the basis of a detailed and ambitious Service Level Agreement between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities. A project plan is also in preparation which will set out clear milestones and timelines for implementation. In tandem with the work of the IWG my Department is engaged with the Office of the Attorney General regarding the detailed primary legislation that will be necessary to implement the new arrangements.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that it is business as usual for CEB clients, with no disruption or diminution of services. It is my intention to complete the transition process as rapidly as practicable, and I aim to give administrative effect to the new structures as soon as possible, in advance of the formal enactment of legislation.  <\/p><p>  I will shortly announce details with Enterprise Ireland of the new small and micro business division.

The State pension is a very valuable benefit. Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  Recent changes to State pension supports the direct link between contributions made and the rate of pension received which underpins State pension policy.  By aligning the rate of pension with the contribution made ensures that those who contribute more during a working life, benefit more in retirement.<\/p><p>  The recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that benefits offer excellent value for money for those on the lower part of the income distribution, those with shorter contribution histories, and the self-employed.  The social solidarity principle which underlies the Fund is reflected in the fact that, for those at the higher end of the income distribution, the Fund is redistributive and they generally get back less than they pay in.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the changes in the contribution rules and associated rates of payment which were introduced in September 2012, those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund.  This is because the negative impact of these changes continues to be outweighed by the lower contributions paid into the Fund in respect of these workers. <\/p><p>  The report looked at the value for money provided by the Fund on a range of individual scenarios and found that:<\/p><p>- Those on lower incomes fare considerably better than those on higher incomes. <\/p><p>- Those with dependants achieve better value for money (when assessing value for money on an individual rather than on a per household basis).<\/p><p>- Those with short contribution histories have the potential to fare better than those with full contribution histories, which is particularly helpful for women who take time out of the workforce for caring purposes.<\/p><p>- The Fund provides better value to female than to male contributors.<\/p><p>- The self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.<\/p><p>- For those at the higher end of the income distribution, the Fund is redistributive and these individuals generally get back less than they pay in.<\/p><p>- Higher value for money is achieved where benefits in addition to the State pension (contributory) are accessed.<\/p><p>  In relation to the homemakers scheme, women who leave the workplace for caring purposes can, if eligible, avail of the homemakers scheme which helps to provide a higher rate of pension for those who meet the qualifying conditions.  It should be noted that women who do not qualify for a pension or are affected by the rate band change may, if their spouse is in receipt of a State pension contributory, receive a qualified adult payment at a higher rate where they satisfy a means test.  A State pension non-contributory pension, which is a means tested payment, may also be payable.  I have no proposals to backdate the homemakers scheme given the policy issues and costs involved. While my Department will keep this scheme under review, any improvements which could result in further costs for the Exchequer could only be considered in a budgetary context.<\/p><p>  Sustainable public finances are a pre-requisite for future economic stability and growth, as well as being a pre-requisite for maintaining and developing our social protection system. The Government&rsquo;s priority is to secure economic recovery, promote growth and employment.  To this end, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy.  Accordingly, there will be an on-going requirement to curtail expenditure in 2013 and in later years.  There are, therefore, considerable challenges ahead including the need to protect, as far as possible, the key income supports and services operated by my Department.  These services and supports impact in some way on the lives of almost every single person in the State.  The scope and scale of this expenditure plays a key role in the wider economy and helps to partially offset the effect of the downturn.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to tackling Ireland&rsquo;s economic crisis in a way that is fair, balanced, and which recognises the need for social solidarity.  The appropriate level of overall expenditure by my Department, including expenditure on weekly and other payments, will be considered in the context of Budget 2013 and subsequent Budgets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600064#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Allowance Applications","counter":680,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600064#WRM00750"},{"type":"question","counter":681,"qnumday":302,"qnumall":"[44112\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600064#WRM00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Wexford was refused fuel allowance when the additional income is well under the weekly threshold; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":682,"content":"<p><b><\/b>  In order to be eligible for a fuel allowance, a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a household means test, and live alone or only with specific people.

The Quarterly National Household survey indicated that there were 66,000 young unemployed aged 15&#8211;24 in Q2 2012 &#8211; representing thirteen per cent of the youth population. The majority of young people are in education and not in the labour force. With regards to those in the labour force, 34% are unemployed (this is the official unemployment rate).  Of particular concern is the continued increase in the share of youth unemployed who are out of work for more than one year. They now account for 41% of all youth unemployment.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the first instance, the Government&#8217;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance\/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies.<\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of <b>education<\/b>, the Youthreach programme provides integrated education, training and work experience for unemployed early school leavers without any qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age.  There are almost 6,000 places available nationwide under the Youthreach umbrella.  The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) scheme, operated through VECs, provides a range of courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people over 21 years of age (particularly early school leavers). The most recent data indicate that there are almost 1,000 participants on VTOS who are under 25 years of age.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Back to Education Allowance scheme run by my Department provides income maintenance, along with a contribution to education costs, for unemployed people returning to further or higher education.  Over 6,500 young people participated in the BTEA in the last academic year.<\/p><p><br \/>  Over 18,000 persons aged  under 25 completed a <b>training<\/b> course with F&Aacute;S in 2011 (excluding evening courses).  Training allowances on eligible courses exceed what a young person would receive in jobseekers&#8217; payments, providing an incentive to take up training programmes.  The Labour Market Education &amp; Training<b><\/b>Fund (LMETF) is part of the Government&#8217;s 2012 Action Plan for Jobs initiative.  The Department of Education &amp; Skills has committed &#8364;20m to fund a range of education and training interventions for up to 6,500 individuals who are long term unemployed.<i><font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font><\/i>There are four themes to the funding, one of which is dedicated to the cohort of under 25s.<\/p><p><br \/>  In terms of <b>job search assistance<\/b>, some 17,000 young people registered with Employment Services this year up until September 2012, representing 37% of all registrants.  Registering with Employment Services gives job-seekers access to guidance interviews, job search assistance, and training courses, as well as self-service job-seeking options.  Under the National Employment Action Plan (EAP) persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social Protection and referred to Employment Services for interview with the aim of assisting them to enter\/re-enter the labour market.  Last year, there were 35,400 referrals of under 25s to the EAP, affecting approximately 25,000 individual jobseekers (those who do not attend initially are referred again). Of those referred,   62% of clients had signed off the Live Register by the end of the year.<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>For the first eight months of this year, there were 23,700 referrals affecting 18,300 young jobseekers. The EAP process is being changed on a progressive basis across the country to one where referral will take place immediately on becoming unemployed for those identified, through profiling, as being at greatest risk of remaining unemployed for long periods.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are a number of schemes\/programmes available that are focussed on <b>work experience.<\/b>  The most relevant for young people are: JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme), and its predecessor the Work Placement Programme. Over 1,500 young people are currently participating on these schemes. The total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during its first year of operation was 2,600. Young people will also benefit from the reduced rate of employer&#8217;s PRSI, the purpose of which is to support job creation, as well as from the impact of Revenue Job Assist and the Employers PRSI Incentive Scheme.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally the European Commission is currently reviewing relevant youth policies across the Member States with a view to making proposals for a European-wide approach to a &#8220;youth guarantee&#8221;  that are to be discussed during Ireland's Presidency of the EU Council.  The Commission&#8217;s proposals are expected to be published in December, and achieving political agreement on these proposals in the Council will be a major objective of Ireland&#8217;s Presidency in the first half of 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600064#WRM03400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Internship Scheme Administration","counter":719,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600064#WRM03450"},{"type":"question","counter":720,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[41667\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600064#WRM03500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her views on the businesses that are signing up to the jobbridge internship scheme; if they are providing relevant and high quality work experience to young persons; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":721,"content":"<p>The JobBridge Scheme has made significant progress to-date since it came into operation on the 1<sup>st<\/sup> July 2011. 11,010 internships have commenced to date with 5,082 participants currently on an internship as at 11<sup>th<\/sup> October 2012 and 2,253 internship opportunities presently advertised on    .

These ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position; provides appropriate training and development experience; and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided.  Firstly, the Standard Agreement signed and agreed to by both the Intern and the Host Organisation upon commencement clearly states the terms of the internship; including the specific learning outcomes the intern will gain over the course of their internship.<\/p><p><br \/>  Secondly, to ensure that both the host organisation and intern are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme, the Department of Social Protection are involved in the continuous monitoring of internships.

Consequently any individual, who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme&#8217;s criteria, including cases of suspected displacement and quality, may contact the JobBridge team.

Any proposal to deduct at source or withhold PRSI to be charged on streams of income which are currently exempt from PRSI would have to be discussed with the Commissioners to determine the viability of that mechanism of collection.<\/p><p>  It is not possible to furnish the annual yield from 2007 to 2011 and the projected yield in 2012, in respect of various categories of unearned income including rental income, dividend income and deposit interest income, as this information is not disaggregated from Class S income generally.<\/p><p>  One of my key goals in the Department is to reform the system of social protection to put it on a sounder financial footing in the future.  One of the matters I am most concerned about is the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund.  It is my intention to widen the PRSI income base to make certain types of unearned income, such as those outlined above, liable to PRSI.  Any proposal to bring additional sources of income within the base on which PRSI is charged would have to be considered taking account of all of the implications, including the potential for providing access to additional social insurance entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600065#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":760,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 333 and 334 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":761,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600065#WRN01950"},{"type":"question","counter":762,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[44651\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600065#WRN02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when the Civil Registration Bill will be published and if it will be compulsory to include the father's name on the birth certificate as a result of this legislation.","asker":"1065","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":763,"content":"<p>The Law Reform Commission, in its report <i>Legal Aspects of Family Relationships<\/i>, makes recommendations relating to the conduct of family relationships, including compulsory joint registration of the birth of a child where the parents are not married to each other.<\/p><p><br \/>  Any change of the current provisions requires careful consideration given the legal complexities involved.  <\/p><p><br \/>  This and other proposals contained in the report that are relevant to the Civil Registration Service are currently under active consideration and it is my intention to introduce legislation on this, and other aspects of civil registration, as early as possible in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600065#WRN02200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":764,"content":"<p>Question No. 336 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Applications","counter":765,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600065#WRN02400"},{"type":"question","counter":766,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[44655\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600065#WRN02500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if and when an application for rent supplement will be granted in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":767,"content":"<p>The person concerned has been awarded rent supplement and is in receipt of his full entitlement based on his household circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600065#WRN02600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance Payments","counter":768,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600065#WRN02650"},{"type":"question","counter":769,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[44662\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600065#WRN02700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a overpayment of PRSI contributions by a company (details supplied) in South Tipperary will be refunded; the reason for the delay in issuing such a refund; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":770,"content":"<p>The determination of the employment status and therefore PRSI Class applicable to working directors has been the subject of challenge, court judgments and legal advices.

Our target is that we must achieve 16% of all energy consumed by 2020 from renewable sources.  We have set out in our National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) that we will do this through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heat, which together would amount to 16% of all energy consumed in the State. <\/p><p>  At the end of 2011, we were at 17.6% renewable electricity, 3.6% renewable transport (biofuels) and 5% renewable heat. Together these amounted to 6.5% all energy consumed being from renewables in 2011. This means we have another 8 years within which to achieve the remaining 9.5%, which will be very challenging. <\/p><p>  Our NREAP and the Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012-2020 published by my Department earlier this year sets out the various policies and strategies that have been put in place on renewable energy. In the electricity sector, EirGrid&rsquo;s 2008 <\/p><p>  Grid25 strategy is being implemented, alongside the rollout of the Gate 3 grid connections to renewable generators. <\/p><p>  Onshore wind will make up the bulk of the 40% 2020 renewable electricity consumption target. In this context, it is recognised that there is an important balance to be struck between renewable energy development and the possible concerns of local communities in regard to issues such as proximity, visual amenity, and noise.<\/p><p>  Existing Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Wind Energy Development (published by the Department of Environment in 2006) State that in general, noise is unlikely to be a significant problem, where the distance from the nearest turbine to any noise sensitive property is more than 500 metres.  The Guidelines also advise planning authorities to seek evidence that the types of turbines proposed in a particular development will use best current engineering practice in terms of noise creation and suppression and provide quite specific limits in the permissible increases in noise above background noise from wind energy developments in order to protect neighbouring properties.<\/p><p>  The current system therefore provides for a degree of specificity and uniformity across all planning authorities while also leaving the final decision in the hands of the local decision makers &ndash; who have the benefit of any submissions or observations from third parties &ndash; in making their decision. <\/p><p>  It is considered that the introduction of mandatory minimum distances set out in statute, as proposed under the Wind Turbines Bill 2012, could effectively prohibit a planning authority from considering wind energy development that may otherwise be acceptable or even desirable from a broader energy policy perspective.<\/p><p>  Along with my ministerial colleagues in the Department of Environment, we feel that the issues raised in the proposed Wind Turbines Bill are best addressed through a targeted review of the existing guidelines rather than legislation.<\/p><p>  In order to ensure that Ireland continues to meet its renewable energy targets and at the same time ensure that wind energy does not have negative impacts on local communities, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government &ndash; in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders &ndash; will undertake a targeted review of certain aspects of the Wind Energy Guidelines.  This focused review will examine the manner in which the Guidelines address key issues of community concern such as noise proximity and visual amenity and any other potential impacts as considered appropriate together with exploring ways of building community support for wind energy development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRP03800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Career Breaks","counter":895,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRP03900"},{"type":"question","counter":896,"qnumday":388,"qnumall":"[44363\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRP04000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of staff in his Department or agencies under his control that are currently on career break; the number of staff currently hired temporarily to cover those on career break; if he will provide a breakdown of the numbers by grade and agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":897,"content":"<p>There are fourteen staff members in my Department that are currently on career break and the grade breakdown is as follows:<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>Grade<\/div><\/th><th><div>Number<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Clerical Officer<\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Executive Officer<\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Higher Executive Officer<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Geologist<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>No persons were hired to cover those on career break.<\/p><p>In relation to the State Agencies under the aegis of my Department, this is an operational matter for the individual agency in the first instance and I have no function in this regard.

All parties have now submitted their responses to my request for proposals for a voluntary industry led solution for homeowners. The responses are now being evaluated and , together with the relevant recommendations in the pyrite report will inform the developmen t of proposals which will provide for a solution to the pyrite problem. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Pyrite Panel undertook a desktop study, in conjunction with stakeholder consultation, to establish facts in relation to the potential exposure to pyrite problems. The information was gathered from a number of sources including local authorities, structural guarantee providers, representatives of homeowners, private builders, construction professionals and public representatives and was cross referenced to verify, as far as practicable, its validity. According to the report, approximately 850 dwellings had a claim with a guarantee provider at March 2012. However, it should be noted that not all those   claims had been verified. The Pyrite Panel recommended the categorisation of dwellings as a mechanism to determine suitable remediation approaches for pyrite affected dwellings .     <\/p><p><br \/>  It further recommended that d wellings categorised as &#8220;red&#8221; should be remediated immediately and dwellings categorised as amber, where there is no significant pyrite related damage, should be monitored and only remediated if significant damage occurs.  I believe the methodology for remediation recommended by the Pyrite Panel offers a pragmatic and sensible approach. The remediation of dwellings is an expensive and disruptive process and I agree with the view expressed by the Panel that it would be unreasonable to remediate d wellings if they are not exhibiting pyrite related damage.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The testing and categorisation protocol, currently under development by the National Standa rds Authority of Ireland (NSAI), will address the   issue of the assessment of damage and the appropriate method for monitoring the amber category. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has set up a dedicated email address , , for dealing with pyrite related queries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRQ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Career Breaks","counter":968,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRQ03750"},{"type":"question","counter":969,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[44366\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRQ03800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of staff in his Department or agencies under his control that are currently on career break; the number of staff currently hired temporarily to cover those on career break; if he will provide a breakdown of the numbers by grade and agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":970,"qnumday":447,"qnumall":"[45609\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRQ03900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of staff that availed of the special civil service incentive career break scheme 2009; the cost of the scheme since its introduction; the savings on the pay bill in that time period; the estimated full year cost for the return of all the new civil servants in 2013; the number of staff members that applied for a further extension of their leave; if these staff were counted as a reduction in numbers employed in the public service during that time period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":971,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[45624\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRQ04000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of staff across the public service that are currently on a career break; if he will provide a breakdown of the numbers on career leave by Department and agency; the estimated cost of this scheme per year; the number of staff currently hired temporarily to cover those on career break; the reforms that have taken place in this general area in the past year; if these staff were counted as a reduction in numbers employed in the public service during that time period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":972,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 410, 447 and 448 together.<\/p><p>There are two different career break schemes in operation in my Department at present, special leave without pay for a career break as provided under Department of Finance Circular 18 of 1998, as amended, and the Special Civil Service Incentive Career Break Scheme 2009 introduced under the Department of Finance Circular 13 of 2009.<\/p><p>Staff of my Department may avail of special leave without pay for a career break as provided for under the Department of Finance Circular 18 of 1998, as amended.

A number of related reports which have been published in conjunction with the Action Programme, including the report of the Steering Group on alignment of local development and local government and the report of the Waterford Local Government Committee, are also available on the site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRS00500","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1065,"content":"<p>Question No. 445 answered with Question No. 429.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tribunals of Inquiry Reports","counter":1066,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRS00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1067,"qnumday":446,"qnumall":"[45594\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRS00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if any proceedings have been initiated against the State arising out of the findings of the Moriarty Tribunal; and if he will make a statement on the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1068,"content":"<p>No proceedings have been initiated against the State, arising out of the findings of the Moriarty Tribunal , in areas in respect of which I, or my Department, have responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRS00800","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1069,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 447 and 448 answered with Question No. 410.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":1071,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRS01000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Airports","counter":1070,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRS00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1071,"qnumday":449,"qnumall":"[44914\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRS01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the cost of security for Shannon Airport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1072,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the cost to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of security for Shannon Airport from 2004 to September 2012 is &euro;16,316,547.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRS01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Services Regulation","counter":1073,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRS01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1074,"qnumday":450,"qnumall":"[44109\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRS01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason persons transferring land to a son or daughter or multiple transfers must use different solicitors adding extra expense to what is already a very expensive transaction.","asker":"968","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1075,"content":"<p>The matter the Deputy is referring to is the Conveyancing Conflicts of Interest Regulation which was adopted by the Council of the Law Society on 7 September 2012 with a view to it coming into effect on 1 January 2013.  The Law Society is the independent statutory body for the regulation of the solicitors profession in the State.  Section 5 of the Solicitors Act 1954 provides for the Society to make regulations which are necessary for the carrying out of its functions and requires that such regulations be laid by the Society before each House of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>  The new regulation, which prohibits the same solicitor from acting for both vendor and purchaser in conveyancing transactions, was made by the Law Society on foot of the recommendations contained in the &quot;Conveyancing Conflicts Task Force Report&quot; published by the Society in July.  The Task Force was specifically set up to look at the existing guidelines and regulations relating to solicitors acting for both parties in such transactions.  The Report, which is publicly available on the Law Society's website (www.lawsociety.ie), details the arguments that were put forward both in favour of and against the introduction of this regulation and explains the reasons behind the decision to propose its adoption.  It sets out how the Task Force undertook extensive consultations with members of the solicitors profession and other relevant interested parties and stakeholders and took account, inter alia, of the November 2010 joint HSE and UCD report concerning the &quot;Abuse and Neglect of Older People in Ireland&quot;.  The Task Force also researched and reviewed the regulatory regimes in other jurisdictions and analysed judicial and academic commentary relevant to all issues considered.<\/p><p>  In noting the Deputy's concerns about the possible cost implications of the new Law Society Regulation, I would expect the relevant costs to even out on the basis of the actual work being done for each party concerned and this is something that can be monitored including in the context of the new and more transparent legal costs regime to be introduced under the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011.  I also have to acknowledge the lessons of previous litigation in this area and of our last property boom which point to the fundamental need to avoid conflicts of interests in the conduct of conveyancing transactions - be that on the part of solicitors or on the part of their clients including where multiple, elderly or otherwise vulnerable family members may be concerned.  While it would be better if such protections were not necessary at all, there can be no doubt that the new Regulation affords better protection - both to solicitors and to their respective clients - from any claims, now or in the future, that the issue of undue influence arises in relation to any conveyancing transaction concerned.  Similarly, in non-family conveyancing transactions, the interests of seller and purchaser would seem better represented and protected in their own right under the new Regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Title","counter":1076,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRS01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1077,"qnumday":451,"qnumall":"[44182\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding a property (details supplied) in Dublin 3 where there are issues on land registry and deeds,","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":1078,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[44750\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRS01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding a Land Registry application (details supplied) in Dublin 3","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1079,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 451 and 477 together.<\/p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that under the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, the Property Registration Authority (PRA) was established as and from 4 November 2006.

Part 13 of the Act, which relates to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March 2007. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children. With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and finally to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.

The very significant challenges and difficult decisions involved in this process cannot be underestimated.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Following the Governments Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, I secured the agreement of the Government to maintain the strength of the Defence Forces at a level of 9,500 serving personnel.  While this represents a very significant commitment on the part of Government, at this strength level it was not possible to maintain the then organisational structure of the Defence Forces, which had been designed to support a serving strength of 11,500.  As a result, I asked the Secretary General of the Department and the Chief of Staff to conduct a detailed review of the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces and to bring forward proposals on an appropriate organisation for a Defence Forces of 9,500 serving personnel which could continue to deliver the services required by Government.  I accepted the proposals submitted jointly by the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff which recommended a reorganisation of Defence Forces' units based on a two Brigade structure.  <\/p><p><br \/>  All personnel in the Defence Forces have now been briefed on the reorganisation proposals.  They will receive further briefings and advice on the many options available to them as implementation of the reorganisation progresses.  The reorganisation implementation plan is designed to limit as far as possible the dislocation of personnel and this will become clear as the plan is implemented.  <\/p><p><br \/>  While the reorganisation means that units will be moved among existing locations, it maintains, as far as possible, the existing organisational strengths within the current locations.  (See enclosed table which shows the serving strength in each barracks prior to the announcement of the reorganisation, and the proposed establishment post the implementation of the reorganisation).  Certain units are being disbanded, amalgamated or relocated as part of the reorganisation.  However, insofar as is practicable, serving members in the Defence Forces whose units are being moved will have the opportunity to either move with their unit or to take up new appointments within or close to their existing locations.  In addition, very significant opportunities for training, career progression and promotion will continue to be available within the reorganised structure for the Defence Forces.  While every effort will be made to accommodate members of the Defence Forces, inevitably, some personnel will have to change location in order to fill appointments in the new organisation.  However, contrary to much of what is being stated in correspondence, there is no question of mandatorily requiring all the personnel currently serving in units changing location to move with their unit and I would like to take this opportunity to allay any concerns in that regard.   <\/p><p><br \/>  I am committed to maintaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to meet their operational requirements and the current reorganisation is part of that process.  I would like to reiterate that the reorganisation will be implemented in a manner which best addresses the future organisational needs and capability requirements of the Defence Forces, while facilitating as far as possible the circumstances of individual members and detailed discussions with both Representative Associations are ongoing in this regard.  I trust the above clarifies the matter for you.         <\/p><p>Yours sincerely,     <\/p><p>&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under; <\/p><p><b>ALAN SHATTER, T.D.<\/b><b>MINISTER FOR JUSTICE, EQUALITY &amp; DEFENCE.<\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRT02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1156,"content":"<p>Question No. 477 answered with Question No. 451.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UN Conventions Ratification","counter":1157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRT02475"},{"type":"question","counter":1158,"qnumday":478,"qnumall":"[44768\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRT02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when Ireland will ratify the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1159,"content":"<p>It is the Government&#8217;s intention to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are being met.

While the changes introduced in respect of the 2012 Scheme, necessitated by the budgetary situation, included a requirement to have had a stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, provision was made for those who did not achieve this minimum to apply for derogation, on specific conditions. Of the 10,000 farmers eligible to apply, almost 9,500 availed of the opportunity; to date, almost 80% of the cases decided upon have been successful. Those who have not been successful are being afforded the opportunity of appeal to the DAS Appeals Committee, under independent chairmanship of Mr Padraig Gibbons. <\/p><p>  Faced with the need to make budgetary savings for the current financial year and, mindful of the difficulties faced by those most dependent on the support which the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme provides, I chose to make technical adjustments to the Scheme terms and conditions, designed to better focus the aid on those contributing most to achieving the aims of the Scheme namely, ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of viable rural communities, maintaining the countryside and maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which take account of environmental protection measures. <\/p><p>  REPS is an agri-environment measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007-2013.  It is designed to encourage farmers to go beyond basic good farming practice and to farm in a way that benefits the landscape, biodiversity and water quality.  Every member state must have an agri-environment measure and REPS is co-funded by the EU at the rate of 55%. The scheme has proven to be very popular with Irish farmers and confirms their commitment to farming to the highest environmental standards, a commitment I might add, that fits very comfortably with the vision of smart, green, growth as set out in my Department&rsquo;s Food Harvest 2020 strategy statement.<\/p><p>  I remain committed to supporting farmers who choose to farm to environmentally friendly practices and to ensuring that these farmers are rewarded for their efforts Under EU Regulations. In this regard I recently announced the reopening of AEOS with funding of &euro;20m annually, with scheme documentation now available on the Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>  Payment rates in an agri-environment scheme must be justified mainly by reference to income forgone and additional costs incurred by the farmer because of the nature of his or her undertakings.  Also up to 20% of an additional payment may be justified by what are called &ldquo;transaction costs&rdquo;. Given the state of the public finances, in finalising my Department&rsquo;s estimates for 2012, I had no option but to announce a 10% cut in the rate of payment to existing REPS 4 applicants. This cut, which will apply to 2012 payments onwards, will be based on a cut to the transaction cost of participating farmers from &euro;28.03 to &euro;5.60 on each hectare that a transaction cost is paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRU02700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":1224,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRU02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1225,"qnumday":503,"qnumall":"[44214\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRU02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will disclose the claimants of area aid from 1 January 2005 to 1 April 2012 in respect of land that was rented by a person (details supplied) in County Kerry;

A maximum payment of &#8364;4,000 per annum will apply to individual applicants under the re-opened scheme.

This funding will provide a boost to the rural economy and will benefit all areas of the country.

REPS payments are up to date.  A total of &#8364;64 million has been paid out to-date and I envisage that by the end of 2012 a further &#8364;121 million will be spent.

Under those arrangements Ireland will have received an additional 9.3% in quota between 2007 and 2014.  However for some countries, including Ireland, these quota increases are insufficient to accommodate increases in milk production which have been driven by supply and demand dynamics and the prospect of a quota free production environment after 2015.<\/p><p>  I have been extremely active in seeking to secure a soft landing for all Member States in the lead-up to milk quota abolition in 2015, as envisaged in the 2008 CAP Health Check agreement.  I have discussed the matter extensively with other EU Agriculture Ministers, including in bilateral meetings with my Danish, French, German, Estonian and Finnish counterparts.  Furthermore, officials from my Department have raised this issue at EU level meetings, and at bi-lateral meetings with other Member States.  The Commission is due to prepare the second interim report on the Health Check by the end of this year and in that context we have called for it to consider measures to ensure a smooth transition to quota abolition in all countries.  <\/p><p>  To date, however, the Commission has resisted attempts to reconsider this issue, as it has resisted attempts to revisit the outcome of the 2008 CAP Health Check in an overall sense.  The Commission&rsquo;s view is supported by a number of Member States, some of whom are firmly against any further adjustment to the Health Check agreement.  It is also the case that only a minority of Member states is likely to be adversely affected by the current quota restrictions, and therefore persuading a qualified majority to agree to an adjustment of the current regime represents a significant challenge.  There are currently no signs of a breakthrough in this regard.<\/p><p>  At this point therefore, it would appear that since a majority of Member States do not support any further adjustment to the soft landing, farmers should plan for the continuation of the quota regime until March 2015. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRW01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Imports","counter":1351,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRW01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1352,"qnumday":544,"qnumall":"[44730\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRW02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of litres of goats milk imported into the State in 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"966","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1353,"content":"<p>My Department is not in possession of the data in question as this level of detail is not available in the official trade statistics produced by the Central Statistics Office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRW02100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Environment Protection Scheme Payments","counter":1354,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRW02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1355,"qnumday":545,"qnumall":"[44734\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRW02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding a fine in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1356,"content":"<p>The final instalment of &euro;1,811.46 of an existing REPS 3 debt that arose in 2009 was netted against a Disadvantaged Area Payments which issued on 25 September 2012.

The scientific advice for the southern stock  over recent years has been that the landings should be reduced and as a result there have been cuts to the TAC year on year since 2006  A rebuilding plan for the stock has been prepared by the Irish industry in consultation with the Marine Institute and submitted by the Regional Advisory Council for Pelagic stocks to the EU Commission.  The Commission has referred the plan to the EU Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for advice which is expected shortly.  There is an EU Management Plan in place since 2008 for the northern stock off the coast of Scotland and the TAC is set each year in accordance with the terms of that plan.<\/p><p>Over the past few years there has been increased interest in participation in these fisheries. This has raised concern about the sustainability of the stock in the context of that level of participation and in relation to the economic viability of individual quota allocations with that increased level of participation.<\/p><p>In 2011, I asked the fishing industry and other interested parties to make proposals on the future management arrangements for all Irish herring fisheries. The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed.  I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.<\/p><p>On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter and I consulted and met industry regarding the draft policy, again there was no consensus.  On 8 June 2012 I issued a policy, having considered all views and having regard to the sustainability of the fisheries which I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks.  The policy is based on giving access to each of the fisheries to those with recent track record in that particular fishery.  The track record involves vessels having landed a minimum of 5 tonnes of herring in 2009 or 2010 or in 3 of the 5 years during the period 2006 to 2010.  In addition, there are some very limited specified circumstances where an earlier track record may be taken into account.<\/p><p>The decision made was based on a clear, detailed and objective assessment of the fisheries in recent years.  This policy is intended to ensure the long term sustainability of the herring fisheries by limiting participation in the main fisheries to those vessels which have participated in the fishery, in the 5 years prior to the commencement of the review, even at a low level. The number of vessels which were allocated quota is as follows:  2009 &ndash; 65 vessels, 2010 - 63 vessels, 2011 &ndash; 92 vessels and 2012 &ndash; 56 vessels.  The revised arrangements have been applied in the North West herring Fishery which commenced on 1\/10\/2012.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s quotas for each stock for 2011 and 2012 are as follows:<\/p><p><b>Table 1 Quota adjustments<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th>2011<\/th><th>ICES Area VIa South and VIIb,c<\/th><th>ICES Area VIa North:  <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Quota<\/td><td>4,065<\/td><td>3,396<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carry over<\/td><td>851<\/td><td>309<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Transferred<\/td><td>385<\/td><td>-385<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Swap<\/td><td><\/td><td>75<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total (8696)<\/td><td>5,301<\/td><td>3,395<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><table><tr><th>2012<\/th><th>ICES Area VIa South and VIIb,c<\/th><th>ICES Area VIa North:  <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Quota<\/td><td>3,861<\/td><td>3,459<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carry over<\/td><td>530<\/td><td>319<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Transferred<\/td><td>386<\/td><td>-386<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Swap<\/td><td><\/td><td>24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total (8,193)<\/td><td>4,777<\/td><td>3,416<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>The table below is the data which the Deputy has requested.<\/p><p><b>Table 2.

If any child is in need of care and protection and is unlikely to receive it at home, the HSE has a duty to ensure they receive appropriate care. <\/p><p>  Where a child is coming into care the HSE allocated social worker undertakes a full assessment of need, and on this basis the statutory care plan is developed. This assessment will call on a full range of professionals where required to set out a comprehensive statement of the child's needs. The care plan also determines the support and interventions needed with regard to the family situation where it is planned that a child will return home.  The care plan also directs the placement most appropriate to the needs of the child. <\/p><p>  Children in residential care are placed in open residential centres run by either the HSE or private\/voluntary providers in communities across the country. The National Standards for Children's Residential Centres clearly set out that the social worker and the centre manager are satisfied that the placement is suitable, will meet the needs of the young person and takes account of the need to protect young people from abuse by their peers.  The HSE is responsible for the registration and inspection of private or voluntary (non-statutory) run residential centres for children and the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) inspects centres operated by the HSE. Centres are inspected under the National Standards.  <\/p><p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) was established under the Health Act, 2007 and replaced the Social Services Inspectorate. HIQA is an independent authority responsible for driving quality, safety and accountability in services for children, older people and people with disabilities in Ireland.  HIQA develops standards for Ministerial approval, monitors compliance with standards and carries out investigations where they believe there are reasonable grounds to do so.  HIQA inspects children&rsquo;s residential centres, special care units and foster care settings against the National Standards for Children's Residential Centres, National Standards for Special Care Units and the National Standards for Foster Care.   HIQA publishes their inspection reports on their website. <\/p><p>  In July 2010, the Government decided to prioritise the inspection of child protection by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). These inspections will be undertaken against standards to be developed by HIQA as provided for under Section 8 of the Health Act 2007. HIQA commenced work on drafting National Standards for the Protection and Welfare of Children  and convened a Standards Advisory Group to advise on their development.

This is particularly important for high-risk mothers and babies.   Therefore it is proposed that the maternity hospitals should be relocated alongside adult acute services.  In this context the National Maternity Hospital is to be relocated to St Vincent's.  The Dublin maternity hospitals have been working with the HSE in relation to the development of their business cases for relocation.   <\/p><p>  Within the context of its commercial remit, NAMA advises that it is at all times open to proposals which can contribute to the achievement of broader social and economic objectives.  My officials and I met with NAMA once this year and the Secretary General of the Department also met with NAMA in June 2011.  While a variety of topics and areas of interest were discussed at these meetings, you will understand that I cannot provide detail on the negotiations and discussions for reasons of commercial sensitivity.   <\/p><p>  The relocation of the National Maternity Hospital to the Elm Park development adjacent to St Vincent's University Hospital was explored and considered earlier this year.   Discussions took place with NAMA in relation to the Elm Park development and these negotiations have now concluded.    While there were some discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the proposal,  formal sanction was not sought for the relocation of the NMH to the Elm Park development.  No budget has been been provided within my Department for this project as management and delivery of the health infrastructure programme is the responsibility of the HSE.    This project cannot be dealt with in isolation and must be considered in the context of the HSE multi-annual capital programme.  The HSE is required to prioritise capital infrastructure projects within its overall capital funding allocation taking into account the existing capital commitments and costs to completion over the period.   Work on the draft Capital Plan for the next multi-annual period 2013-2017 will begin shortly and will be submitted to my Department in due course.  My Department will then review the proposals and follow up with the HSE where further details may be required.   The draft Capital Plan 2013-2017 will require my approval with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRY03900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Expenditure","counter":1509,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRY03950"},{"type":"question","counter":1510,"qnumday":603,"qnumall":"[44167\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRY04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount that has been spent on capital investment into the buildings, fixtures, fittings and permanent equipment at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, Dublin 2, in each of the past 10 years; the moneys that are budgeted for in future expenditures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1511,"content":"<p>The management and delivery of the health capital programme is a service matter.

An EHIC entitles a person to necessary healthcare in the public system of any EU\/EEA Member State and Switzerland also if they become ill or injured while on a temporary stay in that country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRBB03600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1662,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRBB03650"},{"type":"question","counter":1663,"qnumday":658,"qnumall":"[44527\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRBB03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite an application for a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 15; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1664,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRBB03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":1665,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRBB03850"},{"type":"question","counter":1666,"qnumday":659,"qnumall":"[44528\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRBB03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will update D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on services provided by the State for citizens who suffer from Huntington's disease; if he envisages that improved neurological, genetic, psychiatric and psychological services will be available as part of a national strategy for the treatment of rare diseases; if he will engage with the British Government on the idea of sharing services for sufferers of Huntington's disease; if the fair deal scheme will incorporate home care support and respite services for sufferers who are age less than 65 years; if his Department will consider special facilitation for sufferers of chronic, progressive and incurable conditions including Huntington's disease, who must reapply for medical cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"997","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1667,"qnumday":687,"qnumall":"[44753\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRBB04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to resource the much needed support for persons living with Huntington's disease (details supplied)","asker":"998","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1668,"qnumday":688,"qnumall":"[44754\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRBB04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons in County Donegal that have been diagnosed with Huntington's disease","asker":"998","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1669,"qnumday":689,"qnumall":"[44755\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRBB04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons countrywide that have been diagnosed with Huntington's disease","asker":"998","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1670,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 659 and 687 to 689, inclusive, together.<\/p><p><br \/>  Huntington's Disease (HD) is a genetic, neurological disorder and is classified as a rare disease.  The supports provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to people with HD involve a multi-disciplinary team approach to the provision of health and personal supports and incorporates assisted living services, including Personal Assistant Services, Aids &amp; Appliances and hospital, primary care and community services.  The Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland (HDAI), provides consultation, information and individualised support to those diagnosed with Huntington's Disease, their families and their health care team.<\/p><p><br \/>  The HSE is committed to working in partnership with voluntary disability service providers, including HDAI, to ensure that all of the resources available for people with disabilities are used in the most effective manner possible.  The HSE recognises the valuable contribution of the HDAI and approved a grant of just over &#8364;68,000 for 2012 to support the work of the organisation.  The HDAI is a member of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland and the Disability Federation of Ireland.  Both umbrella organisations provide support to the HDAI and are supported by the State through funding from the Health Service Executive.<\/p><p><br \/>  Medical cards are provided to persons who, under the provision of the Health Act 1970, are in the opinion of the HSE unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services and other health services for themselves and their dependants.  The assessment for a medical card is therefore determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  Under this legislation, there is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with specific illness such as Huntington's Disease.  There is however, a provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a card in cases of &quot;undue hardship&quot;, where the income guidelines are exceeded.  The HSE has recently set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.<\/p><p><br \/>  I established a National Steering Group to develop a policy framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of rare diseases based on the principles of high quality care, equity and to be patient centred.  The policy will operate over a five year period, take account of the EU Council Recommendations on Rare Diseases (2009) and define priority actions subject to resource availability.  Similar plans are being drafted by individual countries across the EU.  Article 12 of Directive 2011\/24\/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare establishes that the Commission shall support Member States in the development of European Reference Networks between healthcare providers and Centres of Expertise in the Member States. It is envisaged that the main added value of the European Reference Networks and therefore of the Centres of Expertise will be to facilitate improvements in access to diagnosis and delivery of high-quality, accessible and cost-effective healthcare in the case of patients who have a medical condition requiring a particular concentration of expertise or resources, particularly in medical domains where expertise is rare. Work is ongoing on at EU level on the development of criteria, structures and governance arrangements for such networks and the Department of Health is participating in the relevant Expert Groups.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme, <b><i>A Fair Deal<\/i><\/b>  , is a system of financial support for people who require long-term nursing home care.  The Programme for Government commits to review the Scheme with a view to developing a secure and equitable system of financing for community and long-term care which supports older people, including those with Huntington's Disease to stay in their own homes.  My Department has requested information from the HSE on the numbers of people in Co. Donegal and nationwide who have been diagnosed with Huntington's Disease and my Department will forward that information to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRBB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":1671,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRBB04350"},{"type":"question","counter":1672,"qnumday":660,"qnumall":"[44574\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRBB04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the preparations he and the Health Service Executive have made to secure adequate supplies of both flu and meningitis vaccines; if he will outline the plan for both campaigns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1673,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRBB04500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":1674,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRBB04550"},{"type":"question","counter":1675,"qnumday":661,"qnumall":"[44583\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRBB04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ask the Health Service Executive if he will restore physiotherapy services available to the community in Athy, County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1676,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRBB04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1678,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1679,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[44584\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the waiting time for cataract operations for persons in County Limerick; if he will request the Health Service Executive to prioritise older persons on the scale of their visual impairment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1680,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Funding","counter":1681,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1682,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[44590\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the services that have been reduced by the Health Service Executive North\/East as a result of the cutback of &euro;130 million in expenditure announced at the end of August; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1683,"content":"<p>The HSE has a statutory responsibility to live within the budget voted to it by the Oireachtas.  Detailed cost containment plans have been in place across the health service since the beginning of the year, but an increasing demand for services has contributed in a significant way to the ongoing deficit.  In order to deal with this, the HSE was required to introduce a range of additional cost reduction measures.<\/p><p><br \/>   The range of additional measures announced at the end of August amounted to &#8364;130 million.  In compiling these measures, every effort was taken to target areas that do not impact on direct client\/patient services, with a view to protecting, in as much as is possible, the most essential front-line services.  The &#8364;130m of cost reduction measures is in addition to other non-operational measures to be undertaken, that have been submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, including cash acceleration of receipts from health insurers and once-off transfers from capital to current within the HSE and funding available within the Department of Health's own Vote.  It is a priority for the HSE to minimise, to the greatest extent possible,  the impact on patients and clients of any spending reductions.  Therefore,more than half of the proposals focused on areas that do not have a direct patient impact such as furniture, education and training, office expenses, laptops and PCs, travel and subsistence etc.<\/p><p><br \/>  Prior to the announcement of the &#8364;130m additional cost reduction measures at the end of August, the Louth Meath Hospital Group had already identified the need to introduce measures to reduce its deficit, including a reduction in the usage of agency and overtime.  The Louth Meath Hospital Group is reconfiguring services across the hospital group in order to reduce agency staff costs, with every effort being made to ensure that service reconfiguration will have minimal impact on patients and clients.  Measures have already been introduced to reduce spending in relation to overtime.<\/p><p>It is proposed that there will be a reduction of a maximum of &#8364;8 million on home help hours between now and the end of December.  There are approximately<font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font>11 million home help hours provided annually with a budget of &#8364;195 million.  It is the HSE&#8217;s intention that the impact of reductions will be minimised by ensuring that services are provided in the first instance for direct patient care. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Home Help Service and budget allocation in HSE Cavan and Monaghan is set out in the HSE Dublin North East Service Plan 2012, and there will be no further change to the service delivery arrangements in Cavan and Monaghan to year end.<\/p><p><br \/>  In Louth\/Meath, the HSE has assured me that personal care hours for the most vulnerable clients will be prioritised and focus for reductions will be on domestic duties for less vulnerable patients. No current recipient of this service, who has an assessed need for the service, will be left without a service.  The number of home help hours to be provided in Louth\/Meath between now and the end of the year will be reviewed on an ongoing basis as part of prudent financial management.<\/p><p> My Department is working intensively with the HSE on proposals for submission to Government to address structural expenditure issues in the context of the 2013 Estimates.  This includes reconfiguration of services, maximising the potential for flexibility under the Croke Park Agreement and curtailing expenditure in the Primary Care Reimbursement Service.  These proposals are entirely appropriate and in keeping with the focus in the Programme for Government on reforming the way health services are funded and delivered to achieve greater productivity and more cost effective services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":1684,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1685,"qnumday":664,"qnumall":"[44591\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the cervical cancer vaccine (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1686,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Issues","counter":1687,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1688,"qnumday":665,"qnumall":"[44593\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there will be recruitment by the Health Service Executive of social workers in the HSE South\/HSE West or any other HSE areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1689,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1690,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1691,"qnumday":666,"qnumall":"[44603\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a medical card application in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1692,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Positive Ageing Strategy Publication","counter":1693,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1694,"qnumday":667,"qnumall":"[44633\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the positive ageing strategy will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1695,"qnumday":673,"qnumall":"[44693\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600066#WRCC01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will outline the progress made toward a National Positive Ageing Strategy in 2012; and if he will provide a timeline for publication of this strategy.","asker":"1011","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1696,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 667 and 673 together.<\/p><p>  The programme for Government has committed to completing and implementing the National Positive Ageing Strategy so that older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live independent full lives.<\/p><p>  The strategy will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland.

Approximately 2,200 new cases are diagnosed each year, and it is cause of death in around 950 people each year.

Local offices may operate a discretionary budget which covers a wide range of items ranging from mobility aids to communication aids.  It is possible that some individuals have received orthopaedic footwear in the past from this source.<\/p><p>  The HSE has agreed to a number of non-service impacting cash reduction measures, which includes a &euro;3 million saving from the aids and appliances budget.

A STEMI is a heart attack caused by a blockage in the arteries.  It is diagnosed by using 12 lead ECG machines and treated by clot busting drugs (thrombolysis) or by the insertion of a wire into the artery to open it by using a balloon to allow the blood to flow to the heart muscle again.  This is known as a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) and can only be done in a hospital equipped with an emergency catheter laboratory.  Ambulances are equipped and paramedics trained to recognize a major heart attack and to transport these patients to a primary PCI centre hospital.  PPCI services went live in Galway on October 1st  and it is anticipated that Limerick will become a 24 hour centre for these patients within the next few weeks as the programme is rolled out throughout the country following an inspection by the national clinical ACS Programme Lead. <\/p><p>  International evidence has shown that PPCI is the most effective treatment for major heart attacks and most countries in the developed world have moved to this model of treatment.  It is for this reason that we are striving to expand this service to the people of the Mid West.  The number of patients requiring this service out of hours in the Mid West each year is approximately 58.  Limerick has a 24\/7 coronary care unit and both this and day cardiology services will shortly move to a new, state of the art critical care block.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that a STEMI  is not a case of cardiac arrest.

The HSE is bound by the definition of eligibility in the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006, which requires a positive diagnostic test for applications received by the Tribunal after the specified date of 20 June, 2006.  <\/p><p>  A great deal of consideration has been given to the issue of recipients of Anti-D who have neither tested positive for Hepatitis C, nor had a positive Tribunal decision in their favour.  A number of women who have tested negative for Hepatitis C have experienced a variety of symptoms. However, there is no scientific proof that the symptoms are specific evidence of Hepatitis C infection.  Indeed some symptoms of Hepatitis C, such as fatigue, fibromyalgia and depression, are common conditions that occur in the general population. <\/p><p>  It is estimated that up to 16,000 women in Ireland were exposed to potentially infectious batches of Anti-D and approximately 1,000 of these women were infected with Hepatitis C. Extending eligibility for HAA cards to those who have tested negative for Hepatitis C would have significant implications for the scheme overall.  <\/p><p>  I am sympathetic to the women in question, but taking account of international practice and the rationale which led to the passing of the 2006 Act, I am satisfied that the present arrangements are reasonable in the circumstances.

In that context, my Department will in the coming days be commencing a strategic review of the current and future role of Rosslare within the context of national ports policy. This review will involve external consultants\u00a0and will consider the port&rsquo;s current commercial and operational efficiency and advise as to whether the port is maximising its potential. Furthermore, it will seek to identify and analyse all likely options with regard to the future ownership and operation of the port and having regard to all relevant factors and make recommendations as to the optimal ownership and operational structure for the port.<\/p><p>  As regards the N11 and N25 upgrades, as Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;

We have set out in our National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) that we will do this through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heat, which together would amount to 16% of all energy consumed in the State. <\/p><p>  At the end of 2011, we were at 17.6% renewable electricity, 3.6% renewable transport (biofuels) and 5% renewable heat. Together these amounted to 6.5% all energy consumed being from renewables in 2011. This means we have another 8 years within which to achieve the remaining 9.5%, which will be very challenging. <\/p><p>  Our NREAP and the Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012-2020 published by my Department earlier this year sets out the various policies and strategies that have been put in place on renewable energy. In the electricity sector, EirGrid&rsquo;s 2008 <\/p><p>  Grid25 strategy is being implemented, alongside the rollout of the Gate 3 grid connections to renewable generators. <\/p><p>  Onshore wind will make up the bulk of the 40% 2020 renewable electricity consumption target. In this context, it is recognised that there is an important balance to be struck between renewable energy development and the possible concerns of local communities in regard to issues such as proximity, visual amenity, and noise.<\/p><p>  Existing Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Wind Energy Development (published by the Department of Environment in 2006) State that in general, noise is unlikely to be a significant problem, where the distance from the nearest turbine to any noise sensitive property is more than 500 metres.  The Guidelines also advise planning authorities to seek evidence that the types of turbines proposed in a particular development will use best current engineering practice in terms of noise creation and suppression and provide quite specific limits in the permissible increases in noise above background noise from wind energy developments in order to protect neighbouring properties.<\/p><p>  The current system therefore provides for a degree of specificity and uniformity across all planning authorities while also leaving the final decision in the hands of the local decision makers &ndash; who have the benefit of any submissions or observations from third parties &ndash; in making their decision. <\/p><p>  It is considered that the introduction of mandatory minimum distances set out in statute, as proposed under the Wind Turbines Bill 2012, could effectively prohibit a planning authority from considering wind energy development that may otherwise be acceptable or even desirable from a broader energy policy perspective.<\/p><p>  Along with my ministerial colleagues in the Department of Environment, we feel that the issues raised in the proposed Wind Turbines Bill are best addressed through a targeted review of the existing guidelines rather than legislation.<\/p><p>  In order to ensure that Ireland continues to meet its renewable energy targets and at the same time ensure that wind energy does not have negative impacts on local communities, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government &ndash; in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders &ndash; will undertake a targeted review of certain aspects of the Wind Energy Guidelines.  This focused review will examine the manner in which the Guidelines address key issues of community concern such as noise proximity and visual amenity and any other potential impacts as considered appropriate together with exploring ways of building community support for wind energy development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600067#WRP03800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Career Breaks","counter":1933,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600067#WRP03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1934,"qnumday":388,"qnumall":"[44363\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600067#WRP04000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of staff in his Department or agencies under his control that are currently on career break; the number of staff currently hired temporarily to cover those on career break; if he will provide a breakdown of the numbers by grade and agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1935,"content":"<p>There are fourteen staff members in my Department that are currently on career break and the grade breakdown is as follows:<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>Grade<\/div><\/th><th><div>Number<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Clerical Officer<\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Executive Officer<\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Higher Executive Officer<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Geologist<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>No persons were hired to cover those on career break.<\/p><p>In relation to the State Agencies under the aegis of my Department, this is an operational matter for the individual agency in the first instance and I have no function in this regard.

The Act allows for the direct provision of water and wastewater treatment services by a water services authority in an area where population or economic activities are sufficiently concentrated. A water services authority therefore has to take account of the economic cost in determining where it will directly undertake the provision of water and wastewater treatment services. <\/p><p>  In accordance with the 2007 Act, my role as the nister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in relation to water services is to facilitate the provision of safe and efficient water services and associated water services infrastructure, with responsibility for supervision of the performance by water services authorities of their functions in the water services sector. My Department's role is in developing and implementing Government policy in this area, making sure that the necessary funding is made available to finance the Water Services Investment and the Rural Water Programmes and monitoring physical and financial progress on schemes. In the period 2000 to 2011 (inclusive), over &euro;5.5 billion has been invested in the water services sector under these programmes. The overall strategy of investment in water services is to ensure that the timing and scale of investment facilitates economic and other development, achieves compliance with statutory requirements and promotes environmental sustainability objectives. <\/p><p>  Ireland has a very diverse water supply system, with over 950 public water supplies producing over 1,600 million litres of water daily through a network of 25,000 km of pipes.

All parties have now submitted their responses to my request for proposals for a voluntary industry led solution for homeowners. The responses are now being evaluated and , together with the relevant recommendations in the pyrite report will inform the developmen t of proposals which will provide for a solution to the pyrite problem. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Pyrite Panel undertook a desktop study, in conjunction with stakeholder consultation, to establish facts in relation to the potential exposure to pyrite problems. The information was gathered from a number of sources including local authorities, structural guarantee providers, representatives of homeowners, private builders, construction professionals and public representatives and was cross referenced to verify, as far as practicable, its validity. According to the report, approximately 850 dwellings had a claim with a guarantee provider at March 2012. However, it should be noted that not all those   claims had been verified. The Pyrite Panel recommended the categorisation of dwellings as a mechanism to determine suitable remediation approaches for pyrite affected dwellings .     <\/p><p><br \/>  It further recommended that d wellings categorised as &#8220;red&#8221; should be remediated immediately and dwellings categorised as amber, where there is no significant pyrite related damage, should be monitored and only remediated if significant damage occurs.  I believe the methodology for remediation recommended by the Pyrite Panel offers a pragmatic and sensible approach. The remediation of dwellings is an expensive and disruptive process and I agree with the view expressed by the Panel that it would be unreasonable to remediate d wellings if they are not exhibiting pyrite related damage.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The testing and categorisation protocol, currently under development by the National Standa rds Authority of Ireland (NSAI), will address the   issue of the assessment of damage and the appropriate method for monitoring the amber category. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has set up a dedicated email address , , for dealing with pyrite related queries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600068#WRQ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Career Breaks","counter":2006,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600068#WRQ03750"},{"type":"question","counter":2007,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[44366\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600068#WRQ03800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of staff in his Department or agencies under his control that are currently on career break; the number of staff currently hired temporarily to cover those on career break; if he will provide a breakdown of the numbers by grade and agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":2008,"qnumday":447,"qnumall":"[45609\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600068#WRQ03900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of staff that availed of the special civil service incentive career break scheme 2009; the cost of the scheme since its introduction; the savings on the pay bill in that time period; the estimated full year cost for the return of all the new civil servants in 2013; the number of staff members that applied for a further extension of their leave; if these staff were counted as a reduction in numbers employed in the public service during that time period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":2009,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[45624\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600068#WRQ04000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of staff across the public service that are currently on a career break; if he will provide a breakdown of the numbers on career leave by Department and agency; the estimated cost of this scheme per year; the number of staff currently hired temporarily to cover those on career break; the reforms that have taken place in this general area in the past year; if these staff were counted as a reduction in numbers employed in the public service during that time period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2010,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 410, 447 and 448 together.<\/p><p>There are two different career break schemes in operation in my Department at present, special leave without pay for a career break as provided under Department of Finance Circular 18 of 1998, as amended, and the Special Civil Service Incentive Career Break Scheme 2009 introduced under the Department of Finance Circular 13 of 2009.<\/p><p>Staff of my Department may avail of special leave without pay for a career break as provided for under the Department of Finance Circular 18 of 1998, as amended.

The Law Society is the independent statutory body for the regulation of the solicitors profession in the State.  Section 5 of the Solicitors Act 1954 provides for the Society to make regulations which are necessary for the carrying out of its functions and requires that such regulations be laid by the Society before each House of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>  The new regulation, which prohibits the same solicitor from acting for both vendor and purchaser in conveyancing transactions, was made by the Law Society on foot of the recommendations contained in the &quot;Conveyancing Conflicts Task Force Report&quot; published by the Society in July.  The Task Force was specifically set up to look at the existing guidelines and regulations relating to solicitors acting for both parties in such transactions.  The Report, which is publicly available on the Law Society's website (www.lawsociety.ie), details the arguments that were put forward both in favour of and against the introduction of this regulation and explains the reasons behind the decision to propose its adoption.  It sets out how the Task Force undertook extensive consultations with members of the solicitors profession and other relevant interested parties and stakeholders and took account, inter alia, of the November 2010 joint HSE and UCD report concerning the &quot;Abuse and Neglect of Older People in Ireland&quot;.  The Task Force also researched and reviewed the regulatory regimes in other jurisdictions and analysed judicial and academic commentary relevant to all issues considered.<\/p><p>  In noting the Deputy's concerns about the possible cost implications of the new Law Society Regulation, I would expect the relevant costs to even out on the basis of the actual work being done for each party concerned and this is something that can be monitored including in the context of the new and more transparent legal costs regime to be introduced under the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011.  I also have to acknowledge the lessons of previous litigation in this area and of our last property boom which point to the fundamental need to avoid conflicts of interests in the conduct of conveyancing transactions - be that on the part of solicitors or on the part of their clients including where multiple, elderly or otherwise vulnerable family members may be concerned.  While it would be better if such protections were not necessary at all, there can be no doubt that the new Regulation affords better protection - both to solicitors and to their respective clients - from any claims, now or in the future, that the issue of undue influence arises in relation to any conveyancing transaction concerned.  Similarly, in non-family conveyancing transactions, the interests of seller and purchaser would seem better represented and protected in their own right under the new Regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600070#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Title","counter":2114,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600070#WRS01350"},{"type":"question","counter":2115,"qnumday":451,"qnumall":"[44182\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600070#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding a property (details supplied) in Dublin 3 where there are issues on land registry and deeds,","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":2116,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[44750\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600070#WRS01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding a Land Registry application (details supplied) in Dublin 3","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2117,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 451 and 477 together.<\/p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that under the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, the Property Registration Authority (PRA) was established as and from 4 November 2006.

Part 13 of the Act, which relates to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March 2007. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children. With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and finally to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.

The very significant challenges and difficult decisions involved in this process cannot be underestimated.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Following the Governments Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, I secured the agreement of the Government to maintain the strength of the Defence Forces at a level of 9,500 serving personnel.  While this represents a very significant commitment on the part of Government, at this strength level it was not possible to maintain the then organisational structure of the Defence Forces, which had been designed to support a serving strength of 11,500.  As a result, I asked the Secretary General of the Department and the Chief of Staff to conduct a detailed review of the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces and to bring forward proposals on an appropriate organisation for a Defence Forces of 9,500 serving personnel which could continue to deliver the services required by Government.  I accepted the proposals submitted jointly by the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff which recommended a reorganisation of Defence Forces' units based on a two Brigade structure.  <\/p><p><br \/>  All personnel in the Defence Forces have now been briefed on the reorganisation proposals.  They will receive further briefings and advice on the many options available to them as implementation of the reorganisation progresses.  The reorganisation implementation plan is designed to limit as far as possible the dislocation of personnel and this will become clear as the plan is implemented.  <\/p><p><br \/>  While the reorganisation means that units will be moved among existing locations, it maintains, as far as possible, the existing organisational strengths within the current locations.  (See enclosed table which shows the serving strength in each barracks prior to the announcement of the reorganisation, and the proposed establishment post the implementation of the reorganisation).  Certain units are being disbanded, amalgamated or relocated as part of the reorganisation.  However, insofar as is practicable, serving members in the Defence Forces whose units are being moved will have the opportunity to either move with their unit or to take up new appointments within or close to their existing locations.  In addition, very significant opportunities for training, career progression and promotion will continue to be available within the reorganised structure for the Defence Forces.  While every effort will be made to accommodate members of the Defence Forces, inevitably, some personnel will have to change location in order to fill appointments in the new organisation.  However, contrary to much of what is being stated in correspondence, there is no question of mandatorily requiring all the personnel currently serving in units changing location to move with their unit and I would like to take this opportunity to allay any concerns in that regard.   <\/p><p><br \/>  I am committed to maintaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to meet their operational requirements and the current reorganisation is part of that process.  I would like to reiterate that the reorganisation will be implemented in a manner which best addresses the future organisational needs and capability requirements of the Defence Forces, while facilitating as far as possible the circumstances of individual members and detailed discussions with both Representative Associations are ongoing in this regard.  I trust the above clarifies the matter for you.         <\/p><p>Yours sincerely,     <\/p><p>&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under;&under; <\/p><p><b>ALAN SHATTER, T.D.<\/b><b>MINISTER FOR JUSTICE, EQUALITY &amp; DEFENCE.<\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600071#WRT02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2194,"content":"<p>Question No. 477 answered with Question No. 451.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UN Conventions Ratification","counter":2195,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600071#WRT02475"},{"type":"question","counter":2196,"qnumday":478,"qnumall":"[44768\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600071#WRT02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when Ireland will ratify the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2197,"content":"<p>It is the Government&#8217;s intention to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are being met.

In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Convention monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, is in the process of assisting it to assess the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed. <\/p><p><br \/>  One of the key requirements in this regard is the enactment of mental capacity legislation.  The Government&#8217;s Legislation Programme as announced on 18 September 2012, indicates that the Mental Capacity Bill is expected to be published in the current D&aacute;il session.  The Bill will replace the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework governing decision-making on behalf of adults who lack capacity.

I believe this is the optimum strength required to fulfil all roles currently assigned by Government.  The Military Authorities have advised that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 31 August 2012, the latest date for which details are available, was 8,838 thus requiring the recruitment of approximately 600 personnel to maintain the agreed Permanent Defence Force strength of 9,500.  This recruitment of approximately 600 personnel will be achieved within the resource envelope allocated to Defence. <\/p><p>  The consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective in the ongoing defence modernisation programme and has been recommended in many reports over the past number of years. This was a key consideration of Government in addressing barrack closures as releasing personnel from security and support functions enables the operational capacity of the Defence Forces to be maintained notwithstanding the fall in strength.<\/p><p>For example military personnel occupied on security and support functions within the four barracks closed on 30th March 2012 have been released for operational duties leading to an efficiency gain of around &euro;5 million per annum. In addition, there are direct cash savings of approximately &euro;1.3 million per annum arising from savings on utilities, maintenance and security duty allowances in the four barracks.<\/p><p>  Since 1998 a total of 14 barracks have been closed.  The total amount realised to date in terms of sales of surplus property is approximately &euro;84m.

While the changes introduced in respect of the 2012 Scheme, necessitated by the budgetary situation, included a requirement to have had a stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, provision was made for those who did not achieve this minimum to apply for derogation, on specific conditions. Of the 10,000 farmers eligible to apply, almost 9,500 availed of the opportunity; to date, almost 80% of the cases decided upon have been successful. Those who have not been successful are being afforded the opportunity of appeal to the DAS Appeals Committee, under independent chairmanship of Mr Padraig Gibbons. <\/p><p>  Faced with the need to make budgetary savings for the current financial year and, mindful of the difficulties faced by those most dependent on the support which the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme provides, I chose to make technical adjustments to the Scheme terms and conditions, designed to better focus the aid on those contributing most to achieving the aims of the Scheme namely, ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of viable rural communities, maintaining the countryside and maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which take account of environmental protection measures. <\/p><p>  REPS is an agri-environment measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007-2013.  It is designed to encourage farmers to go beyond basic good farming practice and to farm in a way that benefits the landscape, biodiversity and water quality.  Every member state must have an agri-environment measure and REPS is co-funded by the EU at the rate of 55%. The scheme has proven to be very popular with Irish farmers and confirms their commitment to farming to the highest environmental standards, a commitment I might add, that fits very comfortably with the vision of smart, green, growth as set out in my Department&rsquo;s Food Harvest 2020 strategy statement.<\/p><p>  I remain committed to supporting farmers who choose to farm to environmentally friendly practices and to ensuring that these farmers are rewarded for their efforts Under EU Regulations. In this regard I recently announced the reopening of AEOS with funding of &euro;20m annually, with scheme documentation now available on the Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>  Payment rates in an agri-environment scheme must be justified mainly by reference to income forgone and additional costs incurred by the farmer because of the nature of his or her undertakings.  Also up to 20% of an additional payment may be justified by what are called &ldquo;transaction costs&rdquo;. Given the state of the public finances, in finalising my Department&rsquo;s estimates for 2012, I had no option but to announce a 10% cut in the rate of payment to existing REPS 4 applicants.

Under those arrangements Ireland will have received an additional 9.3% in quota between 2007 and 2014.  However for some countries, including Ireland, these quota increases are insufficient to accommodate increases in milk production which have been driven by supply and demand dynamics and the prospect of a quota free production environment after 2015.<\/p><p>  I have been extremely active in seeking to secure a soft landing for all Member States in the lead-up to milk quota abolition in 2015, as envisaged in the 2008 CAP Health Check agreement.  I have discussed the matter extensively with other EU Agriculture Ministers, including in bilateral meetings with my Danish, French, German, Estonian and Finnish counterparts.  Furthermore, officials from my Department have raised this issue at EU level meetings, and at bi-lateral meetings with other Member States.  The Commission is due to prepare the second interim report on the Health Check by the end of this year and in that context we have called for it to consider measures to ensure a smooth transition to quota abolition in all countries.  <\/p><p>  To date, however, the Commission has resisted attempts to reconsider this issue, as it has resisted attempts to revisit the outcome of the 2008 CAP Health Check in an overall sense.  The Commission&rsquo;s view is supported by a number of Member States, some of whom are firmly against any further adjustment to the Health Check agreement.  It is also the case that only a minority of Member states is likely to be adversely affected by the current quota restrictions, and therefore persuading a qualified majority to agree to an adjustment of the current regime represents a significant challenge.  There are currently no signs of a breakthrough in this regard.<\/p><p>  At this point therefore, it would appear that since a majority of Member States do not support any further adjustment to the soft landing, farmers should plan for the continuation of the quota regime until March 2015. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600074#WRW01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Imports","counter":2389,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600074#WRW01950"},{"type":"question","counter":2390,"qnumday":544,"qnumall":"[44730\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600074#WRW02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of litres of goats milk imported into the State in 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"966","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2391,"content":"<p>My Department is not in possession of the data in question as this level of detail is not available in the official trade statistics produced by the Central Statistics Office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600074#WRW02100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Environment Protection Scheme Payments","counter":2392,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600074#WRW02150"},{"type":"question","counter":2393,"qnumday":545,"qnumall":"[44734\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600074#WRW02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding a fine in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2394,"content":"<p>The final instalment of &euro;1,811.46 of an existing REPS 3 debt that arose in 2009 was netted against a Disadvantaged Area Payments which issued on 25 September 2012.

The scientific advice for the southern stock  over recent years has been that the landings should be reduced and as a result there have been cuts to the TAC year on year since 2006  A rebuilding plan for the stock has been prepared by the Irish industry in consultation with the Marine Institute and submitted by the Regional Advisory Council for Pelagic stocks to the EU Commission.  The Commission has referred the plan to the EU Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for advice which is expected shortly.  There is an EU Management Plan in place since 2008 for the northern stock off the coast of Scotland and the TAC is set each year in accordance with the terms of that plan.<\/p><p>Over the past few years there has been increased interest in participation in these fisheries. This has raised concern about the sustainability of the stock in the context of that level of participation and in relation to the economic viability of individual quota allocations with that increased level of participation.<\/p><p>In 2011, I asked the fishing industry and other interested parties to make proposals on the future management arrangements for all Irish herring fisheries. The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed.  I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.<\/p><p>On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter and I consulted and met industry regarding the draft policy, again there was no consensus.  On 8 June 2012 I issued a policy, having considered all views and having regard to the sustainability of the fisheries which I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks.  The policy is based on giving access to each of the fisheries to those with recent track record in that particular fishery.  The track record involves vessels having landed a minimum of 5 tonnes of herring in 2009 or 2010 or in 3 of the 5 years during the period 2006 to 2010.  In addition, there are some very limited specified circumstances where an earlier track record may be taken into account.<\/p><p>The decision made was based on a clear, detailed and objective assessment of the fisheries in recent years.  This policy is intended to ensure the long term sustainability of the herring fisheries by limiting participation in the main fisheries to those vessels which have participated in the fishery, in the 5 years prior to the commencement of the review, even at a low level. The number of vessels which were allocated quota is as follows:  2009 &ndash; 65 vessels, 2010 - 63 vessels, 2011 &ndash; 92 vessels and 2012 &ndash; 56 vessels.  The revised arrangements have been applied in the North West herring Fishery which commenced on 1\/10\/2012.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s quotas for each stock for 2011 and 2012 are as follows:<\/p><p><b>Table 1 Quota adjustments<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th>2011<\/th><th>ICES Area VIa South and VIIb,c<\/th><th>ICES Area VIa North:  <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Quota<\/td><td>4,065<\/td><td>3,396<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carry over<\/td><td>851<\/td><td>309<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Transferred<\/td><td>385<\/td><td>-385<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Swap<\/td><td><\/td><td>75<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total (8696)<\/td><td>5,301<\/td><td>3,395<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><table><tr><th>2012<\/th><th>ICES Area VIa South and VIIb,c<\/th><th>ICES Area VIa North:  <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Quota<\/td><td>3,861<\/td><td>3,459<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carry over<\/td><td>530<\/td><td>319<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Transferred<\/td><td>386<\/td><td>-386<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Swap<\/td><td><\/td><td>24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total (8,193)<\/td><td>4,777<\/td><td>3,416<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>The table below is the data which the Deputy has requested.<\/p><p><b>Table 2.

There were 4 such staff availing of the Incentivised Career Break at the time. Two of these were due to resume their career in August 2012. One has resigned from the service and the other is due to resume employment later this month. The remaining two are not due back until early 2013. The payroll saving in relation to these career breaks is estimated to be &euro;0.239 million. If all three remaining staff were to resume employment, their full year salary costs would be in the region of &euro;0.120 million.<\/p><p>  In addition to the above, there are two staff on career breaks from the Children Detention Schools, one of which is an Incentivised Career Break. The payroll saving in relation to the Incentivised Career Break is estimated at &euro;0.105 million and the full year salary should that person resume employment would be in the region of &euro;0.048 million.  Similarly, there are two staff on career breaks in  the Family Support Agency, one of which is an Incentivised Career Break. The payroll saving in relation to this is estimated at &euro;0.076 million and associated full year salary cost if they resume will be &euro;0.038 million.<\/p><p>  Staff on career breaks are not replaced and work is re-organised and prioritised to cope with the absence. Staff on career break, or indeed any other form of unpaid leave, are not counted in staff census during the absence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600075#WRX00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":2441,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600075#WRX00850"},{"type":"question","counter":2442,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[44462\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600075#WRX00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the cost in 2011 to her Department and to each body under the aegis of her Department of implementing the Official Languages Act 2003; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2443,"content":"<p>The total cost in 2011 to my Department and to each body under the aegis of  my Department of implementing the Official Languages Act 2003 was  &euro;31,721.20 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600075#WRX01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Lottery Funding Applications","counter":2444,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600075#WRX01050"},{"type":"question","counter":2445,"qnumday":563,"qnumall":"[44652\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600075#WRX01100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding an application for National Lottery funding (details supplied) in Dublin 8; when it is expected that a decision will be made; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1030","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2446,"content":"<p>My Department has received an application for Lottery funding from New Communities Youth Digi Club.

If any child is in need of care and protection and is unlikely to receive it at home, the HSE has a duty to ensure they receive appropriate care. <\/p><p>  Where a child is coming into care the HSE allocated social worker undertakes a full assessment of need, and on this basis the statutory care plan is developed. This assessment will call on a full range of professionals where required to set out a comprehensive statement of the child's needs. The care plan also determines the support and interventions needed with regard to the family situation where it is planned that a child will return home.  The care plan also directs the placement most appropriate to the needs of the child. <\/p><p>  Children in residential care are placed in open residential centres run by either the HSE or private\/voluntary providers in communities across the country. The National Standards for Children's Residential Centres clearly set out that the social worker and the centre manager are satisfied that the placement is suitable, will meet the needs of the young person and takes account of the need to protect young people from abuse by their peers.  The HSE is responsible for the registration and inspection of private or voluntary (non-statutory) run residential centres for children and the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) inspects centres operated by the HSE. Centres are inspected under the National Standards.  <\/p><p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) was established under the Health Act, 2007 and replaced the Social Services Inspectorate. HIQA is an independent authority responsible for driving quality, safety and accountability in services for children, older people and people with disabilities in Ireland.  HIQA develops standards for Ministerial approval, monitors compliance with standards and carries out investigations where they believe there are reasonable grounds to do so.  HIQA inspects children&rsquo;s residential centres, special care units and foster care settings against the National Standards for Children's Residential Centres, National Standards for Special Care Units and the National Standards for Foster Care.   HIQA publishes their inspection reports on their website. <\/p><p>  In July 2010, the Government decided to prioritise the inspection of child protection by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). These inspections will be undertaken against standards to be developed by HIQA as provided for under Section 8 of the Health Act 2007. HIQA commenced work on drafting National Standards for the Protection and Welfare of Children  and convened a Standards Advisory Group to advise on their development. The Advisory Group, which comprises a wide representation of people from the health and social care sector met several times and the Child Protection and Welfare Standards were published in July 2012.   My department was involved in advising HIQA.  It is expected that the first inspections by HIQA based on the standards for child protection will take place by the end of the year.

Co-location of maternity hospitals with adult acute services is the optimal solution for the provision of hospital-based maternity services, as it can provide access to the full range of medical and surgical specialties and clinical support services in sufficient volume and complexity to provide added value.  This is particularly important for high-risk mothers and babies.   Therefore it is proposed that the maternity hospitals should be relocated alongside adult acute services.  In this context the National Maternity Hospital is to be relocated to St Vincent's.  The Dublin maternity hospitals have been working with the HSE in relation to the development of their business cases for relocation.   <\/p><p>  Within the context of its commercial remit, NAMA advises that it is at all times open to proposals which can contribute to the achievement of broader social and economic objectives.  My officials and I met with NAMA once this year and the Secretary General of the Department also met with NAMA in June 2011.  While a variety of topics and areas of interest were discussed at these meetings, you will understand that I cannot provide detail on the negotiations and discussions for reasons of commercial sensitivity.   <\/p><p>  The relocation of the National Maternity Hospital to the Elm Park development adjacent to St Vincent's University Hospital was explored and considered earlier this year.   Discussions took place with NAMA in relation to the Elm Park development and these negotiations have now concluded.    While there were some discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the proposal,  formal sanction was not sought for the relocation of the NMH to the Elm Park development.  No budget has been been provided within my Department for this project as management and delivery of the health infrastructure programme is the responsibility of the HSE.    This project cannot be dealt with in isolation and must be considered in the context of the HSE multi-annual capital programme.  The HSE is required to prioritise capital infrastructure projects within its overall capital funding allocation taking into account the existing capital commitments and costs to completion over the period.   Work on the draft Capital Plan for the next multi-annual period 2013-2017 will begin shortly and will be submitted to my Department in due course.  My Department will then review the proposals and follow up with the HSE where further details may be required.   The draft Capital Plan 2013-2017 will require my approval with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600076#WRY03900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Expenditure","counter":2547,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600076#WRY03950"},{"type":"question","counter":2548,"qnumday":603,"qnumall":"[44167\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600076#WRY04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount that has been spent on capital investment into the buildings, fixtures, fittings and permanent equipment at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, Dublin 2, in each of the past 10 years; the moneys that are budgeted for in future expenditures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2549,"content":"<p>The management and delivery of the health capital programme is a service matter.

They have three main objectives &ndash; to improve the quality of care, to improve access and to improve cost-effectiveness.  Their primary aim is to modernise the way hospital services are provided across a wide range of clinical areas.  This is being done through standardising access to and delivery of high quality, safe and efficient hospital services, and maximising linkages to primary care and other community services.    Currently there are 29 Clinical Care Programmes in different stages of development\/implementation.<\/p><p>  As part of the Orthopaedic Clinical Care Programme, prospective funding for total hip and knee replacements was introduced.   Seven hospitals were initially selected and a price was agreed per procedure. This agreed price also takes account of other medical conditions which patients may have, that may impact on their length of stay.  The reforms introduced have facilitated a reduction in the average length of stay (AvLOS) for total hip and knee replacements. The introduction of new care pathways identified a target AvLOS of  7 days for total hip and knee replacement and 10 days for revision hip replacement.   As per the table below, the AvLOS for hip replacements is currently 6.7 days and for knee replacements is 6.6 days.  These are below the target AvLOS of 7 days.<\/p><p>  In 2012, it is projected that this will result in savings of approximately 5,200 bed days for total hip\/total knee replacements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600077#WRZ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services","counter":2591,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600077#WRZ02950"},{"type":"question","counter":2592,"qnumday":620,"qnumall":"[44229\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600077#WRZ03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1855 of 18 September 2012, if he will outline the nature of the follow up services which are in place to assist children where a concern has arisen as a result of the hearing test conducted between seven to nine months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2593,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600077#WRZ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alcohol Advertising","counter":2594,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600077#WRZ03150"},{"type":"question","counter":2595,"qnumday":621,"qnumall":"[44251\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600077#WRZ03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the alcohol\/advertising proposals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2596,"content":"<p>The report of the National Substance Misuse Strategy Steering Group in relation to alcohol was launched in February last and it is continuing to encourage public debate.

The supports provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to people with HD involve a multi-disciplinary team approach to the provision of health and personal supports and incorporates assisted living services, including Personal Assistant Services, Aids &amp; Appliances and hospital, primary care and community services.  The Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland (HDAI), provides consultation, information and individualised support to those diagnosed with Huntington's Disease, their families and their health care team.<\/p><p><br \/>  The HSE is committed to working in partnership with voluntary disability service providers, including HDAI, to ensure that all of the resources available for people with disabilities are used in the most effective manner possible.  The HSE recognises the valuable contribution of the HDAI and approved a grant of just over &#8364;68,000 for 2012 to support the work of the organisation.  The HDAI is a member of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland and the Disability Federation of Ireland.  Both umbrella organisations provide support to the HDAI and are supported by the State through funding from the Health Service Executive.<\/p><p><br \/>  Medical cards are provided to persons who, under the provision of the Health Act 1970, are in the opinion of the HSE unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services and other health services for themselves and their dependants.  The assessment for a medical card is therefore determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  Under this legislation, there is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with specific illness such as Huntington's Disease.  There is however, a provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a card in cases of &quot;undue hardship&quot;, where the income guidelines are exceeded.  The HSE has recently set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.<\/p><p><br \/>  I established a National Steering Group to develop a policy framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of rare diseases based on the principles of high quality care, equity and to be patient centred.  The policy will operate over a five year period, take account of the EU Council Recommendations on Rare Diseases (2009) and define priority actions subject to resource availability.  Similar plans are being drafted by individual countries across the EU.  Article 12 of Directive 2011\/24\/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare establishes that the Commission shall support Member States in the development of European Reference Networks between healthcare providers and Centres of Expertise in the Member States. It is envisaged that the main added value of the European Reference Networks and therefore of the Centres of Expertise will be to facilitate improvements in access to diagnosis and delivery of high-quality, accessible and cost-effective healthcare in the case of patients who have a medical condition requiring a particular concentration of expertise or resources, particularly in medical domains where expertise is rare. Work is ongoing on at EU level on the development of criteria, structures and governance arrangements for such networks and the Department of Health is participating in the relevant Expert Groups.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme, <b><i>A Fair Deal<\/i><\/b>  , is a system of financial support for people who require long-term nursing home care.  The Programme for Government commits to review the Scheme with a view to developing a secure and equitable system of financing for community and long-term care which supports older people, including those with Huntington's Disease to stay in their own homes.  My Department has requested information from the HSE on the numbers of people in Co. Donegal and nationwide who have been diagnosed with Huntington's Disease and my Department will forward that information to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600079#WRBB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2709,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600079#WRBB04350"},{"type":"question","counter":2710,"qnumday":660,"qnumall":"[44574\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600079#WRBB04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the preparations he and the Health Service Executive have made to secure adequate supplies of both flu and meningitis vaccines; if he will outline the plan for both campaigns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2711,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600079#WRBB04500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":2712,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600079#WRBB04550"},{"type":"question","counter":2713,"qnumday":661,"qnumall":"[44583\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600079#WRBB04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ask the Health Service Executive if he will restore physiotherapy services available to the community in Athy, County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2714,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600079#WRBB04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":2716,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600080#WRCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2717,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[44584\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600080#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the waiting time for cataract operations for persons in County Limerick; if he will request the Health Service Executive to prioritise older persons on the scale of their visual impairment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2718,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600080#WRCC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Funding","counter":2719,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600080#WRCC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":2720,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[44590\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101600080#WRCC00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the services that have been reduced by the Health Service Executive North\/East as a result of the cutback of &euro;130 million in expenditure announced at the end of August; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2721,"content":"<p>The HSE has a statutory responsibility to live within the budget voted to it by the Oireachtas.  Detailed cost containment plans have been in place across the health service since the beginning of the year, but an increasing demand for services has contributed in a significant way to the ongoing deficit.  In order to deal with this, the HSE was required to introduce a range of additional cost reduction measures.<\/p><p><br \/>   The range of additional measures announced at the end of August amounted to &#8364;130 million.  In compiling these measures, every effort was taken to target areas that do not impact on direct client\/patient services, with a view to protecting, in as much as is possible, the most essential front-line services.  The &#8364;130m of cost reduction measures is in addition to other non-operational measures to be undertaken, that have been submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, including cash acceleration of receipts from health insurers and once-off transfers from capital to current within the HSE and funding available within the Department of Health's own Vote.  It is a priority for the HSE to minimise, to the greatest extent possible,  the impact on patients and clients of any spending reductions.  Therefore,more than half of the proposals focused on areas that do not have a direct patient impact such as furniture, education and training, office expenses, laptops and PCs, travel and subsistence etc.<\/p><p><br \/>  Prior to the announcement of the &#8364;130m additional cost reduction measures at the end of August, the Louth Meath Hospital Group had already identified the need to introduce measures to reduce its deficit, including a reduction in the usage of agency and overtime.  The Louth Meath Hospital Group is reconfiguring services across the hospital group in order to reduce agency staff costs, with every effort being made to ensure that service reconfiguration will have minimal impact on patients and clients.  Measures have already been introduced to reduce spending in relation to overtime.<\/p><p>It is proposed that there will be a reduction of a maximum of &#8364;8 million on home help hours between now and the end of December.  There are approximately<font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font>11 million home help hours provided annually with a budget of &#8364;195 million.  It is the HSE&#8217;s intention that the impact of reductions will be minimised by ensuring that services are provided in the first instance for direct patient care. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Home Help Service and budget allocation in HSE Cavan and Monaghan is set out in the HSE Dublin North East Service Plan 2012, and there will be no further change to the service delivery arrangements in Cavan and Monaghan to year end.<\/p><p><br \/>  In Louth\/Meath, the HSE has assured me that personal care hours for the most vulnerable clients will be prioritised and focus for reductions will be on domestic duties for less vulnerable patients. No current recipient of this service, who has an assessed need for the service, will be left without a service.

Approximately 2,200 new cases are diagnosed each year, and it is cause of death in around 950 people each year.

While separate National Quality Standards for both adults and children with disabilities have already been developed by HIQA, they have now brought the draft standards together in one document albeit, with the standards for adults and children being listed separately.  This draft document is now the subject of a 5 week consultation process before it can be finalised and brought before the board of HIQA.

Local offices may operate a discretionary budget which covers a wide range of items ranging from mobility aids to communication aids.  It is possible that some individuals have received orthopaedic footwear in the past from this source.<\/p><p>  The HSE has agreed to a number of non-service impacting cash reduction measures, which includes a &euro;3 million saving from the aids and appliances budget.

A STEMI is a heart attack caused by a blockage in the arteries.  It is diagnosed by using 12 lead ECG machines and treated by clot busting drugs (thrombolysis) or by the insertion of a wire into the artery to open it by using a balloon to allow the blood to flow to the heart muscle again.  This is known as a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) and can only be done in a hospital equipped with an emergency catheter laboratory.  Ambulances are equipped and paramedics trained to recognize a major heart attack and to transport these patients to a primary PCI centre hospital.  PPCI services went live in Galway on October 1st  and it is anticipated that Limerick will become a 24 hour centre for these patients within the next few weeks as the programme is rolled out throughout the country following an inspection by the national clinical ACS Programme Lead. <\/p><p>  International evidence has shown that PPCI is the most effective treatment for major heart attacks and most countries in the developed world have moved to this model of treatment.  It is for this reason that we are striving to expand this service to the people of the Mid West.
