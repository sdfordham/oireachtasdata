I established the Special Delivery Unit, (SDU), as set out in the Programme for Government. The SDU is working to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  Since its establishment there has been significant improvements in the waiting times for unscheduled care against a background of reduced funding for health, reconfiguration of services and a challenging socio-economic climate.<\/p><p>  Hospitals across the country have experienced a surge in presentations to Emergency Departments, as would be expected in the winter months, resulting in high demand for admissions and a consequent rise in trolley waits. Recent outbreaks of influenza have created additional logistical difficulties in relation to the admission, movement and discharge of patients in some hospitals. Those hospitals have released media messages advising non-attendance and restrictions on visiting.  The SDU continues to monitor Emergency Department  activity closely, engaging with key hospitals via teleconference and on-site meetings, collaborating in putting in place a range of measures to assist with patient flow and reviewing the available data for trends in relation to the reported levels of high activity. <\/p><p>Despite these pressures the year on year improvements continue nationally. Numbers recorded on trolleys at the end of 2012 showed a marked improvement of 23.6% less than 2011 which equates to 20,386 less people. From 1st January to 15th   March, there has been a total of 15,220 patients on trolleys: this is a reduction of 2,258 patients or 12.9% on the equivalent period last year. Priority now is to reduce long waiters (over 9 hours) as we move to a six hour patient journey target. The SDU and the Patient Safety &amp; Quality Directorate in HSE are  in communication to agree a mechanism of capturing and responding in instances where a hospital reports one or more patients breaching the targets.<\/p><p>  In relation to St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, it  is the largest hospital in Dublin South East region dealing with all trauma and serious cases and providing support for such patients presenting to St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital, Dun Laoghaire and St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital. The hospital has advised that over the past few weeks the number of patients requiring admission has averaged between a low of 10 to a high of 30. The hospital is working closely with the  SDU  and the Acute Medicine Programme in order to enhance patient care pathways and patient flow. <\/p><p>  The hospitals discharge process has been reviewed in detail and additional emphasis has been placed on the early identification of potential discharges.  All members of the multi-disciplinary team have been engaged in this process.  All consultants and their teams are required to identify potential &ldquo;weekend discharges&rdquo; for review by the consultant on call.  Consultants and their teams are also required to prepare a list of &ldquo;next day discharges&rdquo; on a daily basis with a view to effecting discharges by 11.00am the following day. The hospital has also introduced the following initiatives in relation to dealing with Emergency Department  pressures:<\/p><p>  - Introduction of an Acute Medicine Unit (AMU)<\/p><p>  - Acute Assessment Unit (AAU)<\/p><p>  - Clinical Decision Unit (CDU)<\/p><p>  - Chest Pain Evaluation Unit (CPEU)<\/p><p>  - Rapid access triage (Doctor\/Nurse triaging patients)<\/p><p>  - Specialty Specific targets for Length of Stay<\/p><p>  The hospital is also in daily consultation with their  community based colleagues to ensure that all necessary supports are in place to facilitate discharge from the acute setting, to facilities more appropriate to the patients needs.<\/p><p>  It is envisaged that these developments will lead to shorter lengths of stay in acute hospital care which will in turn improve waiting times and patient experience in the Emergency Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000048#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[14301\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000048#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures that have been taken to tackle in-patient and day case waiting lists in Sligo General Hospital; the impact of these measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1082","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>43 patients were waiting over a year for an inpatient or day case procedure in Sligo Regional Hospital at the end of February 2011.

In recent years, a number of changes to the pricing and reimbursement system have been successfully introduced in Ireland. These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.<\/p><p>  Following intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA),  the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including <\/p><p>- significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, <\/p><p>- a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, <\/p><p>- timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and<\/p><p>- reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.<\/p><p>The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years. Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.<\/p><p>  The Department and the HSE have successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. Under this Agreement, from 1 November 2012, the HSE will only reimburse generic products which have been priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE will require a generic price to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate. It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.<\/p><p>  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nominated EU member states in which the medicine is then available.  The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.<\/p><p>The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which was passed at Committee Stage yesterday, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. The Bill provides that when the HSE is setting a reference price for, or reviewing a reference price set for, a relevant group of interchangeable medicinal products it shall take into account the following criteria:<\/p><p>- the ability of suppliers to meet patient demand for the relevant item;<\/p><p>- the value for money afforded by the relevant item;<\/p><p>- the equivalent prices of the relevant item in all other Member States where the product is marketed;<\/p><p>- the prices of therapeutically similar items; and <\/p><p>- the resources available to the HSE.<\/p><p>It is important to balance achieving best value for money for the taxpayer with assuring continuity of supply for critical medical products, particularly in a small market like Ireland. Consequently, the Bill aims to achieve value for money while avoiding disruption in the availability of medicines on the Irish market. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000048#WRA05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":67,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000048#WRA05250"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[14299\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000048#WRA05300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures that have been taken to tackle in-patient and day case waiting lists in Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital; the impact of these measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":69,"content":"<p>In 2011, I established the Special Delivery Unit in my Department as set out in the Programme for Government.

The development of the Framework is one of the key actions identified in <i>Future Health,<\/i> the recently published Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 &#8211; 2015. It supports the message coming through from <i>Future Health<\/i> regarding the need to restructure service delivery, and improve organisational, financial, governance and accountability systems with the aim of providing a more effective and more accountable service.<\/p><p><br \/>  The vision of the Disability Services Programme as set out in the VFM Review is <i>&quot;to contribute to the realisation of a society where people with disabilities are supported, as far as possible, to participate to their full potential in economic and social life, and have access to a range of quality personal social supports and services to enhance their quality of life and well-being&quot;.  <\/i>  The recommendations in the Review describe how this vision is to be given tangible effect.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Implementation Framework determines how the recommendations from the VFM Review are translated into concrete actions. It assigns responsibilities for those actions, and specifies timelines for their completion. It also identifies priorities and key performance indicators. The Framework describes the project management and monitoring processes which are needed to make sure that the reform of the Disability Services Programme is achieved in a planned, timely and cost effective manner.<\/p><p><br \/>  The implementation of the recommendations, in the manner set out in the National Implementation Framework will ultimately improve the lives of people with disabilities in the following ways: <\/p><p><br \/>  -People with disabilities and their families will have more choice and flexibility in the services they receive and will have more control over how they access these services.<\/p><p><br \/>  -Services and supports will be tailored to meet individual need and will support greater independence and social inclusion.<\/p><p><br \/>  -The move to individualised budgeting will be underpinned by a standardised needs assessment to ensure fairness and transparency in the way in which funding is allocated.<\/p><p><br \/>  -Supports and services will be delivered with greater equity, transparency and accountability and will be more cost effective.<\/p><p><br \/>  A set of key measures necessary to implement the 7 strategic aims which are at the core of the recommendations of the VFM Review have been identified.  Each key measure has been broken down into a set of key actions.  These key measures are clustered under the following strategic aims<\/p><p>1. Establish a national disability function, within the framework of the Social Care Directorate, with a central directional role in funding, shaping and driving the Disability Services Programme.<\/p><p>2. Achieve optimal efficiency in the delivery of the Disability Services Programme.<\/p><p>3. Re-shape certain services and models of service delivery through a collaborative process based on a commissioning and procurement framework.<\/p><p>4. Develop a national resource allocation model, based on a standardised and appropriate assessment of need process, a methodology for associating standard costs with assessed needs and transparent protocols for determining the basis for allocating finite resources.<\/p><p>5. Develop and implement an information infrastructure to support the effective delivery of the Disability Services Programme.<\/p><p>6. Develop a strategic planning framework to support the re-configuration of the Disability Services Programme.<\/p><p>7. Drive migration towards a person-centred model of services and supports through the Service Level Arrangement (SLA) process by initiating and evaluating demonstration projects as proof of concept.<\/p><p><br \/>  A full list of key measures is published in Appendix A of the Framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000048#WRA06700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Positive Ageing Strategy Implementation","counter":88,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000049#WRAAA00150"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[13859\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000049#WRAAA00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the publication of the Positive Ageing Strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":90,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[13862\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000049#WRAAA00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he expects the Positive Ageing Strategy to be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":91,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 161 together.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government has committed to completing and implementing the National Positive Ageing Strategy so that older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live independent full lives.<\/p><p>  The Strategy will be a high level document outlining Ireland&rsquo;s vision for ageing and older people and the national goals and objectives required to promote positive ageing.

For the first time, budget allocations are related to projected spend rather than to historic budgets rolling forward from previous years. This is with a view to ensuring sustainable budgets into the future within the resources available. Heretofore, distribution of budgets across acute hospitals was made with limited reference to past organisational performance or realistic future cost reduction potential and the end result was a system in which some hospitals were significantly underfunded, leading to a position in which deficits become inevitable. We cannot afford to run our hospital system this way. <\/p><p>  The rebalancing of hospital budgets is a very necessary step on the road to financial stability in the health system as a whole in 2013 and aims to introduce a different mindset and culture into the system. Without these changes there is a real risk that the hospital sector as a whole would be in significant deficit this year.  This rebalancing of budgets is just one part of a comprehensive programme of reform in the hospital sector, as outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Future Health strategy.

I established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), as set out in the Programme for Government. The SDU is working to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  Since its establishment there has been significant improvements in the waiting times for unscheduled care against a background of reduced funding for health, reconfiguration of services and a challenging socio-economic climate.<\/p><p>  Hospitals across the country have experienced a surge in presentations to ED, as would be expected in the winter months, resulting in high demand for admissions and a consequent rise in trolley waits. Recent outbreaks of influenza have created additional logistical difficulties in relation to the admission, movement and discharge of patients in some hospitals. Those hospitals have released media messages advising non-attendance and restrictions on visiting.  The SDU continues to monitor ED activity closely, engaging with key hospitals via teleconference and on-site meetings, collaborating in putting in place a range of measures to assist with patient flow and reviewing the available data for trends in relation to the reported levels of high activity. <\/p><p>  Despite these pressures the year on year improvements continue nationally. Numbers recorded on trolleys at the end of 2012 showed a marked improvement of 23.6% less than 2011 which equates to 20,386 less people. From 1st January to 15th   March, there has been a total of 15,220 patients on trolleys: this is a reduction of 2,258 patients or 12.9% on the equivalent period last year. Priority now is to reduce long waiters (over 9 hours) as we move to a six hour patient journey target. The SDU and the Patient Safety &amp; Quality Directorate in the are currently in communication to agree a mechanism of capturing and responding in instances where a Hospital reports one or more patients breaching 24 hours on a trolley on one or more occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000049#WRAAA04300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":136,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000049#WRAAA04350"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[13850\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000049#WRAAA04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the likely impact of the cuts in numbers of staff in services for older persons, mental health and disability revealed in the recent Health Service Executive regional service plans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":138,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[13842\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000049#WRAAA04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his assessment of the impact of the cuts in numbers of staff in services for older persons, mental health and disability announced in the recent Health Service Executive regional service plans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":139,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 44 together.<\/p><p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive must prepare a service plan and submit it to the Minister for Health following publication of the Estimates.

Minister Reilly and I considered the recommendations of the Ombudsman in relation to both schemes carefully and in particular, we looked at the potential cost of implementing the recommended changes.  Any additional cost incurred by expansion of the schemes would have to be met from current expenditure and result in a reduction of front-line specialist disability, older people and mental health services for people who need them.  It is clear that an extension of either scheme would create serious financial pressure on the health budget in the current climate and would be unsustainable.  <\/p><p>  Following detailed consideration of issues involved with Cabinet colleagues, the Government decided on 26th February that it is no longer possible to allow the two schemes to continue as they presently operate and to devise an alternative solution for meeting people's needs.  A special review group, which is independently chaired, has been established to seek an alternative method to provide for the needs of people in a manner that does not run counter to the Equal Status Acts.  The initial phase of the group's work, which is led by the Department of Health, will concentrate on issues around Mobility Allowance and the Motorised Transport Grant.  Thereafter, the group will continue, under the leadership of a different Government Department, to look at opportunities for the enhancement of the transport options provided to the relevant persons in need.  As part of the initial phase of the review, the Health Service Executive will examine the circumstances of all those currently benefiting from the schemes to ensure the identified solutions will encompass their priority mobility needs.  In addition, the Minister for Health has instructed the HSE to contact each individual in receipt of the payments to notify them of this decision.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that, although the Government's decision ends both schemes to new applicants with immediate effect, the payment of mobility allowance to those currently in receipt of it, will continue for a period of four months following the decision.  It is also important to note that the decision is in no way intended to save costs and the funding involved in the two schemes (&euro;10.6 million) remains committed to meeting the priority transport needs of people with a disability.<\/p><p>  In advance of the establishment of the Project Group,  Department of Health officials met with representatives of the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association at my request.  In addition, membership of the Project Group, which is independently chaired, is drawn from both the statutory and non-statutory sectors.  The work of the Project Group is being supported by the National Disability Authority and includes representatives from the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Disability Federation of Ireland, an independent service user and advocate for people with disabilities and a retired County Council Manager with relevant experience.  Both Minister Reilly and myself have instructed the Project Group to seek solutions across the whole of Government, so that alongside representatives from the Department of Health and the HSE, membership also includes representatives from Pobal and from the Departments of Transport, Tourism &amp; Sport, Environment, Community and Local Government, Social Protection and Finance.   <\/p><p>  The Project Group has already met twice and their next meeting is scheduled for 25th March.

Reach Out our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention makes a number of recommendations in relation to fast track referrals to community-based mental health services, effective response to deliberate self harm, training, stigma reduction, etc.   Since the launch of Reach Out and the establishment of the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP), there has been a significant amount of cross-sectoral working which has resulted in considerable advances in suicide prevention.  The NOSP has implemented many of the action areas engaging a strategic approach in four key areas - delivering a general population approach to mental health promotion and suicide prevention; using targeted programmes for people at high risk of suicide; delivering services to individuals who have engaged in deliberate self harm and providing support to families and communities bereaved by suicide; and commissioning research into suicidal behaviour. <\/p><p>Earlier this year, the NOSP established an Expert Group to review the current activities in the area of suicide prevention and to determine the priorities within this area to ensure that we maximise available resources.  The Group will also review current national and international evidence on effective approaches in suicide prevention and will consider how the emerging evidence base can be used to inform the remaining period of the <i>Reach Out<\/i>   strategy and influence new policy on suicide prevention  beyond 2014.<\/p><p><br \/>  Priority suicide prevention initiatives identified for this year include:<\/p><p>- The further development of existing National Mental Health Awareness campaigns to promote help seeking<\/p><p>- Increased training for GPs and practice staff.<\/p><p>- Building the capacity of communities to respond to suicide.<\/p><p>- Implementation of the clinical care programme for self-harm.  This will include the funding of nursing posts within Hospital Emergency Departments, training of acute hospital staff on suicide and self-harm intervention and the development of the SCAN (Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse) model which allows for crisis interventions at primary care.<\/p><p>- Investment in voluntary agencies providing frontline services. <\/p><p><br \/>  The annual budget for suicide prevention increased this year to over &#8364;13m, with &#8364;8.1m available to the NOSP to fund voluntary and statutory agencies delivering services in the area of prevention, intervention, postvention and research and the remaining &#8364;5m available regionally to fund Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000049#WRAAA06200","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":160,"content":"<p>Question No. 46 answered with Question No. 37.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":161,"content":"<p>Question No. 47 answered with Question No. 38.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":162,"content":"<p>Question No. 48 answered with Question No. 37.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000049#WRAAA06550"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[13778\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000049#WRAAA06600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the standards, guidelines, protocols and procedures which are in place for the support and supervision of school going children with type 1 diabetes in their efforts to control their blood glucose levels; if he will outline measures used to ensure these are adhered to; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"998","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":165,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000049#WRAAA06700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":166,"content":"<p>Question No. 50 answered with Question No. 7.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Patient Transport Provision","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000049#WRAAA06850"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[14352\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000049#WRAAA06900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will outline the Health Service Executive policy in relation to transport from hospital to post-operative care of senior citizens following replacement hip or other serious orthopaedic surgery; and if a HSE ambulance is used, if he will outline the cost to public and private patients","asker":"1015","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":169,"content":"<p>Patient transport is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.

The scheme was introduced on the assumption that intake would be spread over a period, especially since the scheme was being introduced some months after most 2012 graduates completed their training.<\/p><p><br \/>  The initiative will give nursing and midwifery graduates an employment opportunity and facilitate their professional development.  They will be able to avail of a suite of educational programmes including intravenous canulation and training in anaphylaxis treatment. It has also been agreed that participants will be facilitated in obtaining a certificate in advanced healthcare skills to cover areas such as health assessment and pharmacology.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform approved this employment initiative on the basis that participants would not be counted in health service staff numbers and that it would contribute to savings on unsustainable levels of agency and overtime expenditure. The HSE's National Service Plan for 2013 provides for a saving of &#8364;10m in the current year, arising from the introduction of this scheme.  This level of saving will need to be achieved regardless of uptake.  Given the requirement on the HSE to reduce numbers employed and to maximise savings, there is only very limited scope to offer permanent nursing posts at present.<\/p><p><br \/>  The graduate nurse\/midwife scheme represents an opportunity for a substantial number of recently-qualified nurses and midwives to work in Ireland for a two-year period and to gain valuable experience and additional skills at a time when job opportunities in the public service are, regrettably, very limited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000051#WRC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pharmacy Services","counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000051#WRC01250"},{"type":"question","counter":220,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[13781\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000051#WRC01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the concern of people with epilepsy that generic substitution is not appropriate in the case of antiepileptic medications AEDs; if he will frame an appropriate exclusion in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, as is the case in other jurisdictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"998","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":221,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill, passed Committee Stage yesterday.

This group includes children who may require short to medium term care, children who have a disability and require long-term care and also sick children for whom there is no reasonable hope of a cure and who are expected to die.<\/p><p><br \/>  The national policy document <b>Palliative Care for Children with Life-limiting Conditions in Ireland &#8211; a National Policy <\/b>(2010) provides the foundation and sets out clear direction for the development of an integrated palliative care service for children and their families, across all care settings. Following the publication of the policy document the National Development Committee for Children&#8217;s Palliative Care (NDC) was established by the Health Service Executive. The committee is co-chaired by the HSE and the Irish Hospice Foundation. The Committee has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the national policy recommendations. The committee&#8217;s emphasis on partnership is reflected in its membership comprising statutory, voluntary, professional, and parent involvement. Lauralynn and The Jack &amp; Jill Foundation are members.<\/p><p><br \/>  In October 2012 the HSE regions were asked to indicate the total previous 12 month spend on home nursing care for children with life-limiting conditions. This amounted to &#8364;8.58m. However, it is widely acknowledged that due to financial coding issues within the system the total spend is actually significantly higher than this amount. It is also acknowledged that children with life-limiting conditions, and particularly children with palliative care needs, are prioritised within the regions and every effort is made to provide home care packages to these children and their families. <\/p><p>The HSE is aware that a more systematic\/coherent approach is needed around the provision of funding for home care packages for children.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is also concerned that proper governance arrangements are in place to ensure that the care being provided is clinically sound and that those providing the care to this cohort of children are adequately trained. To this end a working group has been established in HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster. The group has identified the total spend on home care packages for children and has implemented a standardised financial coding system. It is intended that this approach will be replicated across all four regions.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to this the National Development Committee has commenced is work on the development of standards for the provision of home and out-of-home respite care. This will be done in partnership with current voluntary providers such as the Jack and Jill Foundation and Lauralynn&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Hospice.<\/p><p><br \/>  One of the national policy recommendations was the employment of eight children&#8217;s Outreach Nurses. One of the responsibilities of these Nurses is to facilitate a co-ordinated support structure for children with life-limiting conditions and their families. The Nurse will identify the needs of each child and ensure that families are appropriately linked in to local services. Three nurses are in place (Drogheda, Limerick and Waterford); the fourth will take up her post at the end of March (Temple Street); and the remaining four nurses should be in place within 6-8 weeks (Crumlin, Mullingar, Cork and Galway).<\/p><p><br \/>  The first Consultant Paediatrician with a Special Interest in Paediatric Palliative Medicine has also been appointed to Crumlin Hospital.  The support structure for these children and their families includes health care staff across a range of disciplines. Some of these staff require additional training on working with children with life-limiting conditions. In order to address this, a national programme of continuing professional education on caring for children with life-limiting conditions has been established in Crumlin Children&#8217;s Hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000051#WRC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":232,"content":"<p>Question No. 86 answered with Question No. 7.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":233,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000051#WRC02450"},{"type":"question","counter":234,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[14271\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000051#WRC02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures that have been taken to tackle in-patient and day case waiting lists for children in Cork University Hospital; the measures that have been taken to tackle the number of patients on trolleys in Cork University Hospital; the impact of these measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"985","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[14293\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000051#WRC02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures that have been taken to tackle in-patient and day case waiting lists in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, County Louth; the measures that have been taken to tackle the number of patients on trolleys in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital; the impact of these measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1068","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":236,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 139 together.<\/p><p>  In 2011, I established the Special Delivery Unit in my Department as set out in the Programme for Government. The aim of the SDU is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system. The SDU's Scheduled Care Team focused initially on  waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.  For 2012, a target was set that no adult should wait longer than 9 months for inpatient or daycase treatment. By the end of December 2012, the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months for inpatient and day case surgery nationally had fallen to 86. This was down from 3,706 in December 2011, representing a 98% decrease.<\/p><p>  I am determined that the progress made in 2012 be maintained and improved upon. For 2013, the target is that no adult should be waiting longer than 8 months for inpatient or daycase treatment. It is important to recognise that the progress made in 2012 does not mean the problem is solved, and 2013 will of course be extremely challenging. For example, winter pressures in Emergency Departments have impacted on scheduled care waiting times. However, in the coming months, as winter pressures ease, the SDU will work towards re-balancing scheduled care  to maintain the improvements seen in 2012 and to achieve the new 2013 target.  Since its establishment of the SDU there has been significant improvements in the waiting times for unscheduled care against a background of reduced funding for health, reconfiguration of services and a challenging socio-economic climate. Hospitals across the country have experienced a surge in presentations to ED, as would be expected in the winter months, resulting in high demand for admissions and a consequent rise in trolley waits. Recent outbreaks of influenza have created additional logistical difficulties in relation to the admission, movement and discharge of patients in some hospitals. Those hospitals have released media messages advising non-attendance and restrictions on visiting.  The SDU continues to monitor ED activity closely, engaging with key hospitals via teleconference and on-site meetings, collaborating in putting in place a range of measures to assist with patient flow and reviewing the available data for trends in relation to the reported levels of high activity.<\/p><p>  Despite these pressures the year on year improvements continue nationally. Numbers recorded on trolleys at the end of 2012 showed a marked improvement of 23.6% less than 2011 which equates to 20,386 less people. From 1st January to 15th March, there has been a total of 15,220 patients on trolleys: this is a reduction of 2,258 patients or 12.9% on the equivalent period last year. Priority now is to reduce long waiters (over 9 hours) as we move to a six hour patient journey target. The SDU and the Patient Safety &amp; Quality Directorate in the are currently in communication to agree a mechanism of capturing and responding in instances where a Hospital reports one or more patients breaching 24 hours on a trolley on one or more occasion.<\/p><p>  With regard to the specific hospitals referred to, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputies  concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000051#WRC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":237,"content":"<p>Question No. 88 answered with Question No. 23.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":239,"content":"<p>Question No. 89 answered with Question No. 17.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":241,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[14259\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000052#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the actions taken to reduce the waiting times for patients awaiting a routine endoscopy procedure; the impact of these measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":242,"content":"<p>In 2011, I established the Special Delivery Unit in my Department as set out in the Programme for Government.

However, in 2013, Primary Care funding of &euro;20 million nationally will be invested to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line primary care team posts and enhance the capacity of the primary care sector.  The HSE's 2013 National Service Plan has identified approximately 250 Primary Care posts, including Public Health Nurses, Registered General Nurses, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists and Speech and Language Therapists, that will be filled using the Resource Allocation model, which is based on deprivation and need and was developed by the HSE's National Primary Care Office and Health Intelligence Unit.  Using this model, the HSE has completed a detailed analysis of the numbers and distribution of the above health care professionals.  The analysis revealed considerable variation across the 17 Integrated Service Areas in ratios of health care professionals to population, and to population numbers in areas of high deprivation.  Based on this analysis, it proposed that of the approximately 250 posts, 70 Public Health Nurses and 37 Registered General Nurses will be recruited to Primary Care Teams.  It is my firm intention, along with my colleague the Minister for Health, to have these posts filled as soon as possible in 2013.

The formation of Irish acute hospitals into a small number of groups, each with its own governance and management, will provide an optimum opportunity for hospital services to be configured to deliver high-quality safe patient care in a cost-effective manner.  It was with this in mind that I appointed Professor John Higgins in June of last year to chair a strategic board on the establishment of hospital groups.  I have received Professor Higgins's report, which is based on a comprehensive consultation process and contains almost 60 recommendations on the formation, management and governance of hospital groups, all of which are strongly endorsed by the strategic board.  I will submit this report to the Government shortly to consider it and to decide on the final formation of each hospital group.  I appreciate that this report and the related Government decision are anxiously awaited.  This is the most radical and most fundamental modernisation of our health system infrastructure since the foundation of the State.  I take very seriously my obligation to consider the report closely and assure myself and my Cabinet colleagues that it provides a robust basis to enable timely access to a high-quality and sustainable hospital service for those who need it.  The Government will decide on the initial make-up of hospital groups which will be established on an administrative basis pending the legislation required to set up hospital trusts by 2015.  Before those trusts are established, the composition and functioning of the groups will be reviewed.  If changes prove necessary, then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed.  As such, it would be inappropriate and merely speculative to comment on the prospective impact of the formation of hospital groups on individual hospitals in advance of the consideration of the Higgins report by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000053#WRE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":269,"content":"<p>Question No. 105 answered with Question No. 38.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":270,"content":"<p>Question No. 106 answered with Question No. 17.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":271,"content":"<p>Question No. 107 answered with Question No. 7.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":272,"content":"<p>Question No. 108 answered with Question No. 42.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Regional Service Plans","counter":274,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000054#WRF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":275,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[13864\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000054#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way the recently published Health Service Executive regional plans will help older persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":276,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive must prepare a service plan and submit it to the Minister for Health following publication of the Estimates.

For the first time, budget allocations are related to projected spend rather than to historic budgets rolling forward from previous years. This is with a view to ensuring sustainable budgets into the future within the resources available. Heretofore, distribution of budgets across acute hospitals was made with limited reference to past organisational performance or realistic future cost reduction potential and the end result was a system in which some hospitals were significantly underfunded, leading to a position in which deficits become inevitable.

This rebalancing of budgets is just one part of a comprehensive programme of reform in the hospital sector, as outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Future Health strategy.

In addition, the draft agreement provides for an increase in working hours for most staff and this will deliver a long-term, sustainable and unprecedented increase in productivity.

For 2012, a target was set that no adult should wait longer than 9 months for inpatient or daycase treatment.  By the end of December 2012, the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months for inpatient and day case surgery nationally had fallen to 86.

It outlines the need for smaller hospitals, such as Navan, and larger hospitals to operate together.  The Framework outlines the wide range of services that can be provided within the smaller hospital.  It defines the need for the smaller hospital to be supported within a group of hospitals in terms of education and training, continuous professional development, the sustainable recruitment of high quality clinical staff and the safe management of patients who present with varying levels of complexity.

I have been further informed that there are currently no planned changes to any service in OLHN other than planned seasonal closures which are scheduled every year to coincide with holiday periods, such as Easter, Summer Term break and Christmas.  In terms of service improvements \/ gains, a second Consultant Rheumatologist has now been appointed to OLHN to further extend the Regional Rheumatology service and provide early and rapid access for patients requiring this service.

This will ensure that the principles outlined in the service plan of maintaining services and capacity can be confidently managed.  The Director General Designate of the HSE has informed me that he put alternative governance arrangements in place for LMHG on 1 December 2012.  The LMHG management team no longer report via the Integrated Service Area or Regional Director of Operations but through an Executive Chair.  The Executive Chair has a direct reporting relationship with the Deputy Director General\/Chief Operating Officer.

It can do so by strengthening the infrastructure, capability and capacity that will enable, inter alia, the identification, development, validation and potentially the adoption of enterprise outputs within the health system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000057#WRJ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000057#WRJ01600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":381,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000057#WRJ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":382,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[14148\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000057#WRJ01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on recent reports in the United States that one of the proposed conditions for the new Immigration Reform Bill will provide for the offer of legal status to undocumented immigrants for those who have registered with the Homeland Security Department; his views that such probationary legal status would enable immigrants to work legally but would be ineligible for social services; if there is any indication of the likely time frame for such persons to obtain permanent resident status or citizenship; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[14150\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000057#WRJ01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the time frame for the presentation of the proposed bipartisan Immigration Reform Bill to the United States Congress; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":384,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[13913\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000057#WRJ01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he discussed the plight of the undocumented Irish in the US with President Obama and senior American politicians during his visit to Washington; if any progress was made; the outcome of these discussions; the persons that attended these meetings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":385,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 171, 172 and 179 together.<\/p><p>  The welfare of the Irish abroad in general and especially the position of undocumented Irish immigrants in the United States remains an important priority for the Government.  A resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish immigrants will continue to be pursued by the Government in our ongoing contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  During our visit to Washington this week, the Taoiseach and I discussed the latest prospects for progress with President Obama, Senators McCain, Leahy and Schumer.  The matter also featured prominently during my meeting with Secretary of State Kerry and with Senator Isakson.<\/p><p>  The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which a resolution for our undocumented can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform would appear to have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election.  The emphasis he placed on immigration reform in his inauguration address as well as his subsequent speech on the issue on 29 January and his State of the Union address on 12 February sent a very positive signal in this regard.  The indications of emerging bipartisan support for reform in Congress is also encouraging.<\/p><p>  Through our Embassy in Washington and in close liaison with Irish-American community representatives, our contacts with the US Administration and Congress continue with a view to ensuring that the interests and concerns of undocumented Irish immigrants are captured in any future legislative deal in this area that emerges.  In addition to the meetings in the US this week,  I raised the issue with then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during our bilateral meeting on 6 December last and recalled our strong support for comprehensive immigration legislation and the passage of E3 visas for Irish citizens.   I spoke with Senator John McCain on 8 February last to express the Government&rsquo;s appreciation for the efforts he and others are making in developing bipartisan Senate proposals and to underline our ongoing interest in the issue.  I also spoke with Senator Patrick Leahy on 25 February and met with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand during her recent visit to Dublin on 8 March.<\/p><p>  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system as to what any future legislative deal might comprise.  It is therefore not possible at this stage to identify an exact timescale in which these may become clear but the area will continue to receive the Government&rsquo;s close attention over the period ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000057#WRJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000057#WRJ01950"},{"type":"question","counter":387,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[14217\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000057#WRJ02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will engage further with the authorities in Burma on the abuse of human rights of the Rohingya people who are deprived of basic civil entitlements like the right to education, land ownership and so on, now facing the triple threat of disease, starvation and violence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":388,"content":"<p>The Government continues to closely monitor reports of human rights abuses of the Rohingya people in Burma\/Myanmar and is concerned about the situation.

Drawing our attention to the increasingly destructive war of attrition between the Syrian army and the opposition forces, he reaffirmed his view that only a political solution can bring about an end to the harrowing violence in Syria.  He also appealed to the EU to continue using its leverage with other countries of influence to advance the prospects for a political settlement.  Observing that the continuous flow of arms into Syria is part of the problem, Mr Brahimi endorsed the view of UN Secretary General Ban that supplying arms and ammunition will only exacerbate an already destructive conflict, leading to more casualties and greater destabilisation of the wider region.<\/p><p>  When High Representative Ashton received the Chief of Staff of the Syrian Supreme Military Council, General Idriss, earlier this month in Brussels, she made clear to him that EU support for the people of Syria, other than the already substantial contribution being made to UN-led humanitarian efforts, could not go beyond the provision of non-lethal equipment and technical assistance intended for the protection of civilians.  Along with most EU member States, Ireland is of the view that lifting the current EU embargo on the supply of arms and military equipment would contribute to further militarisation of the conflict and to greater proliferation of arms in Syria and in neighbouring countries.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) estimates that almost 70,000 people have been killed as a result of the conflict and over 3 million have been displaced from their homes.  Over 1.1 million Syrian refugees have fled to neighbouring countries.<\/p><p>  We are very aware of the challenges involved in reaching those most in need in Syria, and I have consistently raised our concerns about humanitarian access at the EU Foreign Affairs Council.  The constraints are many. Excessive controls on aid agencies working in the country, the fragmentation of the armed opposition and the intensity of military confrontations have made the operating environment extremely volatile and insecure, particularly in opposition-controlled areas.  Restrictions imposed by the Assad regime, combined with logistical constraints and increasing insecurity, make it very difficult to access populations in need of humanitarian assistance.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied that our key partners on the ground are succeeding in reaching vulnerable populations.  Since last October, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) has been delivering assistance to 1.5 million people each month.  Almost half of this aid has been delivered in disputed or opposition-controlled areas.  Other partners such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), working with the Syria Arab Red Crescent (SARC), have been reaching areas inaccessible to the UN.  We believe it is essential, however, that the international community increase the scale and scope of humanitarian assistance in order to meet the increasing level of needs across the country.<\/p><p>  In January, negotiations between the UN and the Government of Syria resulted in agreement to allow for the delivery of humanitarian assistance across conflict lines.  The UN also negotiated authorisation from the Government of Syria to establish an international field presence.  The UN base in Homs has had an immediate impact in increasing the delivery of aid.  Additional implementing partners, approved by the Government of Syria and vetted by the UN, have been contracted to expand the reach of humanitarian assistance across the country.  The ICRC and SARC have succeeded through negotiation in delivering much-needed food and essential household items to a number of opposition-held areas, most recently Al-Houleh in Homs province.<\/p><p>  The meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council which I attended in Brussels on 18 February, explicitly reaffirmed the leading role of the UN in providing assistance to Syria and to neighbouring countries which are hosting the large number of refugees from the conflict.  The Council also committed the EU to taking steps towards providing humanitarian assistance to all areas in the country, including those currently not reached by humanitarian aid.  At the most recent meeting of the Council, on 11 March, we held further discussions on the deteriorating humanitarian situation with the Special Envoy of the UN and the Arab League, Lakhdar Brahimi.<\/p><p>  The UN and other humanitarian partners aim to reach 2.5 million people across all areas of Syria over coming months.  Such an increase in humanitarian assistance will depend on the support of the Government of Syria and the Opposition to facilitate safe access to vulnerable populations.  The availability of funds is also critical. It is estimated that over &euro;1.1 billion will be needed for the response in Syria until the end of June.  Ireland has responded swiftly and generously to the humanitarian crisis in Syria and to date has provided over &euro;7 million in humanitarian assistance through long-standing and reputable partners such as WFP, UNICEF, UNHCR, ICRC, and international Non-Governmental Organisations.  We work through partners which have a demonstrated track record of effective humanitarian response in Syria, with strong targeting, delivery and accountability mechanisms to provide live-saving assistance to the people most in need.  We are continuing to monitor the situation to review the effectiveness of our contribution and asses how we can respond further to humanitarian needs in Syria and the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000057#WRJ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":400,"content":"<p>Question No. 179 answered with Question No. 171.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":401,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000057#WRJ03050"},{"type":"question","counter":402,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[13916\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000057#WRJ03100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding diplomatic relations with the Holy See; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":403,"content":"<p>As I have stated consistently, the decision to close the resident Embassy to the Holy See will not be reversed in the immediate term.

There are quarterly reviews of programme implementation, and we have met all our target for these review to date.  Our programme is therefore well performing and we are now well on our way to exit it. <\/p><p>  We have used these quarterly reviews to renegotiate various aspects of the programme.  By way of example, we reversed the reduction in the minimum wage, and also agreed a more progressive use of the proceeds from the sale of state assets. <\/p><p>  A series of measures have already been put in place since early 2011 which serve to significantly reduce the cost and negative impact of Ireland&rsquo;s EU\/IMF programme.  As I noted in my reply to your Parliamentary Question No. 94 of 15 November 2012, the interest rates on EU funding mechanisms (the EFSF and EFSM) were reduced significantly in 2011 and are now provided at rates close to the cost of funding.  These rates apply equally to all countries availing of these mechanisms.  The maturities of these loans were extended at the same time. <\/p><p>  Lengthening of maturities provides benefits in terms of phasing of loans and ensuring that the profile of redemptions is more orderly &ndash; avoiding as far as possible exceptionally large amounts in particular years.  By contrast, money borrowed at longer maturities is generally more expensive.  However, on balance, savings arising from maturity extension are significant though complex to calculate.<\/p><p>  The interest rate reductions for the EFSF and the EFSM have also been reflected in the rates charged on Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark.  It is estimated that the interest rate reductions on the EU funding mechanisms and the bilateral loans are worth of the order of &euro;9 billion over the initially envisaged 7 &frac12; year term of these loans. <\/p><p>  The positive impact of these changes has been significant as demonstrated by the fact that the average interest rate charged on our programme borrowing at the outset of the programme in 2010 was 5.82 per cent, whereas by end-December 2012, the NTMA has estimated that the all-in fixed euro equivalent cost of loans received under the EU\/IMF programme was 3.36 per cent.<\/p><p>  As noted above, our EU programme funding is being provided at, or close to, the cost of funds for the lenders.  The scope for further changes to our programme interest payments is therefore very limited.  <\/p><p>  On 29th June 2012 the Euro Area Heads of State or Government (HoSG) agreed that &ldquo;&hellip; it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns&rdquo;.  The same statement also made explicit reference Ireland, noting the need to further improve &ldquo;the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme&rdquo;.  This commitment was reaffirmed by the European Council in December, which also mandated the completion of the operational framework for the ESM direct banking recapitalisation facility in the first semester of 2013.  Work is continuing at technical, senior official and Ministerial levels to complete work on the European Stability Mechanism&rsquo;s direct banking recapitalisation facility by June of this year in accordance with the mandate of the European Council.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position is that it is essential that the measures introduced for direct banking recapitalisation achieve the object of breaking the link between the sovereign and the banks &ndash; as agreed by the HoSG on 29th June last year and confirmed last December.<\/p><p>  In February this year the Government announced a solution to the Promissory Notes in IBRC (formerly Anglo Irish Bank &amp; Irish Nationwide).  The Promissory Notes were replaced with a series of long term, low interest Government bonds (average length of 34 years) and the liquidation of IBRC.  This generated real and tangible economic and financial benefits to the State, and will improve the long term viability of the Irish financial system and assist our return to the international financial markets.<\/p><p>  As a result of this solution, &euro;3.1 billion will not be paid this month and the arrangement also covers the repayment of &euro;3.1 billion that was due to Bank of Ireland following last year&rsquo;s arrangement.  It will deliver a cash-flow benefit of &euro;20 billion over the next 10 years, as well as reducing the deficit by &euro;1 billion per annum over the coming years.  It also generates significant efficiency benefits from moving assets to NAMA.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Government announced the ending of the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme for new liabilities after the 28th of March 2013.  This marks an additional significant step in the normalization of our banking system and reduces substantially the associated contingent liability of the State.<\/p><p>  EU Finance Ministers at Eurogroup and ECOFIN on 4\/5 March 2012 discussed an adjustment of the maturities on the EFSF and EFSM loans to Ireland and Portugal in order to smooth the debt redemption profiles of both countries.  They agreed to ask the troika to come forward with a proposal for their best possible option for both Ireland and Portugal for EFSF and EFSM loans.  In addition, on Saturday last, 13 March, Eurogroup Finance Ministers agreed to an adjustment of the maturities of Ireland&rsquo;s (and Portugal&rsquo;s) EFSF loans. <\/p><p>  Work is continuing at official level on the adjustment of the maturities for Ireland and Portugal.  In the case of the EFSM loans, this will require discussion and agreement of the EU 27 Finance Ministers, and I expect this matter will be discussed at the April meeting of EU Finance Ministers in Dublin. <\/p><p>  The success of our overall approach to date is illustrated by the NTMA&rsquo;s highly successful sale of &euro;5 billion in ten year bonds last week.  We are now in the final year of our programme of support, and the Government will continue to seek improvements in our programme conditions appropriate to ensure we exit durably and successfully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000058#WRK02000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":432,"content":"<p>Question No. 191 answered with Question No. 187.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Availability","counter":433,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000058#WRK02150"},{"type":"question","counter":434,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[14251\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000058#WRK02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he has received communication from the banking sector with a view to ensuring that small and medium sized enterprises have ready access to working capital as required; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":435,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[14252\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000058#WRK02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will ensure the availability of adequate credit facilities following his discussions with the hotel and tourism sectors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[14253\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000058#WRK02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if any particular attention has been paid to the vacuum left in the lending sector in the wake of the withdrawal of a number of banks from this economy with particular reference to any such lending institutions still operating in this jurisdiction but controlled from outside the island of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":437,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 to 194, inclusive, together.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government recognises that SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy and will play a vital role in the recovery of employment growth in our country.

The recovery is forecast to gain ground in 2013.  Over the medium term, a return to robust and more sustainable growth is foreseen.  While exports are expected to continue supporting economic activity, a gradual pick-up in domestic demand is also projected as the recovery broadens further and spills over to the labour market.

Households, firms and the government sector are still working through the imbalances built up during the boom.  However, there have been some positive developments in recent months as core retail sales have stabilised and have now been in positive territory in year-on-year terms in each of the last six months.<\/p><p><br \/>  The unemployment rate at 14.1 per cent in February is showing signs of stabilisation, albeit at an unacceptably high level, with long-term unemployment now a prominent feature of the labour market.  This high unemployment rate is the unfortunate legacy of the crisis in Ireland, and underlines the importance of the <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2013<\/i> launched last month by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department&#8217;s latest economic forecasts were set out in December 2012 as part of the Budget.  For this year, real GDP growth of 1.5 per cent is projected.  While exports are expected to remain the key driver of the recovery, a gradual pick-up in domestic demand is projected over the medium term, as the recovery broadens out and spills over to the labour market in a more sustained way from the second half of 2013 onwards.  Growth is expected to accelerate to 2&frac12; per cent in 2014 and close to 3 per cent in 2015.  My Department will issue revised forecasts in the Stability Programme Update, which will be published next month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000058#WRK02900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":444,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000058#WRK02950"},{"type":"question","counter":445,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[14256\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000058#WRK03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which his Department continues to be kept up to date in respect of the level of default by insurance companies with particular reference to mortgage or other debt protection; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":446,"content":"<p>My Department does not keep up to date information on the level of default by insurance companies with particular reference to mortgage or other debt protection.

As I have previously stated, the Revenue Commissioners will not be involved in valuing individual properties.  LPT is a self-assessed tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the chargeable value of the property.  As values for properties under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands for the purposes of LPT, property owners will not be required to provide a precise value for their property.  <\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners have prepared valuation guidance which, taken together with the owner&rsquo;s own knowledge of the property, will assist him or her in assessing its value.  The guidance, which is now available on the Revenue website, includes an on-line guide that provides indicative property valuation bands depending on the property type, age and location.  If a property has certain unique features, is smaller or larger than the average for the area, is in a significantly poor state of repair or has exceptional features, property owners will have to factor this into their assessment of the valuation of their property.  Where property owners consider that the on-line valuation guide is not indicating a reasonable valuation for their property, they should make their own assessment of its value.  As I have previously advised the House, where the Revenue guidance is used in an honest manner, the valuation made by a property owner will not be challenged by the Commissioners in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter.  <\/p><p>  I am further advised that additional sources that a property owner would find useful to help them with their property value assessment include the property prices register, the property section of local newspapers, information from local estate agents and property websites.  <\/p><p>  It is a matter for the property owner to decide whether they should have their property professionally valued.

As a new service that will have exceptional temporary pressures at particular stages of its initial implementation it proved difficult to predict the level of contact that would arise during its introduction and, consequently, the resource required to meet customer service demands.    Revenue considered a number of options for the provision of a phone call service and estimated the cost of providing the service needed to meet the anticipated demands taking account of a number of resource options.  These included the use of existing Revenue resources only; the recruitment of Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) for their 1890 service; the outsourcing of the entire service and a mix of existing staff, TCOs and external resources.  Revenue chose the final option outlined, a mix of external and internal resources. <\/p><p><br \/>  The service was initiated on 7 March, the contact number is 1890 200 255 and it operates on the basis that calls are handled by the service provider in the first instance.  Complex matters that cannot be handled by the service provider are escalated to a team of Revenue staff.  The call management and reporting systems are monitored by Revenue and also the actual delivery of the service.  The number of staff allocated to the call centre service, both in Revenue and externally will vary in response to the levels of demand, but for the Deputy&#8217;s information, current indicative numbers are 40 external staff with up to 27 Revenue staff available as required.<\/p><p><br \/>  The outsourcing of peak call handling in respect of the LPT will ensure that skilled Revenue staff can continue to provide the necessary customer service to meet their long term, on-going demands and commitments in relation to the strategic priority of maintaining and improving levels of tax and duty compliance.  It meets the specific and unusual need which has arisen in the context of the roll out of the new tax.  It might also be noted that, following a full hearing, the Civil Service Arbitration Board determined that the proposal to outsource this service is entirely consistent with provisions of the national agreements on the provision of outsourced services, including specific provisions in <i>Towards 2016<\/i>   and the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014.<\/p><p><br \/>  The &#8364;4.9 million figure quoted by the Deputy does not represent the estimate of the cost of the outsourced call centre service.  This figure was Revenue&#8217;s estimate of the total cost of providing a service using internal and external resources.  The nature of the contract is that the cost will depend on the volume of calls handled, but I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is expected to be very much lower than the figure quoted by the Deputy.  I am further informed that in accordance with the relevant Government  decision,  the Revenue Commissioners publish quarterly lists of payments over &#8364;20,000 and payments made under this contract will be included in future lists.<\/p><p><br \/>  The proposal to address the simpler LPT queries through the outsourcing of limited call services offers a flexible, scalable response to an unpredictable demand.  It will also provide assurance that the introduction of LPT will not damage Revenue&#8217;s overall capacity to deliver for the Exchequer and for the Irish people, an important consideration at any time and vital in the current economic circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRM01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Remuneration","counter":521,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRM01750"},{"type":"question","counter":522,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[14017\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRM01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps he will take to ensure that the pay cuts in line with the Croke Park 2 agreement for the public service are extended to the bailed-out banks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":523,"content":"<p>When publishing the Review of Remuneration Practices and Frameworks at the Covered Institutions, on 12 March 2013, I indicated that the Government had formed the view that with the remaining covered institutions still incurring losses it was an inescapable conclusion that the cost base of the institutions needs to be reduced further.

Therefore, in assessing the market value of a residential property it would be inappropriate that account be taken of whether the property was purchased by its current owner at a discount to market value, whether from a local authority or any other previous owner.  The Local Property Tax (LPT) is a self-assessed tax, therefore it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the chargeable value of the property.     Certain Government backed schemes have been and continue to be available, aimed at helping lower-income households buy their own homes by allowing properties to be purchased at prices significantly less than their market value.  I am advised by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that under the Affordable Housing Scheme, launched in March 1999, local authorities provide additional housing on land, which they own, to low-income purchasers at cost price.  A mortgage subsidy is payable to qualifying households based on income bands.   The Shared Ownership Scheme facilitates access to home ownership in two or more stages for those who cannot afford home ownership immediately.  In the case of qualifying households a subsidy towards the rent payments for that portion of the equity not yet purchased, based on income bands, is payable by the local authority, and recouped by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.

The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that a liability for LPT will arise where a person owns a residential property on the liability date which will be 1 May 2013 for the year 2013 and for subsequent years 1 November in the preceding year.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The Act provides that local authorities will be liable to pay LPT on their properties in the same way as any other residential property owner, unless the properties are used to accommodate people who have special housing needs.  Special housing needs refers to the provision of housing and support for people who have a particular need in addition to a general housing need to enable them to live in the community.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are currently drawing up guidelines that will facilitate social housing providers, including local authorities, in identifying which of their properties are used to provide special needs housing and are, therefore, exempted from the charge to LPT.  In keeping with the Department of Finance&#8217;s mission to play a central role in the achievement of the Government&#8217;s economic and social goals, as set out in my Department&#8217;s <i>Annual Review of 2012<\/i>  , officials of my department, along with the Revenue Commissioners, are actively engaging with social housing providers, including, for example, Focus Ireland, in this regard.  <\/p><p><br \/>  It is not possible to give a definitive view on whether local authority emergency or transitional housing will be exempt from LPT without further information on the nature of the housing and any supports provided. <\/p><p><br \/>  As already stated, one of the criteria for liability to LPT is that a building is suitable for use as a dwelling.  The fact that a building is unoccupied will not of itself mean the building is exempt from LPT.  It will be a question of fact in each case whether a particular building awaiting demolition or regeneration is suitable for use as a dwelling.  It is not possible to provide a general reply that will address each case; for example, a perfectly habitable property may be awaiting demolition simply because a local authority intends to re-develop an area. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that where local authority owned properties are not exempt from LPT, the market value of any such property will be deemed to fall into the lowest valuation band of &#8364;0 to &#8364;100,000 up to and including 2016.  This will result in an LPT charge of &#8364;45 per property for 2013 and &#8364;90 per year for 2014 to 2016.

The scheme, which will be introduced by Ministerial order, is entitled the Living City Initiative and will apply, in the first instance, on a pilot basis, to specified regeneration areas in Waterford and Limerick.  My Department have prepared an information note on this Initiative which was published on the Department&rsquo;s website on 13 February last. <\/p><p>  The historic centres of some of our cities have suffered for a long time from gradual depopulation and the relocation of family homes and businesses out to the suburbs, particularly during the period of the &ldquo;Celtic Tiger&rdquo;. These centres have also suffered greatly from the general economic downturn of the past few years and while I am not suggesting that this scheme is capable, on its own, of reversing that trend, I am convinced it has a part to play especially with regard to helping to rebuild confidence in those areas. The particular focus of the scheme is as follows:<\/p><p>- to encourage people back to the centres of Irish cities to live in historic buildings, in particular Georgian houses, and<\/p><p>- to encourage the regeneration of the retail heartland of central city business districts.<\/p><p>  I indicated in my Budget speech in December last year that I would examine proposals for a targeted incentive for already identified regeneration areas. The tax relief which will apply under this scheme will operate for 5 years from the date of commencement. However, it is my intention that before it begins, the scheme will be the subject to an ex-ante cost benefit analysis. Subject to a positive outcome from that analysis, I will seek EU approval under State Aid rules for this initiative to be commenced for Limerick and Waterford cities. I have not yet decided on the exact boundaries of the regeneration areas in these cities but I will be consulting with my Government colleagues and the relevant local authorities before I make any final decision.<\/p><p>  There are 2 strands to the scheme.  The first involves a tax relief for the refurbishment or conversion of Georgian houses for residential purposes. The relief will only apply to owner\/occupiers and not for rented residential accommodation. The relief will be spread over 10 years at the rate of 10% of the expenditure per annum, provided the property is occupied as the principal private residence of the individual during that time. No relief can be transferred to any subsequent purchaser. It will be necessary for the individual to have received confirmation from the relevant local authority that the property conforms to planning permission (if required), appropriate building regulations and floor area limits and that the cost of the works seem reasonable, before the relief can be claimed. <\/p><p>  The second strand is a scheme of accelerated industrial buildings allowances for the conversion and refurbishment of retail premises, although other business services will also be allowed where the premises is a Georgian building. In such cases, the commercial element will be confined to the ground floor or basement with the residential element upstairs. The allowance is at the rate of 15% per annum for 6 years with 10% in year 7 and is subject to the normal balancing charges or allowances if disposed of within that time period.  The standard restrictions on the sideways setting of unused capital allowances against other income will apply and there will be no exemption from the current treatment of the termination of the carry-forward of certain unused capital allowances for passive investors. Furthermore, the high earners restriction, which applies across the full range of reliefs such as this, also applies to this relief. <\/p><p>  I am hopeful that these reliefs will help restore some of these inner city areas to their former glory. The prevalence of Georgian houses is a peculiar characteristic of the built-environment of many Irish cities and while some of these Georgian buildings have fallen into a state of disrepair and dereliction, my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and myself have been exploring ways in which to promote and support the regeneration of these city centres. If EU State Aid approval is received, I will then consider extending the scope of the Initiative to other clearly defined areas within cities, but I do not believe that it would be prudent to go beyond the areas which are already identified at this stage.<\/p><p>  The reliefs which I am introducing are an attempt to encourage people back into these cities, to rear their families and if possible, to operate their business from there. It will not be possible to revitalise these inner city areas without this happening. Pobal, the state agency that supports local communities has developed a sophisticated index which measures deprivation in different local areas across Ireland. Taking into account the deprivation statistics from the 2011 Census, both Limerick and Waterford score as the most disadvantaged of our major cities. Furthermore, unemployment rates in these cities are also the highest, significantly worse than the national average.

The final staffing position for all schools will not be known until later in the year when the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeal Board will have been considered.<\/p><p>  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools is being gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.  During this period the pupil threshold for a 2-classroom school is being increased to 20 pupils. In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.  The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  If amalgamations do take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.<\/p><p>  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities and my Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small schools that are affected by the budget measure.  In this regard small schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting sustainable increased enrolments in September 2013 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.<\/p><p>  The detailed arrangements in relation to the appeals process are set in the Department's Staffing Circular 0013\/2013.

Work-life balance arrangements in the public service will continue to be among the best available options provided by Irish employers, particularly when considered in tandem with annual leave and other provisions.  These arrangements underpin important social policy goals, in particular supporting the ongoing participation of parents and carers in the workplace.  The Irish public service has a proud record of promoting these arrangements and the employee profile across the service reflects the strong efforts made over the last few decades to ensure that public servants&#8217; employment terms allow them to balance their work and home commitments.  A range of flexible working arrangements will continue to be available across the public service where they currently exist, including, flexitime, work sharing arrangements, the shorter working year scheme, career breaks, as well as all of the statutory entitlements such as parental leave and carer&#8217;s leave.  The LRC is proposing that two of these arrangements, namely flexi-time and work sharing, be amended as sustainable reform measures that will underpin the delivery of a more integrated, efficient and effective public service.<\/p><p><b>  Flexi-time: <\/b>Public service organisations that currently have flexitime in place will continue to have flexi-time.  It will be available for existing staff and new entrants up to the grade of Higher Executive Officer and equivalent.  Everyone on flexi-time will continue, within certain limits, to be able to vary their arrival times, departure times and lunch breaks.  A change is proposed in the amount of flexi-leave that can be taken in a flexi period (4 weeks) - this will now be one day.  This still allows somebody on flexitime to avail of an additional 13 days flexi-leave per year in addition to their annual leave entitlement and any other flexible working arrangement that they may have.  Management grades at Assistant Principal and equivalent, who currently have access to flexi-time will continue to have access to these arrangements but will not have access to flexi-leave.<\/p><p><b>  Work Sharing: <\/b>It is important to clarify that a worksharer is an employee who was recruited to a full time position and has opted to reduce their hours to an agreed work sharing pattern.  Work sharing will still be available within the public service.  The proposals include a provision that will require everyone, with notable exceptions, to work a pattern of at least 50% of the full time hours.  It is important to note that only in the region of 2% of those currently work sharing in the Civil Service have a pattern of less than 50%.  In recognition of the valuable contribution made by carers to society, those in receipt of Carer&#8217;s Allowance will not be required to increase their hours above the 15 hour a week limit for payment of their allowance.  In support of our commitment to achieving the public service target of a 3% employment rate for people with disabilities, those with disabilities who have reached a reasonable accommodation with their employer to work less than 50% of full time hours will continue to be able to avail of these arrangements for as long as they are required.  It is necessary to revise flexi-time and work sharing arrangements to better reflect the current needs of public service organisations, in the context of falling numbers and changing demands for public services.  The operation of these arrangements must support the business of the organisation and the provision of services to the public.  The proposed changes are an attempt to balance the requirements of the business while enabling staff to balance work and personal life requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRP01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":674,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRP01450"},{"type":"question","counter":675,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[14207\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will instruct the Chief State Solicitor's Office to reply to a person (details supplied) regarding a property dispute as promised by his Department in a letter","asker":"954","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":676,"content":"<p>I have brought the Deputy's question to the attention of the Chief State Solicitor's Office which informs me that it has now issued an interim letter and will be following up with a full response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRP01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flexible Work Practices","counter":677,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRP01650"},{"type":"question","counter":678,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[13674\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRP01700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to continue the incentivised career break for civil servants as introduced in the supplementary Budget in 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":679,"content":"<p>There are currently no plans to reintroduce an incentivised career break scheme for civil servants.

A Commercial Delivery Manager was also appointed to drive this issue.  As part of this approach, the Government has decided that all proposed new services across the Public Service will be tested for external service delivery before any approval to provide the service internally will be granted.

To this end, my Department has produced and distributed a Preliminary Business Case Template to all Departments and Sectors.

My Department takes its responsibilities in this regard very seriously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRQ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":719,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 292 and 293 answered with Question No. 290.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":721,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRQ01100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Assist Scheme Appeals","counter":720,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRQ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":721,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[13945\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRQ01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a farm assist appeal application in respect of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":722,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 15th March 2013, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRQ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":723,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 295 to 298, inclusive, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Applications","counter":724,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRQ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":725,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[14154\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRQ01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if and when jobseeker's benefit will be reinstated in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare who is currently on Stamp 4 on foot of a pending work permit application; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":726,"content":"<p>The person concerned should present himself to the Social Welfare Local Office, Eyre Street, Newbridge with his current GNIB card to re-apply for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRQ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Appeals","counter":727,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRQ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":728,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[14174\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRQ01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 5","asker":"1017","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":729,"content":"<p>The person concerned incurred a disability allowance overpayment of &euro;42,673.80 over the period 2 January 2002 to 3 September 2007.

The Unit also works jointly with Revenue staff in Joint Investigation Units and other inter-agency work is undertaken with NERA, Customs and the Garda&iacute;.  <b>  <\/b><\/p><p>In addition, it is worth noting that:<\/p><p>- Activation and Control Teams operate at local level.

An Inspector&rsquo;s report is then used to inform the Deciding Officer, who is also appointed under the Social Welfare Acts to make decisions on claims based on all the facts and evidence available.

The population share of those aged 65 and over is expected to more than double between now and 2051, from 11% to approximately 23% in 2050.  In contrast, the working age to pensioner ratio is projected to decline gradually from 5.3 \/1 to 2.1\/1.  <\/p><p>  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.

The full series is available on my Department&#8217;s website.<\/p><p><br \/>  The nature of thatch is such that it requires regular maintenance and more frequent renewal in comparison with other types of roofing. However, some of the costs involved in maintaining thatched properties can be attributed to the use of an incorrect material, issues with the style of thatching and material used, and severe weather conditions. There are some funding streams which, subject to the availability of resources, may assist owners of thatched houses in repairing or maintaining their thatched roofs, including <\/p><p>- my Department&#8217;s <i>Structures at Risk<\/i>   Fund, <\/p><p>- the Traditional Farm Buildings Grant Scheme, which is managed by the Heritage Council Heritage for REPS 4 participants, and <\/p><p>- a grant scheme for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs administered by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRS01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cultural Policy","counter":811,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRS01050"},{"type":"question","counter":812,"qnumday":331,"qnumall":"[14124\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRS01100","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"his views on a submission (details supplied)","asker":"997","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":813,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that the bulk of the material in the submission referred to in his Question is not relevant to my area of responsibility and I will not be referring to those matters in my reply.<\/p><p><br \/>  In relations to the arts, which does come within my area of responsibility, there is a range of ways in which my Department and relevant bodies within its remit are seeking to support arts, cultural and heritage initiatives, in conjunction with local groups and communities.

The annual survey data was gathered using international best practice methodology as part of ongoing Corncrake conservation work. This species spends a large proportion of its time concealed in vegetation and sightings are rare. The primary method of estimating its abundance and distribution relies on analysis of the audible records of this vocal species. It is only the male that regularly calls or sings and there is usually no direct recording of the female or young in an area. Scientific studies have shown that the nest of a female Corncrake and her brood rearing area is usually within 250 meters of the singing place of the male with which she paired. Individual male Corncrake can call from several locations over the course of a breeding season and may pair with more than one female.<\/p><p>Over 35 individual Irish grid reference records estimating the singing locations of male Corncrake are outlined below. These estimates are of calling male Corncrakes that were recorded in or, due to their proximity, were considered to be associated with, the Falcarragh to Meenlaragh SPA over the course of the last six breeding seasons.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>X<\/div><\/th><th><div>Y<\/div><\/th><th><div>Year<\/div><\/th><th><div>Individual bird

ComReg concluded a spectrum allocation process in late 2012, which will enable the successful applicants to operate 4G mobile services across the country. 4G is the fourth generation and most modern of mobile phone technologies currently available.  It is a matter for the individual mobile telephone operators to decide those parts of the country they will prioritise and those areas they will ultimately serve in accordance with the license conditions.<\/p><p>  The provision of broadband services   is also undertaken within a fully liberalised market.

These comparisons do not measure whether the speeds quoted are available in all areas of any country.   The high speeds offered in parts of County Kildare by at least one cable operator, in the areas it serves and has upgraded, compare favourably with high broadband speeds marketed internationally.  Unfortunately there are no statistics available which would allow a national or international comparison of the different speeds available throughout any one county.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>  Specifically, it commits to 70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; at least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population, and  a minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.<\/p><p>  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.

This follows a number of measures introduced since I came into office including significant cuts to practitioners' fees during 2011.<\/p><p>  Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his\/her means are insufficient to enable him\/her to pay for legal aid him\/herself.  The Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.   An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that an accused person who faces serious charges is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence and if he\/she cannot afford to pay for legal representation there is a right to legal aid.  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend him\/herself in person or through legal assistance of his\/her own choosing or, if he\/she has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  My overriding concern must be to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.<\/p><p>  A new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is being drafted to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions will have regard to a person's rights to the presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to be given legal aid, where appropriate.

Ireland has been a member of the European Defence Agency since 2004.   The most pertinent issue facing our troops serving on Peace Support and crisis management operations overseas is Force Protection, and one of the main factors considered when undertaking any operation is protection from threats such as snipers, booby traps and improvised explosive devices.<\/p><p>  We all know the toll caused by Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and homemade explosives; we know how easy it can be for terrorists to wreak death, havoc and destruction in our countries and communities.  We also know there is a need for cooperation and collaboration to counter that threat.  <\/p><p>  Recent operations have shown that those engaged in hostile terrorist actions are likely to use (IEDs) because the materials to assemble them are easy to come by, they are relatively simple to construct, they are difficult to combat and, as we have found to our cost, they are devastatingly effective.  Indeed, criminals engaged in organised crime are also using IEDs and Pipe Bombs  in dealing with their adversaries. This is a very worrying development for civil society, which brings the threat of IEDs and their carnage ever more on to our streets and into our communities. <\/p><p>  The aim of the Resilient Threat Management Conference was to create a common understanding and appreciation of the challenges posed by IEDs past and present; to establish a vision for how the IED threat will be managed in the future; to generate the will to address these challenges comprehensively by bringing together international actors from the civil and military domain; to spread awareness on future capability requirements and technological opportunities and to increase networking within the community.  Therefore, the participation of Irish Defence Forces personnel at the Resilient Threat Management Conference, as experts in this area, is to be welcomed.  <\/p><p>  With expertise gained over several decades in C-IED operations at home and abroad, the Irish Defence Forces are acutely aware of the importance of continuing to find ways to reduce the effects of IEDs on operations.  C-IED is not just about stopping or neutralising an IED once it is already in place, but also about identifying and disrupting the networks that create and initiate IEDs. Understanding the various threat networks at the tactical to strategic levels is vital to success in current and future operations where battle lines are no longer linear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRW00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Legislation","counter":987,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRW00350"},{"type":"question","counter":988,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[13803\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRW00400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will clarify the advice given on the way in which blue flashing lights should be used on vehicles by the Civil Defence when attending to emergency events on motorways; if he will further clarify regarding the implementation of the Road Traffic Act 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":989,"content":"<p>The Circular which issued in January last entitled &ldquo;Guidance on Inter-Agency Co-ordination at Emergency Incidents on Motorways and Dual Carriageways&rdquo; arose out of a high level guidance document being developed by the National Steering Group for the Framework for Major Emergency Management in the Department of the Environment, Community &amp; Local Government.

Prices for cattle have been increasing recently, with a base payment of &euro;4.35 per kg being quoted last week by factories and Bord Bia quality assured cattle also finding a ready market at present. <\/p><p>  On the export front, there is strong demand from customers in our main markets (UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain etc.) which is underpinning the current high beef prices to Irish farmers. In 2012, beef exports amounted to &euro;1.9 billion, an increase of 2% over the previous year.<\/p><p>  The long term sustainability of the Suckler herd will depend on market prices for beef. The current strong prices for both store cattle and finished animals will help increase profitability in 2013 for Suckler cow farmers. In Europe beef supplies remain tight, with beef production down 2.7% in 2012 and due to contract by a further 0.5% in 2013. I am confident that, with these high prices, the viability of the National suckler herd is secure.<\/p><p>  With regard to the viability at farm gate level for suckler farmers Teagasc undertakes income analysis at farm level and publishes the results under their National Farm Survey (NSF) series.  In 2011 the average direct cost of production per hectare for Single Suckling enterprises ranged from &euro;350 per hectare on those farms with the lowest average gross margin to &euro;463 per hectare on the most profitable farms. <\/p><p>  There was considerably more variability in the average gross output between the least profitable and most profitable farms. The most profitable third of Single Suckling farms earned an average gross output of &euro;1,013 per hectare compared with an average gross output of &euro;451 per hectare on the least profitable one third of Single Suckling enterprises. This variability in average gross output is in large part due to the higher average stocking on the more profitable farms. These farms had an average stocking rate of 1.57 livestock units (LU) per hectare compared with only 1.03 LU per hectare for those farms with the lowest profitability.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the ongoing consolidation of the public finances my Department and the agencies under its remit have continued to provide an array of financial and infrastructural supports to underpin production in this sector. These include initiatives such as the Beef Technology Adoption Programme (BTAP), which is designed to equip beef farmers with the knowledge to improve efficiency at farm level. Some &euro;4.5 million was paid in 2012 to 4,800 farmers under the programme. <\/p><p>  Other supports include the establishment of the Beef Data Programme for which &euro;10 million has been allocated in 2013. The new programme will assist farmers in improving the genetic quality of Irish cattle and will maintain the data flow into ICBF in order to build further knowledge and more rapid progress in breeding and ultimately in profitability for farmers. In addition my Department continues to support the work of ICBF in improving genetic quality in the beef herd. On the advisory side Teagasc provides a best practice model for suckler farmers with the expanded BETTER Beef Farm Programme.<\/p><p>  My Department and its agencies will continue to make every effort to assist farmers, including suckler farmers, to improve their farming and income situation in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRW02400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Penalties","counter":1018,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRW02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1019,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[14176\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRW02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will outline specifically the penalty being imposed by his Department on a person (details supplied) in County Cork arising from an alleged non-compliance with single farm payment regulations; if he will quantify the exact financial penalty being imposed; the amount of this that has been recouped to date; the impact that it has on various entitlements including REP scheme, suckler cow, and disadvantaged area payment; if an administrative penalty is also being imposed in this case; and if in view of the scale of the penalty involved his Department is open to considering a reduced fine or easy payment system in this case","asker":"986","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1020,"content":"<p>In order to comply with EU requirements, the application was one of a number selected for inspection.

This would, in the case of several Member States (including Ireland), result in significant transfers between farmers.  I believe there is a need for redistribution but I am concerned that moving to a flat rate as proposed would be harmful for the Irish agricultural sector and the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  Other Member States, such as the newer Member States are seeking alternative solutions, while others still are happy with the flat rate system.  The February Council of EU Agriculture Ministers meeting broadly endorsed a package of measures that I tabled aimed at achieving a compromise on this very difficult issue. The package included the option to take a more flexible approach to distribution, the so-called &lsquo;approximation&rsquo; model favoured by Ireland. This would result in a less radical level of redistribution between farmers, moving gradually towards but not all the way to, a flat rate. <\/p><p>  As part of a set of proposals giving flexibility to Member States, I have proposed that Member States should be allowed to introduce a minimum payment per hectare if they wish, but some others have suggested that this should be mandatory.  Under the Commission proposal, &euro;280m would be transferred between farmers. Under the Irish proposal, a minimum of &euro;74m would be transferred, with flexibility to transfer more if we wished to do so. There will be those who gain and those who lose with either approach but I am working to ensure that those on historically lower payments are adequately supported and those on the very highest payments contribute the most towards redistribution. The key will be to reach a fair compromise, which levels the playing field without putting productive farmers out of business.  As is the case with any negotiation, the final position will be somewhere in between my approach and that of the Commission. I am fighting to ensure that the best possible outcome for all farmers is reached, in a balanced and fair way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRX01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Payments","counter":1052,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRX01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1053,"qnumday":420,"qnumall":"[13727\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRX01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number and percentage of the total single farm payment entitlements that have been traded as commodities during the period 2007-2013 without being linked to land ownership; and the legal position in relation to such entitlements from the period 2014 onwards","asker":"1017","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1054,"content":"<p>The total number of entitlements transferred by sale without land during the 2007 to 2012 scheme years is 132,525.

I am advised that, in 2012, ninety cochlear implants were carried out with 42 children receiving implants and 48 adults.  In addition to providing the surgical services, the programme provides a comprehensive assessment service to potential candidates and a rehabilitative service to those actually implanted.<\/p><p>  In 2009 a National Review of Audiology Services was carried out by the HSE, to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide, and to formulate a national plan for the services. The report of the National Audiology Review Group, published by the HSE in 2011, provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services, from new-born screening to assessment and management of adults and children with hearing problems, including cochlear implantation.  Two of the main recommendations in the report include the national rollout of a universal new-born hearing screening programme and the establishment of a bone anchored hearing aid programme. The report also included a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children. A key development has been the creation of the post of National Clinical Lead for Audiology. This post has recently been filled by a clinician who has worked extensively on cochlear implant programmes, including the Irish cochlear implant programme in Beaumont. The newly appointed lead is very familiar with the complexities of this area and will be taking a key role with the development of the potential introduction of a bilateral simultaneous\/sequential cochlear implant programme.<\/p><p>  While no dedicated programme for simultaneous or sequential implantation is being carried out in Ireland at this time, some bilateral implantation has already occurred for patients, mainly very young children with certain medical conditions such as a history of meningitis or blindness.  It is estimated that there are approximately 200 children in Ireland today who may be suitable for a second implant.<\/p><p>  The HSE is working closely with Beaumont Hospital to progress plans for both simultaneous and sequential bilateral implantation.  I understand that Beaumont Hospital, HSE Management and the HSE&rsquo;s Audiology Clinical Care Programme have met recently to discuss a joint process to identify the options for developing and resourcing a programme of simultaneous and sequential cochlear implantation.  An important element of this will be the development of clear clinical criteria to prioritise clients for assessment and follow on implantation. Each child requires to be assessed to determine if they are suitable for a bilateral implant, and the provision of information about the advantages and potential disadvantages of bilateral implantation is required in order to facilitate an informed decision as to whether to proceed. Not all suitable patients proceed with the second implant when apprised of all the issues involved. I understand that the HSE will be arranging an information day for all parents\/caregivers and children who have had, or about to have a single cochlear implant. This will provide a balance of information regarding the potential benefits that bilateral cochlear implantation may afford some children and the assessment programme that will be required to assess each child individually.<\/p><p>  The development of the service will require additional resources for Beaumont and these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 Estimates process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRZ04200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1183,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRZ04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1184,"qnumday":467,"qnumall":"[14175\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRZ04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to concerns (details supplied) regarding the way in which patients' documentation is being checked at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; and if he will provide an update on the security that has been instigated at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1185,"content":"<p>Hospital staff are fully aware of the need to protect patient confidentiality in relation to personal data.

In the case of the majority of clients there should be no need to avail of this exemption and nothing in the legislation obliges employers in exempted premises to permit smoking.  In any event, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 provides that 'every employer shall ensure so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare at work of all employees'.

The aim of the SDU is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system. The SDU's Scheduled Care Team focused initially on  waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.  For 2012, a target was set that no adult should wait longer than 9 months for inpatient or daycase treatment. By the end of December 2012, the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months for inpatient and day case surgery nationally had fallen to 86. This was down from 3,706 in December 2011, representing a 98% decrease. <\/p><p><br \/>  I am determined that the progress made in 2012 be maintained and improved upon. For 2013, the target is that no adult should be waiting longer than 8 months for inpatient or daycase treatment. It is important to recognise that the progress made in 2012 does not mean the problem is solved, and 2013 will of course be extremely challenging. For example, winter pressures in Emergency Departments have impacted on scheduled care waiting times.

The basis of the complaint, which was upheld by the Data Protection Commissioner, was that NSCs should not be retained indefinitely without consent as this breached the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003. There followed a series of meetings between the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner, representatives from my Department, the Health Services Executive (HSE) and the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, which resulted in the decision to destroy existing cards that are older than ten years. This is to rectify a situation which had developed and which, in the words of the Data Protection Commissioner, &quot;...was unlawful and could not be allowed to continue&quot;. <\/p><p>  I received representations from a number of people and organisations, who pointed out their potential value for research. Consequently, I requested the HSE to conduct a review of the decision to destroy these cards. This review examined both the legal and ethical basis for retention of NSCs and the potential use of the existing cards for research purposes. The report and recommendations of the review group were submitted to me in January 2012. The review group supported the decision to destroy cards more than ten years old.  <\/p><p>  However, the review group also explored how the cards could be made available to the research community in a way which is compatible with ethical and legal obligations. It must be remembered that there is no written consent from parents for the retention or use of these newborn screening cards taken before 2002 for research, or other, purposes.  As Deputies are aware, Part 4 of the Disability Act 2005 deals with genetic testing. Section 42.1 (b) which states that genetic testing shall not be carried out on a person unless &quot;the consent of the person to the processing of any genetic data to be derived from the testing has been obtained in accordance with the Acts&quot;. Sections 41.3 and 41.4 also point out what information should be provided to people before processing of genetic information and make clear it is an offence to process genetic information without the consent of the person concerned. <\/p><p>   line with its recommendations, the HSE  began an information campaign offering people the opportunity to have their screening card returned to them. This campaign will run until 31 March 2013, after which the retrieval procedure will begin. I have been assured that no material will be disposed of before all requests received before 31 March 2013 have been processed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRDD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mobility Allowance Applications","counter":1347,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRDD01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1348,"qnumday":530,"qnumall":"[13946\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000060#WRDD01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide details of the number of claims under the Equal Status Acts 2000 - 2008, made since January 2009 against his Department or the Health Service Executive, arising from the application of an upper age limit in the case of the mobility allowance, and which were referred to the Director of the Equality Tribunal; the number of such claims which have been settled by his Department and or the HSE prior to an Equality Officer hearing; the most recent date on which such a claim has been settled ans if there have been settlements; and the terms on which such claims have been settled","asker":"954","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1349,"content":"<p>One complaint was made to the Equality Tribunal against the Department of Health under the Equal Status Acts on the grounds of age discrimination relating to a refusal of the Mobility Allowance.

The research groups for this work were based in Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin. The second phase of the program (2007-2011) was recently completed. This research investigated the genetic risk factors in ASD by pooling DNA obtained from a large international sample of individuals and their families, including many Irish families. Genetic screening was then employed to identify (i) genetic variants that might increase the risk of autism and (ii) structural changes in the DNA of people with autism. In parallel, complete clinical information was gathered on participants and the clinical and genetic information was combined in the analysis. <\/p><p>  The main outcome showed that although ASDs have a substantial genetic basis, most of the known genetic risk has been traced to rare structural gene variants.

The final staffing position for all schools will not be known until later in the year when the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeal Board will have been considered.<\/p><p>  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools is being gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.  During this period the pupil threshold for a 2-classroom school is being increased to 20 pupils. In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.  The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.

Work-life balance arrangements in the public service will continue to be among the best available options provided by Irish employers, particularly when considered in tandem with annual leave and other provisions.  These arrangements underpin important social policy goals, in particular supporting the ongoing participation of parents and carers in the workplace.  The Irish public service has a proud record of promoting these arrangements and the employee profile across the service reflects the strong efforts made over the last few decades to ensure that public servants&#8217; employment terms allow them to balance their work and home commitments.  A range of flexible working arrangements will continue to be available across the public service where they currently exist, including, flexitime, work sharing arrangements, the shorter working year scheme, career breaks, as well as all of the statutory entitlements such as parental leave and carer&#8217;s leave.  The LRC is proposing that two of these arrangements, namely flexi-time and work sharing, be amended as sustainable reform measures that will underpin the delivery of a more integrated, efficient and effective public service.<\/p><p><b>  Flexi-time: <\/b>Public service organisations that currently have flexitime in place will continue to have flexi-time.  It will be available for existing staff and new entrants up to the grade of Higher Executive Officer and equivalent.  Everyone on flexi-time will continue, within certain limits, to be able to vary their arrival times, departure times and lunch breaks.  A change is proposed in the amount of flexi-leave that can be taken in a flexi period (4 weeks) - this will now be one day.  This still allows somebody on flexitime to avail of an additional 13 days flexi-leave per year in addition to their annual leave entitlement and any other flexible working arrangement that they may have.  Management grades at Assistant Principal and equivalent, who currently have access to flexi-time will continue to have access to these arrangements but will not have access to flexi-leave.<\/p><p><b>  Work Sharing: <\/b>It is important to clarify that a worksharer is an employee who was recruited to a full time position and has opted to reduce their hours to an agreed work sharing pattern.  Work sharing will still be available within the public service.  The proposals include a provision that will require everyone, with notable exceptions, to work a pattern of at least 50% of the full time hours.  It is important to note that only in the region of 2% of those currently work sharing in the Civil Service have a pattern of less than 50%.  In recognition of the valuable contribution made by carers to society, those in receipt of Carer&#8217;s Allowance will not be required to increase their hours above the 15 hour a week limit for payment of their allowance.  In support of our commitment to achieving the public service target of a 3% employment rate for people with disabilities, those with disabilities who have reached a reasonable accommodation with their employer to work less than 50% of full time hours will continue to be able to avail of these arrangements for as long as they are required.  It is necessary to revise flexi-time and work sharing arrangements to better reflect the current needs of public service organisations, in the context of falling numbers and changing demands for public services.  The operation of these arrangements must support the business of the organisation and the provision of services to the public.  The proposed changes are an attempt to balance the requirements of the business while enabling staff to balance work and personal life requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000063#WRP01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":1609,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000063#WRP01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1610,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[14207\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000063#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will instruct the Chief State Solicitor's Office to reply to a person (details supplied) regarding a property dispute as promised by his Department in a letter","asker":"954","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":1611,"content":"<p>I have brought the Deputy's question to the attention of the Chief State Solicitor's Office which informs me that it has now issued an interim letter and will be following up with a full response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000063#WRP01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flexible Work Practices","counter":1612,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000063#WRP01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1613,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[13674\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000063#WRP01700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to continue the incentivised career break for civil servants as introduced in the supplementary Budget in 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":1614,"content":"<p>There are currently no plans to reintroduce an incentivised career break scheme for civil servants.

In July 2012, the Government agreed a range of actions aimed at achieving a focused and integrated approach to external service delivery of non-core processes with the objective of reducing costs and focusing staff resources on priority areas.  A Commercial Delivery Manager was also appointed to drive this issue.  As part of this approach, the Government has decided that all proposed new services across the Public Service will be tested for external service delivery before any approval to provide the service internally will be granted.  External service delivery leads have been appointed in every Department and Sector and the Health, Justice and Local Government sectors are preparing external service delivery plans.  My Department is also examining a number of potential cross-Departmental projects for external service delivery.<\/p><p>  While my Department is overseeing the development and implementation of external service delivery policy for the Public Service, the testing and ultimate decision with regard to the external delivery of any particular service is a matter for the individual public bodies concerned in each case.  It is envisaged that this will involve cost-benefit analysis, on a case-by-case basis.  To this end, my Department has produced and distributed a Preliminary Business Case Template to all Departments and Sectors.  All contracts offered for external service delivery will be subject to the normal rules governing public procurement, which require all services to be offered by competitive tender.  In addition, the proposals from the Labour Relations Commission in respect of the Draft Public Service Agreement 2013-16 reaffirm the principles and procedures in the Croke Park Agreement regarding outsourcing, which include a commitment to evaluate the existing in-house service, the outsourcing option and to compare both.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000063#WRP02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Retirements","counter":1630,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000063#WRP02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1631,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[13892\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000063#WRP02900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of anticipated retirements from the public and civil service in 2013 and 2014; and the likely cost of these retirements in both years.","asker":"1071","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":1632,"content":"<p>The data requested by the Deputy is currently being prepared and will be published in the forthcoming Revised Estimates Volume (REV) for 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000063#WRP03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coastal Erosion","counter":1633,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000063#WRP03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1634,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[13930\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000063#WRP03100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the strategy the Office of Public Works has developed to combat the coastal erosion to Rossbeigh Beach, County Kerry; the funding available to carry out this strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1048","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":1635,"content":"<p>The investigation and addressing of problems of coastal erosion is a matter for Kerry County Council in the first instance.

Following investigation, irregular certification action may have consequences which include the imposition of monetary penalties, termination of the Certifier&rsquo;s agreement, or referral to the Medical Council or relevant body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000065#WRR01900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code Issues","counter":1707,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000065#WRR01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1708,"qnumday":316,"qnumall":"[13754\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000065#WRR02000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if there is the requirement for a review of social welfare payments to families who are living in poverty to protect the misuse of payments for drug or alcohol abuse at the expense of children or spouses; if there is a method by which teachers and persons can report suspected misuse of payments to her Department for action to be taken; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1014","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1709,"content":"<p>The objective of the social protection system is to promote active participation in society through the provision of income supports, employment services and other services.

The population share of those aged 65 and over is expected to more than double between now and 2051, from 11% to approximately 23% in 2050.  In contrast, the working age to pensioner ratio is projected to decline gradually from 5.3 \/1 to 2.1\/1.  <\/p><p>  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  The fundamental principle involved here is that people need to participate in the workforce for longer and they need to contribute more towards their pensions if they are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement.  <\/p><p>  The interdepartmental group, which was established in August 2012 is chaired by the Department of Social Protection, includes representatives from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Pensions Board.  Further engagement has also been undertaken with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health and Children. <\/p><p>  The group has met on 4 occasions which included a &lsquo;Forum on Working and Retirement&rsquo; held in Croke Park on 12th Dec last.

Structures rated '<i>regional'<\/i> or higher are subsequently recommended by me, as Minister, to a planning authority, under section 53 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, for inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures.

The specific allocations to be made over the next few years will, of course, be dependent on the budgetary and estimates cycles in each of those years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000066#WRS01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme Relocation Options","counter":1749,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000066#WRS01250"},{"type":"question","counter":1750,"qnumday":332,"qnumall":"[14130\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000066#WRS01300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will identify the bogs that have been finalised for relocation of turf cutters in County Kildare; and if he will identify the list of the further 30 raised bogs that have been identified as potential relocation sites nationwide.","asker":"1017","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":1751,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[14131\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000066#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will confirm that turf cutters on the Mouds and Ballynafagh bogs in County Kildare who have chosen to receive, on an interim basis, payments under the annuity payment scheme for each year while awaiting relocation to an alternative site will not be signed up to the annuity payment scheme in full that is for 15 years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":1752,"qnumday":334,"qnumall":"[14132\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000066#WRS01500","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the reason the 15 raised bog special area of conseration where relocation has been deemed unnecessary or small in scale, due to small numbers of active turf cutters on these sites, have been classed as active when turf cutting has not taken place on the sites since before 25 May 2005.","asker":"1017","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":1753,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[14133\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000066#WRS01600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the contact that has been made and the discussion that has taken place with the turf cutters on Ballynafagh Bog SAC and Clara Bog SAC by his Department and Bord Na M&oacute;na in relation to the sites finalised or close to finalisation for their relocation from these bogs; and the timeline for when relocation so such sites is likely to occur.","asker":"1017","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":1754,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 332 to 335, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>   Arrangements for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs have been made as regards a group from Clara Bog special area of conservation in County Offaly and a group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog special areas of conservation in County Galway.

It would be inappropriate to name the locations of these sites at this early stage. Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number that had been cutting turf on these sites during the relevant five year period and would qualify for the relocation option available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.<\/p><p>  Lattins Bog in County Kildare has been identified as a potential relocation site for turf cutters from Mouds Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare.

In this regard, the Falcarragh to M&iacute;n an Chladaigh area, which had been identified as an Important Bird Area in a report published in 2000, was specifically mentioned in the Court&rsquo;s ruling. A failure to abide by the Court&rsquo;s findings would result in the probable imposition of fines against the State. In the circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to suspend the designation process for the Falcarragh to Meenlaragh SPA.<\/p><p>The proposal to designate a number of Corncrake sites in Co Donegal, including the Falcarragh to Meenlaragh SPA, was advertised in the Donegal News, the Irish Times and in the Foinse supplement to the Irish Independent in the week commencing 4 July 2011. In addition, the proposed designations were announced four times daily on Highland Radio on 6, 7 and 8 July 2011.<\/p><p>Some 909 landowners and licence holders who could be identified in respect of the Falcarragh to Meenlaragh SPA were written to and provided with detailed information packs, including maps outlining the proposed boundaries, the reasons behind the proposed designation and the processes for objecting.<\/p><p>Maps and details of the proposed designations were also made available for inspection in<\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- the Garda Stations in Bunbeg, Carrick, Carndonagh, Carrigart, Creeslough, Culdaff, Dunfanaghy and Malin;<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- the libraries in Carndonagh and Letterkenny;<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- offices of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and of Teagasc in Letterkenny;<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- the Donegal County Council offices in Lifford; and<\/div><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px\">- the Department of Social Protection offices in Letterkenny.<\/div><\/p><p>Under the provisions of the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, the requisite consultation process commences after the notification of the intention to designate a site.<\/p><p>The Falcarragh to Meenlaragh SPA was chosen as a site for Corncrake on foot of evidence from survey work over a period of years indicating that the area is of continued importance to this species. Using the best available spatial data on Corncrake distribution and numbers, a suitable boundary for the SPA was produced by my Department. The annual survey data was gathered using international best practice methodology as part of ongoing Corncrake conservation work. This species spends a large proportion of its time concealed in vegetation and sightings are rare. The primary method of estimating its abundance and distribution relies on analysis of the audible records of this vocal species. It is only the male that regularly calls or sings and there is usually no direct recording of the female or young in an area. Scientific studies have shown that the nest of a female Corncrake and her brood rearing area is usually within 250 meters of the singing place of the male with which she paired. Individual male Corncrake can call from several locations over the course of a breeding season and may pair with more than one female.<\/p><p>Over 35 individual Irish grid reference records estimating the singing locations of male Corncrake are outlined below.

The rise in numbers in recent years has coincided with the economic recession which has caused customer arrears and debt levels to rise. <\/p><p><br \/>  In line with the CER&#8217;s Code of Practice on disconnection, electricity and gas suppliers must facilitate payment options\/plans for domestic customers experiencing genuine hardship and, where appropriate, engage with a money advisor acting on behalf of the customer or a recognised charity.  This must include offering the customer a prepayment meter.  According to CER&#8217;s published report on its website on Electricity and Gas Retail Markets, concerning the period to the end of September 2012, over 11,000 Pay as You Go electricity meters have been installed.  That report also states that there are approximately 19,500 token meters in operation.

The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) is responsible for issuing licences to mobile phone operators and for monitoring compliance with the conditions attached to the licences.  ComReg concluded a spectrum allocation process in late 2012, which will enable the successful applicants to operate 4G mobile services across the country. 4G is the fourth generation and most modern of mobile phone technologies currently available.  It is a matter for the individual mobile telephone operators to decide those parts of the country they will prioritise and those areas they will ultimately serve in accordance with the license conditions.<\/p><p>  The provision of broadband services   is also undertaken within a fully liberalised market. National and international statistics on broadband availability measure the highest broadband speeds marketed by retail services at the national level. These comparisons do not measure whether the speeds quoted are available in all areas of any country.   The high speeds offered in parts of County Kildare by at least one cable operator, in the areas it serves and has upgraded, compare favourably with high broadband speeds marketed internationally.  Unfortunately there are no statistics available which would allow a national or international comparison of the different speeds available throughout any one county.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>  Specifically, it commits to 70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; at least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population, and  a minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.<\/p><p>  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.<\/p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.

It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. <\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.<\/p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including County Kildare, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000067#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Charities Regulation","counter":1781,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000067#WRT00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1782,"qnumday":349,"qnumall":"[13957\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000067#WRT00800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the reason ComReg requires charities to obtain a premium rate services licence, when charities do not appear to come within the definition of a premium rate service provider as defined by the Communications Regulation (Premium Rate Services and Electronic Communications Infrastructure) Act 2010.","asker":"1034","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1783,"content":"<p>Under the 2010 Premium Rate Services Act, the provision of premium rate services, including services for the benefit of charitable organisations, is subject to a licensing requirement administered by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).

This follows a number of measures introduced since I came into office including significant cuts to practitioners' fees during 2011.<\/p><p>  Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his\/her means are insufficient to enable him\/her to pay for legal aid him\/herself.  The Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.   An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that an accused person who faces serious charges is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence and if he\/she cannot afford to pay for legal representation there is a right to legal aid.  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend him\/herself in person or through legal assistance of his\/her own choosing or, if he\/she has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  My overriding concern must be to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.<\/p><p>  A new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is being drafted to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions will have regard to a person's rights to the presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to be given legal aid, where appropriate.

As Minister, I have no power to intervene in any decision made by these statutorily independent bodies.

Ireland has been a member of the European Defence Agency since 2004.   The most pertinent issue facing our troops serving on Peace Support and crisis management operations overseas is Force Protection, and one of the main factors considered when undertaking any operation is protection from threats such as snipers, booby traps and improvised explosive devices.<\/p><p>  We all know the toll caused by Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and homemade explosives; we know how easy it can be for terrorists to wreak death, havoc and destruction in our countries and communities.  We also know there is a need for cooperation and collaboration to counter that threat.  <\/p><p>  Recent operations have shown that those engaged in hostile terrorist actions are likely to use (IEDs) because the materials to assemble them are easy to come by, they are relatively simple to construct, they are difficult to combat and, as we have found to our cost, they are devastatingly effective.  Indeed, criminals engaged in organised crime are also using IEDs and Pipe Bombs  in dealing with their adversaries. This is a very worrying development for civil society, which brings the threat of IEDs and their carnage ever more on to our streets and into our communities. <\/p><p>  The aim of the Resilient Threat Management Conference was to create a common understanding and appreciation of the challenges posed by IEDs past and present; to establish a vision for how the IED threat will be managed in the future; to generate the will to address these challenges comprehensively by bringing together international actors from the civil and military domain; to spread awareness on future capability requirements and technological opportunities and to increase networking within the community.  Therefore, the participation of Irish Defence Forces personnel at the Resilient Threat Management Conference, as experts in this area, is to be welcomed.  <\/p><p>  With expertise gained over several decades in C-IED operations at home and abroad, the Irish Defence Forces are acutely aware of the importance of continuing to find ways to reduce the effects of IEDs on operations.  C-IED is not just about stopping or neutralising an IED once it is already in place, but also about identifying and disrupting the networks that create and initiate IEDs. Understanding the various threat networks at the tactical to strategic levels is vital to success in current and future operations where battle lines are no longer linear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000070#WRW00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Legislation","counter":1922,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000070#WRW00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1923,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[13803\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000070#WRW00400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will clarify the advice given on the way in which blue flashing lights should be used on vehicles by the Civil Defence when attending to emergency events on motorways; if he will further clarify regarding the implementation of the Road Traffic Act 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1924,"content":"<p>The Circular which issued in January last entitled &ldquo;Guidance on Inter-Agency Co-ordination at Emergency Incidents on Motorways and Dual Carriageways&rdquo; arose out of a high level guidance document being developed by the National Steering Group for the Framework for Major Emergency Management in the Department of the Environment, Community &amp; Local Government.

Prices for cattle have been increasing recently, with a base payment of &euro;4.35 per kg being quoted last week by factories and Bord Bia quality assured cattle also finding a ready market at present. <\/p><p>  On the export front, there is strong demand from customers in our main markets (UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain etc.) which is underpinning the current high beef prices to Irish farmers. In 2012, beef exports amounted to &euro;1.9 billion, an increase of 2% over the previous year.<\/p><p>  The long term sustainability of the Suckler herd will depend on market prices for beef. The current strong prices for both store cattle and finished animals will help increase profitability in 2013 for Suckler cow farmers. In Europe beef supplies remain tight, with beef production down 2.7% in 2012 and due to contract by a further 0.5% in 2013. I am confident that, with these high prices, the viability of the National suckler herd is secure.<\/p><p>  With regard to the viability at farm gate level for suckler farmers Teagasc undertakes income analysis at farm level and publishes the results under their National Farm Survey (NSF) series.  In 2011 the average direct cost of production per hectare for Single Suckling enterprises ranged from &euro;350 per hectare on those farms with the lowest average gross margin to &euro;463 per hectare on the most profitable farms. <\/p><p>  There was considerably more variability in the average gross output between the least profitable and most profitable farms. The most profitable third of Single Suckling farms earned an average gross output of &euro;1,013 per hectare compared with an average gross output of &euro;451 per hectare on the least profitable one third of Single Suckling enterprises. This variability in average gross output is in large part due to the higher average stocking on the more profitable farms. These farms had an average stocking rate of 1.57 livestock units (LU) per hectare compared with only 1.03 LU per hectare for those farms with the lowest profitability.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the ongoing consolidation of the public finances my Department and the agencies under its remit have continued to provide an array of financial and infrastructural supports to underpin production in this sector. These include initiatives such as the Beef Technology Adoption Programme (BTAP), which is designed to equip beef farmers with the knowledge to improve efficiency at farm level. Some &euro;4.5 million was paid in 2012 to 4,800 farmers under the programme. <\/p><p>  Other supports include the establishment of the Beef Data Programme for which &euro;10 million has been allocated in 2013. The new programme will assist farmers in improving the genetic quality of Irish cattle and will maintain the data flow into ICBF in order to build further knowledge and more rapid progress in breeding and ultimately in profitability for farmers. In addition my Department continues to support the work of ICBF in improving genetic quality in the beef herd. On the advisory side Teagasc provides a best practice model for suckler farmers with the expanded BETTER Beef Farm Programme.<\/p><p>  My Department and its agencies will continue to make every effort to assist farmers, including suckler farmers, to improve their farming and income situation in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000070#WRW02400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Penalties","counter":1953,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000070#WRW02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1954,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[14176\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000070#WRW02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will outline specifically the penalty being imposed by his Department on a person (details supplied) in County Cork arising from an alleged non-compliance with single farm payment regulations; if he will quantify the exact financial penalty being imposed; the amount of this that has been recouped to date; the impact that it has on various entitlements including REP scheme, suckler cow, and disadvantaged area payment; if an administrative penalty is also being imposed in this case; and if in view of the scale of the penalty involved his Department is open to considering a reduced fine or easy payment system in this case","asker":"986","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1955,"content":"<p>In order to comply with EU requirements, the application was one of a number selected for inspection.

This would, in the case of several Member States (including Ireland), result in significant transfers between farmers.  I believe there is a need for redistribution but I am concerned that moving to a flat rate as proposed would be harmful for the Irish agricultural sector and the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  Other Member States, such as the newer Member States are seeking alternative solutions, while others still are happy with the flat rate system.  The February Council of EU Agriculture Ministers meeting broadly endorsed a package of measures that I tabled aimed at achieving a compromise on this very difficult issue. The package included the option to take a more flexible approach to distribution, the so-called &lsquo;approximation&rsquo; model favoured by Ireland. This would result in a less radical level of redistribution between farmers, moving gradually towards but not all the way to, a flat rate. <\/p><p>  As part of a set of proposals giving flexibility to Member States, I have proposed that Member States should be allowed to introduce a minimum payment per hectare if they wish, but some others have suggested that this should be mandatory.  Under the Commission proposal, &euro;280m would be transferred between farmers. Under the Irish proposal, a minimum of &euro;74m would be transferred, with flexibility to transfer more if we wished to do so. There will be those who gain and those who lose with either approach but I am working to ensure that those on historically lower payments are adequately supported and those on the very highest payments contribute the most towards redistribution. The key will be to reach a fair compromise, which levels the playing field without putting productive farmers out of business.  As is the case with any negotiation, the final position will be somewhere in between my approach and that of the Commission. I am fighting to ensure that the best possible outcome for all farmers is reached, in a balanced and fair way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000071#WRX01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Payments","counter":1987,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000071#WRX01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1988,"qnumday":420,"qnumall":"[13727\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000071#WRX01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number and percentage of the total single farm payment entitlements that have been traded as commodities during the period 2007-2013 without being linked to land ownership; and the legal position in relation to such entitlements from the period 2014 onwards","asker":"1017","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1989,"content":"<p>The total number of entitlements transferred by sale without land during the 2007 to 2012 scheme years is 132,525.

Under the Bill, Irish Medicines Board has statutory responsibility for establishing and publishing a List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products.  <\/p><p>  In deciding whether to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the Board must be satisfied that each medicinal product which falls within the group:<\/p><p>(a) has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in each of its active substances as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group; <\/p><p>(b) is in the same pharmaceutical form as, or in a pharmaceutical form that is appropriate for substitution for, each of the other products in the group; and<\/p><p>(c) has the same route of administration as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group. <\/p><p>  In addition, the Bill provides that the Board is not permitted to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products where:<\/p><p>- there is a difference in bioavailability between the medicinal products and the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products which may lead to a clinically significant difference in efficacy between them, and<\/p><p>- any of the medicinal  products cannot be safely substituted for any one or more of the other medicinal products in the group. <\/p><p>  I would like to emphasise that in making a decision to add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products the Board is obliged to have regard to the criteria as set out in the Bill and that these criteria fully reflect the recommendations set out in the Joint Department of Health\/HSE report 'Proposed Model of Reference Pricing and Generic Substitution' (the Moran Report, 2010) regarding criteria for interchangeability.     <\/p><p>  To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that these provisions address the concerns raised by the Deputy.

I am advised that, in 2012, ninety cochlear implants were carried out with 42 children receiving implants and 48 adults.  In addition to providing the surgical services, the programme provides a comprehensive assessment service to potential candidates and a rehabilitative service to those actually implanted.<\/p><p>  In 2009 a National Review of Audiology Services was carried out by the HSE, to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide, and to formulate a national plan for the services. The report of the National Audiology Review Group, published by the HSE in 2011, provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services, from new-born screening to assessment and management of adults and children with hearing problems, including cochlear implantation.  Two of the main recommendations in the report include the national rollout of a universal new-born hearing screening programme and the establishment of a bone anchored hearing aid programme. The report also included a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children. A key development has been the creation of the post of National Clinical Lead for Audiology. This post has recently been filled by a clinician who has worked extensively on cochlear implant programmes, including the Irish cochlear implant programme in Beaumont. The newly appointed lead is very familiar with the complexities of this area and will be taking a key role with the development of the potential introduction of a bilateral simultaneous\/sequential cochlear implant programme.<\/p><p>  While no dedicated programme for simultaneous or sequential implantation is being carried out in Ireland at this time, some bilateral implantation has already occurred for patients, mainly very young children with certain medical conditions such as a history of meningitis or blindness.  It is estimated that there are approximately 200 children in Ireland today who may be suitable for a second implant.<\/p><p>  The HSE is working closely with Beaumont Hospital to progress plans for both simultaneous and sequential bilateral implantation.  I understand that Beaumont Hospital, HSE Management and the HSE&rsquo;s Audiology Clinical Care Programme have met recently to discuss a joint process to identify the options for developing and resourcing a programme of simultaneous and sequential cochlear implantation.  An important element of this will be the development of clear clinical criteria to prioritise clients for assessment and follow on implantation. Each child requires to be assessed to determine if they are suitable for a bilateral implant, and the provision of information about the advantages and potential disadvantages of bilateral implantation is required in order to facilitate an informed decision as to whether to proceed. Not all suitable patients proceed with the second implant when apprised of all the issues involved. I understand that the HSE will be arranging an information day for all parents\/caregivers and children who have had, or about to have a single cochlear implant. This will provide a balance of information regarding the potential benefits that bilateral cochlear implantation may afford some children and the assessment programme that will be required to assess each child individually.<\/p><p>  The development of the service will require additional resources for Beaumont and these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 Estimates process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000073#WRZ04200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":2118,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000073#WRZ04300"},{"type":"question","counter":2119,"qnumday":467,"qnumall":"[14175\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000073#WRZ04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to concerns (details supplied) regarding the way in which patients' documentation is being checked at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; and if he will provide an update on the security that has been instigated at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2120,"content":"<p>Hospital staff are fully aware of the need to protect patient confidentiality in relation to personal data.

In the case of the majority of clients there should be no need to avail of this exemption and nothing in the legislation obliges employers in exempted premises to permit smoking.  In any event, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 provides that 'every employer shall ensure so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare at work of all employees'.

The aim of the SDU is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system. The SDU's Scheduled Care Team focused initially on  waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.  For 2012, a target was set that no adult should wait longer than 9 months for inpatient or daycase treatment. By the end of December 2012, the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months for inpatient and day case surgery nationally had fallen to 86. This was down from 3,706 in December 2011, representing a 98% decrease. <\/p><p><br \/>  I am determined that the progress made in 2012 be maintained and improved upon. For 2013, the target is that no adult should be waiting longer than 8 months for inpatient or daycase treatment. It is important to recognise that the progress made in 2012 does not mean the problem is solved, and 2013 will of course be extremely challenging. For example, winter pressures in Emergency Departments have impacted on scheduled care waiting times.

The basis of the complaint, which was upheld by the Data Protection Commissioner, was that NSCs should not be retained indefinitely without consent as this breached the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003. There followed a series of meetings between the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner, representatives from my Department, the Health Services Executive (HSE) and the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, which resulted in the decision to destroy existing cards that are older than ten years. This is to rectify a situation which had developed and which, in the words of the Data Protection Commissioner, &quot;...was unlawful and could not be allowed to continue&quot;. <\/p><p>  I received representations from a number of people and organisations, who pointed out their potential value for research. Consequently, I requested the HSE to conduct a review of the decision to destroy these cards. This review examined both the legal and ethical basis for retention of NSCs and the potential use of the existing cards for research purposes. The report and recommendations of the review group were submitted to me in January 2012. The review group supported the decision to destroy cards more than ten years old.  <\/p><p>  However, the review group also explored how the cards could be made available to the research community in a way which is compatible with ethical and legal obligations. It must be remembered that there is no written consent from parents for the retention or use of these newborn screening cards taken before 2002 for research, or other, purposes.  As Deputies are aware, Part 4 of the Disability Act 2005 deals with genetic testing. Section 42.1 (b) which states that genetic testing shall not be carried out on a person unless &quot;the consent of the person to the processing of any genetic data to be derived from the testing has been obtained in accordance with the Acts&quot;. Sections 41.3 and 41.4 also point out what information should be provided to people before processing of genetic information and make clear it is an offence to process genetic information without the consent of the person concerned. <\/p><p>   line with its recommendations, the HSE  began an information campaign offering people the opportunity to have their screening card returned to them. This campaign will run until 31 March 2013, after which the retrieval procedure will begin. I have been assured that no material will be disposed of before all requests received before 31 March 2013 have been processed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000077#WRDD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mobility Allowance Applications","counter":2282,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000077#WRDD01550"},{"type":"question","counter":2283,"qnumday":530,"qnumall":"[13946\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032000077#WRDD01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide details of the number of claims under the Equal Status Acts 2000 - 2008, made since January 2009 against his Department or the Health Service Executive, arising from the application of an upper age limit in the case of the mobility allowance, and which were referred to the Director of the Equality Tribunal; the number of such claims which have been settled by his Department and or the HSE prior to an Equality Officer hearing; the most recent date on which such a claim has been settled ans if there have been settlements; and the terms on which such claims have been settled","asker":"954","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2284,"content":"<p>One complaint was made to the Equality Tribunal against the Department of Health under the Equal Status Acts on the grounds of age discrimination relating to a refusal of the Mobility Allowance.

Accordingly the database does not record the incidence of Autism or any other disability. <\/p><p>  The 2011 National Council for Special Education (NCSE) study on prevalence of special educational needs in Ireland (A Study on the Prevalence of Special Educational Needs, Joanne Banks and Selina McCoy, Economic and Social Research Institute) includes autism and estimates that prevalence for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is 1 in 100.  <\/p><p>  In 2004, the Department of Health provided funding for research into autism through the HRB as part of the Autism Genome Project - a collaboration of autism researchers internationally aimed at understanding susceptibility to ASD, to pave the way towards the development of better diagnostics and treatments. The research groups for this work were based in Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin. The second phase of the program (2007-2011) was recently completed. This research investigated the genetic risk factors in ASD by pooling DNA obtained from a large international sample of individuals and their families, including many Irish families. Genetic screening was then employed to identify (i) genetic variants that might increase the risk of autism and (ii) structural changes in the DNA of people with autism. In parallel, complete clinical information was gathered on participants and the clinical and genetic information was combined in the analysis. <\/p><p>  The main outcome showed that although ASDs have a substantial genetic basis, most of the known genetic risk has been traced to rare structural gene variants.
