A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits. Chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.  Companies that are not tax resident in Ireland and which do not carry on a trade in Ireland have no liability to Irish corporation tax and have no obligation to file an Irish corporation tax return.  However, a company that is not tax resident in Ireland will be liable to Irish corporation tax tax, if they carry on a trade through a branch or agency in Ireland, in respect of the profits arising to the branch or agency.   <\/p><p>  Specifically in relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I think it is important to be clear that an Irish incorporated company, that is not tax resident anywhere, is taxable in Ireland in respect of any profits that accrue to that company from activities or operations that take place in Ireland under the existing rules that I have just described.  The ability of a company to be tax resident nowhere appears to be the result of mismatches between the domestic rules of different countries with regard to determining the place of tax residence of a company.  Some countries, such as Ireland, rely primarily on the use of a management and control test to determine whether or not a company is tax resident in Ireland.  Some other countries rely primarily on an incorporation test to determine place of tax residence.<\/p><p>  Such mismatches can be exploited by companies to allow them to be tax resident nowhere.  The most effective way to deal with such arrangements is for countries to work together to examine these structures and to consider how international rules can be amended to ensure fair levels of taxation.  Ireland remains fully committed to this approach to ensure coherence in international taxation.  In this regard, Ireland is participating in projects at EU and OECD level which aim to address international tax issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300047#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banks Recapitalisation","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300047#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[41478\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300047#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the payments made to date to pay for the capitalisation of the banks and all other supports given to the banks.","asker":"954","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, before this government entered office, taxpayers&rsquo; money amounting to &euro;46.3bn was injected into the banks, in the form of capital support, most of which went into the former Anglo Irish Bank. Subsequent to the formation of the current government the banks were required to raise a total of &euro;24bn as a result of the Central Bank&rsquo;s 2011 Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR). However, primarily as a result of successful private equity contributions, asset sales and burden sharing with bondholders, the Government only had to inject &euro;16.5bn into the relevant institutions. In addition, the State acquired Irish Life for &euro;1.3bn to complete the recapitalisation of Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent, giving a total commitment of &euro;17.8bn. In all the State&rsquo;s Total Capital Investment in the Banks amounted to &euro;64.1bn at its peak.  This figure represents the gross capital or money committed to recapitalising these institutions and does not take account of revenues received directly or indirectly from the banks in return for State support, or indeed from disposals. The State has now started the process of exiting its bank investments and to date, successful disposals by the State of its bank investments include:<\/p><p>  - The entire &euro;1 billion holding of Contingent Capital Notes (CCN&rsquo;s) in Bank of Ireland.  The State disposed of its holding in the bonds at a price of 101% of their par value plus accrued interest. The transaction settled on Tuesday the 15th of January and the State was paid proceeds of &euro;1,056 million comprising principal of &euro;1,000 million, interest accrued of over &euro;46 million and a profit of &euro;10 million.<\/p><p>  - The sale of Irish Life earlier this year for a consideration of &euro;1.3 billion which was approximately a 30% premium to the price that was achievable when the previous bid process was suspended in November 2011. The consideration received resulted in the State recouping the full investment made by the taxpayer in Irish Life. In addition a &euro;40 million dividend was paid to the State on completion.<\/p><p>  Of course the State still has a sizable portfolio of banking investments which it has yet to monetise. The National Pension Reserve Fund&rsquo;s (NPRF) directed portfolio in Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland was valued at &euro;8.8bn at 30 June 2013. The State also holds contingent capital investments of &euro;2bn in AIB and PTSB and an equity position in PTSB.  The NPRF to date has also received a total of &euro;2.2 billion in cash from its Bank of Ireland investments &ndash; comprising preference share dividends, the repurchase of warrants by the Bank and the sale of ordinary shares to a consortium of private investors.<\/p><p>  Finally, in addition to the cost of capitalisation, the State has supported the banks&rsquo; deposit and funding activities as follows:<\/p><p>  - The Credit Institutions Financial Support Scheme (CIFS) which operated from 30 September 2008 to 29 September 2010; and,<\/p><p>  - The Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme (ELG) which operated until March 2013. <\/p><p>  The CIFS and ELG schemes provided guarantees from the State in return for the payment of a percentage fee of the covered liabilities. A total of &euro;4,106.6 million has been received into the Exchequer to date in fees and interest accrued from the covered banks in payment for these schemes. This is made up of &euro;763.7 million in respect of the CIFS scheme and &euro;3,342.9 million in respect of the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme (ELG). These amounts are expected to be offset by claims under the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (&ldquo;ELG&rdquo;) scheme in relation to the liquidation of IBRC which could cost the State circa &euro;1bn in 2013 based on best estimates. (These costs would have been incurred by IBRC at some point regardless of the transaction.)<\/p><p>  It is the Government&rsquo;s stated intention to break the link between the Sovereign and the Banks which is a desire shared by our European partners. Should an opportunity arise to sell any further investments, this will be considered having assessed the best interests of the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300047#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Mortgage Loan Book","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300047#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[41467\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300047#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address the concerns of former Irish Nationwide customers, who have been advised that their mortgage is being sold, that they may be adversely impacted by the sale; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

HP will also provide hosting facilities at a backup data centre for the purposes of business continuity. Both of these data centres are located in Dublin.  The Central Bank will remain in control and manage all sensitive systems and data. This new data centre will negate the requirement for the Central bank to build two new data centre environments to replace existing facilities which are at &lsquo;end of life&rsquo;. It will also enable supplier consolidation for a range of services currently being provided by a diverse group of up to seventeen external suppliers.

Where a borrower relies on legal action to address an arrears situation it must be able to demonstrate that &ldquo;an arrangement could not be reached or is not appropriate&rdquo; and therefore it is pursuing legal action as a restructure of the mortgage is either not possible or not an adequate solution.<\/p><p>  It is a key responsibility of financial institutions to do more to assist those in severe financial difficulty. Letters threatening repossession or legal action could not in my opinion be considered a sustainable solution under the mortgage arrears targets, and should only ever be considered after every possible avenue for solution has been exhausted. This is consistent with the Central Bank&rsquo;s MART document.  It should be noted that the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) provides that lenders may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where they have already made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative arrangement with a cooperating borrower. <\/p><p>  The MART document sets out three modes of generating a sustainable solution.  The first and most preferred type of solution is an arrangement where payments are re-established on the original, or an agreed revised schedule. The second mode is where the borrower opts for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement and the third mode is where an arrangement could not be reached or is not appropriate and ultimately involves surrender or repossession of the property.<\/p><p>  In his appearance at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, the Governor of the Central Bank acknowledged that more than sixty per cent of the end June proposals by the relevant banks were in the third mode. The Governor also informed the Committee that the Central Bank has commenced the audit of the banks&rsquo; returns on the end of June target and the Central Bank will have initial results of the audit in November (and will publish data in December).  This will ensure that the mortgage modifications proposed by the lenders are in fact sustainable.  The MART document also outlines the Central Bank&rsquo;s position and powers in this regard. The two specific measures the Central Bank can take relate to imposing additional provisioning and capital requirements on firms.  From 2014 the present value of future mortgage cashflows will be set at zero for the purpose of calculating impairment provisions where loans that are in arrears for greater than 90 days have not been subject to a sustainable solution.<\/p><p>  In the targets set by the Central Bank, repossession of a property can be counted as a conclusion once the case has progressed to the lodgement of the Civil Bill with the Circuit Court. The Central Bank has also informed me, however, that to count as a conclusion, the institution must be able to demonstrate that all regulatory requirements have been adhered to, in particular the CCMA obligation to ensure that repossession is a last resort.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank does not expect that repossession will be the lender&rsquo;s preferred solution to mortgage difficulties and in most cases engagement by the borrower will make the legal course unnecessary.  However in circumstances where the borrower does not engage with a lender to address a mortgage difficulty and, subject to fully complying with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, then there may be no other option for the lender but to commence legal proceedings. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300048#WRB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Reductions","counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300048#WRB00950"},{"type":"question","counter":29,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[41303\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300048#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration will be given to extending the 9% tourism VAT rate beyond 2013 in order to continue to boost tourism figures and create and retain jobs in the tourism sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":30,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[41482\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300048#WRB01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will re-think his plans to increase the VAT rate from 9% to 13.5% in view of the negative effect this will have on employment in the hospitality sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Euro-Area Heads of State or Government confirmed this position and mandated EU Finance Ministers to prepare an operational framework by mid-2013.

There is a specific provision for retrospective recapitalisation included in the instrument. This states that &ldquo;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.&rdquo; Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the ESM for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks for us, should we decide to seek it. <\/p><p>  This overall framework agreed this summer builds upon the earlier Euro area Heads of State and Government agreement secured on the 29th of June 2012, and is an important step in the Eurozone&rsquo;s efforts in this regard.

Further High Court applications were made to extend the term of appointment of the Special Manager, the latest being in June 2013, and High Court Orders were secured for a 6 month extension period on each occasion.<\/p><p>  The Special Manager appointment was made because of Central Bank concerns in relation to the high level of loan losses incurred by the credit union, which impacted on the level of its reserves.  There were also concerns about some of the lending made, which went beyond the traditional type of lending normally provided by credit unions.  This action was taken to strengthen Newbridge Credit Union, protect members&rsquo; savings and ensure that Newbridge Credit Union can continue to operate effectively, providing financial services to the local community. <\/p><p>  The Central Bank is responsible for the regulation and supervision of credit unions.  That role includes the implementation of resolution action, where required.  The Central Bank undertook a process under the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011, involving the examination of possible combinations with other credit unions.  As part of this process, Naas Credit Union submitted a proposal to the Central Bank, setting out the basis upon which Naas Credit Union would be prepared to combine with Newbridge.<\/p><p>  At the request of the Governor of the Central Bank, I have confirmed that I am prepared, in principle, to support the proposal.  However, the proposal remains subject to amongst other things due diligence, completion of relevant documentation, Naas Credit Union board approval, regulatory consideration and High Court approval.  I expect that these steps will be completed expeditiously and that the Naas\/Newbridge combination will be finalised by the end of this year.  This will necessitate a significant capital investment of taxpayers&rsquo; funds into Newbridge Credit Union to cover the losses at Newbridge and to ensure the protection of members&rsquo; savings and the stability of Newbridge into the future.  The successful combination of these credit unions is considered the best way to ensure the continuity of credit union services for members in Newbridge.<\/p><p>  I met with the Newbridge Action Group on 19 September.  Following that meeting, the agreed next steps were for the Newbridge Action Group to submit its proposal to me expeditiously.  Once received, I have agreed to communicate that proposal to the Central Bank with a view to a meeting between the Central Bank and the Group.  As yet no proposal has been received from the Newbridge Action Group.  I should also clarify that contrary to media reports no specific amount for the cost of the combination was mentioned by me to the action group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300050#WRD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Arrears Proposals","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300050#WRD00950"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[41507\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300050#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if will work with the Central Bank of Ireland to agree a definition of a strategic defaulter in relation to mortgages.","asker":"981","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":87,"content":"<p>I have been informed by the Central Bank that it has not defined the concept of \"strategic default\".

With that in mind, I am unsure as to the premise of the Deputy's question which seems to imply that Ireland has an \"effective rate\" that is significantly lower than our 12.5% rate.  All companies resident in Ireland are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities in Ireland.  A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits.  Chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.<\/p><p>  I am aware of media reports which refer to the ways that some multinational companies structure their international tax affairs to minimise their tax costs and I understand that some of these reports have suggested that some companies in multinational groups pay Irish corporation tax at rates that are lower than 12.5%.  At this point it is important to state clearly that such companies are not paying a low rate of Irish tax &ndash; as already stated all companies in Ireland pay the standard 12.5% rate on their profits which are generated in Ireland.  The reports concerned appear to have incorrectly attributed to Ireland profits that represent the return due to assets in other jurisdictions, owned by group companies that are not resident in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The profits charged in Ireland fully reflect the functions, assets and risks located here by a multinational group.  The payments to the non-resident company represent the required remuneration of intellectual property assets funded and owned outside the State and its tax payments are properly reduced in these circumstances by reference to expenditure incurred for the purpose of its trade.  Ireland cannot expect to receive or retain the remuneration of these assets.<\/p><p>  The ability of multinational entities to lower their world-wide rates of tax using international structures reflects the global context in which Ireland and indeed all countries operate.  Differences arise in the legal and tax systems between countries.  International tax-planning takes account of these differences in national systems and rules.  The most effective way to deal with such arrangements is for countries to work together to examine these structures and to consider how international rules can be amended to ensure fair levels of taxation.  In this regard, Ireland is participating in projects at EU and OECD level which aim to address these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300050#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Growth Rate","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300050#WRD01750"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[41515\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300050#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason the growth prediction from his Department for 2013 has decreased each year in the Stability Programme Update from 2011 to 2013.","asker":"1037","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>All economic forecasts are conditional forecasts - they are based upon assumptions for key inputs such as demand in export markets and exchange rates etc.  When these assumptions change, projections will, by definition, change.

I discussed how our economies have gone through a major transformation over the last number of years and we are finally starting to see signs of stability and growth.  I indicated that while no two economies are identical, there are many similarities between the causes of the crisis both sides of the border, there are common symptoms, and in my view, there are also common solutions evident in our recovery.<\/p><p>  On both sides of the border, families and businesses borrowed heavily to invest in residential and commercial property.  People got drawn into the property market with many small businesses moving beyond their core business and building up property portfolios.  These same families and business are now struggling under the weight of this debt. As a result we have a situation where thousands of families and business cannot fully engage with the economy. At the broader level the bursting of the bubble has forced Governments to introduce measures that would not be contemplated in normal times. NAMA, our asset management company, is one such example.<\/p><p>  Consistent with that theme, I met with First Minister, Peter Robinson, and the Finance Minister, Simon Hamilton at Stormont Castle in advance of the lunch to discuss NAMA&rsquo;s activity in Northern Ireland.  First Minister Robinson had raised concerns in the press earlier in the week that NAMA&rsquo;s policies in Northern Ireland may constrain Northern Ireland&rsquo;s recovery and so it was opportune that we were able to discuss this very important issue.  We discussed NAMA&rsquo;s involvement in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economy generally.  NAMA&rsquo;s strategy in Northern Ireland is aimed at generating sustainable activity and transactions in the Northern Ireland property market &ndash; both through orderly sales and through targeted initiatives such as vendor finance and joint ventures that are designed to overcome the lack of funding in the market and enhance the future value of Northern Ireland assets through a programme of investment funding.  We also discussed how NAMA&rsquo;s concerns reflect the concerns of members of the Northern Ireland Executive about the negative impact fire sales would have on the economy.<\/p><p>  We discussed the very strong level of engagement NAMA has in Northern Ireland with all key stakeholders, which is supported by NAMA&rsquo;s Northern Ireland Advisory Committee.  NAMA is investing to enhance the value of its assets in Northern Ireland and has advanced significant amounts of new money into the Northern Ireland economy to assist in such projects as the construction of a new 95-unit housing development in Milmount, Dundonald, close to Belfast and to complete Lanyon Plaza and the Soloist Building which form part of a landmark office development in the centre of Belfast.  This investment comes at a time when there are very few other sources of funding for projects in Northern Ireland.  As has also recently been reported in the press, NAMA is working closely with local housing authorities and approved housing bodies in Northern Ireland and recently announced the sale of over 50 apartments to Oaklee Housing Association in Belfast.<\/p><p>  Our meeting was very constructive with both sides sharing an understanding of the importance of NAMA to the economy in Northern Ireland and of the care NAMA is taking in its dealings in Northern Ireland through on going measures of support and considerations regarding the management of the portfolio into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300051#WRE00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU-IMF Programme of Support Issues","counter":104,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300051#WRE00350"},{"type":"question","counter":105,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[41298\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300051#WRE00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the likely financial facility or line of credit that will be required from the financial institutions of the European Union for Ireland when it exits the current bailout programme later this year.","asker":"1020","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[41504\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300051#WRE00450","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the options being considered for additional funding or credit lines if Ireland leaves the troika programme and the level of conditionality each option would bring.

The Government's focus is now firmly fixed on achieving a successful and durable exit from our programme. In this regard we are doing all that we can to achieve this end. We continue to meet our programme conditions and our strong implementation record has been recognised by our external partners and the financial markets. <\/p><p>  The options available to Ireland on exiting the programme fall into two broad categories. A successful exit without any further support or a successful exit supported by the European Stability Mechanism's and the IMF's precautionary backstop facilities. The second option has been referred to as Ireland having an 'insurance policy' to guard against the possibility of unfavorable external events that might arise.  <\/p><p>  By way of information, both the IMF and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) have a number of options available in relation to the precautionary financial assistance as follows.  The ESM's Treaty provides, in Article 14, that the Board of Governors may decide to grant precautionary financial assistance in the form of a precautionary conditioned credit line (PCCL) or in the form of an enhanced conditions credit line (ECCL). It also provides, at Articles 17 and 18 for primary and secondary market support facilities.  The Treaty also provides for the conditionality, terms and conditions to be attached to such assistance. Further information in relation to these instruments is available on the ESM website at .<\/p><p>  The IMF has a number of precautionary or standby type facilities including Flexible Credit Line (FCL), the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), the Extended Funding Facility (EFF) and the Stand By Arrangement (SBA). These different instruments are designed to address different sets of circumstances, and the terms and conditions attaching to them are structured accordingly. Further information on these instruments is available on the IMF website at . <\/p><p>  In the case of both the ESM and IMF precautionary facilities, the nature of the conditionality would depend on the type of facility agreed and also the specific circumstances of the country making the application.  In general, such conditionality seeks to address the reasons underlying the application for assistance.<\/p><p>  The ECB's Outright Monetary Transaction (OMT) is another potential support for countries exiting a programme. The Governing Council of the ECB made a decision to establish Outright Monetary Transaction (OMT) on 2 August 2012, and issued a Press Release on 6 September 2012 which outlined its technical features. According to this ECB Press Release, the purpose of OMT is: &#8220;<i>Safeguarding an appropriate monetary policy transmission and the singleness of the monetary policy<\/i>&#8221;. In the Press Release, the ECB noted in relation to the coverage of OMT that it &#8220;<i>will be considered for Member States currently under a macroeconomic adjustment programme when they will be regaining bond market access<\/i>.&#8221; The Press Release also sets out that a necessary condition for OMT is strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate European Financial Stability Facility\/European Stability Mechanism EFSF\/ESM programme. <\/p><p>  Such programmes can take the form of a full EFSF\/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme or a precautionary programme (Enhanced Conditions Credit Line), provided that they include the possibility of EFSF\/ESM primary market purchases. Finally the Press Release also notes that the ECB's Governing Council will decide on the start, continuation and suspension of OMT, following a thorough assessment, in full discretion and acting in accordance with its monetary policy mandate. The decision on whether to grant OMT or otherwise in any particular case is a matter for the ECB, which is an independent body. <\/p><p>  Ireland will be the first euro country to exit an EU-IMF programme of this type. In this context, discussions on Ireland's exit from the Programme took place during the recent review missions and some further clarity on the possible options that might be available in terms of exit strategy was achieved.  The issue will be considered further at the forthcoming Troika review scheduled for the second half of October.  No decisions have been taken to date by Government on any of the possible options that Ireland might wish to pursue in this matter.  However, all options that assist in supporting durable and sustainable future market funding will be considered in the light of what is appropriate for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300051#WRE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2014","counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300051#WRE00550"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[41299\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300051#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will include a stimulus package in Budget 2014; if he will provide capital investment to build social housing units to address the ongoing housing crisis and to provide much needed employment for those on the live register.","asker":"1020","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":110,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague Brendan Howlin, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced at the start of the summer, a stimulus package which included &euro;150 million to be invested school projects, local road maintenance and repairs, and a Local Authority Energy Efficiency Scheme.

The proceeds of all borrowing as well as revenues including tax and non-tax, and capital receipts are lodged to the Exchequer account to fund general expenditure.  In general, no specific tranches of borrowing were undertaken solely for the purpose of recapitalising the banking sector.

It also recognises that businesses with legacy debts may be viable.  One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.  The Irish Credit Bureau is a private entity and I have no direct function in the day-to-day operational decisions.  In relation to the credit ratings provided to SMEs my department recognised the need to reorganise the government reporting system and established an inter-agency working group at the end of 2010 to develop a strategy to put in place an effective credit reporting system in Ireland.  The working group's report formed the basis of the Credit Reporting Bill 2012.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Credit Reporting Bill, 2012 is currently passing through the Houses of the Oireachtas which provides for the creation of an effective statutory based credit reporting system.  The Bill includes the following provisions:<\/p><p>- The database will be owned by the Central Bank and the Bank will be responsible for the operation of the Central Credit Register. <\/p><p>- There will be mandatory reporting of a comprehensive range of credit information by credit providers. <\/p><p>- The Bill provides for controls with regard to access to information on the Register.  By including provisions relating to access to data and security measures as well as provisions to help to deal with identity theft, this legislation should inspire confidence in businesses and in the consumer.<\/p><p>- The legislation proposes to extend the role of the Data Protection Commissioner to deal with complaints from micro enterprises and SMEs (with a turnover of less than &euro;3m) in respect of their data held on the Credit Register.  This initiative may provide some comfort to enterprises where they have a concern in relation to the potential storing of inaccurate data and where they do not have the resources to take legal action through the Courts to seek to have the data corrected.  Inaccurate data on the Central Credit Register could result in the refusal of credit to a small company.  <\/p><p>- In line with International practice, it provides for a retention period of 5 years in relation to credit information with respect to debts from the day on which it is entered on the Register.  The Bill provides for the retention of information for a period of 6 months in relation to credit applications from the day it is entered on the Register. Anonymised information may be retained indefinitely.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Government is fully engaged in supporting the SME sector and has imposed SME lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.  Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  Both banks achieved the targets for 2011 and 2012.  I have met the Boards of each of the banks in which the State has a shareholding three times since the start of this year.  At these meetings, I have emphasised the importance of access to credit for SMEs and the need for an adequate flow of finance to be available to viable small businesses in Ireland.<\/p><p>  In June 2013 the Central Bank set quarterly institution-specific performance targets for covered banks to move distressed SME borrowers onto longer-term solutions.  The targets set reflect the banks' capacity, processes and systems.  I should stress that the Credit Review process remains available to any SMEs whose credit has been reduced or withdrawn by AIB or Bank of Ireland as well as when credit is refused by them.

Macroeconomic developments thus far are supportive of the projected reduction in debt and deficit in the post-programme environment.  Quarterly National Accounts data for the second quarter show that real GDP increased by 0.4 per cent in the quarter.  Encouragingly high frequency data suggest a continuation of the positive momentum into the third quarter.  Of particular note were the tentative signs of a modest recovery in domestic demand.  Personal consumption increased by 0.7 per cent in the second quarter and strong retail sales in recent months are indicative of further growth in the third quarter.  We have also seen a return to growth in 'core' (excluding planes) investment, with both construction and machinery and equipment now growing.<\/p><p>  Labour market conditions have also improved markedly over the last year, with employment having increased in each of the last four quarters.  Employment was up by 1.8 per cent in year-on-year terms in the second quarter, representing an additional 33,800 jobs over the year.  The improvement in labour market conditions has also been reflected in the unemployment rate, with a standardised unemployment rate falling to 13.3 per cent in September, having peaked at 15.1 per cent in February 2012.<\/p><p>  These indicators point to a modest recovery in the Irish economy.

The Irish Presidency achieved a Council General Approach on this file which has enabled the Lithuanian Presidency to commence the next stage of the legislative process, which is the engagement via Trilogues with the European Parliament and Commission on this file.  The Tripartite discussions in relation to this issue are at an early stage and no agreement has been finalised thus far. This topic is scheduled for further Trilogue discussions in October. It is expected at this stage that agreement on commodities will form part of the final MiFID II package. <\/p><p>  This file, along with the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), seeks to protect against excessive financial speculation in the food and other commodity derivative markets.  The Regulation of derivative trading in the EU has been actively discussed within the EU since September 2010 when the Commission published its proposal for the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) to regulate this market in the context of over-the-counter (OTC) trades. The EMIR Regulation, which entered into force on 16 August 2012, implements reforms to derivatives trading, making it safer and more efficient. These reforms include obligations to clear and report derivatives and it also imposes obligations on non-financial firms who use derivatives.<\/p><p>  Under the current MiFID II proposals, the level of exemptions available has been reduced and more products will be defined as derivative financial instruments, when compared with MiFID I and will therefore fall within the scope of MiFID II and other financial legislation such as Market Abuse. MiFID II also contains important provisions relating to position management, position limits and product intervention. These provisions are in respect of all financial instruments, including commodity derivatives, and have the purpose of providing regulators with tools to avoid excessive speculation in financial instruments, including commodity derivatives. The Council is proposing that competent authorities will be obligated to establish and apply position limits on the size of a position in a commodity derivative which a person can have over a specified period of time. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, competent authorities will have product intervention powers whereby they may prohibit or restrict trading of financial instruments or prohibit or restrict investment activities when there is a threat to the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or commodity markets.

However, towards the end of last year, the Supreme Court ruled that letters from the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence, which sanctioned a parent's residence in the State, could be accepted as evidence of lawful residence from the date of the letter.

Dublin to Fingal County Council for parkland<\/p><p>  - Co-funding, with Fingal County Council, of an N2-N3 link road through lands in west Dublin to facilitate identified development requirements.<\/p><p>  NAMA is also engaging with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive in relation to possible sites and buildings for primary health care centres and other step-down and community health care facilities.<\/p><p>  The Agency, therefore, whilst working to obtain the best achievable financial return for the taxpayer, is very open to realistic proposals that achieve desirable social objectives and there are numerous examples of this.  In addition to NAMA's on-going engagement with public bodies in relation to specific initiatives, such as social housing, it is open to any public body to identify its interest in lands and property securing the Agency's loans.  <\/p><p>  I believe the approach determined by NAMA's Board is contributing in terms of its primary commercial objective, while at the same time contributing to the achievement of wider public policy objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300054#WRH00537","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions Issues","counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300054#WRH00550"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[41554\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300054#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the Credit Union owned CUSOP will receive its authorisation from the Central Bank; if the Government is fully supportive of this initiative; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":189,"content":"<p>A Credit Union Service Organisation for Payments (CUSOP) requires a Payments Institution licence to operate electronic payment accounts for credit unions.

","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":203,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 to 77, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  Section 224 of the Companies Act, 1963, as it applies in modified form to the liquidation of IBRC pursuant to Section 10 of the IBRC Act, requires the directors of IBRC, unless &ldquo;the Minister thinks it fit to order otherwise and so orders&rdquo;, to prepare a Statement of Affairs in respect of IBRC (a &ldquo;Statement of Affairs&rdquo;) within 21 days of the date of the liquidation or such later date as I may specify. I have issued two Statutory Instruments (&lsquo;SIs&rsquo;) in relation to the timing and content of the Statement of Affairs to be prepared by the directors of IBRC. The first SI issued on 6th August 2013 (SI 304 of 2013) and a second SI issued on 18th September 2013 (SI 358 of 2013). Both of these SIs were necessary to facilitate requests made on behalf of the directors of IBRC in relation to the timing and content of the Statement of Affairs which they were required to produce.<\/p><p>  The effect of the two SIs was to extend the date of submission of the Statement of Affairs out to the 30th September 2013 and also to waive the requirement to include the personal details of debtors and depositors of the bank as at 7th February 2013 in the Statement of Affairs. No precedent exists as these are the first orders to be made under Section 224 of the Companies Act, 1963, as it applies in modified form to the liquidation of IBRC pursuant to Section 10 of the IBRC Act.<\/p><p>  I am advised that it was not feasible for the directors of IBRC to prepare a Statement of Affairs for IBRC within 21 days of the appointment of the special liquidators due to the complexity of the balance sheet of IBRC on liquidation and due to the amount of work required to be completed by the directors in preparing the Statement of Affairs. The liquidation of IBRC is arguably the largest and most complex liquidation of a company in the history of the State and I am satisfied that it was simply not feasible for the directors to complete the Statement of Affairs within the period specified in the Companies Act and for that reason I agreed to extend the submission date of the Statement of Affairs to the 30th September 2013. <\/p><p>  I also agreed that it would not be appropriate or necessary for the purposes of the orderly winding-up of IBRC for the directors to disclose personal details of the bank&rsquo;s approximately 2,500 depositors in the Statement of Affairs, as there would be a risk that such details, if they were included in the Statement of Affairs, could quite possibly make their way into the public domain. I further agreed that it would be inappropriate and unnecessary for the purposes of the orderly winding-up of IBRC to require the disclosure of personal information of the approximately 17,000 mortgage holders as well as other debtors of the bank as part of the Statement of Affairs. There is a risk that such information, if disclosed in the Statement of Affairs, could become publicly available and in my view this would not be in the interests of the orderly winding up of IBRC or the maximisation of the value IBRC&rsquo;s assets. <\/p><p>  The directors of IBRC remain obliged to produce a Statement of Affairs which will provide a detailed list of the assets and liabilities of the bank at the time of liquidation and the directors remain required to clearly set out the amounts owing by IBRC to secured, preferential and unsecured creditors at the time of liquidation. Information on aggregate amounts owing by debtors of the bank, and owing by the bank to depositors, upon liquidation will still be included in the Statement of Affairs along with estimates of the recoverable value of the assets.<\/p><p>  It is also important to note that the personal information concerning depositors and debtors which will not now be included in the Statement of Affairs is information which is already fully available to the Special Liquidators of the bank.   I made the decision to issue both the SIs following discussions and consultations between my officials and the directors of IBRC and the Special Liquidators of IBRC, who had no objection to the terms of the SIs.  The exclusion of personal information concerning depositors and debtors of the bank from the Statement of Affairs will not therefore have any adverse impact on the orderly winding-up of the bank&rsquo;s affairs. It is also important to note that the date of submission of the Statement of Affairs has not been negatively impacted by the introduction of the SIs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300054#WRH01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Investigations","counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300055#WRJ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":206,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[41643\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300055#WRJ00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of revenue audits carried out each year from 2008 to 2013; the revenue raised from such audits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":207,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their overall approach to tackling compliance is to make the appropriate intervention following careful appraisal of the risk factors in each case.  Not all interventions conducted are in the form of an audit.  The appropriate compliance intervention is the one considered to be the most effective in targeting the specific risk or risks identified, and to influence the compliance behaviour of the taxpayer. By carefully selecting cases for intervention, and choosing the type of intervention, Revenue maximises the use of resources, and minimises the compliance burden on compliant taxpayers. Accordingly, the focus may vary from a comprehensive examination of all the taxes and duties for which a taxpayer may be liable, to a detailed check of a single tax-head, or a concentration on a single issue of concern.<\/p><p>This targeted approach is greatly supported and enhanced with appropriate technology, including the Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling system &ndash; REAP, integrating information obtained from multiple sources, and Integrated Case Management systems that facilitate case selection, provide invaluable information for evaluating Revenue&rsquo;s programmes, track the progress of cases and record the risks identified and examined.  REAP, developed by Revenue, categorises taxpayers in accordance with defined risk criteria and includes details of the compliance behaviour of the taxpayer in relation to filing and paying.<\/p><p>I am advised that these systems have enabled the Commissioners to gradually evolve and refine the recording and classification of compliance interventions and the approach currently in use is shown in Table 2 below in respect of 2012.

Of the &euro;1,180m &lsquo;debt available for collection&rsquo; figure at 31 March 2013, &euro;476m was under active enforcement and a further &euro;124m was the subject of phased payment arrangements.<\/p><p>In regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s request for a breakdown of the arrears, I am informed that the data is not maintained in the format requested. However the data is available at taxhead level and is attached in the table below.<\/p><p>In regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the number of Revenue staff engaged in arrears collection, primary responsibility for debt management rests with the Collector-General&rsquo;s Division. The purpose of the Collector-General&rsquo;s debt management function is to ensure the timely collection of the business and personal taxes for which Revenue has responsibility and, where timely compliance is not achieved, to undertake robust debt collection activity to recoup arrears.  The numbers of Collector-General staff involved in debt collection activity during the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 are as follows:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Number of Staff<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>450<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>441<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>460<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>Finally, I am assured by Revenue that, notwithstanding the continuing very difficult environment, achieving further reductions in collectible debt is a key strategic objective. I am satisfied that the continuing trend in decreasing levels of &lsquo;debt available for collection&rsquo; over the last couple of years is encouraging and clearly demonstrates the success of Revenue&rsquo;s current approach to debt management.<\/p><p><b>Analysis of Taxes Outstanding Debt at 31 March 2013<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th><b>Tax Head<\/b><\/th><th><b>2013 &euro;m<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>VAT<\/td><td>434<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>PAYE<\/td><td>166<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>PRSI<\/td><td>159<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Income Tax (excl PAYE)<\/td><td>647<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Corporation Tax<\/td><td>241<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Capital Gains Tax<\/td><td>260<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Capital Acquisitions Tax<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Relevant Contracts Tax<\/td><td>27<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Environmental Levy<\/td><td>41<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Air Travel Tax<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Total<\/b><\/td><td><b>2,006<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300055#WRJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treasury Management Agency Deposits","counter":214,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300055#WRJ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":215,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[41723\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300055#WRJ00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the current average interest rate earned by the National Treasury Management Agency on its cash balance; the actual average interest earned by the NTMA on its cash balance in 2012; the current average interest rate on the general Government debt; the current average interest rate on the State's Exchequer debt; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":216,"content":"<p>Exchequer cash balances are held in the Exchequer account at the Central Bank of Ireland and earn interest at the Euro Overnight Index Average (EONIA) rate.

More high frequency data have also been encouraging and suggest a continuation of the positive momentum into the third quarter. In particular, I would point to signs of a modest recovery in domestic demand. Personal consumption increased by 0.7 per cent in the second quarter and strong retail sales in recent months are indicative of further growth in the third quarter. We have also seen a return to growth in &lsquo;core&rsquo; (excluding planes) investment, with both construction and machinery and equipment now growing.<\/p><p>  There has also been a marked improvement in labour market conditions over the last year, with employment having increased in each of the last four quarters. Employment was up by 1.8 per cent in annual terms in the second quarter, representing an additional 33,800 jobs over the year. The improvement in labour market conditions has also been reflected in the unemployment rate, with a standardised unemployment rate falling to 13.3 per cent in September, having peaked at 15.1 per cent early last year.<\/p><p>  These indicators point to a modest recovery in the Irish economy. My Department will be publishing updated forecasts for 2013 and 2014 along with the Budget on 15 October which will take account of developments in the interim and which must be independently endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, in line with the European regulation on common provisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans.  The forecasts produced by the Central Bank yesterday suggest moderate growth this year as weaker export growth drags on the headline figure, with the rate of expansion set to pick up in 2014.<\/p><p>  On the fiscal side, we continue to meet and exceed our budget deficit targets. It should however be noted that part of our current deficit is structural; in other words, economic recovery alone will not be sufficient to correct the deficit. However, we have made significant progress in reducing the structural deficit in recent years and most of this correction has already been done.  Ireland&rsquo;s considerable efforts in restoring our public finances to a sound footing has not only been reflected in the deficit figures but has also had significant confidence effects. Ireland&rsquo;s 10 year bond yield has fallen by over 10 percentage points since peaking in July 2011, facilitating Ireland&rsquo;s return to the market for long-term financing earlier this year. <\/p><p>  As Ireland&rsquo;s EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support comes to an end this year the Government&rsquo;s focus is now firmly fixed on achieving a successful and durable exit from our programme, and a full and sustainable return to the financial markets, and we are doing all we can to this end. Macroeconomic developments thus far are supportive of the projected reduction in debt and deficit in the post-programme environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300055#WRJ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Arrears Proposals","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300055#WRJ01450"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[41762\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300055#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which his Department continues to monitor the progress with which lending institutions are making adequate efforts to meet the requirements of borrowers with particular reference to the need to protect the family home; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":225,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[41768\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300055#WRJ01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is satisfied that all lending institutions are entering into meaningful discussions with borrowers with a view to ensuring that such borrowers remain in their family home while making reasonable arrangements to meet their commitments in the circumstances with particular reference to their current income as opposed to their income when undertaking their borrowings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[41772\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300055#WRJ01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which his Department has monitored the total number of family home repossessions in each of the past three years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":227,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 89 and 93 together.<\/p><p>  The Government's strategy to assist those in mortgage difficulty is built around measures in four distinct areas - Personal Insolvency, a Mortgage Advisory Service, the Mortgage to Rent Scheme, and Engagement with the Banks, and considerable progress has now been achieved across this agenda.<\/p><p>  The implementation of sustainable mortgage arrears strategies and solutions by individual banks for their distressed customers, with Central Bank oversight, is a key element of the overall framework to address the mortgage arrears problem.  The Deputy will be aware of the Central Bank's initiative announced last March, which set time bound and measurable targets for the main banks, requiring them to systematically address their arrears book.  This is a very important step to resolve the impasse on arrears.  The Central Bank initially required the main mortgage lenders to propose sustainable solutions to 20% of mortgages that are in arrears (of over 90 days) by end June.  The target rises to 30% by the end of September, to 50% by the end of December 2013 and 70% by end of March 2014.  The Central Bank is now also requiring banks to agree sustainable solutions with 15% of their customers by the end of this year and 25% of their customers by the end of March next year. The Central Bank has informed me that it will monitor and audit the performance of banks in relation to the targets and, crucially, will also assess whether the modifications provided are in fact sustainable solutions. <\/p><p>  The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) also provides a strong protection framework for borrowers who engage with their lenders. Under the CCMA lenders are required to proactively engage with their co-operating customers in order to help them address the situation - they must carry out a full assessment of the borrower's situation based on the Standard Financial Statement and each case must be examined on its individual merits and when a lender makes a sustainable forbearance offer to a borrower, the affordability assessment of the borrower needs to be based on both their current and prospective future servicing capacity for all borrowings  Lenders are required to explore all their options and where they do not offer an alternative repayment arrangement they must inform the borrower of the reasons for this and what alternatives are available.  <\/p><p>  The 'Keane Report' indicated that, given the recourse nature of mortgages, personal insolvency reform and in particular the introduction of new more accessible insolvency resolution frameworks, were essential for the resolution of the mortgage arrears problem. The Personal Insolvency Act is now law and the introduction of this Act should be a catalyst to incentivise banks to reach an agreed solution with individual borrowers in resolving mortgage arrears cases. The Insolvency Service of Ireland is already dealing with the first cases that have been submitted. <\/p><p>  The Mortgage Advisory Service, which is an extensive independent mortgage advice framework has been put in place by the Minister for Social Protection and comprises of an enhanced website, a Mortgage Arrears information helpline, and the provision of free independent 'one-to-one' professional advice to borrowers when considering a long-term forbearance or resolution offer from their lender.  <\/p><p>  In addition, the Minister for Housing and Planning has put the 'mortgage-to-rent' scheme on a nationwide basis.  Protecting the home of the most distressed mortgage holders through a 'mortgage-to-rent' scheme where the ownership of the house passes to an Approved Housing Body is a key housing support for those with distressed mortgages.  The existing owner then becomes a social housing tenant.  This option is now available in appropriate cases and will be of benefit to low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable to allow the family to remain in their home.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank compiles and publishes quarterly mortgage arrears, restructures and repossession statistics for both primary domestic homes (PDH) and buy-to-let (BTL) mortgages and my Department closely monitors these statistics closely. According to these Central Bank statistics, from Q3 2009, over 2,000 PDH properties have been taken into possession by the regulated lenders to Q2 2013 inclusive.

The Quarterly National Household Survey results for the second quarter of this year showed the strongest job creation since 2008.  Encouragingly this growth consisted of both full and part-time employment and was broad based across the different sectors of the economy.  In addition, the standardised unemployment rate reduced further in September, to 13.3 per cent, which is the lowest level since March 2010, but still unacceptably high.  We must now continue to build on the progress made over the past year as there is clearly still lots to do.  I would not like to single out any one particular job creation initiative introduced by the Government over the past two and a half years, as I feel all the various initiatives have worked in unison to bring about the labour market improvement.<\/p><p>  For instance, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 builds on the success of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, by focusing on creating an environment conducive to job creation. It hopes to achieve this by:<\/p><p>  - Building Competitive Advantage;<\/p><p>  - Assisting Indigenous Business to Grow;<\/p><p>  - Driving Entrepreneurship and Start-Up Companies;<\/p><p>  - Supporting Employment at Community and Local Level;<\/p><p>  - Developing and Deepening the Impact of FDI; and<\/p><p>  - Sectoral Opportunities.<\/p><p>  In addition to the Action Plan for Jobs, Pathways to Work 2013, published in July, is a 50-point action plan that focuses on labour market activation and builds on the success of Pathways to work 2012.  This plan focuses on:<\/p><p>  - More regular and ongoing engagement with the unemployed;<\/p><p>  - Greater targeting of activation places and opportunities;<\/p><p>  - Incentivising both the take-up of opportunities and employers to provide more jobs for people who are unemployed; and<\/p><p>  - Reforming institutions to deliver better services to the unemployed.<\/p><p>  In addition to these economy-wide initiatives, the Government has also introduced sector specific initiatives aimed at job creation, for example in the tourism and hospitality sector.  The Gathering Ireland 2013, along with the Jobs Initiative of reduced VAT for the tourism and hospitality sectors, aims at &#8220;jump-starting&#8221; the tourism sector, which is employment rich and has knock-on effects for the wider economy.  Recent figures show that visitor numbers from North America, Great Britain and mainland Europe are all growing, as trips to Ireland from January to August this year increased by 6.5 per cent compared to the same period last year. Employment in accommodation and food services activities is up 8 per cent on the year to the second quarter of 2013.  So all of the initiatives are having a positive effect.  The task now is to build on this momentum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300056#WRK00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":240,"content":"<p>Question No. 88 answered with Question 82.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":241,"content":"<p>Question No. 89 answered with Question 83.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Data","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300056#WRK00550"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[41769\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300056#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent by which the economic fundamentals and prospects have altered year on year over each of the past five years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":244,"content":"<p>The improvements in economic conditions in Ireland over the past five years have been considerable and, although we still have some way to go, the achievements to date should not be forgotten.  Having contracted for three successive years from 2008 to 2010, the economy recorded a second successive year of growth in 2012.  This recovery has been driven by strong export growth over the period, reflecting, in part, the considerable competitiveness gains achieved in the last number of years.  Inflation in Ireland has been below or on par with that of the euro area average for every month since March 2008 and the latest Commission estimates suggests a 22 per cent improvement in unit labour cost relative to the euro area average between 2008 and 2014.<\/p><p>  I am however cognisant of the fact that it is improvements in the domestic economy that are of greatest concern for the Irish public.  Domestic activity contracted sharply following the bursting of the property bubble, with domestic demand decreasing significantly between 2008 and 2012.  This has had severe ramifications for the labour market with the unemployment rate increasing by around 10 percentage points over this period. <\/p><p>  However recent indications have been that domestic demand is stabilising and is moving on to a modest recovery path.  Personal consumption was up by 0.7 per cent in the second quarter and strong retail sales in the third quarter, along with improving consumer sentiment, bode well for the second half of the year.  We have also seen a return to growth in &lsquo;core&rsquo; (excluding planes) investment, with both construction and machinery and equipment growing in the quarter.  Perhaps most pertinently, employment has now increased in each of the last four quarters, with employment up 1.8 per cent in the second quarter, representing an additional 33,800 jobs over the year. In line with this, the standardised unemployment rate stood at 13.3 per cent in September, having fallen from a peak of 15.1 per cent early last year.  While I would again stress that more must be done to tackle the still high level of unemployment, it is clear that we are now moving in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300056#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":245,"content":"<p>Question No. 91 answered with Question 85.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":246,"content":"<p>Question No. 92 answered with Question 82.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":247,"content":"<p>Question No. 93 answered with Question 83.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":248,"content":"<p>Question No. 94 answered with Question 82.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Policy","counter":250,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300057#WRL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":251,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[41775\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300057#WRL00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the bodies or persons with whom his Department has had contact in relation to the formation of economic programme 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The detailed arrangements are set out in Departmental Circular 0037\/2013 which issued on 1 July 2013 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address: .<\/p><p>  With effect from 1 May 2013 once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service is notified by his\/her employer that he\/she is to be made redundant then he\/she shall be deemed to be a member of a Supplementary Assignment Panel for SNAs.

This allocation was 85% of the Special Education Review Committee (SERC) recommended resource teaching allocations.  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013\/14 school year by 15th March, 2013. <\/p><p>The NCSE published details of all of their initial allocations for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013\/2014 school year in June of this year.

The NCSE allocated 5,284 whole time equivalent resource teaching posts to schools at this point. It should be noted that 700 of these posts are allocated to post primary schools to meet High Incidence and Learning Support needs. These posts remain allocated at 100% of the recommended levels.   <\/p><p>  In order to meet any late demand for resource teaching support arising between 15th March, 2013 and the start of the school year, the NCSE requested all schools to submit outstanding applications for resource teaching support to the NCSE by 20th September, 2013.  The NCSE is presently processing these applications and has estimated that up to 480 additional resource teaching posts will be required to meet demand in respect of valid applications received to 20th September 2013.

Moreover, in order to strengthen the redeployment process, the Haddington Road Agreement provides for revisions to the redeployment arrangements to ensure more flexible and faster redeployment both within and across sectors. This should further improve the flow of staff across the public service and ensure that suitably skilled staff are available to meet the identified organisational, operational and business needs of public service organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300059#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Sites Issues","counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300060#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[41705\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300060#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the visitor numbers to Office of Public Works sites in Askeaton, Adare, Kilmallock during the years 2011, 2012, and to date in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Forfas report &ldquo;Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2012&rdquo; published earlier this year, examined costs of doing business here and identified the relative importance of different areas of cost for different business sectors.  The report indicates that business costs in Ireland have reduced significantly in recent years, with overall price levels in the economy falling back to levels last experienced in 2002. The improvement in business cost competitiveness has been driven by significant reductions in property related costs (in terms of purchase and rent levels) and falling prices across a range of professional and business services. There have also been relative improvements in labour costs in Ireland which fell on average by 0.9% per annum in the period 2008-2011, while labour costs increased in the euro area by 4.6% per annum on average in the same period.  However, while these improvements are very welcome and indicate that the economy is moving in the right direction, we must continue to focus on actions to promote further cost reductions across the economy. The Forfas report makes a number of recommendations aimed at further improving our cost competitiveness position in relation to labour, property, transport, utility and professional services costs.<\/p><p>  Part of the objective of the Action Plan for Jobs has been the development of proposals each year that can improve our competitiveness.  The 2013 Action Plan includes a number of specific actions in this regard which address some of the areas highlighted in the Forfas report.

Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world class physical and digital infrastructure as well as the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  IDA Ireland, however tries to influence these choices by prioritising the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass with sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services, etc. and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, an FDI project secured for one Gateway can have a positive impact on other Gateways and their surrounding areas.  It must be acknowledged, that the decision on where a client company will locate a new FDI investment is ultimately made by senior managers of the companies involved.<\/p><p>  A number of locations outside of Dublin and the main urban centres already facilitate the presence of a large number of multinational companies who have invested over the years, span multiple sectors and employ significant amounts of people.  The primary opportunity for attracting FDI to such regional locations lies with existing clients and the potential further investment opportunities from this base as approximately 70% of all FDI investments won by IDA is from the existing client base.  At the end of 2012 there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry employing 1,600 people.<\/p><p>  I am determined to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for foreign direct investment. In winning such investments, I am, however, mindful of the need to address the concerns that have been expressed to me by Deputies on all sides of the House about the relatively low level of site visits to certain regional locations. I have, accordingly, requested IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to work with my Department so that we can explore what further initiatives we can take to ensure we have a better approach to enterprise development in regional locations.  This exercise will complement the in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy which is currently being undertaken.  This analysis, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, the changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that will be introduced in 2014 and our approach to regional development will inform the formulation of an appropriate FDI strategy for the period post 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300060#WRO01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":352,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300060#WRO01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Retirement Issues","counter":351,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300060#WRO01750"},{"type":"question","counter":352,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[41567\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300060#WRO01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide in tabular form, the number of persons affected by statutory retirement in the private sector, in each of the past five years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"975","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":369,"content":"<p>Increasing the State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition) are steps that have been taken to ensure the sustainability of pensions into the future.  The decision to reform the State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  The State pension age will then increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.   <\/p><p>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age.  This applied at a time when longevity was much lower and working patterns were more likely to be physically demanding.  State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension and was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Overtime, the age for State pension contributory was reduced to 66 years.   <\/p><p>  I am aware that there are concerns in relation to this matter.  However, the Deputy may wish to note that a significant number of people coming on to State Pension transition in 2012 did not come from work as many were already on other social welfare schemes well in advance of State pension transition age.  In December 2012 there were approximately 14,400 State pension (transition) claims in payment and of those, 12.5 per cent came from work with over 50 per cent coming from other social welfare schemes such as illness benefit, jobseeker's benefit and assistance, invalidity and carers indicating that significant numbers of people are leaving the workforce for a variety of reasons well in advance of State pension age. <\/p><p>  In terms of social welfare supports available to those at age 65 who are unable to remain in the workforce, the main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker's benefit.  Persons who qualify for a jobseeker's benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).  All short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.  I will keep this matter under review.<\/p><p>  It should be noted there is no statutory compulsory retirement age for employees in Ireland.  Responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer\/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  However, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has made rulings in a series of age-discrimination cases concerning Directive 2000\/78\/EC, which prohibit work-related discrimination on various grounds, including age.  The CJEU has clarified that mandatory retirement ages may be set down by employers within the context of national law, whether by contract, custom and practice or other means, which must be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim, with the means of achieving that aim being both appropriate and necessary.  Consideration of these issues as they relate to enterprise and equality policy come within the respective remit of the Minster for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Justice and Equality. <\/p><p>  An interdepartmental Working and Retirement Group was initiated to consider the cross departmental policy issues arising and thereby improve the sustainability and adequacy of pensions systems.  The interdepartmental group, established in August 2012, is chaired by the Department of Social Protection, and includes representatives from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Pensions Board.  Further engagement has also been undertaken with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health and Children and work in this regard is ongoing.<\/p><p>  The recently published OECD report on the Review of the Irish Pension System confirms that reforms are necessary if we are to continue to put pension provision on a sustainable footing given the changes in demographics, the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund, and the difficult fiscal situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300061#WRP00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Benefit Payments","counter":370,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300061#WRP00950"},{"type":"question","counter":371,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[41664\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300061#WRP01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide, in tabular form, for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, the number of persons in receipt of carer's benefit and the expenditure from the overall Department of Social Protection budget on carer's benefit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012 and expects to receive in the region of 350,000 applications by the end of 2013. <\/p><p>  Garda Vetting Disclosures are predicated on the signed authorisation of a vetting subject for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to disclose to the registered organisation &ldquo;details of all prosecutions, successful or not, pending or completed, and\/or convictions which may be recorded in respect of them in the State or elsewhere&rdquo;; or alternatively that there are &ldquo;no prosecutions or convictions recorded in respect of them&rdquo;.  The disclosure is made to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.  <\/p><p>  Each time a new vetting application is received, a full vetting check is conducted to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. The non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the certificate protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service. It also affords the registered organisation the facility to assess suitability based on the most up to date information available on the applicant. The Deputy will appreciate that the safety of children and vulnerable adults is the primary consideration and this must remain the case.<\/p><p>  It is essential that the GCVU has the resources required to perform this most critical of roles effectively and I have given this matter particular priority. In that regard I have been actively engaged with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. As a result of that engagement, I am pleased to say that the Commissioner has confirmed to me that there are now 134 whole-time equivalent staff (130 civilians and 4 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) assigned to the GCVU, some 41 of whom have been redeployed from elsewhere in the public service since the end of March 2013. Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process, and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks. Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU. This brings the total number of staff in that service to over 170 which, when compared to the average staff allocation of 78 at the Unit over the past two and a half years, represents an increase of 117%.<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is now approximately 9 weeks from date of receipt. However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion. Nevertheless this is a significant improvement on the processing time of 14 weeks which existed in July this year. In the interest of fairness and equity, Garda vetting applications are processed in chronological order based on the date of receipt in the GCVU and all organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.<\/p><p>  Development of an e-Vetting solution is underway. This will facilitate the processing of all applications in an e-format, thus removing the time-consuming current process of manually managing all applications received .

There are currently 4,414 persons seeking international protection residing in 34 Direct Provision accommodation centres across 16 counties under contract to RIA.  Of these residents, approximately a third are children under the age of 18.<\/p><p>  I should firstly commend to the Deputy RIA's 2012 Annual Report available on its website - www.ria.gov.ie - which  includes greater detail than before on family make up in centres as well as additional information on facilities for children in each of the centres involved.<\/p><p> The Direct Provision system is unique and there is no direct comparison with other types of accommodation where children would reside, be they houses with gardens or apartment buildings. Some accommodation centres have more outdoor and indoor facilities than others.  However, any suggestions that children in these centres do not have opportunities for meaningful recreation activities are wide of the mark. Further details are available in the Report mentioned above. Of the current 34 asylum centres in RIA's portfolio, only 3 were specifically built for the sole purpose of accommodating asylum seekers, that is, they were 'purpose-built'.  All other centres must operate within the physical limitations of the premises' original use e.g. hotel, college dormitory, hostel, etc.  While all conform, at the very least, to minimum contractual and legislative standards, there are necessarily a range of facilities available in centres in the overall RIA portfolio, deriving from their original use.<\/p><p>  RIA and centre management work with local schools, community groups, sports clubs and NGO's to link children and families into community initiatives, sports and other activities to ensure access to the best available package of services. Children of asylum seekers can access recreational facilities available in the locality in which they are living.  Some Direct Provision Centres have on-site playgrounds.  Many centres will also facilitate NGO&rsquo;s who organise outings etc. Centres also have links with local community facilities which allow for free and discounted access to amenities outside of the accommodation centre.<\/p><p>  It is worth noting that asylum seeker children benefit from access to primary and secondary education on the same basis as Irish citizen children in the local community, and both schools and the Community Welfare Service are very supportive of those children in assisting with any associated costs in respect of equipment and transport. An exemption from fees for State Examinations is also available to asylum seekers who are holders of medical cards. Homework clubs and quiet spaces are provided in family centres to facilitate children doing their homework. <\/p><p>  On-site pre-school services are available in some of the larger direct provision centres. However, in all cases parents may opt to send their children to privately run pre-schools in the community. The Early Child Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme provides for free pre-school placements to all children, including children of asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300066#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":550,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300066#WRX00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":549,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300066#WRX00750"},{"type":"question","counter":550,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[41571\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300066#WRX00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive payment for their agri-environment options scheme 2; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The broad range of available task options allowed participants to choose those best suited to the business needs and particular characteristics of their beef enterprises.<\/p><p>  The person named did not qualify for payment because he failed to satisfactorily complete one of two selected tasks &ndash; the task related to the completion of a herd health plan in consultation with a veterinary practitioner. Participants who chose that task were required to join the Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) eradication programme, a condition of which was that herd owners had to submit tissue samples from all calves born on their holdings in 2012 to one of a number of designated laboratories. Task completion was verified by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) which maintains a database of laboratory results on behalf of Animal Health Ireland. Information received from ICBF indicated that the herd owner in question did not sample any animal born in 2012. While the calves born in 2012 were BVD-tested in January 2013, this does not meet the Task requirement for the 2012 Programme.<\/p><p>  It is the responsibility of participants and their facilitators to familiarise themselves with the Programme Terms and Conditions and with the consequences for breaches of the rules. In applying for the BTAP, farmers undertook to comply with the Terms and Conditions of the Programme and accepted that failure to abide by the rules could result in a loss of payment. It was determined following appeal that the individual concerned failed to fully comply with the BTAP Terms and Conditions and, accordingly, no payment is possible in this case.

Approximately 68,000 children availed of the provision in 2012.  In line with the Programme for Government, I succeeded in maintaining the universality of the free pre-school year, including securing an additional funding requirement of &euro;9.8m in 2012 to address increased demand due to an increase in births since 2009.<\/p><p>  There is an increasing body of Irish and International evidence which quantify the benefits of early year&rsquo;s interventions in terms of improving children&rsquo;s outcomes and in delivering significant economic and societal return to the state. I this context I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes as well as proving significantly beneficial to children with special needs. In addition a second pre-school year would represent &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 worth of free childcare to parents and likely generate 4,000-5,000 new positions, albeit mostly part-time. The benefits of introducing a second year were further referred to in the OECD reports on Ireland published last week.<\/p><p>  However, the introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, with the additional cost broadly in line with the cost of the current one year provision, which is &euro;175 million.  This funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is currently operating.  However I would hope that this proposal is one which Government could continue to work towards as our public finances recover.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, I am progressing a Pre-School Quality Agenda involving a range of actions in eight key areas, aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime.  I see this agenda as a key building block for any further extensive of universal childcare provision, including any proposal to introduce a second free pre-school year.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.\u00a0 The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for each local authority.  The application for INTERREG IVA funding by Louth County Council and its partners was for &euro;17.4m.\u00a0 This amount was approved by the SEUPB.\u00a0 Financial contributions were sought from my Department and the Northern Ireland Department of Finance &amp;amp; Personnel on the basis of this figure, with any balance to be funded by Louth County Council. \u00a0The funding which was to be provided by my Department for the Narrow Water Bridge Project represented a significant commitment given the current financial circumstances and the fact that the project did not perform well in cost benefit analyses from a transport perspective.<\/p><p>  On 9th July Louth County Council released a statement indicating that the tenders received ranged from &euro;26m to &euro;40m plus VAT which was substantially above the allocated budget for the project and leaving the Council with a substantial funding shortfall. \u00a0The Council also stated that while they would try to see if the shortfall could be filled through any combination of additional funding and cost reductions the project had been put on hold.  Unfortunately, on the basis of the tender prices received, the cost of the project is well beyond that projected and bridging the shortfall is very difficult.  Furthermore the increased cost of the project now has significantly reduced the Benefit to Cost Ratio associated with this project. <\/p><p>  I understand that the Special EU Programmes Body has been in discussion with Louth County Council and its project partners in relation to the financial viability and deliverability of the scheme.  This is to be expected given the scale of the cost increase.\u00a0 It is a matter for the SEUPB, taking account of its responsibilities in relation to the allocation of INTERREG IVA funding, to assess the position and satisfy itself as to the deliverability of the project.\u00a0 As part of this process SEUPB sought clarifications and additional information from the project partners which it is now assessing.\u00a0 No formal proposal has been made by Louth County Council to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on increasing the Department&rsquo;s funding contribution.  Due to budget cut backs the Department for Transport, Tourism and Sport has had to curtail investment on major new \/ improvement projects in recent times to focus available funds on necessary maintenance and repair work and based on the current estimates.  As the Deputy will be aware, there is scheduled to be a further reduction of in excess of &euro;50m in the 2014 budget for Regional and Local Roads.  It is from this budget that any additional funds for the Narrow Water Bridge would have to come. <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding this, I have previously stated that I would be willing to consider helping to make up some of the shortfall but only in the context that there would be significant additional contributions from other parties including the Northern Ireland Executive.\u00a0 As I understand it to date such a package of funding has not been put together.  The SEUPB is currently in discussions with Louth County Council and its project partners in relation to the financial viability and deliverability of the scheme.  It should be noted that there are other transport related projects with a cross-border dimension that could be consider for any unallocated INTERREG funding including improvements to the North-South railway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300066#WRDD00800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Industry Issues","counter":709,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300066#WRDD00850"},{"type":"question","counter":710,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[41577\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300066#WRDD00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if it is the intention of Bord F&aacute;ilte to close down the tourist information office at a location (details supplied); if there has there been any consultation with local interest groups regarding the proposed closure; and his views on the potential negative effect of this closure and the potential negative impact of this on the area and upcoming Gathering events.","asker":"996","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":711,"content":"<p>The matter raised is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.\u00a0 I have referred the Deputy's Question to\u00a0F&aacute;ilte Ireland\u00a0for direct reply.

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making written representations to the then Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.

","asker":"981","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":770,"content":"<p>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), an operational unit of the Irish Naturalisation &amp;amp; Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department, is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision. There are currently 4,414 persons seeking international protection residing in 34 Direct Provision accommodation centres across 16 counties under contract to RIA.  Of these residents, approximately a third are children under the age of 18.<\/p><p>  I should firstly commend to the Deputy RIA's 2012 Annual Report available on its website - www.ria.gov.ie - which  includes greater detail than before on family make up in centres as well as additional information on facilities for children in each of the centres involved.<\/p><p> The Direct Provision system is unique and there is no direct comparison with other types of accommodation where children would reside, be they houses with gardens or apartment buildings. Some accommodation centres have more outdoor and indoor facilities than others.  However, any suggestions that children in these centres do not have opportunities for meaningful recreation activities are wide of the mark. Further details are available in the Report mentioned above. Of the current 34 asylum centres in RIA's portfolio, only 3 were specifically built for the sole purpose of accommodating asylum seekers, that is, they were 'purpose-built'.  All other centres must operate within the physical limitations of the premises' original use e.g. hotel, college dormitory, hostel, etc.  While all conform, at the very least, to minimum contractual and legislative standards, there are necessarily a range of facilities available in centres in the overall RIA portfolio, deriving from their original use.<\/p><p>  RIA and centre management work with local schools, community groups, sports clubs and NGO's to link children and families into community initiatives, sports and other activities to ensure access to the best available package of services. Children of asylum seekers can access recreational facilities available in the locality in which they are living.  Some Direct Provision Centres have on-site playgrounds.  Many centres will also facilitate NGO&rsquo;s who organise outings etc. Centres also have links with local community facilities which allow for free and discounted access to amenities outside of the accommodation centre.<\/p><p>  It is worth noting that asylum seeker children benefit from access to primary and secondary education on the same basis as Irish citizen children in the local community, and both schools and the Community Welfare Service are very supportive of those children in assisting with any associated costs in respect of equipment and transport. An exemption from fees for State Examinations is also available to asylum seekers who are holders of medical cards. Homework clubs and quiet spaces are provided in family centres to facilitate children doing their homework. <\/p><p>  On-site pre-school services are available in some of the larger direct provision centres. However, in all cases parents may opt to send their children to privately run pre-schools in the community. The Early Child Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme provides for free pre-school placements to all children, including children of asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300069#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":772,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300069#WRX00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":771,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300069#WRX00750"},{"type":"question","counter":772,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[41571\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300069#WRX00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive payment for their agri-environment options scheme 2; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The broad range of available task options allowed participants to choose those best suited to the business needs and particular characteristics of their beef enterprises.<\/p><p>  The person named did not qualify for payment because he failed to satisfactorily complete one of two selected tasks &ndash; the task related to the completion of a herd health plan in consultation with a veterinary practitioner. Participants who chose that task were required to join the Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) eradication programme, a condition of which was that herd owners had to submit tissue samples from all calves born on their holdings in 2012 to one of a number of designated laboratories. Task completion was verified by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) which maintains a database of laboratory results on behalf of Animal Health Ireland. Information received from ICBF indicated that the herd owner in question did not sample any animal born in 2012. While the calves born in 2012 were BVD-tested in January 2013, this does not meet the Task requirement for the 2012 Programme.<\/p><p>  It is the responsibility of participants and their facilitators to familiarise themselves with the Programme Terms and Conditions and with the consequences for breaches of the rules. In applying for the BTAP, farmers undertook to comply with the Terms and Conditions of the Programme and accepted that failure to abide by the rules could result in a loss of payment. It was determined following appeal that the individual concerned failed to fully comply with the BTAP Terms and Conditions and, accordingly, no payment is possible in this case.

Approximately 68,000 children availed of the provision in 2012.  In line with the Programme for Government, I succeeded in maintaining the universality of the free pre-school year, including securing an additional funding requirement of &euro;9.8m in 2012 to address increased demand due to an increase in births since 2009.<\/p><p>  There is an increasing body of Irish and International evidence which quantify the benefits of early year&rsquo;s interventions in terms of improving children&rsquo;s outcomes and in delivering significant economic and societal return to the state. I this context I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes as well as proving significantly beneficial to children with special needs. In addition a second pre-school year would represent &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 worth of free childcare to parents and likely generate 4,000-5,000 new positions, albeit mostly part-time. The benefits of introducing a second year were further referred to in the OECD reports on Ireland published last week.<\/p><p>  However, the introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, with the additional cost broadly in line with the cost of the current one year provision, which is &euro;175 million.  This funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is currently operating.  However I would hope that this proposal is one which Government could continue to work towards as our public finances recover.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, I am progressing a Pre-School Quality Agenda involving a range of actions in eight key areas, aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime.  I see this agenda as a key building block for any further extensive of universal childcare provision, including any proposal to introduce a second free pre-school year.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.\u00a0 The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for each local authority.  The application for INTERREG IVA funding by Louth County Council and its partners was for &euro;17.4m.\u00a0 This amount was approved by the SEUPB.\u00a0 Financial contributions were sought from my Department and the Northern Ireland Department of Finance &amp;amp; Personnel on the basis of this figure, with any balance to be funded by Louth County Council. \u00a0The funding which was to be provided by my Department for the Narrow Water Bridge Project represented a significant commitment given the current financial circumstances and the fact that the project did not perform well in cost benefit analyses from a transport perspective.<\/p><p>  On 9th July Louth County Council released a statement indicating that the tenders received ranged from &euro;26m to &euro;40m plus VAT which was substantially above the allocated budget for the project and leaving the Council with a substantial funding shortfall. \u00a0The Council also stated that while they would try to see if the shortfall could be filled through any combination of additional funding and cost reductions the project had been put on hold.  Unfortunately, on the basis of the tender prices received, the cost of the project is well beyond that projected and bridging the shortfall is very difficult.  Furthermore the increased cost of the project now has significantly reduced the Benefit to Cost Ratio associated with this project. <\/p><p>  I understand that the Special EU Programmes Body has been in discussion with Louth County Council and its project partners in relation to the financial viability and deliverability of the scheme.  This is to be expected given the scale of the cost increase.\u00a0 It is a matter for the SEUPB, taking account of its responsibilities in relation to the allocation of INTERREG IVA funding, to assess the position and satisfy itself as to the deliverability of the project.\u00a0 As part of this process SEUPB sought clarifications and additional information from the project partners which it is now assessing.\u00a0 No formal proposal has been made by Louth County Council to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on increasing the Department&rsquo;s funding contribution.  Due to budget cut backs the Department for Transport, Tourism and Sport has had to curtail investment on major new \/ improvement projects in recent times to focus available funds on necessary maintenance and repair work and based on the current estimates.  As the Deputy will be aware, there is scheduled to be a further reduction of in excess of &euro;50m in the 2014 budget for Regional and Local Roads.  It is from this budget that any additional funds for the Narrow Water Bridge would have to come. <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding this, I have previously stated that I would be willing to consider helping to make up some of the shortfall but only in the context that there would be significant additional contributions from other parties including the Northern Ireland Executive.\u00a0 As I understand it to date such a package of funding has not been put together.  The SEUPB is currently in discussions with Louth County Council and its project partners in relation to the financial viability and deliverability of the scheme.  It should be noted that there are other transport related projects with a cross-border dimension that could be consider for any unallocated INTERREG funding including improvements to the North-South railway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300075#WRDD00800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Industry Issues","counter":931,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300075#WRDD00850"},{"type":"question","counter":932,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[41577\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100300075#WRDD00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if it is the intention of Bord F&aacute;ilte to close down the tourist information office at a location (details supplied); if there has there been any consultation with local interest groups regarding the proposed closure; and his views on the potential negative effect of this closure and the potential negative impact of this on the area and upcoming Gathering events.","asker":"996","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":933,"content":"<p>The matter raised is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.\u00a0 I have referred the Deputy's Question to\u00a0F&aacute;ilte Ireland\u00a0for direct reply.
