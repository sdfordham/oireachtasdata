I welcome this opportunity to undertake legislative scrutiny of the Waste Reduction Bill in advance of Committee Stage.  There has been delay from the Second Stage debate to now, which I regret.  We are looking at different ways in which we could do the detailed analysis, but we have really benefited from the work of the legal advisory service and the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  The reference and research work they have done has been really helpful and useful.  We have just had a presentation from them in private session, and I look forward to engaging with everyone here today.  <\/p> <p>  A number of other developments in the interim since Second Stage have, to my mind, copperfastened the case for the Bill and for a certain speed and urgency in having it implemented.  I cite first of all, and I am not sure if the Chair has had a chance to read it yet, the strategy paper published by the European Commission, \"A European strategy for plastics in a circular economy\".  In my mind, it is a defining document in setting European policy for the next ten years.  On a regular basis, the document refers to the sort of provisions contained in our Bill and recommends them as part of fitting in within the new European packaging and circular economy directives that are coming our way.<\/p> <p>  It is an excellent overview for anyone who has an interest in the subject.  There are endless figures that could be plucked from it, but I refer to the analysis looking to the five best deposit and refund schemes, along the lines of what we are proposing, that indicates that they work.  In countries where they have such schemes, they get a 94% recycling rate for plastic bottles.  <\/p> <p>  Timely for our own work was the introduction by the Chinese government, as it promised last July via the World Trade Organisation, WTO, of an end to the importation of what it calls foreign garbage.  I imagine Europe and Ireland are some of the highest percentage exporters of our plastic recycling to China of what is an ill-segregated and often contaminated waste stream.  China is no longer accepting this and it means our whole approach will have to change because of the reality that we face.  I also present to the committee a very useful analysis by the UK government.  Only last week it presented a whole new plastic strategy which is in tune with the European approach, whatever else happens with Brexit.  I refer the committee to the work of the UK committee which, back in December, made a very clear recommendation to introduce in the UK economy, which is a very similar and has similar circumstances, the sort of measures included in our waste reduction scheme.  <\/p> <p>  I notice with interest IBEC and Repak looking to keep everything as it is and arguing that we are just great.  This Bill is important in terms of the deposit refund scheme and how we deal with disposal single use coffee cups and so on.  However, it should be part of a wider change of our entire Repak industry scheme as is also recommended by the UK parliamentary committee.  It recognises that it is completely outdated to have a single price in terms of that industry scheme.  A differentiated and designed scheme in the UK has to a much more sophisticated, advanced and appropriate marketing or management of the whole plastics waste stream.  I also refer to the Blue Planet series on the BBC just before Christmas, a remarkable television production.  At the core of it, David Attenborough had an absolute plea to policymakers, similar to our responsibility here, to start addressing marine pollution and plastic pollution in the environment.  This is again picked up by the European Union and others.  <\/p> <p>  I have two other points.<\/p><p>I will cite some evidence.  There was a group outside the Oireachtas today calling for action on this issue.  A group of people went to Dunmore Strand in Sligo yesterday and picked up what was on the beach.  They collected this bag of rubbish.  The same could be done on any beach in the country.  If one goes to any river, canal or street in Ireland and starts looking for waste, one is sure to find a similar amount, by volume if not by weight.  Everyone realises and sees that.  The public are fed up with the level of waste in their environment.  Irish people are very good at recycling and have taken to it in terms of the usage of green bins, but they are increasingly and rightfully suspicious that the authorities and those managing that system are not being honest with them in terms of where the waste is going and how it is managed and are not being ambitious or matching the public ambition for an end to the culture of the wasteful and throwaway use of plastic.  This Bill is an important step toward changing that culture.  More than anything else, it will change the minds of the public through going back to measures such as the deposit refund schemes that I saw implemented as a child and that will change the public connection to this issue, which is one of the biggest gains we could get from the Bill.  I look forward to the question and answer session in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#D00300","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516195800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ryan.

It is reasonable to say that all of us broadly share concerns about waste.  We are all aware of incidents of illegal dumping or fly-tipping locations in parts of rural Ireland or streets in our towns and cities.  Similarly, we are gravely concerned that over one million tonnes of food waste is disposed of each year in Ireland, around one third of which comes from households.  Every household in Ireland is responsible for one tonne of food waste and the cost per household varies between &euro;400 and &euro;1,000 per year.  We may have different views on which issue should be prioritised, as well as the best way to tackle those issues.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, has welcomed the Waste Reduction Bill introduced by Deputy Ryan, along with a number of other bills addressing this issue.  However, he asked for the Bill to be referred to the committee for detailed scrutiny because he has some concerns around the provisions.  I would like to take the opportunity to outline some of those concerns.  The Bill suggests two approaches for dealing with single use plastics: a ban on non-compostable plastic cups, glasses and tableware; and the introduction of a deposit and return scheme for drinks containers.  It should be noted by the committee that from a national and EU legislative perspective, plastic cups, glasses and drinks containers are packaging and consequently are subject to regulation by the European Union (Packaging) Regulations 2014 - SI 282\/2014 - and the EU Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive 94\/62\/EU.<\/p> <p>  Before dealing with the specifics of the Deputy&rsquo;s two proposals, it is useful to put them into Ireland's policy context.  Our national approach to date for dealing with waste packaging has been based around the extended producer responsibility, EPR, principle as set out in European legislation.  EPR seeks to ensure that the producer of a product bears a significant proportion of the cost of dealing with the waste management of the product they supply.  In Ireland, this has been done very effectively through a producer-funded compliance scheme operated by Repak.  Similar schemes operate in other waste streams such as waste electronic and electrical goods, batteries, farm plastics and, most recently, end-of-life vehicles and tyres.  In a review of EPR schemes carried out in 2014 for the Department, it was concluded that Ireland has achieved great success in recent years in recovering and recycling packaging waste and one of the key reasons for that success was the shared responsibility approach to packaging waste.  In its most recent bulletin on waste packaging statistics for Ireland, the EPA found that Ireland met and exceeded all EU targets for recovery and recycling.  Of the estimated almost 980,000 tonnes of packaging waste generated in 2015, some 91% was recovered and the majority of that was recycled.  <\/p> <p>  As regards the provision requiring the Minister to ban disposable, non-compostable plastic cups and glasses, the Minister has requested the committee to scrutinise this part of the Bill as it is his understanding that such a ban may be in contravention of Article 18 of the EU Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste, which states: &ldquo;Member States shall not impede the placing on the market of their territory of packaging which satisfies the provisions of this Directive.\"  In considering this proposal, the committee may be interested to know that France tried to introduce a ban similar to that proposed, which is supposed to come into effect in 2020.  The original idea when the law was adopted was to cover all single-use plastic cups, glasses and plates.  However, the Commission pointed out that in some circumstances those items were considered as packaging when sold full with food or drink.  This meant that the scope has been refined in France to all tableware falling out of the scope of the packaging and packaging waste directive.  In practice, the result is that the ban only concerns packages of empty plastic tableware that one would buy at the supermarket and became known as the \"picnic tax&rdquo;.  The Minister also had concerns that the proposed ban needed to be scrutinised to consider whether it is in breach of the free movement provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. <\/p> <p>  In recommending scrutiny of the legislation to the committee, the Minister suggested that a levy might be a better approach in light of these reasons.  The plastic bag levy has worked very well in terms of behavioural change and this might be a possible approach to limit the volume of single-use containers being used.  Environmental levies are not about revenue generation but are designed to encourage behavioural change and this might be an excellent way to deal with the issues raised.  The committee may like to consider that further.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned, packaging in Ireland is subject to a successful producer compliance scheme.  As part of the review of the scheme in 2014, a wider examination of issues was undertaken and consideration was given to the introduction of a bring-back scheme for waste.  The review report did not recommend its introduction because it concluded that to establish such a scheme was inappropriate in view of the operation of the existing packaging scheme.  On Second Stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il, the Minister indicated that although he was not convinced of the merits of introducing a deposit and return scheme in Ireland for the reasons outlined, he was not averse to considering a review, similar to that under way in Scotland.  The ongoing work in Scotland is of particular interest given that it currently operates a producer responsibility scheme.  A feasibility study based on practice overseas, previous relevant studies, and stakeholder consultations identified how a scheme could work in Scotland and the possible set-up and administration costs involved.   It gave a total estimated cost of a deposit and return scheme of &pound;78 million sterling or about &euro;88 million.  With such significant suggested costs, any scrutiny of this proposal would, at a minimum, need to consider how much the installation and running of a deposit and return scheme would cost; how it should operate; who should operate it; what steps would be needed to provide the necessary infrastructure; what the likely benefits would be; and how it could be made compatible with our existing initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matthew Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1516195800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting Mr. Collins.

As the committee is aware, the EPA&rsquo;s mission is to protect and improve our environment as a valuable asset for the people of Ireland and to protect against the harmful effects of radiation and pollution.  A substantial area of EPA activity in achieving that mission is the collection and statutory reporting of national waste statistics and the development and implementation of the national waste prevention programme.<\/p> <p>  In the context of national waste statistics, the Waste Reduction Bill proposes to target waste streams that are classified as packaging waste.  The EPA reports national statistics on this waste stream on an annual basis to the European Commission.  In 2015, over 980,000 tonnes of packaging waste was generated in Ireland, with packaging waste making up about one third of total municipal waste generated.  Typical packaging is made from materials such as plastic, cardboard, paper, glass, steel, aluminium, wood and textile.  Packaging made of composite, or two or more, materials is also frequently used, for example, in the coffee cups we take away from forecourts and the milk and juice cartons we use every day.  In 2015, of packaging waste materials, plastics comprised 29% of the total, 84% of which is recycled or recovered through waste incineration.  Paper and board made up 41% of packaging waste and 99% of that waste stream is recycled or recovered.  For further information, interested parties may refer to the EPA&rsquo;s recently redeveloped waste statistics platform on our website.<\/p> <p>  It is instructive to note that Ireland currently meets its statutory recycling targets for waste packaging but future targets envisaged in the EU&rsquo;s circular economy package will likely prove far more challenging.  For example, while Ireland recycled 34% of plastic packaging waste in 2015, exceeding the EU target of 22.5%, the current proposals in the circular economy package call for 55% of plastic packaging to be recycled or prepared for reuse by 2025.<\/p><p>While Ireland has made progress in improving recycling and recovery levels, further progress is needed to protect the environment, to meet the requirements of the incoming EU regulations and to facilitate the transition to a circular economy in Ireland.<\/p><p> As part of the process and commitment to continual improvement, the EPA is continually refining and developing national waste statistics in terms of how they are collected, assessed and published.  In that regard, we are currently completing a new, comprehensive waste characterisation project, one of whose objectives will include, for example, estimates of the quantity of disposable cups in municipal waste.  The report from that project will be issued during 2018, and it will provide more definitive statistics on that particular waste stream.  We will be very happy to share the outcome of the project during the year with the committee and other interested parties.<\/p><p> I would like to make some more observations, particularly on the Bill.  The EPA believes it is important that waste policy and legislation be guided by the waste hierarchy, which accords the highest priority to waste prevention, followed by preparing for reuse, recycling and energy recovery, with disposal being the least desirable option.  In this respect, Ireland's national waste prevention programme was established in 2004.  It is led by the EPA.  The EPA welcomes innovative measures that will increase resource-use efficiency and waste prevention, including actions to reduce the use of disposable items.  In addition, such measures as reduce the scourge of societal littering are also to be welcomed.  We recognise the range of options available.  We desire to be innovative and efficient in that regard.  For example, Ireland has pioneered economic initiatives that have changed consumer behaviour and prevented waste.  A very pertinent example is the plastic bag levy.  A range of extended producer-responsibility schemes have been quite successful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516195800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ryan.

We acknowledge that his Bill is well-intentioned, if somewhat vague on the expected outcomes.  We have conducted our own assessment of it.  On reflection, we are unable to support it.  We consider it unlikely that it would have got this far in its current form if an impact analysis had been carried out.  Regulatory impact assessments are required not only under the Government's approach to better regulation but also to comply with specific European Commission guidance on beverage packaging.  There appear to be unintended consequences arising from each of the Bill's two provisions that would be difficult to avoid.<br\/><br\/>As Deputy Eamon Ryan has acknowledged, the mandatory deposit return scheme<b><\/b>envisaged in the Bill would entail very large set-up and running costs.  Businesses cannot afford to absorb them so Irish shoppers would face rising prices.<br\/><br\/>There is also a risk of distorting competition between town-centre shops and their out-of-town counterparts.  Focusing briefly on the intended environmental benefits, our analysis suggests a prospect of reduced<i><\/i>overall packaging recycling.  Drink bottles and cans comprise only a small proportion of post-consumer plastic packaging waste but are by far the most valuable component.  Therefore, they are twice as likely to be recycled as plastic film.  By taking that valuable stuff out of the green bin, one is undermining the financial viability of Repak, which reduces its ability to encourage waste collectors, which are private sector firms, to accept the less valuable packaging materials.  With the closing of the Chinese market, it will be even more difficult to have further progress on the recycling of plastics.  We should not be doing anything that makes it any harder than it already is.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>We draw attention to a recent UNESCO-supported modelling study, ARIADNA.  I can provide a copy or references.  The study was carried out in Spain and considered the impact of introducing a mandatory deposit scheme alongside an established collection and recycling scheme.  It found that, in addition to being very costly, the duplication of effort could feasibly cause a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions. <br\/><br\/>Plastic bottles constitute less than 2% of street litter.  A deposit refund scheme might marginally reduce this already small amount, but possibly at the expense of an overall increase in the litter problem.  Some households will forgo the return of their deposits simply to avoid the inconvenience of driving to, and queuing at, a reverse vending machine.  One obvious way for enterprising individuals in the neighbourhood to make a bit of pocket money would be to go scavenging once the green bins are put out for collection.  The quickest and easiest way to do this would be to upend every bin along the street looking for bottles.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the proposed ban on disposable cups, glasses or plates that cannot be composted at home, we would question the Minister's powers under the 1996 Act.  Voluntary action by business should certainly be encouraged.  For example, a number of IBEC's members are actively researching, along with their suppliers, the use of safe but compostable hot drink cups.  We have had some dealings with CR&Eacute; on this very issue.  It is very interesting.<br\/><br\/>It is unclear whether there are any commercially available bioplastics that form the liner of a coffee cup that can be readily composted at home.  In any case, home composting does not count towards meeting EU recovery targets because they are not collected.  If the Exchequer were to provide money to local authorities for segregated waste collection in public places, it would certainly help improve recycling rates, but education and labelling would be needed to prevent cross-contamination.  <br\/><br\/>As for litter, it is a social problem.  A consumer who cannot be bothered to put soiled packing in the nearest waste bin will not bring it home in his or her pocket or bag to put in the brown bin. <br\/><br\/>Specifically on the idea of a levy, we do not believe a small levy of 15 cent or 20 cent will have anything like the effect of the highly successful plastic bag tax.  The keep cup I bought was on sale, reduced to &euro;15.  It is huge.  One cannot put it in one's pocket or bag after it has been used as it will leak.  If a levy were to be introduced, it would simply be seen as a regressive tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Neil Walker"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516195800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I am presenting today on behalf of Retail Ireland, the IBEC group that represents the retail sector, a sector that employs over 280,000 and contributes 23% of the State's total tax receipts.

Waste prevention and reduction programmes are a core objective of the sector's commitment to tackling environmental issues.  Our members invest many millions each year to ensure we protect and promote our environment.  An example of this commitment is the significant level of funding provided to the Repak organisation, which in turn funds the successful national kerbside collection of recyclable materials, or materials in the &ldquo;green bin&rdquo;.  This direct funding by retailers has helped Ireland not only to exceed EU recycling targets set for 2011 but also to have already exceeded some of the suggested targets for 2025. <\/p> <p>  Retail Ireland agrees with the recent independent report commissioned for the Government on this matter that states the cost of implementing a deposit-and-refund scheme would outweigh the benefits.

Repak represents 2,300 businesses and charges fees to its members in accordance with the amount and type of packaging they place on the market and reflects the recycling available in those areas.<\/p> <p>In the last 20 years, we have put &euro;400 million into the recycling of packaging in the country, bringing it from 15% to 91%.  We increased the amount of packaging recycled overall from 794,000 in 2016 to an expected 804,000 tonnes for 2017.<\/p> <p>  The money is spent on subsidising the green bin to the tune of &euro;64 per tonne.  It subsidises the 1,848 bottle bank sites and 118 civic amenity sites for the recycling and recovery of packaging from all those sites.  Repak also has an educational mandate and spends almost &euro;1 million on this annually.  I will not refer to targets, to which Dr. Tom Ryan already referred.  We support almost 5,000 jobs within the recycling industry.  We have been a significant contributor on behalf of industry since the regulations were introduced.<\/p> <p>  I will cover two key points.  We broadly support the Bill on what it endeavours to do regarding coffee cups.  It is important that a technical assessment is carried out to determine precisely what is needed in the area because there is considerable confusion between non-compostable and compostable coffee cups and the alternatives.  We recommend that the committee examines this.<\/p> <p>  We are fundamentally opposed to the deposit return scheme as it has been presented and think there are major issues associated with it.  It is important to note that we do not have a major beverage container problem but we have a major plastic recycling problem, particularly in regard to infrastructure in Ireland and Europe.  It is important that those two facts are not confused.  We do not believe that a deposit return scheme will have any noticeable impact on the recycling rate for beverage containers which make up about 4% of all packaging.  We think a deposit return scheme would be extremely difficult to operate.  It is important to carry out a cost benefit analysis on this.  To put a deposit return scheme in place on top of an existing recycling scheme such as Repak would lead to unnecessary duplication of collection infrastructure, duplication of transport, increase traffic pollution, wasteful use of energy and have a negative carbon impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amus Clancy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516195800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I am the managing director of PMCA economic consulting.  Along with Ms Gill Bevington, an independent packaging consultant based in the UK, I was commissioned to write a report examining the rationale and likely effects of the beverage container deposit scheme as proposed in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  I will highlight the main conclusions of the study.  On the rationale for the proposal, the way that economists would usually look at this is to ask if there is evidence of a market failure.  Our report reviews the literature and previous studies, including a 2004 OECD report which sums the situation up well.  It says that the rationale for a deposit scheme in a jurisdiction where there is already an extended producer responsibility scheme, EPR, such as Repak in Ireland, is just litter control.  That leads to the question of whether there is a litter problem in Ireland and specifically one of beverage containers.  Fortunately, there is extensive information for the position in Ireland provided by Tobin Consulting Engineers in tandem with local authorities.  We have looked at that evidence in detail and it shows two things.  The overall litter problem in Ireland is diminishing, as one would expect, because Ireland is a country with a green and clean environment and we have a vested interest in ensuring that.  Looking specifically at the beverage container litter, as others have noted already, about 3% of all litter in Ireland is beverage containers and when one adds drinks cartons it increases to 3.5%.  The trend over time is decreasing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pat McCloughan"},{"type":"speech","time":1516195800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I apologise but I must stop Dr. McCloughan.

After the Blue Planet series, as the Deputy noted earlier, and the Sky Ocean Rescue campaign, plastics is a huge issue on which we are now reaching the tipping point.  According to the Ellen MacArthur foundation, 8 million tonnes of plastic are leeching into our marine environment.  That is equivalent to a rubbish truck emptying a load of plastic into the ocean every minute.  By 2050 we will have more plastic in the ocean than fish.<br\/><br\/>We have received figures from Repak regarding how much of the plastic bottles and aluminium cans are being recycled.  We have calculated that around 2.5 million plastic bottles, 720,000 aluminium cans and 500,000 disposable coffee cups are either thrown away, incinerated or littered each day.  These are valuable resources that leak from the recycling scheme and there is value in these resources.  This is the result of our throwaway society, a far cry from where we were 20 years ago.  A takeaway coffee then would have been a thermos of hot instant coffee.  While we have improved our household recycling, and Repak has been instrumental in subsidising the collection of mixed dry recyclables, we are terrible on the go when we have takeaway containers, bottles, cans and single use items that are either thrown away or littered into the environment.  We cannot continue with the <i>status quo<\/i>and we need to take a step back to address where the problem occurs and how we can resolve it.  <br\/><br\/>First, we need to examine how we can prevent the waste.  This can be done through reuse.  Economic incentives such as the latte levy or the imposition of other economic instruments could be imposed on single use items to encourage people to bring their own bottles, coffee cups and containers.  This can be administered in the same way as we do with the plastic bags, when vendors file their VAT returns.  We could ban their sale but that would be a problem under article 18.<br\/><br\/>We need to capture as many valuable recyclables as we can.  Where people do not have a choice of bringing their own, for instance, when they buy a can of Coke or a bottle of beer, we call for a deposit refund scheme to be established.<\/p><p>Deposit refund schemes have been successful all around the world.  I grew up in the state of Michigan where we have had one in place since the 1970s and there is up to 98% net recovery, that is, recapture of drinks containers.  We do not turn the bins over.  We also have reverse vending machines in retail establishments.  When people go shopping, they bring their bottles and cans, put them in and get the chit to present when they buy items.  It is convenient and people do it when they go shopping.  I walked a mile on a beach in Michigan in October and found one aluminium can the whole way.  I have a ten minute walk from the DART to work where I found 50.  There is a litter problem.  Companies such as Wellman International in the North and Shabra in Monaghan support deposit retention schemes because the quality of plastics and aluminium collected in single streams is much higher than what one gets in dry recyclable material.  On extended consumer responsibility, as was stated earlier, Repak charges the same fee for PET bottles and non-recyclable plastics.  This needs to be reformed.<\/p><p> There is a cost to litter and drinks containers make up around 40% in volume of all litter.  It was said that it is 3% but that it is in items collected rather than in volume.  One cannot equate a plastic bottle with a cigarette butt.  It happens when people are on the go.  They are drinking and eating on the go.  They will not take that packaging home to be recycled.  It ends up in our bins and is not recycled.  Our litter is not recycled and it ends up being incinerated or as litter.<\/p><p> Economic incentives work.  We have seen this with the plastic bag levy and we call for economic incentives to work again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Mindy O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516195800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Our final witness is Dr. Dominic Hogg from Eunomia.

The company I work for carried out a study for the Government in 2009.  We were reviewing international policy and this was based primarily on a review of literature.  At the time we felt unable to call out definitively whether we should have a deposit scheme.  Since 2009, we have conducted many different studies, all of them in the public domain.  Interestingly, none of them was covered in the review undertaken by Repak.  This has been rather interesting.  We carried out those for DG Environment, Zero Waste Scotland, UK-based NGOs, Spanish NGOs and the Catalan waste administration.  We are currently working with the Maltese Government, which said it wants to implement a deposit scheme, and the Kosovan Government which wants to implement one.  Both Serbia and Latvia have announced they want to do it.  We worked in Connecticut to improve a Bill there.  Why are people doing this?  What are the benefits to the system?  Why would I recommend that the Irish Government do this if I had the chance again?<\/p> <p>  There are four key benefits to a deposit scheme.  The first relates to the increase in recycling one will get in an effective scheme for beverage containers.  That has consequences in terms of greenhouse gas benefits.  It is particularly important for plastic containers.  Increasingly, Ireland, along with other EU member states, is moving its residual waste management away from landfill into thermal processes.  From a climate change perspective, putting plastic into a thermal process is possibly the worst thing one can do, especially as the background intensity of the energy being generated is declining over time as one seeks to address climate change objectives.<\/p> <p>  The second point is that litter will be reduced.  The selective citation of the OECD 2004 study, which I know very well, having critically reviewed it for the OECD a few years later, states - I will quote it selectively - that deposit schemes will achieve an 80% reduction in litter of beverage containers.  The Repak study says that beverage containers only contribute 2.5% and that the figure may be decreasing.  What is acceptable here?  We have a major problem in terms of litter and the flow of that litter into the marine environment.  We know that this is a massive global problem.  We can sit here and imagine that 2.5% or whatever the figure is.  Imagine that the figure is decreasing, although I would dispute it.  Even on Ireland's own econometric analysis, the t-statistics in terms of the trend in its own analysis are not significant.  It is a random walk at the moment.  We do not even know that the percentage is actually reducing.  There is an issue here in terms of the litter.<\/p> <p>  The other point is the quality of the material.  Ireland is seeing the diminishing availability of its markets.  Repak's own data have shown the level of contamination of recycling material in Ireland.  We have exactly the same problem in the UK and I hope that this will serve as a wake-up call in the UK and Ireland.  We will not see a reduction in the recycling rate.  Ireland can count that in its packaging recycling figures and it would be incredibly sensible if it did that as it would be improving the likelihood of getting to the 55% recycling rate it will have to achieve for plastics under the new circular economy package for plastic packaging.  How will Ireland do it?  It is at 33% at the moment, or is it?  When measured against the actual recycling figures that it will have to report under the new package, I really doubt that it is.  Ireland will have to report what is sent for final recycling and it will see a hit on its existing reported rate.  That will go down and Ireland will have to do better.<\/p> <p>  What about the companies whose corporate social responsibility, CSR, objectives are to use more recycled content?  This is interesting.  We have had lots of discussions with them and some of them say that they do not like deposit refund schemes.  We asked them where they get their material to meet CSR objectives of recycled content of 25%, 50%, etc.?  Norway is the answer.  This is interesting because it has come out of the deposit scheme.  Everyone wants the quality of the material that those schemes provide.  Why are we seeing the brands starting to shift?  I understand why industry may initially feel a little threatened by this type of measure.  I particularly understand it in the case of Ireland and the UK because we both have schemes where the producer responsibility scheme does not cover the full costs of the packaging recycling service.  Therefore, we are in a uniquely interesting situation where the costs go up.  Norway, funnily enough, has very high recycling rates of aluminium and there is a zero fee for the aluminium packaging producers.  It is even thinking of giving a rebate because the value of the material more than offsets the costs of collecting it.<\/p> <p>  Therefore, there are a number of different reasons to do this.  I understand the objections.  I have seen them before.  However, we have seen brands becoming more aware.  They realise that having their bottles washed up on pristine beaches all over the world is not good PR.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dominic Hogg"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516195800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present.  I represent the owners of 3,500 local, independent and family-owned shops, convenience stores, forecourt stores and supermarkets.  RGDATA members are community-based retailers and we share the concerns the Bill seeks to address, namely, the need for waste reduction, increased recycling and reduction in single-use plastic packaging, food and beverage containers and utensils.  The independent retailers I represent have played a significant role to date in the dramatic increase in Ireland's packaging recycling rates, from 15% in 1997 to 90% in 2016.  Our members pay significant fees to Repak to fulfil their waste management and recycling objectives and to comply with Irish and EU regulations.  They also pay for their waste to be taken from the backdoor of the shop as well.<\/p> <p>  We are active in our communities.  We encourage reuse and recycling.  Many of our members host recycling centres on their sites and are proactively working in their stores to follow best practice guidelines.  They provide staff training on waste management, appoint green champions in their stores and adopt initiatives to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill and be more efficient in their use of natural resources.  Many of our members are also trialling initiatives to encourage their customers to use reusable beverage containers.<\/p><p>The shop owners I represent are genuine \"green grocers\" and take their responsibilities in this area very seriously.<\/p><p> In principle, our members welcome any initiative which helps to reduce waste and contributes to consumers and retailers having more sustainable choices concerning packaging of food products.  Accordingly, we are supportive of the general aims and objectives of the Bill.  However, we do have concerns about aspects of the Bill which we feel need to be addressed to ensure that any new legislative measures achieve their objectives without unintended consequences.  We also believe that any new proposals should be rigorously tested to ensure they will deliver value for money and that they will actually deliver on their objectives.<\/p><p> There are two elements to the Bill: the banning of non-compostable disposable beverage containers and tableware from 2020, and the introduction of deposit and return schemes for sealed beverage containers from July 2019.<\/p><p> On the first provision, banning non-compostable containers and tableware, it is important that consumers and retailers have ready access to affordable substitutes to the products currently being used typically for food to -go in shops and other outlets.  There are concerns within the trade at both the cost and availability of substitutable alternatives which will be available in the numbers likely to meet the anticipated demand.  Unlike the plastic bag levy, where people could bring their own bags to a shop and customers adapted very quickly to this, there are concerns within the sector that a significant proportion of consumers will be less inclined to bring their own coffee cups, containers or glasses to shops and will be reliant on the food or beverages continuing to be supplied in containers and with utensils from the shop.  Consequently it is important that there are cost-effective and substitutable alternatives available to both retailers and consumers before any ban on the existing implements is introduced.  Retailers have shown that once alternatives are available, they will fully embrace any initiative designed to reduce unnecessary or unsustainable waste.<\/p><p> On the bring-back scheme proposals in the Bill, we have serious reservations about how this scheme will operate and about the impact the new scheme will have on the existing producer compliance scheme to which retailers contribute.  As I have pointed out, our members pay between &euro;1,000 and &euro;3,500 to Repak depending on the size of their store and the amount of packaging they put on the market.  They already make a significant contribution to the cost of recycling in Ireland.  There is concern that a new deposit-and-return scheme would undermine the rationale and justification for supporting Repak by my members and would amount to a form of double compliance with regulatory obligations with significant extra costs for the smaller retailer.<\/p><p> There are also concerns that such a scheme would be very expensive to set up and that the design of the scheme would need to take account of the place of sale for particular beverage products.  For example, if a larger retailer is putting beverage containers out into the market place, then that retailer should have a commensurate responsibility to take back those products in proportion to the volumes put onto the market.  It would be an unfair system if smaller retailers found themselves inundated with beverage containers which had been purchased at larger outlets, in circumstances where they would need to install the relevant infrastructure to manage, store and fund a deposit-and-return scheme for products that they did not directly put on the market.  Obviously, we would like to see this rigorously tested before being applied because we are concerned about its impact, cost and effectiveness.<\/p><p> In general, we are very supportive of the principle of reducing packaging waste but believe that the design of any legislative measure needs to have due regard to the practical consequences of enactment on both consumers and retailers.  There is no point in bringing in new restrictions where easily substitutable alternatives are not available or which serve to undermine existing producer responsibility schemes which are working well.  Obviously, we do not place a disproportionate burden on smaller retailers by making them accountable for the sale practices and trading volumes of larger retailers.<\/p><p> In the interest of brevity, I will finish there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516195800,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their brevity on this.

On banning non-compostable disposable cups, glasses and tableware, I note Mr. Collins's comments on the incompatibility with the EU packaging and waste directive.

Is Dr. Tom Ryan diplomatically asking where all this new recycling will happen if the Bill proceeds?<\/p> <p>  My final questions for now are for Repak.  Presumably the deposit-and-return scheme, if introduced, would deal with more lucrative plastics.  How would that impact on household waste charges?

I recognise that they are all here with some degree of vested interest depending on whom they represent, but the one vested interest that does not get enough recognition is the environment.  It falls on us, as legislators, to try to craft and develop a series of legislative measures that force industry to respect and protect the environment.<\/p> <p>  The organisations before the committee today, particularly IBEC, represent industry and receive contributions from their companies annually.  They represent those companies that want to sell their products.  However, producers have not done enough to reduce the amount of packaging that ultimately ends up as waste.  While we can clap ourselves on the back and claim we have achieved phenomenal results in the amount of materials we recycle, the volume has grown dramatically.  It is possible to use statistics in whatever way one wants.<\/p> <p>  Like many other people I often walk the roads for enjoyment.  During the winter period the amount of material that is disposed of into the ditches along our roadways has increased significantly.  It is appalling how that has increased in recent times.  Clapping ourselves on the back and claiming we are recycling much more material does not resolve that.  We know from others about the amount of material that is disposed of into our waterways that ultimately damages aquatic life.  It shows up in rivers as well as along our beaches, and we know the impact it has on the international seas.  We need to take legislative measures to some extent almost disregarding what the industry is looking for because it will always push back and want to protect the producers.  Unless we put serious measures in place to protect the environment and speak up for the environment, we will not see the kind of change we need.<\/p> <p>  I have great regard for what Repak does, but it is an industry representative group.  Mr. Clancy is right in saying the recycling industry employs people and naturally enough there is a lobby group to protect the recycling industry as we know it.  However, we need to find legislative measures to reduce and eliminate to the greatest extent possible the amount of waste material that ends up being discarded.  I was struck by points made by one of the previous speakers that we are relatively good at recycling within the home, the commercial environment etc., but the disposable society we have and the amount of materials that are disposed of really is having a huge impact, and we need to look for other ways.<\/p> <p>  I note the rejection from the Department and I accept that there are European issues that need to be addressed.  Perhaps we would introduce some pilot projects that would not contravene the overall national policy, that would help to deal with what Ms Buckley says in terms of testing the viability of these initiatives, and which would get to inform policy into the future.

I listened intently to all the arguments and points raised.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in broadly supports Deputy Ryan's Bill.  The Deputy has listened to the debate.  We acknowledge the Bill would possibly have to be heavily amended, but that is a matter of tweaking.  Stepping back and looking at the broad picture - Deputy Dooley touched on this and was spot on - it is about the environment but also about people, and we are the people.  The key here is that we need to be healthy to survive, so we must take a realistic and common-sense approach to the matter.<\/p><p> I reject a few of the comments made.  Luckily enough, I remember as a young fellow getting the old 5p coin back for the glass bottle.  I certainly did not go scavenging through bins, but it was an adventure and an education for young kids at the time.  Our Saturday morning was getting up early and walking the country roads, hoping to God that, the farmer having cut the ditch, the bottle would not be broken because, if it was, we would not get the 5p.  The comments about scavenging are a bit of a myth.  Such schemes are a very cute and selective way to educate people.  It was mentioned a while ago that we must educate people about recycling.  Let us do so in a common-sense and rewardable way.<\/p><p> I acknowledge that legal dumping happens.  I am a little disappointed by the Minister's recent statement and the fact that money was being allocated to address the issues, therefore effectively admitting we are possibly heading towards more legal dumping.  The other side of that is that I acknowledge what Ms Mindy O'Brien said a while ago.  It is said that by 2050 the plastic in our seas will outweigh the fish.  That will be horrific if it comes to fruition.  The more worrying thing about it, and this goes back to my comments about the environment and people, is that we will be eating the product from the sea.  We should not be human recyclers in this.  I go back to my first point, which was that the environment and people both have to be healthy to survive.  As I said, I support the broad thrust of the Bill, although tabling amendments to it would be a common-sense approach.

I have probably not been here as long as some of the members present.  I have been here about two years now, since 2016, but I am seeing a pattern.  Everything cannot be done until it is being done.  We see a lot of resistance again today.  I respect entirely the mandates of the organisations that all the witnesses represent and the concerns they have.  They are well voiced and, I am sure, well founded, but where there is a will there is a way, and perhaps that is the attitude we need to have to these kinds of environmental challenges that face us more and more now.  When my party introduced the plastic bag levy, perhaps 15 years ago or more, such concerns were probably raised as well.  We got over them and got on with it.  I think the public is very accepting, possibly more so at times than the institutions and organisations, of what needs to be done, and they got on board with it in the case of the plastic bag levy.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Walker's comments about scavenging in bins caught my imagination as well.  They painted an apocalyptic scenario and reminded me of watching \"The Walking Dead\" on Netflix, a programme in which people upturn bins on the streets and scavenge, prowling by night trying to find what might be around.  I do not remember the 5p scheme in Ireland but I did live briefly in Amsterdam for one summer and was very familiar with what they had, which was a bottle deposit scheme, as opposed to a plastic deposit scheme.  Every morning I was nearly run down by bicycles whizzing past with crates full of empties sorted for collection and return.  It worked extremely well and was an incentive.  I did not see anyone scavenging or upturning bins but I did see plenty of people on their way to the various collection centres every day.<\/p> <p>  On that note, I think it was Mr. Burke who mentioned the possibility that the collection centres may be outside towns and may somehow contribute to the demise of our town centres, a risk with which we are all familiar.  However, I am not sure about that.  I appreciate the witnesses must cover all bases, but I think it may be a stretch to associate the demise of town centres with the location of collection centres.  We already have plenty of bring centres, and I have been involved in working to bring them into many places in my area.  I see the Bill in the same vein and consider that collection centres can be complementary to existing facilities.  They do not have to be brand new centres.<\/p> <p>  Regarding compostable cups and whether they can be composted at home, I think the brown bin could take a great many things.  I am familiar with one company, Zeus packaging, which has kindly given us samples.  They seem to work perfectly well and seem to be compostable.  I know they can go into the brown bin.  The technology and the products are already there.  It remains to support them in the marketplace.<\/p> <p>  It was very interesting to hear Dr. Dominic Hogg's comments and it is very illustrative for us to hear how other jurisdictions deal with this issue.  If I understood his contribution, various other jurisdictions have grappled with this and similar concerns and questions have been raised but they have been overcome satisfactorily.  It would be very interesting to pursue that a little further and see how exactly that was done.<\/p> <p>  Going back to what I said at the start, the point of Committee Stage, amendments and Report Stage is to thrash these things out.  It is really useful to have a discussion on this here, but rather than parking it and saying we cannot proceed because of these questions, I would say let us take the answers to these questions and put them into amendments and proceed on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#K00300","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1516195800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Does Ms Mindy O'Brien wish to come in at this point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#K00600","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516195800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Yes.

There are many bottles littering the countryside.<\/p> <p>  As for the environment, we have support outside the gates of the Houses today.  We have signatures from 8,000 people and we have received 3,000 signatures to support the deposit refund scheme in the past four days.  Thirty Tidy Towns groups have also lent their support for the Bill.  They are at the coalface of seeing all this pollution and litter on the ground.  They see plastic bottles and disposable cups.  They are there and they see it so they support the Bill.  I do not think they publicly support many pieces of legislation.<\/p> <p>  Compostable coffee cups are better than the existing coffee cups.  The problem I see is that if we do not have the good infrastructure to collect them, they will just go to be burnt like any other waste.  If one wants to have them composted, one must send them to a composting facility.  That means separate collection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Mindy O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1516195800,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I note that Mr. Walker indicated.

Looking at the plastic strategy published by the Commission yesterday and looking forward to the evolving policy demands of the circular economy, we are very keen to highlight the challenges of self-sufficiency of waste management, including recyclables, that lie ahead for Ireland.  It has been rehearsed here already that we are heavily reliant on export markets for treatment of recyclable waste.  We had suggested that efforts to enhance the management of those waste streams should include proactive planning for adequate future treatment capacity in the State.  We see that as a really important step, particularly as we transition to a circular economy.  The role that the EPA can play to support and assist in this is by providing evidence and by funding appropriate targeted research that might assist in that transition process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1516195800,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Does the Department wish to come in on either what members have raised or my own questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#K01000","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516195800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Yes.  To respond to the Chairman's questions, the plastic strategy was published yesterday, so we have not had a chance to consider it fully at this stage.  The focus of the Department's thinking now is really the legislative package that will be formally concluded probably this quarter by the European Union.  That will bring in the legally binding waste targets for Ireland.  They set the targets from 2025 to 2030 and 2035, and it is really in that context that we would very much focus on how Ireland will move from where we are today to delivering on those targets.<\/p><p> The best way to describe what we are thinking of is an attempt to put in place sufficient evidence so that we know what initiatives and measures we are proposing.  We would like to understand what the impact would be, determine the best structure for the Irish context and know the cost.  That will be an ongoing process now that we are approaching the conclusion of negotiations on waste targets.  Whether or not the Minister has done so, we have already raised the issue of tackling plastic and packaging with the Commission and the European Union at an official level.  Depending on direction of the Bulgarian presidency, the circular economy package it is due to be discussed by the Council of Ministers.  I have no doubt that the Minister will raise the issue at that point as well.  It will be the Minister's first chance to consider the publication of a plastics strategy, and hopefully also to sign off on the new targets for 2025 and 2035.<\/p><p> The real challenge for us as a Government Department is providing robust evidence on the impacts of the instruments we choose to use, whether they are economic or regulatory in nature.  Deputy Dooley asked if we would consider ways of testing the viability of options.  That is certainly something we would like to pursue.  In our work with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, we explore possible research projects examining how various measures might operate in an Irish context.  That would be a challenge, but it is something we would definitely be willing to look into. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#K01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matthew Collins","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516195800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I think it is important to understand that we are on the same page where the intent of the Bill is concerned.  We are supportive of the intention.  We feel that other ways to deliver the potential outcomes should be examined, and we should be trying to achieve measurable outcomes.  In that context, we are developing a plastics strategy.  We have been working on it for about two years.  There are a lot of complex stakeholders involved in this.  We believe that Ireland Inc. needs to implement a good strategy to deal with plastic, and recycling as a whole, in order to hit the 2025 targets.  We have a huge deficit in infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the comments from the EPA calling for this to be examined in a very serious way, because that is what is needed.  I am suggesting to the committee that this must be examined in a very holistic way, with the involvement of producers.  At the end of the day, they are the people placing the material on the market.  We work with them all the time to try to prevent and reduce use, reuse and do away with unnecessary packaging.  Unnecessary packaging is a blight on our landscape throughout the country.  It has to brought to an end, but they have to play a part.<\/p> <p>  The consumer has also been referred to.  In urban areas, green bins have up to 30% contamination.  That has an immediate impact on how much we can recycle.  The third area to consider is the development of technology.  It is still at a very low ebb, particularly for recyclers.  The technology still needs to be developed. The circular economy package refers to tackling this problem. <\/p> <p>  Last but not least, Ireland Inc. needs to have a coherent, cohesive strategy to deal with this.  The Chair asked a question about the bin itself.  Removing polyethylene terephthalate, PET, the plastic present in beverage bottles, from the recycling bin would remove a valuable commodity.  It is one of the varieties that is fairly stable worldwide.  In the main, it does not go to China but is recycled in Europe.  A much bigger problem is the amount of low-grade plastic on the market.  I recommend that the committee looks at this in its totality, and uses this as a core body of work.  The focus should not be on something that is a relatively small area in the overall context of plastic.  <\/p> <p>  Moreover, when we are making comparisons it is important to remember that the situation in Ireland, where there is an extended producer responsibility scheme for 20 years, differs from a jurisdiction where there is no scheme and deposit returns are to be introduced.  They all have different mechanisms for reaching the same level of return.  It is important to note that in the countries where there is a deposit return scheme there is very little difference in overall recycling rates.  A good example is Norway, which has had a lower overall recycling rate over 40 years than Ireland has today. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amus Clancy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516195800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>It is a pity that Deputy Dooley is not here.  He made two comments; that business is not doing enough and could be doing more; and that the problem is all about litter.  Businesses are doing more than we advertise, and we are very strongly committed to the polluter pays principle.  Ms O'Brien and I sit on the water forum, and she can testify that I have been quite outspoken on the polluter pays principle in the face of some people.  Let us not get into the water charge debate though.<br\/><br\/>We have supported the EPA's waste prevention programme with a 75% full-time executive since 2010.  We have provided consultation to hundreds of companies in effectively promoting resource efficiency.  Dozens of them have done resource efficiency assessments.  We are planning a big campaign on this issue in 2018.  That has now morphed into a circular economy role.  We have a circular economy executive which is virtually full time.  We will run member surveys to determine a baseline and another survey at the end of the year, to see if we can change hearts and minds.  The circular economy is a huge opportunity and we want to avail of it.  There could be first-mover advantages.  <br\/><br\/>Greenhouse gas is a minor issue in this regard.  If we could increase the recycling of high-density polyethylene, HDP, in bottles, we might get an extra 10,000 tonnes or 15,000 tonnes.  If it cost &euro;10 million or &euro;20 million a year to do it, that equates to &euro;1,000 per tonne.  An equivalent carbon tax would collapse the economy.  The greenhouse gas argument is not the major one.  Litter is a huge problem, but if the Government is to spend &euro;10 million or &euro;20 million a year in running costs, with set-up costs further to that, it raises the question of what could be done with that money that would be more effective in reducing litter?<br\/><br\/>Litter is a scourge.  I bloody hate it.  I would like to quote one of Deputy Lawless's Senatorial colleagues, Senator Catherine Ardagh.  She spoke in the Seanad on 10 May 2017, talking about Dublin City Council and litter, and we wholly agree with what she said.  The Senator remarked:<\/p><blockquote>&quot; In 2014, there were 18 litter wardens in Dublin city but we now only have 16.  There were 2,295 fines issued, 698 fines paid and 542 prosecutions for failure to pay on-the-spot fines, of which only 44 were successful.  It seems from the statistics that no one was prosecuted either summarily or on indictment.&quot;<\/blockquote> <p>That is not intended to be a criticism of Dublin City Council.  If the council had more money, it could employ more enforcement.  Why are there no council employees going up and down the beaches on Segways?  If we want to stop litter, we must deal with it as a litter problem.<br\/><br\/>I have one more point in response to Mr. Clancy's remarks about Norway.  Our packaging recycling rate is higher than Norway's.  Over all packaging, our rate is 68% while Norway's is 56%.  Some 57% of plastics in Norway are incinerated.  For Ireland to be more like Norway might please President Trump, but it would not necessarily make us any better at recycling.  In the area of plastic packaging, we are roughly on a par with Norway.  According to 2014 data, the most recent we have, Norway recycles 36.1% while Ireland's rate is about 0.5% lower than that.  As much as I love Norway, I am not sure it is a role model that is any better than what we currently do. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Neil Walker"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516195800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I will respond to Dr. Walker's comments first.  It is very welcome news that the industry bodies are developing a circular economy.  It is important to recognise the opportunity.  The company I worked for recently carried out a major review of waste statistics in environments where deposit schemes apply.  The initial executive summary was pretty stinging, because we felt we had been here so many times before.  Sadly it is very difficult to do comparative analysis on European waste data.  In a discussion of the effect of a deposit scheme on packaging statistics, another question arises.  How much of the total packaging consists of beverage containers?<\/p><p>The other issue is that when we are talking about total packaging and what the effect of a deposit scheme is, we have to ask how much of the total packaging is actually beverage containers.  It is not massive.  That is interesting, because when we talk about the collection system and the effect of it, we have to think about what is in the collection service.  All the paper, card, steel cans used for food, glass jars not used for beverages and plastic bottles not used for beverages are all still there, as well as all the other types of plastic.  The idea that some system is made redundant or that its economics are radically altered is not true.  We recently did some analysis of this for UK non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and the net effect in terms of local government service tends to be marginally positive because of the cost of the disposal on the residual side and the marginal benefit in terms of litter clean up costs.  The cost of dealing with litter is not completely eliminated, of course.  I believe that point is overplayed.<\/p><p> I agree with the point about carbon if it was only justified on that basis.  The interesting thing is that we are starting to learn more about what the externalities associated with the disamenity effects of litter are, and we are starting to understand what they are in a marine environment.  That opens up a whole new area of research.  Litter is never both on the land and in the sea at the same time.  The same piece of litter moves from one place to the other, and there is a large amount of research that needs to be carried out to help us understand that better and to understand those externalities.  We do know that the effect is big.  It is much more important than climate change externalities on a tonne-for-tonne basis.  If an impact assessment of this nature is carried out it is not the case that it stands or falls on the climate change impacts, in our view.  It has to take into account the disamenity and the impacts associated with litter, which is something we are getting a better handle on.  <\/p><p> On the question of the markets, Ireland, the UK, the United States and other countries are suddenly getting a wake-up call that we are not collecting stuff very well and are not getting quality material out.  We are trying to sell this to anyone who will take it, and some people are saying that they are fed up and do not want to take it anymore.  In the context of a circular economy, if there is 30% to 40% contamination of plastics - and that happens - what can be done if one is trying to develop a reprocessing industry here?  If 30% or 40% of every tonne that comes in has to be thrown away over &euro;100 per tonne will have to be spent to get rid of it.  If it is shipped to China what is the disposal cost?  It is peanuts.  The transport of the material to China is effectively funded.  If the quality of the material is better it is more likely to stay here and it is more likely that people will come forward with a view to actually using it and actually developing the markets in reprocessing here.  This is not a straightforward issue.  <\/p><p> On the final points about the costs of recycling, when we did the work back in 2009 we had some very interesting discussions with Repak.  I welcome Mr. Tony O'Sullivan, who is at the back of the room.  Our discussions concerned the cost of recycling in the Republic of Ireland.  We did not ask what Repak pays to support recycling.  That is a different matter.  We were focused on the cost.  We carried out a piece of analysis, because - and I do not wish to take this into a completely different area - we feel that Ireland has a relatively expensive system because it is based on the open market, which in our view leads to inefficiencies in the delivery of the service.  I know that is a hot topic here and it opens up other issues.  The fact is that we do not have a really good handle on the cost in all cases. <\/p><p> I will make a final point on small retailers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018011700002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dominic Hogg","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516195800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Yes.

There may be a cost.  A reverse vending machine does not have to be in place.  Manual take back could be done as well.  One could be paid to recompense for the take-back of that material.  The gut instinct of governments is often to exempt small and medium-sized enterprises.  Imagine there was a deposit scheme coming in and that every person who returns a container gets 15, 20 or 25 cent back.  Do retailers want them to come back to their stores?

That is predominately down to the collection process, but there are also many more apartments and there is less consciousness of the issue.<\/p><p>The cost associated with recycling means that there is a greater need for facilities to separate it.  Where there is significant contamination, the whole load collected can be lost.  If, for example, someone puts a container of oil into his or her recycling bin, it contaminates the whole truck and that is lost.  That is a continuous education issue that we are working with.  The industry is examining ways to track down and highlight this to consumers who are contaminating their recycling bins and we are very much in favour of that.<\/p><p> On the cost issue to which Mr. Hogg referred, we have started in the past three years to do detailed costings on the collection and recycling costs across all the different sectors and facilities.  There are nine main recycling facilities in the country.  We have a breakdown of those costs and we are breaking it down to material type in particular as well to better inform us.

It is not as if we are shooting for the moon.  There are numerous international examples of deposit and refund schemes.<\/p> <p>  One of the key questions the Department asks relates to what might be the cost.  I am not sure Mr. Hogg has done the mathematics in breaking down the cost of a deposit and refund scheme but let us say there was a 10, 15 or 20 cent deposit refund what would be the cost per bottle for operating the scheme?  Has Mr. Hogg done any work on that?  He said earlier that he is sceptical of the statistics for recycling rates here.  The recycling rates are uncertain.  I think that is why the public is also suspicious about this area.  We are not clear about what is going where.<\/p> <p>  Where does Mr. Hogg think best practice exists?  Where would we look for example?  My understanding is that the Scottish Government has agreed to commit and introduce this scheme.  It is not doing it on a trial basis but across Scotland and I understand the UK Government is about to do the same.  It will not do it on a trial basis but across the UK.

The fees to the producers, the beverage companies and the importers would have to make up the gap between the running of the whole system and on the plus side, income, the money coming from deposits that people did not claim and the revenue from the sale of the materials.  If there is a low level of return the value of the unclaimed deposits can fund the whole system.  We would like to see something in legislation that would push for high return rates from the scheme.

The second factor is that they were introduced before kerbside recycling was undertaken.  In 2008 my colleague, Gill Bevington, authored a report for Repak looking at the same issues of whether a deposit scheme would be suitable for Ireland and she concluded that it would not, because of the same set of factors.  One has to ask what has changed in Ireland in the meantime.  Has there been any significant change?  What has changed is that there has been a growth in the kerbside and household sector, albeit with contamination issues.  Tonnage has been growing successfully in these areas and the cost of recycling has also improved.<\/p> <p>  The cross-Border situation is a big issue and the CSO undertook a module in 2010 on cross-Border shopping.

They spend hundreds of euro, more than people from Donegal or Sligo, and this raises the question of dumping and how we handle the additional items.

We are engaged in a study on what we would do if we were to design a recycling system anew today.  The technology has moved on in terms of quality, particularly in the case of the extraction of plastics from mixed waste sorting.  In the Norwegian example, they decided that having a deposit scheme for high-value containers meant they would not have to bother with the rest, which they would extract at the back end before the material went into an incinerator.

According to the plastics strategy, the Commission will propose new rules on waste management.  These include clearer obligations for national authorities to set up separate collection and targets to encourage investment in recycling capacity and avoid infrastructural over-capacity for processing mixed waste, for example, incineration.  I could go through its circular economy package notes throughout the day.  The Commission could not be clearer that this is not the way we should be going.<\/p> <p>  Our Bill is political in the sense that this really is a political choice because it asks that we avail of the mechanisms within the Waste Management Act 1996.  It is really a political question in terms of whether we want to join the myriad countries that are looking at this issue in terms of both.  Ms O'Brien is right.  We concentrated on the deposit refund scheme and bottles today but there is the issue around the use of disposable throwaway plastic coffee cups, cutlery and other items.  We must address this across the board for climate reasons, environmental protection reasons and circular economy development reasons and to simply meet EU rules in terms of how we are going to get from 35% to 55%.  If someone has a better idea and if some other party will say that it has another mechanism which will help us do that, I would love to hear it and I would love to read cited international papers - such as the studies carried out by Eunomia and others - which fit in with what the Commission is saying.<\/p> <p>  What we are suggesting in this Bill is absolutely in tune with where European regulation is going and is also in tune with ensuring due regard is had and with the precautionary principle in terms of protecting our marine environment in particular but also our land environment.

We recognise that we want to do it in step with other international developments, particularly in Scotland and the rest of the UK because they are similar jurisdictions, and France.  Our nearest neighbours are legislating in this direction.  We are not saying it must be done tomorrow but I believe we should go to Committee Stage.  What this Bill does is signal intent and the desire to use the Waste Management Act 1996 and indeed work with Repak and other industry people here, particularly small retailers who will be at the centre of our concern in terms of getting it right going back to those days where when we went back with a bottle, it was to a small retailer.  This could be an opportunity to turn around the nature of the retailer-customer relationship.  It is not just about this bottle and the cups but this is an important part of the overall picture because it involves the public.  It is something we can all understand.  If we get the public behind us on that, it is so much easier to understand all the other different strands involved and the various changes we will have to make.  We have done good work in the past 20 years but now is the time to jump up to a much more extensive recycling circular economy system.

As the Chairman said, I am joined from the Department of Health by Ms Geraldine Luddy, head of the bioethics unit, and Mr. Paul Ivory, assistant principal at the bioethics unit, as well as some colleagues from the HSE: to my left is Mr. Liam Woods, national director for acute operations; Dr. Colm Henry, consultant geriatrician at the Mercy University Hospital, Cork, and national clinical adviser and group lead on acute hospitals; Dr. Jerome Coffey, consultant radiation oncologist at the St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Network and national director of the national cancer control programme; and Dr. Peter McKenna, former master of the Rotunda Hospital and clinical director of the national women and infants health programme.  I hope to provide the Chairman and these hearings with some background to the Government decision to approve the general scheme of the assisted human reproduction Bill 2017 and to outline briefly the main provisions of the scheme.<\/p> <p>  It is estimated, as I am sure the committee knows, that one in six couples worldwide experiences infertility at some point in their lives.  The rate of infertility and subfertility is increasing due to a range of both social and lifestyle factors - for example, due to delayed decisions surrounding parenthood to support the pursuit of careers and to ensure financial security - as well as higher rates of obesity and sexually transmitted infections, particularly chlamydia, which can impact a person's reproductive health and fertility.  From the Irish point of view, based on information we have from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the number of cycles for assisted human reproduction, AHR, procedures conducted in fertility clinics in Ireland is increasing.  For example, the provision of treatment has risen from 7,589 cycles in 2009 to almost 9,000 in 2016.<\/p> <p>  We understand the impact that the issues of infertility and subfertility can have at an individual level.  The ability to conceive a child naturally is a normal human expectation, and a diagnosis of infertility can be a source of severe emotional and psychological distress, discomfort and financial hardship.  These decisions and the impact they can have at a personal level have been brought to the fore in our engagements with various stakeholders on behalf of people with infertility and in the context of developing the general scheme as well as through a number of representations made to us in the Department, in particular to the Minister on behalf of citizens affected by infertility.<\/p><p>As the committee will be aware, work is ongoing in the Department on proposals for a potential public funding model for AHR treatments, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.  The development of the general scheme and the work relating to a possible public funding model for assisted human reproduction, AHR, has generated debate.  While we endeavour to progress these important policy and regulatory issues we are conscious of the direct impact this work will have on individuals.  For example, people listening to these discussions who are currently undergoing AHR treatment, or who may be considering such treatment, may adjust or defer their plans in anticipation of impending policy changes arising from this work.  As such, we understand that we have a responsibility to provide a realistic and reasonable appraisal of what the Department is endeavouring to do in this space and the timelines involved.<br\/><br\/>The development of reproductive technologies means that children can be created outside of what may be seen as the normal male-female sexual relationship.  Sperm and eggs can now be manipulated and embryos created in laboratories.  While reproductive medicine is one of the most innovative and rapidly developing areas of medicine it also raises challenges from ethical and legal perspectives.  Advances in AHR technologies have increased the number of treatment options available to those affected by infertility and subfertility, for example <i>in vitro<\/i>fertilisation; the donation of gametes, either sperm or eggs, from third party donors; and surrogacy to name just a few.  The categories of people wishing to access such treatments have also expanded to include heterosexual couples, same-sex couples, single people and people wishing to avoid serious hereditary diseases.  Therefore, from a medical and social perspective, infertility and subfertility represent important issues that require a considered health service response and regulation. <br\/><br\/>As we know, we currently have no specific legislation in Ireland governing AHR.  There is limited existing regulation relating to the use of gametes and embryos.  In 2006 the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, was designated as the competent authority for SI 158 of 2006, the quality and safety of human tissues and cells regulations, which govern the quality and safety standards in the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells, including gametes and embryos.  These regulations empower the HPRA to authorise and monitor tissue establishments, which include some of the existing fertility clinics.<br\/><br\/>Of further relevance, the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, the CFR Act, reforms and updates family law to address the needs of children living in diverse family types.  Parts 2 and 3 of that Act are the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  These parts of the CFR Act, when commenced, will regulate aspects of AHR involving donation of gametes and embryos and are specifically concerned with the parentage rules for children born through donor-assisted human reproduction procedures, obligations applying to facilities providing such procedures and the establishment of a national donor-conceived person register.  We in the Department of Health are preparing draft regulations to facilitate the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the CFR Act 2015, and are working to resolve some final technical issues in order to ensure that the processes associated with these Parts of the Act can be commenced.<br\/><br\/>While the number of people accessing AHR treatments and services in Ireland is increasing, the provision of these services remains largely unregulated, as I have said.  This means that individuals are availing of often complex and sometimes risky procedures in a legal vacuum.  Legislation is therefore required in order to assist people to have children safely, to clarify the legal position of children born from these practices, and to ensure research and new reproductive technologies are carried out within a prescribed ethical framework.<br\/><br\/>While the vast majority of AHR treatments and services currently available in Ireland are provided through private AHR clinics, there is a limited specialist AHR service available through the HSE, which provides funding for fertility preservation for cancer patients whose treatment is likely to impact on their future fertility.  The Department intends to work with representatives from the HSE to ensure that there is a coherent approach to the development of the AHR legislation, which is consistent with the existing publicly available cryopreservation service.  In order to support the commencement of this legislation once it is enacted, the Department will work during the course of 2018 in parallel with the HSE to develop a model of care for infertility to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible services through the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.  To provide for that we intend to establish an implementation committee to ensure that the drafting of the legislation, the preparation of the above service arrangements and the development of any specific eligibility arrangements that we might approve can all proceed in line with each other to allow for the timely commencement of the legislation. <br\/><br\/>The scheme we are discussing this morning represents the first time a comprehensive package of measures has been drafted for AHR that includes aspects of research.  The introduction of legislation in this area is a priority for the Minister and affirms the commitment contained in A Programme for a Partnership Government relating to the regulation of AHR and surrogacy.  <br\/><br\/>Moving on to the detail of the scheme, we adopted three principles to guide our work in this area, namely, the welfare of any children born through assisted human reproduction technologies, which is the most important, safeguarding the health of women undergoing those procedures and the promotion of best clinical practice.  Children born through AHR may be vulnerable as they obviously lack any control over the circumstances of their birth.  For this reason, and in recognition of Article 42A of the Constitution, as well as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the welfare and best interests of children born through AHR was a key consideration.  Equally, the well-being of women involved in these procedures also requires special attention, as women are the main recipients of AHR interventions due to their biological role in pregnancy and childbirth.  Finally, the promotion of best clinical practice should be standard in any recommendation put forward by the Government and, in the case of AHR, it has also been seen that adhering to this principle can positively impact the safety and well-being of women, for example, in the context of multiple pregnancies.<br\/><br\/>Officials in the Department are engaging with the Office of the Attorney General in respect of the process of drafting this legislation.  Given the comprehensive scope of the legislation and the ethical, legal and social issues that arise with AHR practices, I anticipate that, as we go along, there will be areas of the scheme that will require further consideration and refinement, as is usual in the drafting of legislation. <br\/><br\/>The general scheme is comprised of nine parts.  Part 1 deals with standard provisions relating to the legislation such as interpretation and commencement matters.  Part 2 outlines the general principles that apply in the context of all AHR treatments and procedures, including requirements regarding informed consent and counselling, conditions regarding embryo transfer, and considerations involving the welfare of the child.  Part 3 outlines the conditions and restrictions relating to the donation of gametes and embryos for use in AHR treatment by other people, for use in research or both.  It also outlines specific requirements relating to people wishing to access AHR treatment involving donated material.  This part includes specific requirements relating to informed consent and counselling, age restrictions for donors, the prohibition of the donation of embryos other than supernumerary embryos, limits on the use of donated material, the prohibition of commercial gamete and embryo donation and the permitted storage periods that should apply for any gametes and embryos in storage.<br\/><br\/>Part 4 of the scheme deals with posthumous assisted reproduction, PAR, which involves the use of frozen gametes or embryos from a deceased person to achieve a pregnancy.  These provisions enable a surviving female partner to continue a parental project after the death of her partner, provided specific conditions are fulfilled.  For example, the relevant parties must have received counselling and given their informed consent and a period of time, in this case one year, for grieving has to have elapsed since the death of that relevant partner.  The scheme states that the deceased person would be recognised as a parent of any child born following PAR provided that child is born within 36 months of that person's death.<br\/><br\/>Part 5 provides for pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, PGD; sex selection for medical purposes; and human leucocyte antigen, HLA, matching in the context of AHR treatment, provided certain eligibility or qualifying criteria are fulfilled.  For example, both PGD and sex selection would only be permitted where there is a significant risk of a child being born with a serious genetic disease.  The AHR regulatory authority established by this legislation will be responsible for maintaining a list of genetic diseases for which PGD and sex selection would be permitted.  In respect of HLA matching, the regulatory authority will also maintain a further list of eligible diseases but specific approval from the regulatory authority will be required on a case-by-case basis and will be subject to the consideration of any particular criteria in respect of those cases.<br\/><br\/>Part 6 outlines the specific conditions under which surrogacy will be permitted in Ireland.  The term surrogacy relates to a situation whereby one woman, that is, the surrogate, agrees to become pregnant, carry and deliver a child on behalf of another individual or couple, that is, the intending parent or parents.  This includes a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the regulatory authority.  This pre-authorisation process will help to safeguard the welfare of the parties involved in the surrogacy agreement, in particular that of any child who may potentially be born as a result of that agreement, as well as that of the surrogate involved.  The scheme sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate - and her husband, if applicable -  to the intending parent or parents.<\/p><p>Commercial surrogacy raises a number of concerns relating to the welfare and commodification of the children involved as well as potential risks of coercion and exploitation of financially vulnerable women to act as surrogates.  In light of this, the general scheme explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy being conducted in Ireland.<\/p><p> Part 7 stipulates the conditions under which research involving embryos, embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells may be permitted, subject to obtaining a licence from the regulatory authority.  This part prohibits the creation of embryos specifically for research purposes and also prohibits certain practices that may be associated with embryo and stem cell research, for example, reproductive cloning.<\/p><p> Part 8 provides for the establishment of the AHR regulatory authority and outlines its functions in terms of the oversight and regulation of compliance with the legislation.  This includes the issuing of licences to AHR treatment providers and researchers.  As previously mentioned, the AHR regulatory authority will be essential to the successful implementation of the legislation given the complexity of the issues involved in regulating this area and the rapidly evolving nature of AHR and research technologies.  A key function of the regulatory authority will be the collection of statistical information from AHR providers, beyond that which is currently available, on all AHR activities and their outcomes, such as the number of children born from such procedures.  The collection of this detailed information would enable the regulatory authority to monitor and assess the safety and effectiveness of AHR practices and would also help to inform future policy-making in this area.<\/p><p> Part 9 outlines the various offences that apply in respect of contravening specific heads within the scheme and stipulates the level of penalty that could apply in each instance.<\/p><p> I reiterate that the provisions outlined within the scheme and, in particular, the establishment of a dedicated AHR regulatory authority will ensure that AHR practices and research in related areas will be conducted in a more consistent and standardised way and with the necessary oversight.  As I outlined earlier, the commencement of the legislation is one element of the development of a model of care for infertility, which will ultimately aim to embed the provision of safe, effective and accessible AHR treatments and services into the broader range of obstetric and gynaecological services available through the public health service.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for undertaking this review of the general scheme.

I have provided more detailed questions to which the witnesses might be able to reply in writing.  They are fairly general and any replies would be for my own information.<\/p> <p>  I have a concern that the prohibition on sex selection other than where there might be a significant risk to the child being born one sex or the other may be hijacked by people seeking to inject a bit of misinformation into the system.  There are people who are opposed to assisted human reproduction.  I will not name them but I am sure the witnesses have an idea of whom I am speaking.  It needs to be made crystal clear - and it is not possible to say it enough - that the purpose of this will not be to engage in some form of gender-based selection and, indeed, that it will not happen save in very discrete and distinct circumstances.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that if possible.<\/p> <p>  Head 36 relates to surrogacy.  I note the potential for forced surrogacy.  In that scenario, we have all heard stories in the media and I have some experience of hearing first hand about vulnerable migrant women who may have been forced into surrogacy.  Certainly, that has been suggested.  Where this happens and it becomes apparent halfway through the pregnancy, there is very little that can be done.  The pregnancy will proceed.  However, it is a very severe violation of a woman's human rights.  Indeed, it does the poor child no service either.  Can the Department outline what legal provisions can be made and should be to dissuade people from doing that and also to impose punitive sanctions?  What scope is there for including those to ensure that this will not happen?<\/p> <p>  I raise the these points because there are people who are opposed to the legislation who will settle on any small aspect of it to criticise the whole.  I have had people approach me and I know there are individuals watching who are desperate for the legislation to go through.  We all want to see it go through and we want to see it happen quickly and properly.  If we are to answer the detractors in advance, we need to be able to deal with issues like forced surrogacy and sex selection.

I welcome them to the meeting.  It is just information that I am looking for really in the context of the point that, with regard to treatment, there were approximately 9,000 cycles in 2016.  That was within Ireland.  There are also huge numbers of people who travel abroad for treatment.  Do we have any idea of the figure in that regard?  Has any research been done on that?  No matter what regulation we bring in, people will still have the option of travelling abroad.  It is a big issue now due to the costs people are incurring here.<\/p> <p>  The next issue I want to highlight relates to the cost of medication.  Has an analysis been carried out on the cost of medication here relative to the cost in other EU jurisdictions?  My understanding is that it is extremely expensive and that the cost here is far above that which obtains in other countries.  In introducing the scheme, do we not need to watch carefully to ensure we are not suddenly backed into a corner by pharmaceutical companies which see it as another opportunity to be on the winning side?  It is one of the concerns we need to watch.  As such, I wonder if an analysis has been carried out in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018011700002#E00500","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1516179600,"counter":117,"content":"<p>We are very happy to revert to Deputy O'Reilly in writing to provide absolute clarity on her written questions.

I would like some clarification on this matter as I am aware of a number cases, internationally, which have been very hard fought in this area.<\/p> <p>  I assume birth certificates will eventually be as normal, with no reference to the methodology, and I assume they will just show the parents.  Might they also show details of a surrogacy?  I do not want to go into the question on sex selection as it has already been discussed, other than to emphasise the importance of ensuring there is absolute clarity as to what the purpose of the exercise is.  We recognise that, in certain cases, a gene might be carried in one line but not in another and this might be of huge importance to a potential parent in avoiding an inherited difficulty that they might have cause to regret for the rest of their lives.  We need to ensure, however, from an ethical viewpoint that everything is done as it should be done.<\/p> <p>  There are provisions for relevant parties to have received counselling and to have given their informed consent, and there is a requirement for a one-year grieving period to have elapsed since the partner's death.  Can the witnesses elaborate on that and give the committee an indication of the thinking behind these provisions?  We have an idea of what they are but it is important to explain the detail so that participants and the general public may be reassured.<\/p> <p>  There were a number of cases, though not in this country, where relationships had broken up and legal cases were taken in which consent was sought after the break-up.  Can the witnesses clarify how we anticipate dealing with such situations?  These things do happen and, under Murphy's law, if it can happen it will happen.<\/p><p>That is not a reference to my colleague.  Suffice it to say it would be very important to have reassurance in this area.  With all due deference to my legal colleague, who has just left, when there are legal possibilities, they could well become legal realities and major difficulties in what we are trying to do.  We have referred to storage issues and further counselling.  Will the witnesses give some further clarification on age restrictions on donors, which is important?  It will be a matter for query.  The age restriction could be a major issue in some cases.  I have many other questions but we might get some answers to those for a start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018011700002#F01000","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516179600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for coming before us.

The meeting has been convened to resume Committee Stage of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017.  I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and his officials to the meeting.  When we last addressed the legislation, we were considering amendment No. 8 under section 2.  The amendment is grouped with amendments Nos. 84, 85, 162 to 172, inclusive, 175 to 179, inclusive and 181 to 183, inclusive.  While we had commenced to address the grouping, it is appropriate to reopen the opportunity to discuss amendment No. 8 in the names of Deputies Jim O'Callaghan and Jack Chambers.  Accordingly, I invite either Deputy to outline once again the purpose of their proposed amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#A00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 8 is linked with a number of others, which I have just looked at.  A lot of them are in my name and some are in the name of Deputy Wallace.  The purpose of amendment No. 8 and many of the others in the grouping is to simplify the process set out by the Minister in the Bill.  From the last occasion, it may be recalled that one of the arguments I made was that a very complicated statutory scheme has been set out.  The purpose of amendment No. 8 is to try to simplify it.  The reason I say it is complicated is that under the Bill there are a number of committees.  There is a procedures committee and another section refers to a \"relevant committee\".  The procedures committee is supposed to set out the procedures for the operation of judicial advisory board.  The purpose of the amendment is to simplify matters to make it one board.  It is not a body which is appointing hundreds of people each year.  The Minister may have more accurate figures, but I think it will be ten to 15 appointments to the Judiciary each year.  What is the point of having a procedures committee and some other one?  I know there is a dispute about who should be on the body, but let us just put together a body which makes decisions as to who should be recommended for judicial appointment.<\/p><p>It is for that reason, in amendment No. 8, we seek to delete the definition of the Procedures Committee in section 2, which states the &quot;&quot;Procedures Committee&quot; has the meaning assigned to it by <i>section 19(1)<\/i>.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 84 is in the name of Deputy Wallace and amendment No. 85 is in the names of Deputies Sean Sherlock and Mick Wallace.  One can see that after amendment No. 85 that the proposal put forward by myself and Deputy Jack Chambers is that section 19 should be deleted.  Section 19, on page 17, deals with the &quot;Procedures Committee and other committees of Commission&quot;.  Again, the purpose of our proposal is to simplify the matter.<br\/><br\/>I might as well deal with the other amendments in this group now rather than have to talk about them later.  Amendment No. 162, in section 53, states: &quot;In page 36 to delete lines 2 to 5.&quot;  Again, the amendment seeks to remove references to the Procedures Committee and to remove, in particular, the first part of section 53(1) where the Procedures Committee can &quot;consult with the President of each court&quot;.  If one is going to get rid of the Procedures Committee then there is obviously no need to do that.<br\/><br\/>Amendments Nos. 163 to 165, inclusive, relate to section 53.  They also seek to delete references to the Procedures Committee.<br\/><br\/>In terms of Section 55, Deputy Jack Chambers and I have proposed amendments Nos. 166 to 172, inclusive.  Again, they deal with the preparation of statements under the Act and the role of the Procedures Committee.  <br\/><br\/>Amendments Nos. 175 to 179, inclusive, seek to get rid of references to the Procedures Committee.  Again, what will be mentioned simply is that it will be the Commission as opposed to the Procedures Committee.  <br\/><br\/>Members will note that Deputy Jack Chambers and I oppose section 56 in its entirety.  We oppose it because we do not think there is a necessity to include section 56 if it is the case that the Procedures Committee will be removed.  <br\/><br\/>Finally, amendments Nos. 181 to 183, inclusive, are the last amendments in my name and that of Deputy Jack Chambers in this group of amendments and they concern section 58.  Again, they refer to the review by the Procedures Committee and recommendations.  We have proposed that we should, in amendments Nos. 181 to 183, inclusive, remove the reference to the Procedures Committee and substitute the word &quot;Commission&quot;.<br\/><br\/>We have tabled many amendments but they all seek to do the same thing - remove references to the Procedures Committee and just have the Commission perform the function.  Our rationale is that it is complicated to have a separate committee within a commission, which is already doing a fairly net short job.  That is my overview of the grouped amendments.  I know the group of amendments contained a number of amendments tabled by Deputy Wallace but I think they are on the same topic and seek to have the same effect.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#A00500","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Before I ask the Minister to comment, does Deputy Wallace wish to contribute at this point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#B00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>No.  Let the Minister in now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#B00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Before I bring him in, I noted Deputy O'Callaghan's reference to the complexity of the grouping.

I am not sure the extent to which we need to go back over, in its entirety, the debate on the last occasion that took place on group three.  Of course, I accept the need for a refresher, which we have had from Deputy O'Callaghan.<\/p> <p>  On the last occasion, just looking at the transcript, I had given my response to the various amendments in group three, which seek to remove from the Bill references to the Procedures Committee, the creation of the Procedures Committee, the role of the Procedures Committee, and the function of the Procedures Committee.  I had indicated that I was not minded to accept the amendments because I do not accept the Opposition's view, or the proposers of the amendments' view, that the structure envisaged under the Bill is overly complicated and overly cumbersome.  I believe it is important that we have a Procedures Committee under section 12(2), and that that committee would approve its statement of selection procedures and its statements of appropriate skills and attributes for inclusion in the published statement.  That performance of the functions of a Procedures Committee is under section 19.  <\/p> <p>  I want to reiterate the importance of the setting up of the Procedures Committee and, indeed, the functions of the Procedures Committee.  I have to say that I would regard this committee as being a core element of the Bill and I am not inclined to accept the change in approach, as proposed by the Deputies.  I did, on the last occasion, make reference to amendment No. 84 by Deputy Wallace and amendments No. 85 by Deputies Sherlock and Wallace.  Again, amendments Nos. 84 and 85 seek to remove from section 19(2) and 19(5) the stipulation that the procedures committee or, indeed, any other committee should contain a majority of lay members and, indeed, a lay chair, as determined by the commission.   Without reopening the debate, Chair, let me just say, as succinctly as possible, that I reject the import of the amendments because I do not accept that the structure envisaged under the Bill is unduly complicated, and I think this is a really important committee within the legislation.  Therefore, I am unable to accept the amendments.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#B00500","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>It is open to any member who wishes to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#B00600","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":194,"content":"<p>My amendments are Nos. 84 and 85.  The rationale for removing the requirement that the Chairperson be lay was explained earlier.  Similarly, the other amendments allowed the commission to regulate itself for the reasons set out earlier as well.  The Bill focuses too much on having a lay majority.  We may well end up with a procedural committee with a lay majority and a sub-committee with a lay majority.  However, I do not see the need to require them in advance in legislation.  My colleagues and I have proposed that the chairpersons are selected by the committees themselves thus giving them a bit more independence.<\/p> <p>  The Bar Council submission refers to the committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe and its statement that the procedure for the appointment of judges should be transparent and independent in practice.  The authority taking the decision on the selection and career of judges should be independent of the Government and the Administration.  In order to safeguard its independence, rules should ensure that, for instance, its members are selected by the Judiciary and that the authority decides itself on its procedural rules.  That shows that the Bar Council encourages greater independence.  <\/p> <p>  I believe that there has been a deliberate focus on the lay versus legal aspect.  Obviously this Bill was very much driven by Lord Ross.  He argued that this legislation would de-politicise how judges are appointed and diminish the legal powers over same but, in fact, that completely depends on the lay people appointed.  If we want to stop this but have the usual types and civil servants, then they will be creatures of politics.  The measure will not remove political influence from this area.<\/p><p>While we may diminish the legal influence over who becomes a judge and when, we may increase the political influence in the whole area.

Regarding some of the points made by Deputy Wallace, we support the idea of a lay majority on the judicial appointments commission.  We believe it is in line with what is in place in many other jurisdictions and in many other professions and organisations, and that is something that we will be supporting throughout this process.<\/p> <p>  A point that was clearly made is that lay appointments often are made through the standard process.  In order to reform the appointments of judges and any impact that would have on court procedures, there needs to be a much broader representation in the appointments.  There are a number of amendments in my name and the names of other members to address that issue. <\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy O'Callaghan's amendments, there is a substantial degree of duplication in the different committees for the appointments of judges to different courts.  I made that point on the last occasion we discussed the Bill.  That is something that could be considered.  Of all the additional committees outlined in the legislation, and there may well be too many of them, the procedures committee is probably the one that has the most to offer.  The appointments of judges to different courts might have different considerations but, ultimately, the principle would be the same.  The procedures committee would have a value in addressing consistency in appointments to the different courts.  There is a great deal in this legislation about diversity and the representativeness of the Judiciary.  If there is any structure that is appropriate to address that, it is the procedures committee.  However, I would be open to supporting some of the other amendments that relate to consolidating some of the committees for the appointments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#C01100","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I wish to touch on the same point and I spoke about this at the last hearing dealing with this legislation.

We examined that and I have some sympathy for that but my understanding is that this group of amendments relates to getting rid of the procedures committee only.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, I have less sympathy for that argument than I have for the argument made in the next group of amendment dealing the other relevant committees.  There is a logic in having the commission as a whole doing all the decision making.  What is the point in setting it up and having another gang of little groups all over the place?  I am seeking clarity on whether the idea of having a procedures committee only set up at the start is to decide the criteria of selection.  Is it dissolved then?  Is that it?  The procedures committee has one job and one job only, which is to set up the criteria for selection.

It is important that the composition would be reflective of the overall commission in respect of its membership.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Wallace's reference to other members of the Government, lest he be of the view that this Bill is under the sponsorship of one individual Minister, this is a Government Bill and is not the property of any one Minister or any one arm of the Government.  This is a Government Bill, having enjoyed the full support of the Government in accordance with a specific commitment given in the programme for Government.  Therefore, reference to any one Minister would not be reflective of the actual situation as far as the Government is concerned.  This is a Government-sponsored Bill.  <\/p> <p>  I must take issue with suggestions that this committee - or the commission but we are dealing with the committee in so far as what Deputy Daly has said - will not be occupied by people without expertise and certainly will not be occupied by civil servants, as suggested by Deputy Wallace.  In section 15(7), specific reference is made to areas of Irish life, including human rights, equality, issues concerning diversity, private sector organisations, commerce, finance, administration, public administration, experience in respect of board membership, corporate governance or areas such as mediation or professional dispute resolution.  What we are doing here is important in ensuring that we have a level of expertise and that they would be non-legal persons.  We had this debate to a great extent in the past but it is important that we have people who are other than simply legal practitioners or former legal practitioners.<\/p> <p>  I cannot accept the amendments because it is important that we would retain a stipulation that this procedures committee or any other committee of the commission would have a lay majority, a lay chair, as determined by the commission.  It is important that we do not depart from what is a core function of the Bill.  <\/p> <p>  On Deputy Daly's specific question, the procedures committee will not be just a once off.

Having regard to the entire gamut of our courts system now and the way that over recent years, they have become more specialised with different divisions, it is important to continue to move in that direction.  For example, having a particular family law division is importance.  In that regard, where vacancies arise from time to time, there will need to be reference to the particular requirements of the court at that given time.  As such, there will be an ongoing role for the procedures committee but its most important work will be at the commencement.  Of course, the procedures committee will also have a role under section 58 in monitoring and reviewing on an ongoing basis, which is necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#C01400","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>If we take a step back, the Government's Bill is being overly prescriptive to an excessive degree.  We are talking about ten to 15 appointments per year but the Bill provides for five specific committees under the remit of the commission and a further procedural committee, which is what we are talking about here.  Under section 19, there is a further proposal that other relevant committees may be established.  In effect, the commission could have as many committees as actual appointments.  If that does not alarm the Minister about the superstructure and layers he is creating and the discretion he is giving the commission to establish more committees, where will it end?  What is the rationale for giving the commission a discretion in addition to the committee's specified in the Bill to establish as many committees as the number of appointments it makes?  The Government is over-complicating what could be a much simpler commission.  That is why Fianna F&aacute;il considers that while there should be a discretion to establish a committee, it should be for the commission to decide what committees it requires rather than to establish a prescriptive process from the get go that is going to cost enormous amounts of public money.  On what basis is it being done?

There are many amendments on the procedures committee, but it all comes down to one issue, which is whether we need one.  I do not know if members have the Bill before them, but the functions of the procedures committee are dealt with in section 58.  It is on page 39 of the Bill.  The section provides that the procedures committee will be responsible for monitoring and reviewing the implementation of the Act, the practical operation of the published statement, the diversity among candidates for judicial appointment, the effectiveness and application of the qualification requirements, the effectiveness of the administrative support, the adequacy of the functions assigned to the commission and international developments.  Those functions should be carried out by the commission itself.  We will have a judicial appointments commission and a separate procedures commission.  I assume every member of the judicial appointments commission will be on top of the items I have just outlined.  I would not like to see a situation in which one could be a member of the commission and say, \"The issue of diversity among candidates is not an issue for me because it is a matter for the procedures committee\".  It complicates matters and is unnecessary.  It is one commission with 13 individuals.  If one is on it, one should have a full, broad overview of the functions one is being asked to carry out by the Oireachtas.  It is not necessary to have separate committees to deal with it.

It also covers a statement of the appropriate level of attributes and skills.  I would not like the committee to be of the view that there is not much to be done here, that there are as many committee as there are appointments and that it is too cumbersome.  There are hundreds of applications annually.  I look in particular at the number of applications to the judicial appointments board where there is a District or Circuit Court vacancy.  There is a huge amount of work to undertake.  There will be hundreds of applications.  Having a sub-committee of the procedures committee will ensure that the work is done effectively and efficiently.  I see every reason that it is important to provide an option to have a smaller group in the form of a committee to look at these issues.

An extraordinary grouping requires an extraordinary response.  I do not propose to go through each one of these amendments by way of an individual debate because they are all in my name and that of Deputy Chambers and they all concern the same net issue.  Rather than saying &quot;amendment No. 9 deals with this&quot; and going through each one individually, I will deal with them broadly and it will cover all of them.  <\/p><p>If members have the Bill in front of them and look at page 11, sections 11 and 12, they will see the purpose of all of these amendments.  In effect, amendment No. 9, all the other amendments being consequential on it, seeks to remove from the piece of legislation this definition of relevant committees of the commission.  We know a commission will be established but what happened after the heads of Bill were published is that the Government made a decision that it was going to include within the commission all these groups of relevant committees.  Those relevant committees are set out on page 11 in section 11 of the Bill.  Members can see that there are five relevant committees of the commission.  They are the Supreme Court appointments committee, the Court of Appeal appointments committee, the High Court appointments committee, the Circuit Court appointments committee and the District Court appointments committee.  All the other amendments that come after amendment No. 9 are consequential.  They remove references to the relevant committee.  <\/p><p>What I propose should happen is that instead of having five different committees within the commission, we should just have one body, which would be the Judicial Appointments Commission.  The reason this committee structure was introduced after the heads of Bill were published by the Government was because the Government recognised that membership of the commission was inadequate.  If members look at section 12 on page, they will see that the commission is to be made up of 13 members.  One of my criticisms and that of others is that it was wrong that the president of the Circuit Court and the president of the District Court were excluded from the commission since they are the presidents of the courts that have the largest number of judges and have the greatest amount of interaction with members of the public and because they are people who know what is required in a District or Circuit Court judge.  That was a legitimate criticism.  I think the Government recognised that there was legitimacy in that criticism but because of that, it responded by trying to set up all these different committees.  The Government's purpose in setting up all these different committees is that when the Circuit Court appointments committee was meeting, it would be able to invite in the president of the Circuit Court and similarly, when the District Court appointments committee was meeting, it could invite in the president of the District Court.  That was the way of getting around not having the presidents of both those courts on the commission.  It would be much simpler and more appropriate if the presidents of the two busiest courts were members of the commission.  <\/p><p>Another reason I think it is a bad idea to have relevant committees, and the Minister knows this more than anyone else in the room, is that sometimes, one could get a person who could apply for a job as a Circuit Court judge, the Minister may think a better candidate for the Circuit Court exists but there is a District Court vacancy at present and that would be a very suitable person to be a District Court judge.<\/p><p>One is not going to have a capacity for the committee to consider that someone who did not get a Circuit Court appointment might be a good District Court judge.  For that reason and because of the limited number of appointments, it is more appropriate to have one commission as opposed to five committees.  We seem to be obsessed in this country with having committees for everything.  For instance, how often will the Supreme Court appointments committee meet?  There may not be a Supreme Court appointment for two or three years whereas the really busy one is the District Court.  The media pays more attention to who is appointed to the Supreme or High Court but far more important appointments from the point of view of members of the public are to the District Court because they are the judges with whom they have the most interaction.  Their appointments deserve as much scrutiny as appointments to the Supreme Court.<\/p><p> I will not go through all of the amendments individually.  They are all consequential on this proposal.  We should get rid of \"relevant committees\" and have one commission which considers applications and nominations for appointment to all the courts.  It will allow them to suggest that a person who applied for the Court of Appeal should go to the Supreme Court.  It is a small country and there are a small number of positions on the Bench.  It is wrong to exclude the Presidents of the District and Circuit Courts from the commission, which is something that can be perfected later.  The Government has brought in this committee structure to allow them to come back in, but it would be much easier to put them on the commission.  While there are a huge number of amendments here, they all relate to the same thing.  That is my contribution on each of the proposals.  I recognise that when we make a decision on amendment No. 9, it will deal with the rest of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#E00300","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Other members are indicating, but the committee may wish to hear the Minister reply to Deputy O'Callaghan first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#F00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I agree that there are a lot of amendments here.  In fact, there are more than 50 in the grouping.  In response to Deputy O'Callaghan and for the benefit of members who have not yet made a contribution on their amendments, I will set out briefly and clearly the structure of these sections of the Bill and their purpose.  Section 9 of the Bill establishes the relevant committees.  Section 10 is the enabling provision requiring the commission to select and recommend to the Minister persons for appointment to judicial office through the relevant committee as set out in section 11(2).  I remind members that section 10 is being opposed through these amendments.  Section 11 provides for the membership of the relevant committees.  I note the section is also opposed.  Section 11 sets out the committees to be established under section 9.  I will not repeat what Deputy O'Callaghan said in that regard.  He draws our attention to the section, the content of which is self-explanatory.  Section 11(2) provides in the table for the role of each committee in making a selection and recommendation.  Section 13 provides for the membership of the relevant committees and other provisions in relation to them.  Section 13 is opposed.  Section 13(1) sets out the composition of the committees, each of which will have a total of 11 members.  All committees will have as members the Chief Justice, the Attorney General, a nominee of the Bar Council and Law Society, respectively, and the lay chair.  A committee will also comprise five of the lay persons.<\/p><p>The second judicial member provision is set out in section 13.  Section 13(2) provides the detail to ensure that the selection and recommendation of appointees to judicial office in a particular court will be conducted by a committee whose membership includes a judge serving at the level of the courts system to which the committee's business relates.  There are obvious and important reasons that should be the case.  In the case of a Supreme Court appointments committee, the additional member shall be either the President of the Court of Appeal or, with the concurrence of that President, an ordinary Supreme Court judge nominated by the Chief Justice.  Deputies will be aware that these important provisions were not included in the Bill as published.  I acknowledge what Deputy O'Callaghan has said.  These provisions were included following careful consideration and having regard to what Deputies, including Deputy O'Callaghan, had to say in the course of pre-legislative scrutiny about the need to have all court Presidents as well as the Chief Justice involved in the function of selecting and recommending persons for judicial appointment.  The provisions were also developed following a period of consultation with members of the Judiciary at senior level.  These sections and related provisions create a structure whereby the selection and recommendation function will be carried out within the framework of the five relevant committees designed to address judicial vacancies in each of the five court levels.  This architecture reflects concerns raised by the Judiciary in the consultation process.<\/p><p>Deputies will be fully aware that the Judiciary is opposed to having a majority of lay persons on the commission and to having a lay chairperson presiding over a commission of which the Chief Justice is a member.  I am conscious that we will be addressing issues relating to the composition of the commission on a separate basis but I must advert to a particular concern the Judiciary had that all five court Presidents, including the Chief Justice, should be involved directly in the selection and recommendation process for the appointment of persons as is currently the case with the judicial appointments board.  Having listened to the views of the Judiciary on the matter, having reflected on the point during the pre-legislative scrutiny debate and having regard to the input of my predecessor, I am of the view that it is desirable to meet this particular concern in the manner set out in the Bill.  Rather than to provide for a consultation arrangement with, for example, the President of the District Court, as the <i>ex officio<\/i>arrangement under the general scheme of the Bill originally provided, a direct decision-making role for each President should be retained.  That is what we have under the current process.<\/p><p>Sections 11 and 13 provide that the commission shall act in the form of a relevant 11 person committee, one for each of the five courts.  In the case of an appointment to the Circuit Court, for example, the committee will comprise the commission members, with the President of the Circuit Court replacing the Presidents of the Court of Appeal and the High Court and with five ordinary lay members instead of six.  It is that committee which will conduct the selection process and recommend persons for appointment to the Circuit Court in that example.  While all Superior Court Presidents, including the Chief Justice, are permanent members of the commission through the appointment committees format in the Bill, all Presidents will form part of the decision-making process through the relevant committees in selecting and recommending persons for appointment to the relevant courts.  Under section 10 of the Bill, the relevant committees will perform the functions of the commission in respect of the selection of persons for each court.  In that sense, they will be the statutory iteration of the commission itself and be empowered to select and make decisions as to who to recommend.  I refer again to the programme for Government in that regard.<\/p><p>The chair, the Chief Justice and a number of other members will be common across the relevant committees.  There will be a perspective across the entire gamut of selection applications.  I say this in response to the point raised by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan who spoke in terms of there being silos in this respect.  That will not necessarily be the case because there will be common membership and a common secretariat across all the relevant committees via a judicial appointments commission office, which will be established under the Bill.<\/p><p> I have listened to Deputy O'Callaghan in particular, as well as other members, but I am not minded to increase the number of members of the commission beyond the 13-member composition that the legislation now provides.  Nor am I in a position to pull back on the key programme for Government commitments in this regard.  I am therefore unable to accept any of the amendments, including amendments Nos. 9, 22 and 23, which have the effect of removing the relevant committee structures in the Bill.  I agree with Deputy O'Callaghan that this is the core matter and many of the other 50 amendments are related or consequential.  It is important we retain the relevant committees as in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#F00300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":228,"content":"<p>These are incredibly difficult and confusing.  There are aspects of amendments that could be supported but they have a knock-on effect for other parts of the legislation, which makes it very difficult for us in handling them.  As I said in a previous discussion, this is an area we actively examined in preparation of our amendments.  It is the idea of getting rid of all the relevant committees.  There is a very compelling argument for that, not least of which is the idea of having a commission of 13 people and a plethora of committees made up of 11 people.  That sort of goes against the grain of the establishment of the commission in the first place.  It is still unwieldy, even with a few people taken out, but most of the people on the committees would be on the other body.  Are we not better off just leaving it at the commission itself?  It is quite a compelling argument.<\/p> <p>  We wanted to hear the discussion and I am not sure the reasons we did not put down specific amendments stand up.  There may be other ways of achieving the goal that we cannot do in the course of these amendments.  I suppose we decided against proposing getting rid of them because the Bill, as currently constituted, precisely excludes the presidents of the District Court and Circuit Court from membership.  There are committees that allow them to come in through an elegant way to be part of the process under the headline of an additional member.  That is without making the commission so big by adding them on.  That is too messy, although I know it is the logic behind the process.  I would like the involvement of the two presidents and I note Deputy O'Callaghan provides for that.  If he is providing for extra lay people etc., we could suddenly be talking about 17 people, which is too big.<\/p> <p>  This comes back to the idea of the lay majority and how important it is.  In some ways, it is kind of a matter of preference.  That said, I still like the idea of a lay majority.  We made the point before that focusing really gets away from what we should be looking at, which is who gets appointed as a judge, rather than necessarily how such people get appointed.  I echo very much the points made by Deputy Wallace earlier that we are talking about a lay majority but the criteria for those lay people is really such that in a different way they will replicate certain sections of Irish society that are already over-represented.  The points about the Civil Service are not meant to be derogatory in any way but many of these State bodies tend to have people from those types of backgrounds.  In many ways they are as institutionalised, if not more, than the Judiciary or the legal profession.  Would we get a diverse balance and would it really be a lay representation?  It is more of the same.<\/p> <p>  The Judiciary should not be a career progression for people in the legal profession as such.  We should not have a position where judges are a class apart but they are.  If there was a different way we could get representation for the presidents of the District Court and Circuit Court to become involved in the commission, I would be open to considering it.  It is not a strong enough reason to maintain the relevant committees.  They will create mayhem.  The legislation will be made chaotic by having these multiple committees with 11 people when there is a commission of 13 people.  It will not work.  I will have to do some work on this to bring about a different way for the presidents of the District Court and Circuit Court to have a role in this process without relevant committees.  They are a really cumbersome way of trying to get over that point and they will not work.  I am strongly against them but we must find a different way of getting the other two involved in the process.  Those are my initial thoughts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#G00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":229,"content":"<p>As I noted with the previous set of amendments, the procedures committee would have a very specific role to play in guiding the diversity and representation of the Judiciary and it was worth preserving.  Having said that, the multiple committees of 11 members drawn from a commission of 13 members amount to an overly complex system.  It is unnecessary.  It would be desirable for one body to look at all appointments, with different considerations for every level.  There would also be considerations that would be the same in all appointments as well.  The example given by Deputy O'Callaghan of identifying a judge interested in one position who may be more suited to another position shows that such considerations are relevant.  The commission should be responsible for the nomination of judges as a whole and the main body is suitable for that.<\/p><p>Deputy Daly has indicated very clearly that acceptance of these amendments will require a cleaning up exercise in subsequent Stages but there would be no problem with that and it is the reason we have multiple Stages when considering legislation.

If I was going to have any judge on this Commission, I would have the president of the District Court, considering the number of candidates who are appointed to that court.<\/p> <p>  Part of the reason we are here is that politics is damaging the legislation.

As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, if we must add the presidents of the District Court and the Circuit Court, as I think we should, and we want a lay majority, then two more laypeople must be added.  I think that is inappropriately large, but for some reason this lay majority is said to be politically necessary and of public benefit.  I disagree with that.

Simply deleting reference to the relevant committees is not in itself advisable.  I do not accept that this is unduly cumbersome.  I do accept that there are a number of committees that have different functions, and which might, at face value, appear to be somewhat technical in nature.  In practice, however, the relevant committees are effectively the Commission itself.  It is a function of the Commission to select and recommend people for appointment.  Under section 10, this function is performed by the relevant committee only.  As such the relevant committees are in effect iterations of the Commission.  It is not as though we are introducing significant layers of bureaucracy.  Circumstances are such that there will be common membership across a range of relevant committees.  However, I agree with Deputy Daly that ultimately the objective here is to reform the process of appointment.  That is the main thrust of the legislation.  It is the manner in which we arrange structures in order to facilitate that objective that we are discussing here.<\/p> <p>  I said at the outset of this debate that I did not come in here with a closed mind.  I have not changed that view.  There may be different ways of achieving the objective we all share, as noted by Deputy Daly.  I am prepared to further examine the balance between having a manageable number on the Commission and ensuring the membership of the presidents.  We all agree that the direct involvement of the presidents of the courts is extremely valuable and will be very important in the new process.  The question is how we can best avoid having an unwieldy overall Commission with large numbers of people, while meeting the obligation to have a lay chair and a lay majority, assuming that members of this committee are minded to continue with that central thrust of the legislation.<\/p> <p>  To my mind, the current relevant committee process is the most effective way of involving the presidents as experts in their own court area.  I do not accept Deputy O'Callaghan's contention that we are creating indivisible silos, considering the common membership across the relevant committees.  We will continue to have a perspective across the whole gamut of selections and applications.  We will also have a common secretariat across all of the relevant committees, which will be the Judicial Appointments Commission office.  Should we delete all reference to the committees and deny ourselves the opportunity to avail of expertise of the presidents?  I believe that expertise is essential, as the presidents themselves have said.  I would be reluctant to depart from that.

There would be lay members, whom we hope will influence the diversity and representation of the judiciary.  However, there might be somebody who is perfectly well equipped to deal with that who would never have a say in a District Court or Supreme Court appointment, merely because they are not on that committee.  If the model of the Commission as a whole was adopted, all six of the lay members currently proposed would have a say in each appointment.

I really feel we should do that.  The original scheme, as committee members recall, had <i>ex officio<\/i>participation of Presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court in the selection process, but that was seen as distinguishing between presidents who are commission members and those who are not.  There is an issue there about fairness and the need to be representative.  I am minded to give this matter further consideration to see how best we can achieve that balance between, on the one hand, the commission not having such a large number of members as to be problematic and, on the other hand, the need to ensure we can have the input and draw on the experience and expertise of the presidents of the courts.

In practice, the process will be quite straightforward.  Deputy O'Callaghan and other Deputies mentioned, for example, the appointment to a vacancy in the District Court under the new framework.  This court is perhaps most relevant to the day-to-day lives of individuals.  Hundreds of thousands of people appear annually in District Courts up and down the country.  If the committee forms the view that the relevant committees under the Bill would have no function and would be non-existent, we would then have a situation in practice where there might be up to 200 applications for consideration for a vacancy in the District Court from all over the country.  Without the relevant committee structure, these applications would be put to the entire commission for due consideration.  There is real danger that much other work of importance that might be undertaken by the commission would not take place because of a concentration by the commission on dealing with one appointment to the District Court.  That is one of the important reasons we have carefully arrived at after significant consideration at the relevant committee structure.  It is to ensure efficiency and expertise and it would provide for the membership of the president of the court to which the appointment is to be made.

I will briefly make reference to section 5, which concerns the review of operation.  As we know, the Bill is new, innovative and ground-breaking in the extensive changes it introduces in the process of judicial appointments.  We are moving to make an important step forward.  This is a very innovative adjustment to the manner in which we deal with such matters.  I only have to mention the significant reduction in the number of recommendations that the Government receives and the extension of this system to all judicial appointments, including the further appointment of serving judges.  There would be increased lay participation in decision making and a developmental function in the commission.<\/p> <p>  In a short period following enactment, the landscape will change in a most significant manner.  It is worth pointing out that the review arrangements envisaged in section 5 will have close interaction with later provisions in the Bill.  I refer specifically to the requirements of section 58, which requires the procedures committee, to which we made considerable reference earlier, to be charged with responsibility to monitor and review the implementation of the Act, having regard to the various factors.  That review should be conducted two years after commencement of the section and thereafter from time to time as the commission might request.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#L01700","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1516184400,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Those factors include the operation of statements on selection procedures and skills and attributes which the procedures committee is required to publish under section 55, which we referred to earlier.  Other factors include diversity among candidates for judicial appointment and the adequacy of functions assigned to the commission.<\/p><p>Section 58(3), as I have said, mandates the review to be conducted within a two-year period.  This process will be followed by a report, including any recommendations, to the commission.  That report, and any recommendations, will be submitted by the commission to the Minister with observations of the commission.<\/p><p>It can be assumed that the process of review will serve as a reference point for the review by the Minister of the Act, as provided for under section 5.  To adequately take account of the entire experience and workings of the Act, including the review, and reporting process, I am of the view that a period of five years is appropriate.  This is typical of such provisions which have been used from time to time in statutes where it is considered that a review clause is deemed prudent.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire suggested three years.  In principle, that of itself is not objectionable.  I appreciate the support that is implicit for the review concept but one factor behind the five year mark is that we need to see a sufficient throughput of selections and appointments over an adequate period of time.  The more appointments that become the subject of a review, for example, with reference to matters such as diversity which is referenced in Part 8 of the Bill, the better picture we will have of developments.  It will also give us a clearer picture of trends in these areas which are important to us all.  It is critical to have had adequate experience of the new procedures and skills and the frameworks that we are developing, and that the procedures committee has that bank of experience under section 55, before we are in a position to make an objective and clear assessment.  It is my view that three years, as suggested by the Deputy, is too short.

That is extremely important.  The objective of every person in this room is to ensure that those appointed to the Bench get there because of their ability and the type of judge that they will be rather than any political affiliation, friendship or other connection that they may have.  We all want the best people to be made judges.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire mentioned Dr. Patrick O'Brien who has done a lot of research in the area of how they have changed the system in England.  I met Dr. O'Brien as well.  He made an interesting point about the emphasis of the merit principle in England and Wales at present.  He stated that one of the consequences of having a completely autonomous body that recommends people based solely on merit is that one gets a lot of people who are similar being appointed.  He stated that one gets a lot of highly intelligent people who got firsts in Oxbridge being recommended because on the principle of merit they appear to be come out on top.<\/p><p>However, that has a consequential downside in terms of how the Judiciary must reflect diversity in society and shows where the advantage lies with Government.  A Government does not operate the same way as a statutory body that must operate on the basis of merit.  A Government will take into account diversity.  Many appointments in recent times recognise that more women must be appointed to the Bench.  That is a benefit.  It is important to link merit and diversity together.  In section 7, as it stands, there is reference to how appointments should be based on merit and how they should reflect diversity.  My only problem with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendment is that, if passed, it will have the effect of knocking out my amendment No. 20, although I know that was not his intention.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 20, which was tabled by me and Deputy Jack Chambers, requires that when judges are being recommended by this body, consideration will be given to ensuring the objective that there is proficiency in the Irish language among members of the Judiciary, which is a practical problem at present.  Every person is entitled to have his or her case heard in Irish, whether in the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court or on appeal.  It is difficult enough to converse in Irish but running a case in Irish is extremely difficult.  I could not do it.  However, it is important that we have judges with proficiency in the Irish language so that those who want to exercise the constitutional right to have their case heard through Irish can do so.<\/p><p> On a number of occasions judges have to come down from higher courts to hear cases and three judges who are proficient in the Irish language are needed to hear an appeal in the Court of Appeal.  Previous Governments have not given sufficient recognition to this factor but it is now an issue - not a problem - for the courts.  It is important that this body recognises, when recommending people, that it must consider that proficiency in a court.  For instance, if someone wants to have his or her appeal heard through Irish, we have to ensure that there are three judges on either the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court who can hear such cases.  This amendment would knock out my amendment No. 20.  However, I will not oppose Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendment because I agree with the principle of it.  I also think Deputy Clare Daly's amendments No. 17 and 19 and perhaps amendment No. 21 - I do not know if it is in this grouping - achieve the objective Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is seeking to achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#M01200","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I will discuss my amendments Nos. 17 and 19 first and then deal with amendment No. 21 separately.  These amendments are seeking to do the same thing in some ways.  Ours might be a little less complicated than Sinn F&eacute;in's in that it allows for recommendations for the appointment to be based on merit while having regard to objectives of gender equality and diversity.  They might be less complicated than the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal, although I am open to looking at it.  This gets to the heart of a lot of what we are talking about and what we want to see.  The outcome in terms of the judges that we have is more important than the process, which we have all been absorbed in until now.  What do we get out of the end of this process?<\/p> <p>  As it stands, the Bill states that, in decisions to recommend persons to the appointment of judicial office, regard shall be had, subject to merit, to \"the objective that the membership of the judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women\" and \"to the extent feasible and practicable, reflect the diversity within the population\".  In revising this section, we are proposing that the objectives of gender equality and diversity are not subject to the principle that all appointments must be made on merit.  The reason is to emphasise that diversity, be it social or gender, is as important as merit in making appointments.  At the same time, these amendments do not have the effect of allowing the recommendation of less worthy female appointments or appointments of people from ethnic minorities or under-represented classes.  It is trying to balance the two and to equate them.<\/p> <p>  We propose to delete the words \"feasible and practicable\" in the subsection on diversity because there is no clear reason for it.  This is all the more so if we are saying the Judiciary should be made up of equal numbers of men and women where we do not have that caveat of \"feasible and practicable\" but it is there when it comes to broader diversity.  That should be removed, which is straightforward enough.<\/p> <p>  We are taking a lot of guidance on these amendments.  The English Constitutional Reform Act 2005 places a specific onus on the judicial appointments commission in performing its function to have regard to \"the need to encourage diversity in the range of persons available for selection\", which I think is what we are all trying to do here.  Arguments about merit started to take off in the UK and Australia a couple of years ago, after their merit-based systems were in place.  They found that the judiciary being appointed after introducing a merit-based ground looked very like the judiciary they had before it.  They all tended to be the same type of middle class white males.  Jack Straw, a former Minister for justice, said that merit can too easily mean \"people like us\", which is what we are trying to get away from.<\/p> <p>  We are not encouraging diversity for the sake of it.  Judges who are drawn from a wide range of backgrounds and life experiences bring varying perspectives to bear on critical legal issues.  That is important.  That is what we are trying to do here.  The Bar Council was of the view that \"justice is best served when the judiciary [is more reflective of] the collective morals of society and when they, as a group, have wider perspectives and a broader experience of life\".<\/p> <p>  The inclusion of diversity as an element of merit enshrines its importance and moral legitimacy and, in that sense, would achieve an enhancing of public confidence in the Judiciary, which is supposed to be the concern of the Bill.  Therefore, why not make a firm commitment in that regard?  Rather than hiding behind \"feasible and practicable\", let us put it on an equal footing.  If other amendments with regard to the appointment and background of lay members of the commission fall, we run the risk of ending up with quite a narrowly defined version of merit which is \"people like us\".<\/p> <p>  As currently constituted, the Bill provides for a lay majority made up of ex-civil servants, human resources managers and CEOs.  Those are the criteria in the Bill as it stands.  Those are the types of lay persons we would be selecting.  The vast number of them will come from a particular background and a good number of them will see merit as meaning the person attended a good university and had a career at the Bar and that is about it.<\/p> <p>  We should be saying that merit is a lot more than that.  It is about appreciating and really understanding cultural and social diversity.  It is about having experience of a wide range of different circumstances as well as a deep knowledge of the legal system and the law.  With these amendments, I am trying to put diversity on an equal footing, and not a lesser one, with merit.  It is not seeking to discount merit or anything like that.<\/p> <p>  I will not labour the points but this is critical.  Three of six current Supreme Court judges went to fee paying schools.  I cannot find the details on one of them so I am not sure but potentially more than 50% of the Supreme Court judges had a private education.  Only 7% of the population has a private education.  Therefore, we need to address those aspects.  It is very important.<\/p> <p>  The other matter is slightly different but it is related.  I am referring to amendment No. 21.  This is similar to Deputy Wallace's amendment No. 189 and a little like Deputy Sherlock's amendment No. 15.  I think the reason all of us tabled these amendments is pretty obvious.  The whole aim of the Bill should be to remove political meddling as far as possible or, at least, the perception of political meddling from the judicial appointments process.  The reasons are well rehearsed but I will run through them briefly.  I will not labour the point but removing political influence from the judicial appointments process is key to giving us a more diverse Judiciary and to ensuring that the perception of judicial independence is not compromised.<\/p><p>The Bar Council, for its part, supports an explicit statutory prohibition on consideration of a person's political affiliation in determining his or her suitability for appointment in order to dispel the apprehension that party politics plays a role in the appointment of judges.  It is about more than perception.  Dr. Eoin Daly of NUI Galway made a good point that we must factor in the role that judges play in shaping the law as well, where he states:<\/p><blockquote>Far from mechanically administering laws laid down by the legislature, judges are, in reality, responsible for developing the law.  And the question of how the law should be developed in this way raises fundamental &quot;political&quot; questions about the nature of justice and injustice, the distribution of power and opportunity in society, and so on.  ...judging at all levels involves sometimes significant elements of discretion &ndash; which means that judicial power is not always guided by strictly &quot;legal&quot; standards.<\/blockquote><p>In that sense, we must also factor in that the nature of the legal system is such that the Judiciary has far more far-reaching powers, such as constitutional powers, than its counterpart in England.  The political nature is key.  My other amendment seeks to deal with that issue also.  It is quite important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#N00200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I will allow the Minister to respond at this point and then I will bring Deputy O'Callaghan in.

That, to my mind, is a positive.  Section 7 of the Bill is an important section setting down in statute for the first time the explicit stipulation that a decision to recommend a person must be based on merit, as expressly contained in the section.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's amendment effectively requires under subsection (1) that recommendations made by the commission shall be based on merit.  It refers to this stipulation as being the \"Merit Principle\".  I have no particular objection to that terminology but, right through these amendments on the issue of merit, it is important that we are mindful of the need to retain certain flexibilities.  I would be concerned about a series of amendments that would have the effect of constricting the commission in a way that is not intended but could ultimately have the effect of some form of hamstring.<\/p> <p>  Subsection (2) of the proposed new section has the effect of benchmarking the merit-based recommendation against the objectives of equality of men and women in the membership of the Judiciary and diversity among membership of the Judiciary.  These objectives are denoted by reference to a diversity principle.  The proposed terminology is not in any way objectionable, but terminology of itself does not change the basis on which the recommendations are to be made, as provided for under the Bill.  What is new in the amendment is the stipulation that a list of persons recommended for appointment to office under the Act shall include at least one person whose appointment would further the objectives of the diversity principle.  While the naming of merit and diversity principles would not perhaps be unwelcome, I am much less sure that the hand of the commission must be compelled or mandated to select in a particular direction.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we step back for a moment to describe broadly how the Bill addresses what is an important, but also a sensitive, issue of diversity.  There are a number of elements to the manner in which these issues are addressed.  First, the provisions of section 7 develop significantly from what was contained in the general scheme of the Bill, moving from guiding principles to a direct stipulation with regard to merit-based recommendations.  The Government, to my mind, made the correct decision when publishing the Bill that guiding principles were not sufficiently strong as far as this issue was concerned.  The public consultation phases of the reform process clearly signposted the need for merit to be very much to the forefront in the matter of our reform proposal.  It is also significant that, subject to the merit-based recommendation only, the concerns around gender balance and diversity in the membership of the Judiciary are brought up and that they be dealt with in a front and centre way - to borrow a term from the Act.<\/p> <p>  Regarding gender equality and diversity, section 15(7), which is the subject of a separate debate, provides one area where knowledge and experience will be to the fore in the selection of the lay members with regard to \"human rights, equality or issues concerning diversity amongst members of society\".  The Bill signals the critical importance of taking account of that perspective in appointing the lay members of the commission.<\/p> <p>  A third area that is worthy of mention relates to the requirement under section 55 of the Bill.  This requires, in the preparation of the statements of selection, the procedures for selection and the requisite skills and attributes, that regard will be had to the following two objectives: in subsection (5)(c) \"the objective that the membership of the judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women,\"; and \"the objective that, to the extent feasible and practicable, the membership of the judiciary should reflect the diversity within the population as a whole\".  There is a direct co-relation between the objective set out in section 7 and the requirement of the commission to cater for this in its own published statements.  In this context, Part 8 of the Bill will ensure that the judicial selection procedures and the qualities of persons selected will take full account of the gender equality and diversity objectives which are integral objectives in everything the Bill is aimed at achieving.  The final element I should mention in this matter is that, in the section 58 review process that we discussed earlier, diversity must be monitored and reported upon to the commission and to the Minister.<\/p> <p>  All in all, I have no specific difficulty with a variation in terminology denoting the principles that are framing the Bill, but I am not inclined to accept what will be a prescription that subsection (3) in the amendment implies.  I do not intend to support the amendment.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge Deputy Clare Daly's amendments Nos. 17 and 19, which propose the deletion of aspects of the phraseology of section 7.  I accept that it is not just a question of removing or changing words, but there are significant adjustments.  Amendment No. 17 appears to delete the provision that the objectives of subsection (2) around gender equality and diversity are subject to the merit-based recommendation principle.<\/p><p>The intention behind this appears to be to remove the element which makes the gender equality and diversity objectives in section 7 subject to the overall principle of selection on merit.  The purpose of the existing provisions of the Bill is to ensure that the overarching consideration in the selection of people for appointment to judicial office is merit and to make any consideration of gender equality and diversity clearly subject to that overarching principle.  Having it subject to that provision serves merely to underpin the primacy of the merit based recommendation provisions.<br\/><br\/>What is merit?  I cannot see how the concept can be compromised in any sense by reference to any competing principle.  Merit is merit.  It is fully acceptable to associate the concept with the specified objectives.  That is what we are doing in the Bill.  I am sure the members and Chairman will testify to the huge advance we are making in specifying those very objectives.  It is important to have no misunderstanding about the single criterion to be referenced in the recommendation process.  Dropping the term &quot;subject to subsection 1&quot; is unhelpful in respect of the core principle of the section.  Looking at merit or a definition of merit, it can to many be a fluid concept.  According to 2012 research, merit is often invoked in the eye of the beholder.  Oftentimes, merit does not necessarily equate to the <i>status quo<\/i>.  I refer briefly to Paterson 2012, a research study, which stated that historically what has been put into the definition of merit for judicial appointments has constantly shifted.  In Lord Halsbury's day, it included, apparently, coming from the same party as the Lord Chancellor.  At a later point, it was deemed to be a good thing to have had previous political experience before appointment as a judge in the House of Lords.  More recently, however, it has been and remains in large part the case that merit is regarded as coterminous with having been a junior or Queen's Counsel at the bar for a period of 30 years.  I merely make the point by way of that short reference that merit is a changeable feature.  In many respects, it is subjective.<br\/><br\/>I am unable to accept the amendment which dilutes the overall stipulation of merit as the overarching criterion for selection.  At best, the effect of Deputy Daly's amendment would be to create confusion as to the relative status of merit, gender equality and diversity, respectively, in the selection process.  At worst, we could have a situation in which candidates were selected primarily on gender or diversity considerations, with merit not constituting the primary or overarching criterion but rather being somehow secondary to other issues.  I am not sure to what extent that is intended.  I have no doubt that the Irish people are entitled to be assured through the legislation that the overarching basis for recruitment to the Judiciary is merit.  They are also entitled to be assured that diversity considerations and gender equality are taken into account in the selection process.  It is important that there is no confusion as to merit being the main deciding factor.  The section was carefully drafted and a lot of work went into it.  A great deal of consideration has been given to these matters by the drafters to deliver on this.  It would be unwise for us to change it.  The Judiciary has asked repeatedly that legislation contain a stipulation as to the overarching status of merit and I accept their position on that fully.<br\/><br\/>The aim of amendment No. 19 is to remove the wording from section 7(2)(b) which stipulates that the achievement of the diversity objective in relation to the Judiciary is &quot;to the extent feasible and practicable&quot;.  The words &quot;to the extent feasible and practicable&quot; are no more than a reflection of the task to which the commission will have to have regard in the attainment of this objective.  The amendment, if made, would require the selection process to have regard to the need for diversity in the Judiciary whether or not the achievement of such diversity was feasible or practicable in all of the circumstances.  That could be problematic.  The achievement of a diversity among the Judiciary which reflects the diversity of the population as a whole is a medium to long-term desirable objective based on the premise that all cadres and groups in society should be able to identify with those who are appointed to judicial office and have the confidence that our judges are in a position to understand and reflect their particular needs and aspirations.  That objective must be subject to what is feasible and practicable.  That qualification is important because of a whole range of things, not least the availability in a particular judicial selection process of diversity within the ranks of the highest performing lawyers who choose to apply and from among whom members of the Judiciary are chosen.  I am satisfied that the provision in place is sufficient as it draws attention to the important matter of diversity, requires that it be acted on and will ensure it is taken into account in the selection of appropriate candidates for the Judiciary.<br\/><br\/>The effect of amendments Nos. 19 and 20 taken together would be to insert in the Bill express statutory provisions governing requirements for proficiency in the Irish language.

I will be brief.  I am not inclined to accept amendments Nos. 19 and 20 in the context of the Bill before us.  Making the amendments would mean that, subject to the existing fundamental requirement in section 7 that merit is the basis for any decision to recommend a person for appointment to judicial office, regard would also have to be had to an additional new and third objective that there be proficiency in the Irish language among the Judiciary.  Deputies will know that the Law Reform Commission's 2010 report on the consolidation and reform of the Courts Acts examined existing provisions in sections 44 and 71 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 which provide that, where practicable, a person assigned as a judge to a district or circuit where the Irish language is in general use must possess such knowledge of the Irish language to enable proceedings to be conducted without the aid of an interpreter.  The Law Reform Commission examined these provisions in light of the requirements of sections 8 and 9 of the Official Languages Act 2003 which deal with a person choosing to use the national language of his or her choice when dealing with a public body.  The commission recommended that its proposed courts (consolidation and reform) Bill should enhance the provisions of the 1924 Act.<\/p><p>It recommended that its proposed courts consolidation reform Bill should enhance the existing 24 statutory provisions and should provide for a Circuit Court or District Court judge assigned to a Gaeltacht area to be registered in the Irish language registers provided for under the Legal Practitioners (Irish Language) Act 2008 without prejudice to any right or obligation under the Official Languages Act - sections 8 and 9 in particular.<\/p><p> It has not proved possible to put such proposals into current substantial legislative reform programme.  However, if and when it arises, it could be a more appropriate place to examine further where there is a need for the Deputy's proposed reforms not in the stand alone piecemeal way peculiar to the judicial appointments process, but in the broader context of the provision of courts services through the Irish language generally in the existing law as set out in 1924 and more recent statutes not under the direct remit of my Department as well as wider aspects of the European Union law.  The language issue is wider than the appointments process, looking at the scheme of the courts services Bill - the scheme of courts services as published in the 2003 Act detailing the courts services existing policy in practice regarding the delivery of services in the Irish language.<\/p><p> Deputy Clare Daly makes her point in amendment No. 21 dealing with political affiliation.  That is similar in effect to amendment No. 189 to section 64 proposed by Deputy Wallace.  That amendment seeks to prohibit any consideration of political affiliation in the judicial selection process.  I accept the thinking behind the amendment to the effect that political affiliation should not in any way be reckoned as better qualifying a candidate for appointment to judicial office, but a stipulation in section 7 of the Bill, which sets merit as the overarching criterion for recommendation with a requirement also but subject to merit the issue of gender equality and diversity into account, that makes my mind clear that political affiliation will play no role in the process of selecting persons for judicial office.<\/p><p> I have a concern about Deputy Daly's proposed wording that the complete prohibition on consideration of a candidate's political affiliation could be counterproductive to the intention of the amendment.  For example, as political affiliation is not defined, could the Deputy's proposed amendment mean that the commission's processes would be prohibited from considering the political affiliations of a candidate who may be a known member of an extremist political group with views that would make him or her patently unsuitable to be a member of the Judiciary?<\/p><p> I have a number of amendments and having regard to time, we will probably have a further opportunity before these questions are put.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#P00700","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I wish to refer to two amendments about which I have not spoken previously.  The first is amendment No. 21 in the name of Deputy Clare Daly on which the Minister has just spoken.  This proposes including an express reference to the fact that a person's political affiliation should not be considered when the recommending body is considering their application.  The purpose behind the legislation is to ensure people are appointed on merit.  There is a public concern that sometimes people are appointed to political office because they have political connections or because of their political affiliations.  I am sure that has happened in the past.  I do not think it is a good thing.  Therefore, there is benefit in including within the section on recommendations based on merit a reference to the fact that somebody's political affiliation should be irrelevant and should not be considered when it comes to an application.<\/p> <p>  I hear the interesting point the Minister just made about extremist political views.  Consideration should be given to whether that would preclude an individual.  On balance, I would have thought that would be a factor that would exclude a person from consideration because they did not display the type of independence or integrity that would be required of somebody being appointed to the Bench.  On balance, I am favourably disposed to amendment No. 21.<\/p> <p>  What I like about amendment No. 21 is that it does not assume that just because somebody has a political affiliation they should not be made a judge.  Some of the best judges we have had are people with political affiliations.  In some instances, I am sure members of the public who come before a judge would prefer to be before an individual who has experience like all of us.  Sometimes we denigrate politicians and politics too much.  We have the advantage of having an exemplary insight into the public's thinking.  People sometimes think the media have a better insight; that is wrong.  Politicians have a much greater insight into what is happening on the ground with the public and how the public are thinking on certain issues.  We should not be nervous about the fact that somebody who had a political affiliation or was involved in politics then decides to get into the Judiciary afterwards.  I have no interest, myself, Chairman, just in case you think this is a defence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#Q00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I was just wondering if this was a personal bid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#Q00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":303,"content":"<p>No, it is not.

I know the Minister did not have an opportunity to discuss it.  In amendment No. 124, Deputy Jack Chambers and I seek to set out the characteristics that would make a good judge - the basis and the factors that should be considered by the commission when it is making a determination to recommend a person based on merit.  Obviously, it is difficult to set out the characteristics that constitute merit.  In many respects, a good judge is like an elephant: it is hard to describe, but when one sees it, one knows it.<\/p> <p>  I have sought to identify the characteristics that I think are important for somebody to be a good judge such as integrity; independence of mind; intellectual skills; sound temperament; ability to exercise sound judgment; impartiality; and an ability to interact with people in a courteous and considerate manner.

It is a public job dealing with members of the public and a judge must have an ability to deal with people in a courteous and considerate manner.<\/p> <p>  I have set them out in amendment No. 124.

Essentially, the new section 7(3) would require that the net be case a little wider.  There is no question of anyone who is not qualified and who does not meet the merit proposal being appointed.  However, the short list of persons who could be appointed would have to include at least one person who satisfies the diversity criteria.  I think this is quite a low threshold.  In fact, I do not believe the Minister or anyone else would be satisfied if the Judicial Appointments Commission was producing short lists that were exclusively made up of middle-aged white men.  I do not think that would be satisfactory for the purposes of what we are trying to achieve and I am of the view that if we address it by means of casting the net wider, then at that point the commission may appoint whoever it wishes to appoint.  That is the separate issue but it is forcing the commission to cast the net wider and that is entirely in keeping with the spirit of and intention behind the legislation.  It is for this reason that the amendment, as worded, is valuable.

His amendment is stronger than mine in some ways but both seek to achieve the same thing.  In respect of amendment No. 19 and the debate regarding the term &quot;feasible and practicable&quot;, the issue here that, under paragraphs (a) and (b), there is an objective to have equal numbers of men and women and to reflect diversity.  However, it is only in the provision relating to diversity that we include the caveat &quot;feasible and practicable&quot;.  What I am saying is that if it is not necessary to include the &quot;feasible and practicable&quot; bit with regard to the equal numbers of men and women, which is also an objective, why is it included in the context of diversity?  It is putting it down the pecking order.  I do not think there is any merit to it at all.  I do not think it is a big deal.  It is only putting it on an equal footing.  I would not have thought that was controversial at all.<\/p><p>In terms of the other one about merit and diversity, this is putting them on an equal footing.  I think that is important.  Senator Michael McDowell, who is one of the biggest critics of this Bill in the Seanad, made the point that he did not understand why we needed diversity at all because we have loads of excellent judges as matters stand.  In their submission, the judges said that diversity is a non-issue but that proves the point.  The fact that one has to make the argument for diversity shows that the nature of privilege is not being understood here.  I will put one quote on the record because I think it is very relevant.  It is from Dr. Laura Cahillane in UCC who said:<\/p><blockquote>Diversity is not about expecting different decisions than those that are given now but about providing equality of opportunity, democratic legitimacy, which feeds into public confidence that judges are representative of the community as a whole and can understand a vast array of issues, and also about providing diversity of opinion and divergent views.<\/blockquote> <p>In order to have that kind of equality of opportunity, we must ensure a diverse Judiciary.  I am glad to see stuff from the Bar Council and the Law Society of Ireland to the effect that there is a responsibility to get more people into the profession from those sections, so it not singly the responsibility of this Bill but it is key.  It is as equally as important as merit and not of lesser consideration.  That is not to say that people who are not qualified and do not have an understanding of the law should be given positions.  Nobody is arguing for that but it is saying that it is at least as important that people would have a broad range of experience of different cultural backgrounds and so on.  That is what we are trying to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018011700002#R00400","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1516184400,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Before I invite the Minister to speak, I note that it is now 1.04 p.m.  We only have the use of this facility until 1.15 p.m.  I wish to be able to address the rescheduling of the resumption of Committee Stage and, as a result, we may not be able to proceed to take each of these amendments.

Amendment No. 124 proposes to insert into section 38 a requirement that the commission ascertain which candidates for judicial office demonstrate specified qualities and characteristics and also have regard to the necessity for candidates to possess specified legal skills or competencies.  I have a number of difficulties with the amendment.  I am concerned that it would have the effect of detracting from the prevalence of the merit principle in section 7.  The latter establishes clearly that recommendations be based on merit and that merit assumes full consideration of equality as between men and women and diversity within the population.  The very detailed provisions in the amendment could be construed as overriding the crucial section 7 principles and objectives.  I invite Deputy O'Callaghan to agree that there are issues relating to what is a very wide-ranging amendment that go beyond merit.  I refer specifically to subparagraph (viii) concerning sensibility and cultural sensitivity.  There is also reference to \"sound temperament and common sense\" in subparagraph (iv).  I am not saying that these are not important.  However, I am saying that we have gone beyond the section 7 merit principle.<\/p> <p>  The amendment is simply too prescriptive and comprehensive to have an application in primary law.  It also runs contrary to the approach in Part 8 of the Bill, which tasks the procedures committee with defining and drawing up statements of skills, competencies, personal attributes and characteristics that an aspirant for judicial office must possess.  The Bill recognises that different statements may apply to different judicial offices and different classes of business.  If people read section 55 (5) and (6), they will see that we have covered much of the import of Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment without actually specifying matters in the detail into which he goes.  In the circumstances, going into such detail is problematic.  Section 55(6) sets out clearly for the procedures committee some specific issues to which regard should be had at the design stage.  I refer here to knowledge of the law, the proper and efficient conduct of proceedings, decision-making and awareness of the needs of those persons who use the courts.  I am of the view that this is sufficient.  The Bill recognises the different statements that may apply to various judicial offices.  There is a danger that what is proposed in Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment could prove too onerous should all of these issues become part of the legislative process.  In the UK - or at least in England and Wales - the Judicial Appointments Commission has developed merit criteria.<\/p><p>It deals with, for example, intellectual capacity and personal qualities of sound judgment, objectivity, decisiveness, an ability to understand and deal fairly, authority, and efficiency.
