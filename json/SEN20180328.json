I would like to ask the Minister for Education and Skills for a comprehensive update on when a permanent structure for the gaelscoil in Kinsale will be built.  The school has been working out of prefabs since 2003.  In this day and age, that is totally unacceptable.  The prefabs have deteriorated rapidly in the past two years.  One of the prefabs in the gaelscoil was abandoned during the winter because of its condition.  There was a leaking roof and water came into the toilet and the senior infants' room.  In this day and age, it is totally unacceptable to have a school of prefabs in which the senior infants' classroom is abandoned because of the condition of the prefab.  We need to get clarity on where the site will be.  We need clarity on when the site will be developed.<\/p> <p>We probably have two options.  We could have a new site, the position of which is to be decided, or we could build on the original site where the prefabs are.  The Department is working with Cork County Council on locating a site.  The issue is urgent.  An exceptionally expensive regime has been put in place to maintain a school of prefabs.  We have seen that this year with one prefab being abandoned.  We really need to see two things now.  We need clarity on what the Department proposes to do.  Does it propose to build on the original site where the prefabs are or will it work with the local authority to find another site to get zoned and built?  That is the first step.  We need clarity on where the site will be and when it will happen.<\/p> <p>The other thing we need rapidly is a major financial programme to ensure the prefabs are brought into proper nick.  It is a huge issue for us.  The electrical, engineering and roofing contractors that are required to keep the school up and running is an expensive regime for the school.  It has to be recognised.  The board of management and particularly the parents' association have been trying to work with everyone to ensure the conditions in the school are appropriate.  They are doing a fantastic job.  We need the Department to help the school board of management with finances.  It is unbelievable to think we have been waiting five, six or seven years to get the school up and running.  There have been major improvements in schools throughout the country.  Unfortunately this one has lagged behind.  To have a school of prefabs is unacceptable.  Clarity on the site is required.  Financial support is required to help the board of management to ensure the conditions in the school can be improved.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State talk to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, about the issue?  There needs to be a meeting.  The Department needs to meet with the school.  There has to be a concerted effort at the local authority to find a suitable site and it must be fast-tracked.  The site is the key to solving the issue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#A00500","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Lombard for raising this very important issue.

If they are old, they are too warm in the summer and too cold in the winter while school authorities experience many problems with leaking roofs, etc.  They cause many problems.  The Minister for Education and Skills rang me last night and asked me to take the debate on his behalf as he has urgent business to attend to this morning.  I will convey sentiments and issues raised by the Senator to him.  I asked him on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills to clarify the position in respect of the development of permanent accommodation for Gaelscoil Cionn tS&aacute;ile, Kinsale.  The Gaelscoil is a primary co-educational all-Irish school.  It is currently located in temporary accommodation and a project to provide for a new permanent school building is included in the Department&rsquo;s six-year capital programme.<\/p><p>Officials in the Department have engaged with Cork County Council officials under the memorandum of understanding for the acquisition of schools sites with a view to identifying and acquiring a suitable site to accommodate a permanent school building for Gaelscoil Chionn tS&aacute;ile.  Under the memorandum, local authorities assist the Department with the process of identifying and acquiring sites for the development of school accommodation.  The first step in this process is the identification of suitable sites by the local authority.  The identified sites are then technically assessed on a joint basis by officials from the local authority and the Department&rsquo;s professional and technical staff.  The Senator will appreciate the importance of a thorough appraisal of site options at this point to ensure the achievement of value for money and to minimise the potential of any issues arising during the planning and development stages.<\/p><p>In the case of Gaelscoil Chionn tS&aacute;ile, further to assessment of options, the Department identified a potentially suitable site and made offers to acquire land for the school as far back as 2016.  However an acquisition was not achieved at that time because after lengthy negotiations, ultimately agreement was not reached.  That happens from time to time, particularly given the price of land.  Matters have progressed in the meantime.  The site on which the school is currently located in temporary accommodation was zoned for community-educational use in the Bandon-Kinsale municipal district local area plan adopted in August 2017.  Specific reference was made within the local area plan to the fact that the Gaelscoil is currently operating in a prefabricated building and is in need of a purpose-built unit.  The local area plan further states: \"The site at Cappagh is zoned for educational use and allows for expansion at this facility.\"<\/p><p>Cork County Council, on behalf of the Department, is currently engaging with the landowner to progress matters.  The Department's objective is to acquire a suitable site for the school as quickly as possible and it is working in conjunction with the council to meet that objective.  It is difficult to indicate a timeline for the completion of the acquisition of a site for the school, as it is dependent on the outcome of current negotiations and on the complexity of the conveyancing process.  However, I assure the Senator that the acquisition of a site for this school is a priority for the Department and officials are working to progress matters as quickly as possible.  Once a site has been acquired, the project can progress to architectural planning.  The Minister has taken a special interest in this case because the Senator has met him on a number of occasions and constantly reminds him of the urgent need for the school.  I will convey his sincere concerns about the school to the Minister.  I know what it is like for students to be housed in outdated accommodated that needs to be upgraded.  Officials have been in contact with the school authorities to arrange a meeting with a view to updating the school on the progress with regard to the site acquisition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#A00600","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response to the issue.

As he may know, calls for inclusive and robust relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and social, personal and health education, SPHE, curricula have been made for some time.  It is has come to the fore in recent months, having been reflected in the ancillary recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly and Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and it is the top priority of the LGBTI+ youth strategy for which 4,000 respondents made a similar call.  It has become apparent that the current model is not fit for purpose.  The ad hoc nature of SPHE and RSE is failing to fully equip young people with positive and informed outlooks on their sexual health, self-care, body image, relationships, gender identity, contraception, consent and sexuality.  For young people, who are learning how to have relationships and going through their formative years, the value of teaching positive ideals to them will shape their outlooks throughout their lives.This is not the case when elements are excluded.  When LGBTQI young people or young people with disabilities are excluded from these conversations, they are forced to attempt to piece together an informed, but potentially distorted, view of relationships and sexuality from a one-size-fits-all model that is delivered in a heterosexual and able-bodied context in the hope of staying safe.  When consent is excluded from the conversation, we fail to teach young people how to respect another's boundaries or give confidence in asserting their own.<\/p><p>I have worked with the Senators Grace O&lsquo;Sullivan and Lynn Ruane on this issue for almost a year, meeting a variety of different teachers, students, groups and organisations to understand how we could bring about robust and inclusive curricula.  First, there is a major obstacle in legislation, namely the Education Act 1998, which determines that ethos-based schools can essentially derogate from certain aspects of a curriculum that they believe contravene the &quot;characteristic spirit&quot; of a school.While the Department has issued circulars stating that schools are required to teach &quot;all aspects of family planning, STIs and sexual orientations&quot;, they also should also uphold the ethos of the school.  The issue is that this creates a grey area and many schools either act with indifference, omission or direct defiance of this circular, leaving teachers too afraid or vulnerable to suggest inclusive elements.  This is a constant theme.<\/p><p>Furthermore, many teachers do not feel supported, adequately trained, resourced and insisted upon to teach all aspects of SPHE and RSE.  They feel that, by and large, schools treat it as a box-ticking exercise and a distraction from core subjects, and do not appreciate its potential.  Many teachers have received no formal training and what we are hearing is that the curriculum is <i>ad hoc <\/i>and, in practice, lacks formal characteristics.  Not all ethos-based schools confine the SPHE and RSE models to heterosexuality and many work hard to ensure their pupils are informed in an inclusive setting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#B00400","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.

A separate RSE programme is in place for senior cycle.<\/p><p>The right of schools to uphold their ethos and characteristic spirit is protected in a number of laws and the Department recognises that RSE will be delivered within the characteristic spirit of the school.  The school's RSE policy, which should be developed and reviewed in partnership with parents and, as appropriate, students, should clarify how RSE is to be provided in accordance with the ethos of the school.  It remains a requirement, however, that all aspects of the RSE curriculum, including those relating to sexual orientation, contraception and sexually transmitted infections, should be covered.<\/p><p>At post-primary level, all schools are required to provide an RSE programme as part of SPHE for all students from first year to sixth year.  Where students are not taking SPHE at senior cycle the RSE programme is still mandatory.<\/p><p>Through RSE, formal opportunities are provided for students to acquire knowledge and understanding of human sexuality.  While gender and orientation are not explicitly designated topics in the SPHE syllabuses, those syllabuses provide opportunities for teachers to explore such issues at an age-appropriate level.  The topics included are intended to develop in students respect for their own sexuality and the sexuality of others.<\/p><p>The Department's SPHE support service, which is now integrated with the professional development service for teachers, has worked collaboratively with GLEN, BelongTo and the HSE to develop the resource, entitled Growing up Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender.   This resource is for use by RSE classes at both junior and senior cycle levels.  It includes lesson plans which support students to achieve a better understanding of the concepts of gender identity and transgender.  The menu of in-service courses and supports offered by the PDST to schools also includes the topics of sexual orientation and homophobic bullying.<\/p><p>Regarding primary curriculum provision, the SPHE course is designed to foster in the child a sense of care and respect for himself, herself and others, an understanding of his or her sexuality, and an appreciation of the dignity of every human being.<\/p><p>As children progress through the SPHE programme, they encounter a wide range of issues.  These include substance misuse, relationships, sexuality, child abuse prevention, prejudice and discrimination.  The SPHE curriculum is structured in such a way that these issues are not explored in isolation; rather the emphasis is on building a foundation of skills, values, attitudes and understanding relevant to all these issues, with specific information provided where necessary.<\/p><p>I again thank the Senator for raising the issue and I will convey his concerns to the Minister, Deputy Bruton.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#B00500","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for agreeing to convey the sentiment.

It is a pressing and urgent matter that needs to be heard by the Minister for Education and Skills and his officials.  It relates to a school I attended, St. Declan's community college in Kilmacthomas, which serves the entire mid-County Waterford area.<\/p> <p>Established as a vocational school in the 1970s, St. Declan's college is one of the huge success stories of the vocational educational system.  It has been successful across many areas, including academia, vocations in jobs, in producing graduates and high performance in sports.  The school will participate in an all-Ireland colleges football final on Saturday against a school from Ardee in County Louth.  The school also produces excellent graduates who go into technology and engineering throughout the region and indeed the country.  I am very proud of the school and the vocational educational system should also be very proud of it.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, it is now a victim of its own success.  Student numbers have risen steadily since it was established.  Credit for this is due to the current and former principals, and the current and former staff of the school.  Today I think of people like my former teachers, Se&aacute;n Ahern and Jim Timmins, who were teachers, and deputy principal and principal at the school.  Unfortunately both of them have now gone to their eternal rest.  They would be very proud to see the school's present success.<\/p> <p>For the coming school year in September 2018 more than 170 applications for enrolment have been made.  The school normally enrols 120 students each year.  Over recent years it has projected increases and in 2015 it applied for additional accommodation.  The school has gone to enormous lengths to accommodate the additional applications this year and 150 students have been accepted for September 2018.  However, that leaves 21 students and their parents very concerned and frustrated because they have not been accepted even though they come from immediate feeder schools.<\/p> <p>Almost ten of those students come from Kilmacthomas primary school which is next door to the secondary school.  A few more come from Newtown national school, which is only 5 km up the road and more come from Kill national school.  The nearest alternative secondary school for any of these students is 20 km away, which would mean longer days, costly bus trips and all the other issues associated with ferrying students to and from school.  It is causing enormous stress to the students.<\/p> <p>I am asking for the Minister of State's support for my request that the Department of Education and Skills provide the urgent additional accommodation to meet the needs of the school, now and for the years ahead.  It is a successful school.  It deserves support on merit.  I hope I will get good news this morning that the school will receive funding for the additional accommodation so that all the students who live in the area, some of them attending primary school right next door, get the support they need and can access the school in September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#C00500","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter.

An indicative analysis indicates that the school authority is enrolling pupils from a number of schools outside its school planning area.  On school admissions, parents can choose to which school they wish to apply and, where it has places available, the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than the number of places available, a selection process may be necessary.  The selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and applied fairly for all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.<\/p><p>In order to plan for school provision, the demographic data for the Kilmacthomas school planning area, like other school planning areas nationwide, are being kept under ongoing review by the Department of Education and Skills to take account of updated child benefit and enrolment data.  Where the demographic data indicate that additional provision is required, its delivery is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on circumstances, be delivered through either one or a combination of the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools; extending the capacity of a school or schools; or the provision of a new school or schools.<\/p><p>I will convey the Senator's concerns to the Minister.

I have heard anecdotally teachers in training are teaching leaving certificate subjects, which is unfair and not right.  Teacher shortages are crippling our education system.  The number of people going on to teacher training courses is also falling due to their long duration and the lack of income over the course.  I have raised the issue of public sector recruitment and retention before.  It is hitting the education system very hard.  It is time the Minister took action and made this a priority.<\/p> <p>AIB claims that 4,000 of its tracker mortgage customers have not suffered financially.  It says that had those customers been on a tracker rate, it would have been 7.9% and would not have been any lower than the variable rate.  This is not credible.  We know anecdotally that AIB tracker customers were paying less than 2% over that period.  The bank has also agreed to pay 1% in compensation and &euro;615 towards legal fees.  This is scandalous.

I hope the Bill will journey quickly through to Report and Final Stages.<\/p> <p>I want to talk about an interesting development known as Clare's Law, which has come into force in Northern Ireland.  It allows women to ask the police if their partner has a history of violence against women.  It arose from a case in England where a woman, Clare Wood, was murdered by her former partner.  She was unaware of his previous history of violence against women.<\/p> <p>Under this system, if a woman fears for her safety due to her partner's behaviour, she can ask the police about his history.  The most innovative aspect of this is that the application can be made online.  This means that a vulnerable woman does not have to make the physical journey to a police station.  The PSNI then has a duty to inform the woman of any knowledge of behaviour which could pose a risk.  It aims to have this information within 40 days but this can happen quicker if there is a serious risk present.<\/p> <p>Another innovative aspect is that concerned family members and friends can also ask for this information.  It is all about giving women the information to make decisions about their own relationships.  I welcome this because so many times, we hear where abusive partners of women in particular, although I acknowledge that it often happens to men, have had previous abusive relationships of which the women are unaware.<\/p> <p>In Northern Ireland, women and their relatives and friends can inform themselves about this.  Sometimes it can be easier to spot the abusive behavioural signs from the outside and people watching a situation from the outside can now get this information.  I welcome that.  I look forward to the passing of the Domestic Violence Bill here.  The introduction of Clare's Law in this State should be looked at and it should be used as part of an all-island approach to addressing the issue of violence against women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#H00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Members will be aware that the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, is having its annual conference.  Serious concerns have been expressed by that body about the Government's foot dragging over responding to a landmark Council of Europe decision a couple of years ago relating to trade union rights for the AGSI, a right that should and could be very easily applied not just to representative bodies of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but also to representative bodies representing the interests of members of the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>This issue has been raised time and again by Senator Craughwell and I.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has provided the AGSI and other analogous bodies with a certain degree of limited access to the WRC and the Labour Court but that is to miss the point.  In its landmark decision, the Council of Europe made it very clear that there was no reason in international law why full trade union and collective bargaining rights should be denied to organisations like the AGSI.<\/p> <p>The idea that providing full trade union and collective bargaining rights to an organisation like the AGSI would jeopardise the security of the State is entirely bogus.  The reality across Europe is that there is a trend towards awarding the very fundamental rights to be an active member of a trade union and to be represented by one to members of police and defence forces but those rights are being denied to rank and file and more senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and members of the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>It is important that this House works to vindicate those rights that are enshrined in international law.  It is extremely disappointing that yet again, a Minister for Justice and Equality attends the AGSI conference and the foot dragging on this important issue continues.

What we have witnessed since the successful outcome of the referendum on Catalonian independence has been the unmasking of an authoritarian Spanish state.  From rejecting the democratic will of the Catalan people to the use of brutal violence to suppress their civil rights to locking up its political leaders, the Spanish state is now abusing its judicial institutions to prosecute innocent political leaders who it perceives as a threat to its law and order.  The judicial system is not a place for political conflicts to be resolved.  Political differences are resolved through dialogue and the ballot box, which is precisely what the Catalan people did when they democratically voted for independence.<\/p> <p>The continued repression of Catalan democracy is reprehensible and counterproductive.  The arrest of Charles Puigdemont and the violent response of the Spanish police to the protests that followed have highlighted that the Spanish Government is firmly wedded to a policy of aggression.  The dispute between the people of Catalonia and the Spanish state over independence will not be resolved by incarceration and violence.  The mask has slipped when it comes to the Spanish state, and its institutionalised authoritarianism and anti-democratic nature have been exposed.  This has also exposed the European Union's lack of empathy and a lack of desire for true human rights in the Union.  The EU has a duty to move with urgency.  It must show leadership in convincing the Spanish Government that dialogue and mediation are the only way to resolve this crisis.

In the course of my contribution last night, I referred to my daughter's early arrival.  She was born at 26 weeks.  When I checked what I had said, I did not realise I had said she was born at 20 weeks, instead of at 26 weeks.<\/p> <p>I take this opportunity to wish everybody a happy Easter.  Many teachers are on holidays, but they are paid during the holiday period.  However, the providers of, and those working in, the early years sector do not get paid during the holiday period.  The early years sector is suffering because the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is marking them as different, even though they play a significant role in our children's education.  The early years sector is faced with increasing difficulties.  We are talking a great deal about fairness and equality but we need to look at this sector and do something about fairness in it.  The Government introduced the Children First Act 2015 and provided an overview of child welfare and protection in Children First - National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2017.  Every early childhood education and care service in Ireland must provide child protection training for staff and develop a child safeguarding statement for the premises.  While primary school teachers can avail of time off to undertake this training, the training must be completed by early years staff in their own time.  A great deal was made some years ago about the ECCE scheme, allowing parents free access to child care.  The capitation rate is &euro;64.50 per child for 38 weeks but that level of funding does not come close to covering the cost of delivering the scheme.  While the sector experienced an upsurge in the number of parents being able to send their children to this all-important stage of education, the providers suffer because they must constantly make up the shortfall even to the extent of taking no pay.  This is the truth.  At times the providers are not paid for their services.  They must process all the paperwork and do everything for the Department in their own time and at their own expense.  More needs to be done to invest in this service.  The provider gives a high quality child care service.  It is not enough to provide funding to parents.  Funding needs to be applied to keep the services open or the initial funding will not work.  Early years service staff are now recognised as qualified professionals but they are not paid nearly enough.  County Carlow has one of the highest percentage of qualified early years staff, yet many of them cannot afford to live on the wages they are being offered.  That worries me.  This sector is so poorly paid that often graduates from early education working in the sector have to find employment somewhere else.<\/p> <p>I will be requesting that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs comes to the House.  I know the issue has been addressed in the Seanad before but this unfair system needs to be addressed.  More investment in the early years sector is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#K00100","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the issue of funding for research.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>during the week Professor Orla Hardiman spoke about her research on motor neurone disease.  It is not a good diagnosis to be told that one has motor neurone disease and the prognosis is always bad.  They call it a 1,000 day illness, so most people will live for up to 1,000 days but one never knows when one gets the diagnosis at what point of the 1,000 days one is at.  Some people such as Stephen Hawking live a great deal longer.  Professor Hardiman is very optimistic that in her working life a drug will be found that will help people who are suffering with motor neurone disease.  I would like the Leader to ask the Minister to come to the House so that we can have a debate on funding for Professor Orla Hardiman's research and also for the Irish Motor Neuron Disease Association, which provides a service around the country for patients and their families.  There are only three motor neurone disease specialist nurses in this country.  They are all funded by the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association, and not by the State.  I would like a debate on motor neurone disease in this Chamber.<\/p><p>I am grateful to the Members of the Oireachtas who have supported coffee mornings and the fashion show that was run by the former Member, Mr. Jimmy Deenihan, to raise funds for the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and for research.  The charity should not have to do that and it should be provided for by the State.  I really would welcome a debate and it would be a fitting tribute to people who have died from the disease or those who get a diagnosis in the coming years.  We must remember that several Members, not just one who was dear to my heart, have died from motor neurone disease.<\/p><p>With that in mind, I co-hosted a briefing in the AV room with Senator Kevin Humphreys with the Parkinson's Association of Ireland, which is amazing.  Similar to the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association, it is looking for funding for research, running the association and things that can be done around the country to prevent the HSE having to get involved to the extent that it does.  There are 12,000 people in the country with Parkinson's disease.  That number is expected to double in the coming years.  We need to put money in place to look after these people.

The reason I am interested in Parkinson's disease is because of a great friend in County Waterford who was a good looking man of 6 ft 2 in and a terrific athlete but who 12 years ago, when he was in his early 40s, got Parkinson's disease.  He died just about six weeks ago.  In the end he had a catastrophic decline.  Like many people with Parkinson's disease, he became quite isolated and he rejected social interconnection.  I had to go down to Waterford and chivvy him along and take him to a fish restaurant and make him laugh.<\/p> <p>One of the things that impressed me at the presentation this morning was a man called Garry who had early onset Parkinson's and what was so striking about him, and I think Senator McFadden will agree with me on this, was that he spoke about the excellence of the service delivered by the HSE.  I have had experience as a cancer patient of the HSE.  I cannot speaking highly enough of it.  So often we hear nothing but unending criticisms of the health service in this country.  Like Garry I, too, found the service was excellent.  The difficulty is getting into the system.  Once one is in the system, it is outstanding.  It must be terribly disheartening for people in the health service to hear unending negative comment, carping, criticism and so on.  Much of the time the public is responsible themselves.  There is a note in St. Vincent's hospital, detailing the thousands of appointment that were missed.  People did not bother turning up.  How can a service operate efficiently if people do not turn up for their appointments?<\/p> <p>I thank the health service personnel.  They are absolutely excellent and professional in the delivery of the services, once one gets into the system.

Many schools have difficulties when they come to recruit home economics teachers.  I have heard of situations where retired teachers have to come back into the system because we do not have the throughput of students studying home economics.  St. Angela's College in Sligo is the main college for home economics.  It has 80 places for students this year.  It had 100 places last year but it dropped the number by 20 places.  To drop places when we have such a dearth of home economics teacher coming through the system makes no sense.  It changed the profile of the students and the courses they can take.  Traditionally one could do the course by taking biology, Irish, religion and economics.  Now economics has been dropped.  That is a problem because the removal of those 20 places will impact on the system.  After the junior certificate examination, young students must put a career path in place.  The college has changed the curriculum in the past four weeks.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->People who have been looking towards the course for two years received notification that it has been cancelled and that is a problem.

We need to have a debate about the lack of these teachers and what needs to happen.  The course needs more students to go through it because we have a shortage.  I hope the Leader will raise the issue with the Department of Education and Skills and maybe the Minister will come to the Chamber to discuss what the long-term plans are for home economics teachers.  Unless we get home economics teachers through the system, the shortage will continue to exist.  The current system of having retired teachers coming in makes no logical sense at all.  There is a gap that needs to be filled.  The only way to fill it is to do one of two things: increase the numbers in St. Angela's College or have another college put on the same course.

We often criticise the HSE but we do not often compliment it on the good work it does.  I fully support the comments made by Senator Norris.  Consultants have raised issues with the congenital heart unit at the Mater Hospital.  The number of patients with heart defects going through that unit has increased significantly.  Consultants say they are finding it difficult to cope with the volume of people coming through.  Every year approximately 400 people transition into adult care once they reach the age of 16.  That has increased the number and the unit has 2,500 people on its books.  The complexities of dealing with people with heart defects means it is a slow and tedious exercise.  The unit only has two part-time consultants.  They have no secretary and there are two or three nurses.  They have claimed that these issues limit their capacity and ability to do their jobs properly because they cannot access outpatient clinics.  They have limited access to scanning machines which are all vital to detect heart defects, which I said earlier is very complex.  There are currently 2,500 people on their books.  They are saying they cannot cope.  The result of that is people's lives are being put at risk.

It is important that AIB is held to account for all of this.  It has been accused of concocting a notional tracker rate of 7.9% which affects 4,000 people.  The bank has agreed it was wrong to deny people the option to switch.  The Central Bank has extended and included that cohort of people in its ongoing tracker mortgage examination.  There should be a code of conduct for banks.  They are and should be about the customer, not just about profit for the bank.  I agree with Senator Ardagh that it is important to treat customers fairly and that they are given the right information.  The Central Bank has said customers can engage with the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and that the compensation paid can be banked and will not be lost.  It is unfair of the bank to treat customers wrongly.  It should be very fair in that.  I agree with Senator Ardagh on that.  <\/p> <p>On the issue of education which was raised by Senator Ardagh and Senator Lombard, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, announced a number of recruitment package measures earlier this spring to address issues in science, home economics and the Irish language.  Senator Lombard raised the issue of home economics.  The number of places in St. Angela's College in Sligo has been increased.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has convened a specialist group dealing with teacher supply which had its first meeting this week on the matter.  We have forthcoming conferences of the teachers' unions over Easter.  It is important we look at the issue of pay inequality.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, as the Minister with responsibility for education, has prioritised investment in education where we have seen investment of up to &euro;1 billion in the past two years.  There is an issue of pay inequality.  Those of us who have been in the education world and who have been in the classroom recognise the importance of pay equality.  We have seen an increase of more than 5,000 additional posts in the past two years.  I hope we can see further progression on the road to equality of pay for teachers.  I thank all of our teachers for the work they do and wish them well in their conferences next week.  It is important we resume that debate after the teachers' conferences because we will hear from a number of the unions about the issues affecting teachers.  It is important in tandem with pay that we continue to augment the work of teachers with the increase in special needs assistants, that we continue to create and build new schools and invest in facilities in our education sphere, whether third or second level.<\/p> <p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of addiction services in Cork and the need for a detox centre there.  I agree with the Senator's comments.  Huge work is being done in Cork by organisations like Fellowship House, Tabor Lodge and Arbour House and there is a need for a continuation of investment in addiction services under the national drugs and alcohol strategy through the HSE and other organisations.  There is a huge need for detox beds and step-down facilities to be made available.  I commend all those who work in the services because it is important that if any deficits exist in the programmes, whether in Cork or any part of the country, that we reach out and work through organisations like Arbour House and Tabor Lodge.  I am quite happy to have that debate.  Perhaps it would be best to raise it as a Commencement matter.  The Senator also raised the issue of education which I have addressed.<\/p> <p>I join with Senator Conway-Walsh in welcoming the passage of the Domestic Violence Bill and hope it is enacted quickly.  The Senator raised the issue of Clare's Law and it is one we should give consideration to.  It is important that we not only protect women, but also men who are in relationships and dating relationships, and provide information and protection to all people.  <\/p> <p>Senator Nash raised the issue of the AGSI conference and its decision to form a union.  As the House is aware, these issues arose in the past with regard to the Workplace Relations Commission.  The Garda associations were given direct access to pay determination mechanisms which allowed them to participate in and engage on an equal basis with other public sector representative bodies.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Nash said it is not necessarily about being able to have trade union status.  At the time the Minister created a working group under the chairmanship of Mr. John Murphy which presented its first report on the issue.  It stated that Garda associations should not transition to become trade unions and noted that trade union status was not necessary for them to access the WRC and the Labour Court or to represent their members. <br\/><br\/>Another working group was established which is now in its second phase.  I do not think it is a question of procrastination or delaying the process.  Rather, it is about trying to find a mechanism whereby we can allow members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to have access to mechanisms of the State.  The Minister wants to work with the Garda on building a stable industrial relations framework so that we can work together.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House regarding that issue.<br\/><br\/>Senators Byrne, Norris and McFadden congratulated Senators Humphreys and McFadden on their very important briefing today.  I apologise for not attending.  Parkinson's disease and motor neurone disease are very much to the fore today in our communities, in part because of the tremendous advocacy work done by the Parkinson's Association and the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association.  I agree with Senator Byrne that there is a need to look at the issue of specialist nurse positions and neurology.  Senator McFadden is correct.  The State has a duty to provide services and should not expect the voluntary sector alone to provide them.<br\/><br\/>I am not privy to the heads of the Bill to which Senator McDowell referred.  The Minister referred to it in his speech yesterday and outlined his thematic approach to the publication of his policy paper in March.  He brought the heads of the Bill to Cabinet yesterday.  As the Senator knows, the Bill is a separate issue.  I am sure if the Minister is asked about it on Committee Stage today, he will be happy to enlighten the House.  It is important that in tandem with the referendum Bill, there is a debate on what the Minister and the Government are proposing.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mulherin raised the issue of eating disorders.  It is very important issue which we need to address.  A lot of investment has taken place across the country in various units and organisations.  There is a difference of approach in terms of how eating disorders are treated.  Community settings are recommended.  The Government and the HSE have invested in services for obesity and eating disorders.  I would be happy to have a debate following the Easter recess.<br\/><br\/>Senator Gavan raised the issue of Catalonia.  I wish him well with the briefing tomorrow.  I will not make any comment on the affairs of another country.  It is important that we have an informed debate on what is happening in Catalonia.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter.<br\/><br\/>Senator Higgens missed my contribution on data protection.  There will not be a guillotine <i>per se<\/i>.  We have already had 15 hours of debate and there will be another four hours today, which brings the total to 19 hours.  The Senator said the debate might not finish today.  I am happy to resume it and I will not curtail it.  There were four hours allocated to the debate in order to give structure to Members.<br\/><br\/>Like Senator Feighan, I welcomed the passage by the House of Lords yesterday of the Northern Ireland marriage equality legislation.  I join with him in welcoming the invitation issued by the Brexit committee to Secretary of State, David Davis, yesterday.  I hope he takes it up.  All members of the House of Commons and House of Lords should visit the Border to see what it means in real terms.  It is not an imaginary border; it will have a significant impact.  We must ensure there is no hard border.  There is a duty on the United Kingdom to bring forward a solution because it is it which voted to leave.  In saying that, the best way forward is to extend an invitation to the UK Brexit committee to address the Seanad and meet us in order to continue to explore ways in which we can overcome the issue.<br\/><br\/>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of early years education.  As she knows, the Government has invested highly in that sector over the past five years, and that continues.  A universal subsidy for children has been introduced, but the issue she raised in terms of pay and conditions for those who work in the sector is a contentious issue and one we must all work to try to address.  A balance needs to be struck between parents, providers and workers, a balance which I would support.  We are lucky that the quality of our early years education is so high.  I agree with the Senator that the issue needs to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>Senator Gallagher referred to the Mater Private Hospital.  I am not aware of the issue, but I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House.  It is a complex issue.  If the Senator has information, perhaps he could table a Commencement matter.  That might be a quicker way of getting an answer.  The issue needs to be addressed.  <br\/><br\/>If the debate on data protection has not concluded by the end of the allocated time I am happy to allow it to roll over if the need arises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#L01200","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1522229400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Croatian Delegation","time":1522229400,"counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#M00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I am sure Members of the House will wish to join me in welcoming Ms Marija Pejinovi Buri, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign and European Affairs of the Republic of Croatia.

Whether we like it, the Supreme Court has ruled that the only protection for the unborn is in the Constitution, not anywhere else.  There is zilch otherwise.  The Bill proposes the holding of a referendum to allow for the removal of that protection and not replace it with anything, but, worse than that, it proposes to follow its removal with a Bill providing for abortion without restriction up to 12 weeks and, in some specific instances, beyond that time period.  Again, we should think of the position in Britain.  We do not want to go down that road, as 9 million abortions have taken place there to date.  We are the living; thanks be to God, our mothers gave us life and allowed us to be born, but we are now being asked to pass judgment on the most defenceless in society - future citizens who should feel safe in their mothers' wombs.  For the life of me, I cannot understand how anyone could extinguish the life of their own flesh and blood.  We have to pause and think very carefully, as legislators, about what we are about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#P01000","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>As I alluded to in my contribution on Second Stage last night, the Bill seeks to take out the protection for the unborn, the life of which is equal to that of the mother, and replace it with the words, \"Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy\".  What exactly do those words mean?  They mean that any Parliament, either this one or another in the future, will be able to set guidelines.  We are told that the period will be 12 weeks, but it could be increased to six or seven months.  There will be nothing to prevent that from happening if we take out the provision in Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution and replace it with the line of words proposed.  That is exactly what they mean.  In the future provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy without limit.  If the referendum is successful as I hope and believe it will not be, the protection provided will be taken out of the Constitution and replaced by that line of words.   What will the period be down the road?  It will be 12 weeks at a minimum, but what will the maximum period be?  That is my concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#P01100","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I commend and thank him for his very powerful words last night both in opening and closing the debate on Second Stage and expressing such powerful reasons we should support the Bill.  I am glad that it was passed on Second Stage in the Seanad last night by 35 votes to 10.  I very much hope we will see it being swiftly passed by a resounding majority today once we get through Committee and Remaining Stages.  I did not intend to speak because I had the opportunity to make a contribution on Second Stage last night, as did my colleagues, but I cannot listen to the scaremongering by those who oppose the Bill.  There are some points that need to be made and facts and legal truths about which we need to speak about what the Bill will mean if it is passed and if the referendum is passed at the end of May.  <\/p> <p>There will be no legal vacuum if the referendum is passed.  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 will remain in force and abortion will remain prohibited, except where necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman.  As we know, strict and stringent criteria are laid down in the 2013 Act which provide for when doctors may intervene in such circumstances.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Oireachtas may amend or repeal that legislation if the eighth amendment is removed from the Constitution.  However, as the Minister made clear last night and all Senators know to be true, any Bill put through the Oireachtas will be subject to normal parliamentary scrutiny.<br\/><br\/>The Government has put forward detailed proposals for the legislation it will introduce and the Labour Party will be happy to support its Bill, which will be debated in full in both Houses, as is our duty as legislators.  The legislation amounts to a very sensible, evidence based set of legal criteria and a very strict and robust legal framework to provide women with the caring and compassionate health care they clearly need.<br\/><br\/>The 12 weeks proposal is one that is rooted in medical evidence presented to the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and of the doctors with whom the Minister has been consulting since the joint committee concluded.  The Minister and his officials have worked hard to produce robust legislation that is in line with legislation in other countries.  The 12 weeks figure is not plucked from the air.  As far back as the Roe <i>v<\/i>. Wade case, Mr. Justice Harry Blackmun in his wonderful judgment spoke about the first trimester.  It is medically different and also the period in which medical abortion, namely, the abortion pill, may be used.  The 12-week period has been chosen for all sorts of reasons.  It has not been plucked from the air and it is not a period that can be extended at whim, as some Senators appear to suggest.  It is a very clear demarcation and there is no proposal from anywhere to extend it in any way.  The Minister outlined strict rules that will apply even within the first trimester period, including the provision for a 72-hour consultation period.  He also stated clearly that late term abortion will be prohibited.  Dr. Peter Boylan has also spoken clearly on this issue and referred to the need for neonatal teams and specialists to be present if viability is an issue.  This will be built into the legislation. <br\/><br\/>I support the comments of the Minister and those of other speakers that the Bill will not open floodgates.  Opponents of the 2013 Act and naysayers argued that it would open floodgates and women would lie routinely to secure access to abortion.  This has not happened.  Only 77 women or 25 or 26 per year have had an abortion since 2013 and abortion is carried out only where it is necessary to save their lives.  We will pass sensible, compassionate legislation that will not open floodgates and will meet the needs of Irish women if this referendum is passed.  I will do my best and work as hard as I can to ensure it is passed.  I thank the Minister again and apologise again for speaking for so long on Committee Stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#P01200","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I reassure Senator Bacik in case she needs any reassurance that she should not feel any embarrassment about making a contribution that she believes is necessary on Committee Stage.

Already today in the corridors of this House, I was scolded by a member of the Government for daring to say that politicians cannot be trusted on this issue.  The person in question is very nice by the way and I will not name him for fear I will be accused of attacking him.  The reason I say this is that across the western world, and in this country also, politicians say one thing at election time, as the Government party did but do a different thing when political convenience seems to indicate.  All along, politicians have been reassuring ordinary folk that they support the right to life of the unborn as well as top medical care for mothers.  They go on journeys without consulting two sides of the story and on which they seem to believe in listening to only one side of the story.  To give an example of this latest twisting and turning, one Minister's proposal that a two thirds majority be required for any changes to abortion legislation in future was shot down by the Attorney General and the Government.  There was no credibility to the position of the politician in question in any case because we was already in favour of repeal, which gives politicians a blank cheque for however much abortion they wish.<\/p> <p>If the Government was serious about the kind of caution the Minister for Health would like us to believe the Government would exercise, they need look no further than Article 12.10.4&deg; of the Constitution, which does not relate to the life of the unborn but to the political life of the President.  They could have easily proposed a formula of words to the constitutional amendment providing that no such law, that is, a law regulating abortion, shall be approved by either of the Houses of the Oireachtas save upon a resolution of that House supported by not less than two thirds of the total membership thereof.  The concept exists, provided one provides for it in the Constitution.  It is not my proposal because once the eighth amendment has been repealed, there will be no protection for the baby in any case and the law the Minister is proposing is so extreme and permissive as to make my point without me having to make it. <\/p> <p>What I am trying to say is that the Government is not serious about restricting abortion.  It says it is and shoots down the T&aacute;naiste's proposal when, if it so wished, it could perfectly easily and democratically provide for a blocking minority.  That is just one example of the argumentation that seeks to reassure but is not grounded in fact.  I make that point because it is relevant on Committee Stage.  I am not making a proposal on Committee Stage to amend the constitutional provision.  I am opposed to it in principle because it is fundamentally against authentic human rights. <\/p> <p>Senator Diarmuid Wilson deserves tremendous credit for undermining, in his typically understated and slightly mischievous way, the arguments of those who say that to oppose even putting the issue to the people is an undemocratic act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#Q01500","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Of course it is undemocratic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#Q01600","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":112,"content":"<p>That was an attempt to corral people who believe there is something fundamentally wrong with asking a question that would remove human rights and an attempt to portray such people as anti-democratic.
