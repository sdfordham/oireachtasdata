I would like to ask the Minister for Education and Skills for a comprehensive update on when a permanent structure for the gaelscoil in Kinsale will be built.  The school has been working out of prefabs since 2003.  In this day and age, that is totally unacceptable.  The prefabs have deteriorated rapidly in the past two years.  One of the prefabs in the gaelscoil was abandoned during the winter because of its condition.  There was a leaking roof and water came into the toilet and the senior infants' room.  In this day and age, it is totally unacceptable to have a school of prefabs in which the senior infants' classroom is abandoned because of the condition of the prefab.  We need to get clarity on where the site will be.  We need clarity on when the site will be developed.<\/p> <p>We probably have two options.  We could have a new site, the position of which is to be decided, or we could build on the original site where the prefabs are.  The Department is working with Cork County Council on locating a site.  The issue is urgent.  An exceptionally expensive regime has been put in place to maintain a school of prefabs.  We have seen that this year with one prefab being abandoned.  We really need to see two things now.  We need clarity on what the Department proposes to do.  Does it propose to build on the original site where the prefabs are or will it work with the local authority to find another site to get zoned and built?  That is the first step.  We need clarity on where the site will be and when it will happen.<\/p> <p>The other thing we need rapidly is a major financial programme to ensure the prefabs are brought into proper nick.  It is a huge issue for us.  The electrical, engineering and roofing contractors that are required to keep the school up and running is an expensive regime for the school.  It has to be recognised.  The board of management and particularly the parents' association have been trying to work with everyone to ensure the conditions in the school are appropriate.  They are doing a fantastic job.  We need the Department to help the school board of management with finances.  It is unbelievable to think we have been waiting five, six or seven years to get the school up and running.  There have been major improvements in schools throughout the country.  Unfortunately this one has lagged behind.  To have a school of prefabs is unacceptable.  Clarity on the site is required.  Financial support is required to help the board of management to ensure the conditions in the school can be improved.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State talk to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, about the issue?  There needs to be a meeting.  The Department needs to meet with the school.  There has to be a concerted effort at the local authority to find a suitable site and it must be fast-tracked.  The site is the key to solving the issue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#A00500","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Lombard for raising this very important issue.

If they are old, they are too warm in the summer and too cold in the winter while school authorities experience many problems with leaking roofs, etc.  They cause many problems.  The Minister for Education and Skills rang me last night and asked me to take the debate on his behalf as he has urgent business to attend to this morning.  I will convey sentiments and issues raised by the Senator to him.  I asked him on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills to clarify the position in respect of the development of permanent accommodation for Gaelscoil Cionn tS&aacute;ile, Kinsale.  The Gaelscoil is a primary co-educational all-Irish school.  It is currently located in temporary accommodation and a project to provide for a new permanent school building is included in the Department&rsquo;s six-year capital programme.<\/p><p>Officials in the Department have engaged with Cork County Council officials under the memorandum of understanding for the acquisition of schools sites with a view to identifying and acquiring a suitable site to accommodate a permanent school building for Gaelscoil Chionn tS&aacute;ile.  Under the memorandum, local authorities assist the Department with the process of identifying and acquiring sites for the development of school accommodation.  The first step in this process is the identification of suitable sites by the local authority.  The identified sites are then technically assessed on a joint basis by officials from the local authority and the Department&rsquo;s professional and technical staff.  The Senator will appreciate the importance of a thorough appraisal of site options at this point to ensure the achievement of value for money and to minimise the potential of any issues arising during the planning and development stages.<\/p><p>In the case of Gaelscoil Chionn tS&aacute;ile, further to assessment of options, the Department identified a potentially suitable site and made offers to acquire land for the school as far back as 2016.  However an acquisition was not achieved at that time because after lengthy negotiations, ultimately agreement was not reached.  That happens from time to time, particularly given the price of land.  Matters have progressed in the meantime.  The site on which the school is currently located in temporary accommodation was zoned for community-educational use in the Bandon-Kinsale municipal district local area plan adopted in August 2017.  Specific reference was made within the local area plan to the fact that the Gaelscoil is currently operating in a prefabricated building and is in need of a purpose-built unit.  The local area plan further states: \"The site at Cappagh is zoned for educational use and allows for expansion at this facility.\"<\/p><p>Cork County Council, on behalf of the Department, is currently engaging with the landowner to progress matters.  The Department's objective is to acquire a suitable site for the school as quickly as possible and it is working in conjunction with the council to meet that objective.  It is difficult to indicate a timeline for the completion of the acquisition of a site for the school, as it is dependent on the outcome of current negotiations and on the complexity of the conveyancing process.  However, I assure the Senator that the acquisition of a site for this school is a priority for the Department and officials are working to progress matters as quickly as possible.  Once a site has been acquired, the project can progress to architectural planning.  The Minister has taken a special interest in this case because the Senator has met him on a number of occasions and constantly reminds him of the urgent need for the school.  I will convey his sincere concerns about the school to the Minister.  I know what it is like for students to be housed in outdated accommodated that needs to be upgraded.  Officials have been in contact with the school authorities to arrange a meeting with a view to updating the school on the progress with regard to the site acquisition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#A00600","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response to the issue.

As he may know, calls for inclusive and robust relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and social, personal and health education, SPHE, curricula have been made for some time.  It is has come to the fore in recent months, having been reflected in the ancillary recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly and Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and it is the top priority of the LGBTI+ youth strategy for which 4,000 respondents made a similar call.  It has become apparent that the current model is not fit for purpose.  The ad hoc nature of SPHE and RSE is failing to fully equip young people with positive and informed outlooks on their sexual health, self-care, body image, relationships, gender identity, contraception, consent and sexuality.  For young people, who are learning how to have relationships and going through their formative years, the value of teaching positive ideals to them will shape their outlooks throughout their lives.This is not the case when elements are excluded.  When LGBTQI young people or young people with disabilities are excluded from these conversations, they are forced to attempt to piece together an informed, but potentially distorted, view of relationships and sexuality from a one-size-fits-all model that is delivered in a heterosexual and able-bodied context in the hope of staying safe.  When consent is excluded from the conversation, we fail to teach young people how to respect another's boundaries or give confidence in asserting their own.<\/p><p>I have worked with the Senators Grace O&lsquo;Sullivan and Lynn Ruane on this issue for almost a year, meeting a variety of different teachers, students, groups and organisations to understand how we could bring about robust and inclusive curricula.  First, there is a major obstacle in legislation, namely the Education Act 1998, which determines that ethos-based schools can essentially derogate from certain aspects of a curriculum that they believe contravene the &quot;characteristic spirit&quot; of a school.While the Department has issued circulars stating that schools are required to teach &quot;all aspects of family planning, STIs and sexual orientations&quot;, they also should also uphold the ethos of the school.  The issue is that this creates a grey area and many schools either act with indifference, omission or direct defiance of this circular, leaving teachers too afraid or vulnerable to suggest inclusive elements.  This is a constant theme.<\/p><p>Furthermore, many teachers do not feel supported, adequately trained, resourced and insisted upon to teach all aspects of SPHE and RSE.  They feel that, by and large, schools treat it as a box-ticking exercise and a distraction from core subjects, and do not appreciate its potential.  Many teachers have received no formal training and what we are hearing is that the curriculum is <i>ad hoc <\/i>and, in practice, lacks formal characteristics.  Not all ethos-based schools confine the SPHE and RSE models to heterosexuality and many work hard to ensure their pupils are informed in an inclusive setting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#B00400","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.

I will get back to him regarding the issue that has been raised.<\/p> <p>Section 9(b) of the Education Act 1998 requires schools to provide the curriculum as prescribed by the Department.

A separate RSE programme is in place for senior cycle.<\/p><p>The right of schools to uphold their ethos and characteristic spirit is protected in a number of laws and the Department recognises that RSE will be delivered within the characteristic spirit of the school.  The school's RSE policy, which should be developed and reviewed in partnership with parents and, as appropriate, students, should clarify how RSE is to be provided in accordance with the ethos of the school.  It remains a requirement, however, that all aspects of the RSE curriculum, including those relating to sexual orientation, contraception and sexually transmitted infections, should be covered.<\/p><p>At post-primary level, all schools are required to provide an RSE programme as part of SPHE for all students from first year to sixth year.  Where students are not taking SPHE at senior cycle the RSE programme is still mandatory.<\/p><p>Through RSE, formal opportunities are provided for students to acquire knowledge and understanding of human sexuality.  While gender and orientation are not explicitly designated topics in the SPHE syllabuses, those syllabuses provide opportunities for teachers to explore such issues at an age-appropriate level.  The topics included are intended to develop in students respect for their own sexuality and the sexuality of others.<\/p><p>The Department's SPHE support service, which is now integrated with the professional development service for teachers, has worked collaboratively with GLEN, BelongTo and the HSE to develop the resource, entitled Growing up Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender.   This resource is for use by RSE classes at both junior and senior cycle levels.  It includes lesson plans which support students to achieve a better understanding of the concepts of gender identity and transgender.  The menu of in-service courses and supports offered by the PDST to schools also includes the topics of sexual orientation and homophobic bullying.<\/p><p>Regarding primary curriculum provision, the SPHE course is designed to foster in the child a sense of care and respect for himself, herself and others, an understanding of his or her sexuality, and an appreciation of the dignity of every human being.<\/p><p>As children progress through the SPHE programme, they encounter a wide range of issues.  These include substance misuse, relationships, sexuality, child abuse prevention, prejudice and discrimination.  The SPHE curriculum is structured in such a way that these issues are not explored in isolation; rather the emphasis is on building a foundation of skills, values, attitudes and understanding relevant to all these issues, with specific information provided where necessary.<\/p><p>I again thank the Senator for raising the issue and I will convey his concerns to the Minister, Deputy Bruton.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#B00500","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for agreeing to convey the sentiment.

It is a pressing and urgent matter that needs to be heard by the Minister for Education and Skills and his officials.  It relates to a school I attended, St. Declan's community college in Kilmacthomas, which serves the entire mid-County Waterford area.<\/p> <p>Established as a vocational school in the 1970s, St. Declan's college is one of the huge success stories of the vocational educational system.  It has been successful across many areas, including academia, vocations in jobs, in producing graduates and high performance in sports.  The school will participate in an all-Ireland colleges football final on Saturday against a school from Ardee in County Louth.  The school also produces excellent graduates who go into technology and engineering throughout the region and indeed the country.  I am very proud of the school and the vocational educational system should also be very proud of it.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, it is now a victim of its own success.  Student numbers have risen steadily since it was established.  Credit for this is due to the current and former principals, and the current and former staff of the school.  Today I think of people like my former teachers, Se&aacute;n Ahern and Jim Timmins, who were teachers, and deputy principal and principal at the school.  Unfortunately both of them have now gone to their eternal rest.  They would be very proud to see the school's present success.<\/p> <p>For the coming school year in September 2018 more than 170 applications for enrolment have been made.  The school normally enrols 120 students each year.  Over recent years it has projected increases and in 2015 it applied for additional accommodation.  The school has gone to enormous lengths to accommodate the additional applications this year and 150 students have been accepted for September 2018.  However, that leaves 21 students and their parents very concerned and frustrated because they have not been accepted even though they come from immediate feeder schools.<\/p> <p>Almost ten of those students come from Kilmacthomas primary school which is next door to the secondary school.  A few more come from Newtown national school, which is only 5 km up the road and more come from Kill national school.  The nearest alternative secondary school for any of these students is 20 km away, which would mean longer days, costly bus trips and all the other issues associated with ferrying students to and from school.  It is causing enormous stress to the students.<\/p> <p>I am asking for the Minister of State's support for my request that the Department of Education and Skills provide the urgent additional accommodation to meet the needs of the school, now and for the years ahead.  It is a successful school.  It deserves support on merit.  I hope I will get good news this morning that the school will receive funding for the additional accommodation so that all the students who live in the area, some of them attending primary school right next door, get the support they need and can access the school in September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#C00500","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter.

An indicative analysis indicates that the school authority is enrolling pupils from a number of schools outside its school planning area.  On school admissions, parents can choose to which school they wish to apply and, where it has places available, the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than the number of places available, a selection process may be necessary.  The selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and applied fairly for all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.<\/p><p>In order to plan for school provision, the demographic data for the Kilmacthomas school planning area, like other school planning areas nationwide, are being kept under ongoing review by the Department of Education and Skills to take account of updated child benefit and enrolment data.  Where the demographic data indicate that additional provision is required, its delivery is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on circumstances, be delivered through either one or a combination of the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools; extending the capacity of a school or schools; or the provision of a new school or schools.<\/p><p>I will convey the Senator's concerns to the Minister.

I have heard anecdotally teachers in training are teaching leaving certificate subjects, which is unfair and not right.  Teacher shortages are crippling our education system.  The number of people going on to teacher training courses is also falling due to their long duration and the lack of income over the course.  I have raised the issue of public sector recruitment and retention before.  It is hitting the education system very hard.  It is time the Minister took action and made this a priority.<\/p> <p>AIB claims that 4,000 of its tracker mortgage customers have not suffered financially.  It says that had those customers been on a tracker rate, it would have been 7.9% and would not have been any lower than the variable rate.  This is not credible.  We know anecdotally that AIB tracker customers were paying less than 2% over that period.  The bank has also agreed to pay 1% in compensation and &euro;615 towards legal fees.  This is scandalous.

I hope the Bill will journey quickly through to Report and Final Stages.<\/p> <p>I want to talk about an interesting development known as Clare's Law, which has come into force in Northern Ireland.  It allows women to ask the police if their partner has a history of violence against women.  It arose from a case in England where a woman, Clare Wood, was murdered by her former partner.  She was unaware of his previous history of violence against women.<\/p> <p>Under this system, if a woman fears for her safety due to her partner's behaviour, she can ask the police about his history.  The most innovative aspect of this is that the application can be made online.  This means that a vulnerable woman does not have to make the physical journey to a police station.  The PSNI then has a duty to inform the woman of any knowledge of behaviour which could pose a risk.  It aims to have this information within 40 days but this can happen quicker if there is a serious risk present.<\/p> <p>Another innovative aspect is that concerned family members and friends can also ask for this information.  It is all about giving women the information to make decisions about their own relationships.  I welcome this because so many times, we hear where abusive partners of women in particular, although I acknowledge that it often happens to men, have had previous abusive relationships of which the women are unaware.<\/p> <p>In Northern Ireland, women and their relatives and friends can inform themselves about this.  Sometimes it can be easier to spot the abusive behavioural signs from the outside and people watching a situation from the outside can now get this information.  I welcome that.  I look forward to the passing of the Domestic Violence Bill here.  The introduction of Clare's Law in this State should be looked at and it should be used as part of an all-island approach to addressing the issue of violence against women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#H00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Members will be aware that the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, is having its annual conference.  Serious concerns have been expressed by that body about the Government's foot dragging over responding to a landmark Council of Europe decision a couple of years ago relating to trade union rights for the AGSI, a right that should and could be very easily applied not just to representative bodies of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but also to representative bodies representing the interests of members of the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>This issue has been raised time and again by Senator Craughwell and I.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has provided the AGSI and other analogous bodies with a certain degree of limited access to the WRC and the Labour Court but that is to miss the point.  In its landmark decision, the Council of Europe made it very clear that there was no reason in international law why full trade union and collective bargaining rights should be denied to organisations like the AGSI.<\/p> <p>The idea that providing full trade union and collective bargaining rights to an organisation like the AGSI would jeopardise the security of the State is entirely bogus.  The reality across Europe is that there is a trend towards awarding the very fundamental rights to be an active member of a trade union and to be represented by one to members of police and defence forces but those rights are being denied to rank and file and more senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and members of the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>It is important that this House works to vindicate those rights that are enshrined in international law.  It is extremely disappointing that yet again, a Minister for Justice and Equality attends the AGSI conference and the foot dragging on this important issue continues.

What we have witnessed since the successful outcome of the referendum on Catalonian independence has been the unmasking of an authoritarian Spanish state.  From rejecting the democratic will of the Catalan people to the use of brutal violence to suppress their civil rights to locking up its political leaders, the Spanish state is now abusing its judicial institutions to prosecute innocent political leaders who it perceives as a threat to its law and order.  The judicial system is not a place for political conflicts to be resolved.  Political differences are resolved through dialogue and the ballot box, which is precisely what the Catalan people did when they democratically voted for independence.<\/p> <p>The continued repression of Catalan democracy is reprehensible and counterproductive.  The arrest of Charles Puigdemont and the violent response of the Spanish police to the protests that followed have highlighted that the Spanish Government is firmly wedded to a policy of aggression.  The dispute between the people of Catalonia and the Spanish state over independence will not be resolved by incarceration and violence.  The mask has slipped when it comes to the Spanish state, and its institutionalised authoritarianism and anti-democratic nature have been exposed.  This has also exposed the European Union's lack of empathy and a lack of desire for true human rights in the Union.  The EU has a duty to move with urgency.  It must show leadership in convincing the Spanish Government that dialogue and mediation are the only way to resolve this crisis.

In the course of my contribution last night, I referred to my daughter's early arrival.  She was born at 26 weeks.  When I checked what I had said, I did not realise I had said she was born at 20 weeks, instead of at 26 weeks.<\/p> <p>I take this opportunity to wish everybody a happy Easter.  Many teachers are on holidays, but they are paid during the holiday period.  However, the providers of, and those working in, the early years sector do not get paid during the holiday period.  The early years sector is suffering because the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is marking them as different, even though they play a significant role in our children's education.  The early years sector is faced with increasing difficulties.  We are talking a great deal about fairness and equality but we need to look at this sector and do something about fairness in it.  The Government introduced the Children First Act 2015 and provided an overview of child welfare and protection in Children First - National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2017.  Every early childhood education and care service in Ireland must provide child protection training for staff and develop a child safeguarding statement for the premises.  While primary school teachers can avail of time off to undertake this training, the training must be completed by early years staff in their own time.  A great deal was made some years ago about the ECCE scheme, allowing parents free access to child care.  The capitation rate is &euro;64.50 per child for 38 weeks but that level of funding does not come close to covering the cost of delivering the scheme.  While the sector experienced an upsurge in the number of parents being able to send their children to this all-important stage of education, the providers suffer because they must constantly make up the shortfall even to the extent of taking no pay.  This is the truth.  At times the providers are not paid for their services.  They must process all the paperwork and do everything for the Department in their own time and at their own expense.  More needs to be done to invest in this service.  The provider gives a high quality child care service.  It is not enough to provide funding to parents.  Funding needs to be applied to keep the services open or the initial funding will not work.  Early years service staff are now recognised as qualified professionals but they are not paid nearly enough.  County Carlow has one of the highest percentage of qualified early years staff, yet many of them cannot afford to live on the wages they are being offered.  That worries me.  This sector is so poorly paid that often graduates from early education working in the sector have to find employment somewhere else.<\/p> <p>I will be requesting that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs comes to the House.  I know the issue has been addressed in the Seanad before but this unfair system needs to be addressed.  More investment in the early years sector is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#K00100","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the issue of funding for research.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>during the week Professor Orla Hardiman spoke about her research on motor neurone disease.  It is not a good diagnosis to be told that one has motor neurone disease and the prognosis is always bad.  They call it a 1,000 day illness, so most people will live for up to 1,000 days but one never knows when one gets the diagnosis at what point of the 1,000 days one is at.  Some people such as Stephen Hawking live a great deal longer.  Professor Hardiman is very optimistic that in her working life a drug will be found that will help people who are suffering with motor neurone disease.  I would like the Leader to ask the Minister to come to the House so that we can have a debate on funding for Professor Orla Hardiman's research and also for the Irish Motor Neuron Disease Association, which provides a service around the country for patients and their families.  There are only three motor neurone disease specialist nurses in this country.  They are all funded by the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association, and not by the State.  I would like a debate on motor neurone disease in this Chamber.<\/p><p>I am grateful to the Members of the Oireachtas who have supported coffee mornings and the fashion show that was run by the former Member, Mr. Jimmy Deenihan, to raise funds for the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and for research.  The charity should not have to do that and it should be provided for by the State.  I really would welcome a debate and it would be a fitting tribute to people who have died from the disease or those who get a diagnosis in the coming years.  We must remember that several Members, not just one who was dear to my heart, have died from motor neurone disease.<\/p><p>With that in mind, I co-hosted a briefing in the AV room with Senator Kevin Humphreys with the Parkinson's Association of Ireland, which is amazing.  Similar to the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association, it is looking for funding for research, running the association and things that can be done around the country to prevent the HSE having to get involved to the extent that it does.  There are 12,000 people in the country with Parkinson's disease.  That number is expected to double in the coming years.  We need to put money in place to look after these people.

The reason I am interested in Parkinson's disease is because of a great friend in County Waterford who was a good looking man of 6 ft 2 in and a terrific athlete but who 12 years ago, when he was in his early 40s, got Parkinson's disease.  He died just about six weeks ago.  In the end he had a catastrophic decline.  Like many people with Parkinson's disease, he became quite isolated and he rejected social interconnection.  I had to go down to Waterford and chivvy him along and take him to a fish restaurant and make him laugh.<\/p> <p>One of the things that impressed me at the presentation this morning was a man called Garry who had early onset Parkinson's and what was so striking about him, and I think Senator McFadden will agree with me on this, was that he spoke about the excellence of the service delivered by the HSE.  I have had experience as a cancer patient of the HSE.  I cannot speaking highly enough of it.  So often we hear nothing but unending criticisms of the health service in this country.  Like Garry I, too, found the service was excellent.  The difficulty is getting into the system.  Once one is in the system, it is outstanding.  It must be terribly disheartening for people in the health service to hear unending negative comment, carping, criticism and so on.  Much of the time the public is responsible themselves.  There is a note in St. Vincent's hospital, detailing the thousands of appointment that were missed.  People did not bother turning up.  How can a service operate efficiently if people do not turn up for their appointments?<\/p> <p>I thank the health service personnel.  They are absolutely excellent and professional in the delivery of the services, once one gets into the system.

Many schools have difficulties when they come to recruit home economics teachers.  I have heard of situations where retired teachers have to come back into the system because we do not have the throughput of students studying home economics.  St. Angela's College in Sligo is the main college for home economics.  It has 80 places for students this year.  It had 100 places last year but it dropped the number by 20 places.  To drop places when we have such a dearth of home economics teacher coming through the system makes no sense.  It changed the profile of the students and the courses they can take.  Traditionally one could do the course by taking biology, Irish, religion and economics.  Now economics has been dropped.  That is a problem because the removal of those 20 places will impact on the system.  After the junior certificate examination, young students must put a career path in place.  The college has changed the curriculum in the past four weeks.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->People who have been looking towards the course for two years received notification that it has been cancelled and that is a problem.

We need to have a debate about the lack of these teachers and what needs to happen.  The course needs more students to go through it because we have a shortage.  I hope the Leader will raise the issue with the Department of Education and Skills and maybe the Minister will come to the Chamber to discuss what the long-term plans are for home economics teachers.  Unless we get home economics teachers through the system, the shortage will continue to exist.  The current system of having retired teachers coming in makes no logical sense at all.  There is a gap that needs to be filled.  The only way to fill it is to do one of two things: increase the numbers in St. Angela's College or have another college put on the same course.

We often criticise the HSE but we do not often compliment it on the good work it does.  I fully support the comments made by Senator Norris.  Consultants have raised issues with the congenital heart unit at the Mater Hospital.  The number of patients with heart defects going through that unit has increased significantly.  Consultants say they are finding it difficult to cope with the volume of people coming through.  Every year approximately 400 people transition into adult care once they reach the age of 16.  That has increased the number and the unit has 2,500 people on its books.  The complexities of dealing with people with heart defects means it is a slow and tedious exercise.  The unit only has two part-time consultants.  They have no secretary and there are two or three nurses.  They have claimed that these issues limit their capacity and ability to do their jobs properly because they cannot access outpatient clinics.  They have limited access to scanning machines which are all vital to detect heart defects, which I said earlier is very complex.  There are currently 2,500 people on their books.  They are saying they cannot cope.  The result of that is people's lives are being put at risk.

It is important that AIB is held to account for all of this.  It has been accused of concocting a notional tracker rate of 7.9% which affects 4,000 people.  The bank has agreed it was wrong to deny people the option to switch.  The Central Bank has extended and included that cohort of people in its ongoing tracker mortgage examination.  There should be a code of conduct for banks.  They are and should be about the customer, not just about profit for the bank.  I agree with Senator Ardagh that it is important to treat customers fairly and that they are given the right information.  The Central Bank has said customers can engage with the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and that the compensation paid can be banked and will not be lost.  It is unfair of the bank to treat customers wrongly.  It should be very fair in that.  I agree with Senator Ardagh on that.  <\/p> <p>On the issue of education which was raised by Senator Ardagh and Senator Lombard, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, announced a number of recruitment package measures earlier this spring to address issues in science, home economics and the Irish language.  Senator Lombard raised the issue of home economics.  The number of places in St. Angela's College in Sligo has been increased.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has convened a specialist group dealing with teacher supply which had its first meeting this week on the matter.  We have forthcoming conferences of the teachers' unions over Easter.  It is important we look at the issue of pay inequality.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, as the Minister with responsibility for education, has prioritised investment in education where we have seen investment of up to &euro;1 billion in the past two years.  There is an issue of pay inequality.  Those of us who have been in the education world and who have been in the classroom recognise the importance of pay equality.  We have seen an increase of more than 5,000 additional posts in the past two years.  I hope we can see further progression on the road to equality of pay for teachers.  I thank all of our teachers for the work they do and wish them well in their conferences next week.  It is important we resume that debate after the teachers' conferences because we will hear from a number of the unions about the issues affecting teachers.  It is important in tandem with pay that we continue to augment the work of teachers with the increase in special needs assistants, that we continue to create and build new schools and invest in facilities in our education sphere, whether third or second level.<\/p> <p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of addiction services in Cork and the need for a detox centre there.  I agree with the Senator's comments.  Huge work is being done in Cork by organisations like Fellowship House, Tabor Lodge and Arbour House and there is a need for a continuation of investment in addiction services under the national drugs and alcohol strategy through the HSE and other organisations.  There is a huge need for detox beds and step-down facilities to be made available.  I commend all those who work in the services because it is important that if any deficits exist in the programmes, whether in Cork or any part of the country, that we reach out and work through organisations like Arbour House and Tabor Lodge.  I am quite happy to have that debate.  Perhaps it would be best to raise it as a Commencement matter.  The Senator also raised the issue of education which I have addressed.<\/p> <p>I join with Senator Conway-Walsh in welcoming the passage of the Domestic Violence Bill and hope it is enacted quickly.  The Senator raised the issue of Clare's Law and it is one we should give consideration to.  It is important that we not only protect women, but also men who are in relationships and dating relationships, and provide information and protection to all people.  <\/p> <p>Senator Nash raised the issue of the AGSI conference and its decision to form a union.  As the House is aware, these issues arose in the past with regard to the Workplace Relations Commission.  The Garda associations were given direct access to pay determination mechanisms which allowed them to participate in and engage on an equal basis with other public sector representative bodies.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Nash said it is not necessarily about being able to have trade union status.  At the time the Minister created a working group under the chairmanship of Mr. John Murphy which presented its first report on the issue.  It stated that Garda associations should not transition to become trade unions and noted that trade union status was not necessary for them to access the WRC and the Labour Court or to represent their members. <br\/><br\/>Another working group was established which is now in its second phase.  I do not think it is a question of procrastination or delaying the process.  Rather, it is about trying to find a mechanism whereby we can allow members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to have access to mechanisms of the State.  The Minister wants to work with the Garda on building a stable industrial relations framework so that we can work together.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House regarding that issue.<br\/><br\/>Senators Byrne, Norris and McFadden congratulated Senators Humphreys and McFadden on their very important briefing today.  I apologise for not attending.  Parkinson's disease and motor neurone disease are very much to the fore today in our communities, in part because of the tremendous advocacy work done by the Parkinson's Association and the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association.  I agree with Senator Byrne that there is a need to look at the issue of specialist nurse positions and neurology.  Senator McFadden is correct.  The State has a duty to provide services and should not expect the voluntary sector alone to provide them.<br\/><br\/>I am not privy to the heads of the Bill to which Senator McDowell referred.  The Minister referred to it in his speech yesterday and outlined his thematic approach to the publication of his policy paper in March.  He brought the heads of the Bill to Cabinet yesterday.  As the Senator knows, the Bill is a separate issue.  I am sure if the Minister is asked about it on Committee Stage today, he will be happy to enlighten the House.  It is important that in tandem with the referendum Bill, there is a debate on what the Minister and the Government are proposing.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mulherin raised the issue of eating disorders.  It is very important issue which we need to address.  A lot of investment has taken place across the country in various units and organisations.  There is a difference of approach in terms of how eating disorders are treated.  Community settings are recommended.  The Government and the HSE have invested in services for obesity and eating disorders.  I would be happy to have a debate following the Easter recess.<br\/><br\/>Senator Gavan raised the issue of Catalonia.  I wish him well with the briefing tomorrow.  I will not make any comment on the affairs of another country.  It is important that we have an informed debate on what is happening in Catalonia.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter.<br\/><br\/>Senator Higgens missed my contribution on data protection.  There will not be a guillotine <i>per se<\/i>.  We have already had 15 hours of debate and there will be another four hours today, which brings the total to 19 hours.  The Senator said the debate might not finish today.  I am happy to resume it and I will not curtail it.  There were four hours allocated to the debate in order to give structure to Members.<br\/><br\/>Like Senator Feighan, I welcomed the passage by the House of Lords yesterday of the Northern Ireland marriage equality legislation.  I join with him in welcoming the invitation issued by the Brexit committee to Secretary of State, David Davis, yesterday.  I hope he takes it up.  All members of the House of Commons and House of Lords should visit the Border to see what it means in real terms.  It is not an imaginary border; it will have a significant impact.  We must ensure there is no hard border.  There is a duty on the United Kingdom to bring forward a solution because it is it which voted to leave.  In saying that, the best way forward is to extend an invitation to the UK Brexit committee to address the Seanad and meet us in order to continue to explore ways in which we can overcome the issue.<br\/><br\/>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of early years education.  As she knows, the Government has invested highly in that sector over the past five years, and that continues.  A universal subsidy for children has been introduced, but the issue she raised in terms of pay and conditions for those who work in the sector is a contentious issue and one we must all work to try to address.  A balance needs to be struck between parents, providers and workers, a balance which I would support.  We are lucky that the quality of our early years education is so high.  I agree with the Senator that the issue needs to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>Senator Gallagher referred to the Mater Private Hospital.  I am not aware of the issue, but I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House.  It is a complex issue.  If the Senator has information, perhaps he could table a Commencement matter.  That might be a quicker way of getting an answer.  The issue needs to be addressed.  <br\/><br\/>If the debate on data protection has not concluded by the end of the allocated time I am happy to allow it to roll over if the need arises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#L01200","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1522229400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Croatian Delegation","time":1522229400,"counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#M00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I am sure Members of the House will wish to join me in welcoming Ms Marija Pejinovi Buri, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign and European Affairs of the Republic of Croatia.

Whether we like it, the Supreme Court has ruled that the only protection for the unborn is in the Constitution, not anywhere else.  There is zilch otherwise.  The Bill proposes the holding of a referendum to allow for the removal of that protection and not replace it with anything, but, worse than that, it proposes to follow its removal with a Bill providing for abortion without restriction up to 12 weeks and, in some specific instances, beyond that time period.  Again, we should think of the position in Britain.  We do not want to go down that road, as 9 million abortions have taken place there to date.  We are the living; thanks be to God, our mothers gave us life and allowed us to be born, but we are now being asked to pass judgment on the most defenceless in society - future citizens who should feel safe in their mothers' wombs.  For the life of me, I cannot understand how anyone could extinguish the life of their own flesh and blood.

What exactly do those words mean?  They mean that any Parliament, either this one or another in the future, will be able to set guidelines.  We are told that the period will be 12 weeks, but it could be increased to six or seven months.  There will be nothing to prevent that from happening if we take out the provision in Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution and replace it with the line of words proposed.  That is exactly what they mean.  In the future provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy without limit.  If the referendum is successful as I hope and believe it will not be, the protection provided will be taken out of the Constitution and replaced by that line of words.

I commend and thank him for his very powerful words last night both in opening and closing the debate on Second Stage and expressing such powerful reasons we should support the Bill.  I am glad that it was passed on Second Stage in the Seanad last night by 35 votes to 10.  I very much hope we will see it being swiftly passed by a resounding majority today once we get through Committee and Remaining Stages.  I did not intend to speak because I had the opportunity to make a contribution on Second Stage last night, as did my colleagues, but I cannot listen to the scaremongering by those who oppose the Bill.  There are some points that need to be made and facts and legal truths about which we need to speak about what the Bill will mean if it is passed and if the referendum is passed at the end of May.  <\/p> <p>There will be no legal vacuum if the referendum is passed.  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 will remain in force and abortion will remain prohibited, except where necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman.  As we know, strict and stringent criteria are laid down in the 2013 Act which provide for when doctors may intervene in such circumstances.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Oireachtas may amend or repeal that legislation if the eighth amendment is removed from the Constitution.  However, as the Minister made clear last night and all Senators know to be true, any Bill put through the Oireachtas will be subject to normal parliamentary scrutiny.<br\/><br\/>The Government has put forward detailed proposals for the legislation it will introduce and the Labour Party will be happy to support its Bill, which will be debated in full in both Houses, as is our duty as legislators.  The legislation amounts to a very sensible, evidence based set of legal criteria and a very strict and robust legal framework to provide women with the caring and compassionate health care they clearly need.<br\/><br\/>The 12 weeks proposal is one that is rooted in medical evidence presented to the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and of the doctors with whom the Minister has been consulting since the joint committee concluded.  The Minister and his officials have worked hard to produce robust legislation that is in line with legislation in other countries.  The 12 weeks figure is not plucked from the air.  As far back as the Roe <i>v<\/i>. Wade case, Mr. Justice Harry Blackmun in his wonderful judgment spoke about the first trimester.  It is medically different and also the period in which medical abortion, namely, the abortion pill, may be used.  The 12-week period has been chosen for all sorts of reasons.  It has not been plucked from the air and it is not a period that can be extended at whim, as some Senators appear to suggest.  It is a very clear demarcation and there is no proposal from anywhere to extend it in any way.  The Minister outlined strict rules that will apply even within the first trimester period, including the provision for a 72-hour consultation period.  He also stated clearly that late term abortion will be prohibited.  Dr. Peter Boylan has also spoken clearly on this issue and referred to the need for neonatal teams and specialists to be present if viability is an issue.  This will be built into the legislation. <br\/><br\/>I support the comments of the Minister and those of other speakers that the Bill will not open floodgates.  Opponents of the 2013 Act and naysayers argued that it would open floodgates and women would lie routinely to secure access to abortion.  This has not happened.  Only 77 women or 25 or 26 per year have had an abortion since 2013 and abortion is carried out only where it is necessary to save their lives.  We will pass sensible, compassionate legislation that will not open floodgates and will meet the needs of Irish women if this referendum is passed.  I will do my best and work as hard as I can to ensure it is passed.  I thank the Minister again and apologise again for speaking for so long on Committee Stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#P01200","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I reassure Senator Bacik in case she needs any reassurance that she should not feel any embarrassment about making a contribution that she believes is necessary on Committee Stage.

Already today in the corridors of this House, I was scolded by a member of the Government for daring to say that politicians cannot be trusted on this issue.  The person in question is very nice by the way and I will not name him for fear I will be accused of attacking him.  The reason I say this is that across the western world, and in this country also, politicians say one thing at election time, as the Government party did but do a different thing when political convenience seems to indicate.  All along, politicians have been reassuring ordinary folk that they support the right to life of the unborn as well as top medical care for mothers.  They go on journeys without consulting two sides of the story and on which they seem to believe in listening to only one side of the story.  To give an example of this latest twisting and turning, one Minister's proposal that a two thirds majority be required for any changes to abortion legislation in future was shot down by the Attorney General and the Government.  There was no credibility to the position of the politician in question in any case because we was already in favour of repeal, which gives politicians a blank cheque for however much abortion they wish.<\/p> <p>If the Government was serious about the kind of caution the Minister for Health would like us to believe the Government would exercise, they need look no further than Article 12.10.4&deg; of the Constitution, which does not relate to the life of the unborn but to the political life of the President.  They could have easily proposed a formula of words to the constitutional amendment providing that no such law, that is, a law regulating abortion, shall be approved by either of the Houses of the Oireachtas save upon a resolution of that House supported by not less than two thirds of the total membership thereof.  The concept exists, provided one provides for it in the Constitution.  It is not my proposal because once the eighth amendment has been repealed, there will be no protection for the baby in any case and the law the Minister is proposing is so extreme and permissive as to make my point without me having to make it. <\/p> <p>What I am trying to say is that the Government is not serious about restricting abortion.  It says it is and shoots down the T&aacute;naiste's proposal when, if it so wished, it could perfectly easily and democratically provide for a blocking minority.  That is just one example of the argumentation that seeks to reassure but is not grounded in fact.  I make that point because it is relevant on Committee Stage.  I am not making a proposal on Committee Stage to amend the constitutional provision.  I am opposed to it in principle because it is fundamentally against authentic human rights. <\/p> <p>Senator Diarmuid Wilson deserves tremendous credit for undermining, in his typically understated and slightly mischievous way, the arguments of those who say that to oppose even putting the issue to the people is an undemocratic act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#Q01500","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Of course it is undemocratic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#Q01600","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>That was an attempt to corral people who believe there is something fundamentally wrong with asking a question that would remove human rights and an attempt to portray such people as anti-democratic.

A one day, two day or three day waiting period does not offer any meaningful protection for an unborn child, boy or girl, if one believes that it is a human being.  <\/p> <p>I also emphasise that the Minister sought to distinguish the law that the Government will bring forward in due course from the British law on the basis that it is now being proposed that, post-viability, there would not be a termination of the life of the baby.  I think that is what the Minister said.  What does he think it is like for an unborn child when they are brought into the world prematurely in situations like that?  I think they would be very sick.  The Minister should speak to the issue of what type of care he would envisage there.  It leaves a lot to be desired from a human rights perspective.<\/p> <p>The Minister does not seem to think that an abortion prior to viability is a late-term abortion.  What does he think it is?  One of the disadvantages of what we call a debate on this matter here is that we do not get answers to questions, we do not get to test each side's arguments to see if there is any substance to them.  I hope the upcoming debate will not only comprise one-on-one interviews with Ministers in studios and that there will be an opportunity to test what they are saying because sometimes what they say does not stand up.  I am sure the Minister has prepared his brief very well but my experience of the Government is that there has not been any listening to the women who felt betrayed by the abortion culture, who felt that they were not given the support they needed before they had their abortion and who went on to regret their abortions.  No attention seems to have been paid to the fact that the best research indicates it is not advisable to link abortion with a mental health ground, as they do in Britain yet the Minister proposes to do the exact same thing.  That research comes from people who have no problem with abortion in principle.  <\/p> <p>If I was in a studio debate with the Minister tomorrow and asked him about the developmental stages of the unborn, would he be able to tell me at what stage the pads for a baby's fingerprints start?  Would he be able to tell us that today?  I ask him that, with all due respect, because I note he has not acknowledged the humanity of the baby.  Are people who want to deny the humanity of the baby, and change our law such that there is no protection of any kind for them in the Constitution, interested in looking step by step at how the baby develops in the womb, that is, human life with potential, as I like to call it?

Senator Mullen put forward the argument that removing the eighth amendment from the Constitution does not future-proof the legislation against there being no term limits for abortion, but all his statement implies is that he does not trust women at any point during their pregnancy.  Women will put a limit on themselves.  We do not need politicians to say that seven months into a pregnancy is too far into it to have a termination, unless there is a risk to the woman's life or a fatal foetal abnormality.  Women do not make such a decision seven or eight months into a pregnancy.  We do not need to be future-proofed.  We know when it is appropriate to make that decision.  It will always be as early as possible but as late as necessary in extreme circumstances.  Therefore, we do not need future-proofing.<\/p> <p>All the Senator is doing is showing further mistrust for women's decisions and their ability to make good decisions for themselves and their families.  To not allow terminations up to 12 weeks in Ireland, which is an argument that has been put forward, the Senator is supporting what he is trying to fight against, namely, late-term abortions.  If women are not allowed early access to a termination in their own country, they are being forced to have a late-term abortion - about which the Senator is very much against - because they have to access travel to England.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#R00800","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#R00900","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Therefore, Senator Mullen is supporting late-term abortions in the stance that he has taken.<\/p> <p>I do not know what the phrase \"abortion culture\" means.

First, it has the effect of inserting the wording in the Schedule and, second, it has the effect of removing the existing wording from Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>of the Constitution.  In the ordinary course of events in this House the time available for each speaker on a Second Stage debate is naturally limited to eight limits, which is to ration out time fairly among us all, and I have no problem with that.<\/p><p>I would like to briefly develop a few points I made yesterday evening regarding Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>, which we are taking out of the Constitution, if we pass this legislation subject to the decision of the people.  First, I made the point that Article 40.3.3<sup>o  <\/sup>in its original form was inserted into the fundamental rights section of the Constitution in the Article headed &quot;Personal Rights&quot;.  In those circumstances we are dealing with what I believe was a misguided attempt to say that a fertilised ovum either prior to implantation or post implantation amounted to a person.  In my view, and I want to put this on the record of this House, that is not so.  Nobody in this House believes it is so.  If we believed that a fertilised ovum in an <i>in vitro<\/i>fertilisation, IVF, laboratory, where they are trying to assist a mother and father who are having difficulty in having children, was a person, there would be all sorts of different laws and things to be done.  If one ovum was selected and if we believed that was a person in that tank, and the others were disposed of or put into nitrous oxide to be frozen, that is one thing, but none of us actually accords the status of a person to a fertilised zygote.  Therefore, constitutionally, we are in a grey area.  That was the problem with Article 40.3.3<sup>o<\/sup>.  It decided to over-simplify the issue and to elevate the unborn, which it did not define, to the position of a person.  In doing so, it said that the right to life of a zygote, once implanted, as later decided by a court, was equal to the right to life of the foetus's mother.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not accept that proposition and I believe it was a falsehood and oversimplification put into the Constitution without working out precisely what it meant.  That was done in 1983, doubtless in good faith, but principally because the suspicion was that our Judiciary would do a Roe <i>v. <\/i>Wade and introduce abortion as a constitutional right and that the Judiciary was not to be trusted.<br\/><br\/>In 1992 there was the X case.  The girl in that case was the victim of a rape and was told by the Supreme Court that she could not leave Ireland for the purpose of having an abortion unless her life was under threat.  She could not go to England and her parents could not arrange for her to go to England and an injunction was available to prevent her going to England to have an abortion.  A young rape victim was told that the meaning of Article 40.3.3&deg;, as it then stood, was that she could not have an abortion.  I am particularly addressing the Senators who are conservative on this issue and I fully respect their rights to be conservative and do not think it is in any way undemocratic for them to vote against this, if that is their point of view.  Article 40.3.3&deg; meant that rape victims, once implantation had taken place, were obliged by the Constitution to carry that conception to full delivery unless they could prove, as was done in the X case, that there was an imminent threat of suicide if they were not allowed to have an abortion.  The idea of travel injunctions was enshrined by the Supreme Court in the X decision.  Let us not forget that point.<br\/><br\/>In 1992, when all of that became apparent, the people were horrified by the result.  The then Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, put three propositions to them, which was curious, and it was objected to at the time, but in retrospect it was probably just as well.  The first was should suicide be a ground for termination of a pregnancy in Ireland.  The Supreme Court had said it could happen here.  The second was should anybody be the subject of a travel injunction, again by reference to pregnancy or the intention to procure an abortion abroad.  The third proposition was should anybody in Ireland be denied information because there were student publications and the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, SPUC, at the time.  The question was whether it should be a crime to tell anybody in Ireland whether abortion was available outside Ireland.  It asked should it be a crime in this country to tell somebody, as in the case of Ms X, to go abroad and obtain the services of a place like the Marie Stopes clinic in England.  The people said no to the first proposition, that if somebody committed suicide, it could be held that we allowed it to happen by our vote in the referendum because abortion was not available here.  They voted to allow people leave Ireland to have an abortion.  I ask Senator Mullen and others, respectfully, through the Chair, if we really believed that an implanted foetus had the same rights as a born child, would we have amended our Constitution to allow parents to take that child to a clinic in England to have it killed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#R01200","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":127,"content":"<p>It is hypocrisy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#S00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":128,"content":"<p>All the Senators may have their views about the answer to that question.

Viewed barely, that is what I believe was happening.<\/p> <p>Even when all of that was done, there was a succession of cases, some of which I was involved in as Attorney General, others as a barrister, but I do not want to deal with them because I do not refer to cases I was involved in.  In some cases Article 40.3.3&deg;, notwithstanding the changes that have been made, affected for instance the position of a child in care, and whether the Irish courts or health boards would facilitate such a rape victim in care in going to Britain.  There was serious opposition at the time and some of it came from the pro-life movement, which was entitled to express its views.<\/p> <p>There have been trips to Strasbourg in respect of fatal foetal abnormalities and we are now addressing the issue fair and square.  Senators Wilson and Mullen ask what is so special about 12 weeks.  In one sense, whether it is 11 or 13, they are somewhat arbitrary time periods.  The medical truth, however, is that after three or four weeks it is a cluster of cells that is a couple of millimetres across.  It begins to pulsate, to circulate fluids to maintain its existence and development.  We are told that is a heartbeat but there is not really a heart at the earliest stage.  Up to eight or nine weeks we are dealing with a developing embryo, which grows from being tiny to being less than the size of a finger over several weeks.  That is the period we are dealing with, not a foetus such that any ordinary person looking at it, if it was miscarried, would say there is a person.  What a person would say in such sad circumstances is there was the seed, the potential, for a person to exist.  Many mothers have been in that sad position after miscarriages.  In my respectful view, the law should not be, and the Constitution should not have been, perverted to regard that foetus at that stage of development as a human person in the sense that we accord meaning to the term \"person\".<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I want to make the point about what this section is doing.  We are removing from the Constitution a very contradictory set of statements which started in 1983 with what I believe was an untrue statement that the unborn was a person with the same and equal rights as the mother which when it came up against legal realities in the X case had to be reversed by the people through a constitutional amendment to reverse the idea of equality and to say that we will treat the unborn differently from a born child.  That is what we did because, as I said earlier, nobody in his or her right mind would change the Constitution to say that parents can bring their born baby to England to have that baby killed.  Nobody would do it so the people actually were making their own judgment on these matters.  We have now got to the point where we see all the problems that still flow from the fundamental untruth that a zygote or foetus at an early stage of its development is to be regarded as an equal person compared with a child just about to be born.  We have got to that point where we must confront the problem which arises from that.  They are serious problems legally.  In all seriousness, what was wrong with Article 40.3.3&deg;, and the late Peter Sutherland pointed out what was wrong with it, was that it would inevitably have these consequences because it was not telling the truth and it was not admitting that we were dealing with a grey area.  It was saying it is black and white, it is simple, just vote for it, everything will be all right and there will never be abortion in Ireland.  It failed.  It is an obstruction.  I am not going to say the recent legislation is, to use the phrase, &quot;a dog's dinner&quot;, but it is not satisfactory and everybody knows it is not satisfactory and is not a maintainable or sustainable point of view.  Let us again remember the people who are against repeal of the eighth amendment vigorously opposed the legislation that was supposed to regularise the post-X case decision.  They were entitled to do so.  I do not criticise them for that but it is not as if the <i>status quo<\/i>is what they wanted to defend.  They want to defend a very different simplistic Article 40.3.3&deg; as they originally intended it to be.  I want to make the point that we are not simply putting in the wording to which we will return when we get to the Schedule.  We are removing Article 40.3.3&deg; and we are bringing Ireland back to the position in 1982.  It was not a bad position in one sense because the Legislature at that time had the freedom to deal with abortion, termination, rape and all the rest of it as it saw fit.  What was done in 1982 at the behest of people who were worried about a Roe <i>v.<\/i>Wade decision from the courts was to take away the power from the Legislature to bring in laws to deal with that situation.  I think that is a very serious problem.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mullen said last night that we have an infanticide law that differentiates between a mother in post-delivery and the rest of humanity when it comes to the law of homicide and takes account of post-natal depression.  It used to be on the basis of a crazy theory that it had something to do with the effect of lactation on the mother's mind.  What Senator Mullen said is true but it is still a crime.  What Senator Mullen advanced yesterday for our consideration was the possibility that with a humane and decent DPP, no girl would ever be prosecuted for taking the abortion pill.  I am saying that if we keep Article 40.3.3&deg;, which is a point I did not have time to make yesterday, we cannot decriminalise abortion.  The courts would say that this is unconstitutional.  We cannot say &quot;Ah, we'll turn a blind eye to this and turn a blind eye to that.&quot;  We cannot turn a blind eye.  If somebody gives somebody else an abortion pill, we cannot turn a blind eye to that set of facts and at the same time, claim that we are upholding the right of the unborn as far as is practicable and defending and vindicating that right.  We know that a girl was prosecuted in Belfast for taking the abortion pill because her flatmate got a pang of conscience and told the police about it and the poor girl was interviewed about it and admitted it.  She was prosecuted for that.  Let us not cod ourselves.  I say in all sincerity and with all conviction that what leaving Article 40.3.3&deg; in place actually involves is requiring it to be a crime to take an abortion pill and to assist somebody in taking an abortion pill like going to England to get it or going down to the chemist to get it.  We cannot decriminalise that activity and keep Article 40.3.3&deg; in its present form.  I reject the idea that the Constitution is there to set standards and is not there to deal with the hard cases because in the end, we remember the poor girl in the X case - a rape victim who was hauled back from England by the courts because that was the law - and we remember that girl in Belfast who found herself dragged before the courts because she had taken the abortion pill in Belfast where it is a criminal offence to do so.  If we are going to say there is no distinction between a cluster of cells in a Petri dish in a laboratory and a human being and say there are no shades of grey, there is no developmental process and no spectrum of development within which the victim of a rape is entitled to take steps to end a pregnancy and it will be and must remain a crime for the victim of a rape in Ireland to end her pregnancy, which is what not deleting Article 40.3.3&deg; necessarily means, so be it.  We should stand on that but the consequences definitely are that this is what we are standing for.  If this referendum is defeated, it will be a crime for a victim of rape in Ireland to take an abortion pill to end the pregnancy, it will be a crime for anybody to give it to her and it will be a crime for anybody to assist her in getting it.  They will all be criminals before our law.  If someone says to me, it will not happen, I will say that it has happened in Belfast.  Tell me why it should not happen here if that is not merely part of our criminal law but part of our criminal law that is necessitated by the terms of the Constitution itself.  <br\/><br\/>I ask fellow Members of this House to consider carefully what keeping Article 40.3.3&deg; actually means.  We are in exactly the same position as our predecessors were in 1983 when they enacted the eighth amendment.  We are making a decision which will have definite legal and criminal effects.  There will be outcomes.  A person cannot simply say he or she is against 12 weeks, therefore, he or she wants it to continue to be a criminal offence for a girl to take the abortion pill in Ireland after a rape, that is what he or she wants it to be and that the price he or she is willing to pay to keep the Constitution as it is because that price will be paid by some girl.  It was in Belfast and it will be here.  The same applies to any way a person can try to develop the law in any way to deal with exceptions such as rape.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Regardless of whatever faults people have with the processes of the joint committee of these Houses and the Citizens' Assembly, they faced up fair and square.

The problem is that they have already got hold of abortion laws.  Senator Leyden has just referred to it.  In 1983 they got hold of abortion laws and changed them such that they are now beyond the reach of democratic politicians.  That is why I would contend, and I mean this respectfully, the arguments the Senator made are fundamentally undemocratic.  He is saying that politicians should not be allowed to legislate on this matter.  I am saying it was a major mistake in 1983 and my party has been consistent on that, and that politicians should be allowed to legislate because that is what elected representatives like ourselves are here to do.  We are here to legislate.  That is a fundamentally undemocratic argument and that is why it is important that we remove article 40.3.3o.  <\/p> <p>I cannot be half as eloquent as Senator McDowell and even though we disagree fundamentally on many issues, I thought his contribution, spanning some ten or 15 minutes, was excellent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#U01700","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#U01800","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#U01900","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I  want to develop one point.

I respectfully ask a question of my colleagues who disagree on this issue.  Do they think it is right that women should have the freedom to travel and the freedom to have information to abortion?  If they do, I have a difficulty because what they are really saying by implication is, &quot;Look, we don't like abortion, but you can have one.  Just don't have it here.&quot;  There is something fundamentally wrong with that.<br\/><br\/>Equally if they do not agree with that, it is fine.  I ask them to articulate their position as to why they believe it is fundamentally wrong for women to have access to travel and access to information.  However, if they accept it is right, how can it be otherwise than saying, &quot;You can have an abortion, but just don't have it here.&quot;  That is why 12 women are travelling on a plane today.  That is why women are taking abortion pills here today, having abortions here in Ireland without medical care or supervision.  That is why Dr. Rhona Mahony says it is time to stop playing Russian roulette with women's lives.<br\/><br\/>I also respectfully ask my colleagues to think about the message they are sending to women today.  We know from the evidence we received that right now a woman cannot receive medical treatment until she is dying.  That is what our doctors told us.  My colleagues may believe in some giant conspiracy, but that is what the heads of two of the maternity hospitals told the committee.  That <i>status quo<\/i>is just not tenable.  I am genuinely shocked that people would think it is acceptable to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>that a woman must be dying before she can receive medical intervention.  Unfortunately, that is the truth.  That is what we were told by the head of the National Maternity Hospital and by Dr. Peter Boylan, and it is the truth.  Is that the message they want to send out here today?  I ask our colleagues on the other side of the argument to deal with these issues.<br\/><br\/>My last point is simple.  Senator Leyden mentioned 1983 and he is entitled to his opinion.  He is obviously very proud of what happened back then.  I was horrified by what happened back then.  Each of the 35 years we have gone through has shown how horrific that is.  We do not have to look back to the victim of the X case, because, as I mentioned yesterday, a 12 year child had to go to Britain for an abortion just a few weeks ago.  Unless we act on this amendment, the next 12 year old child, the next victim of rape, will have to go to Britain for an abortion.  I cannot countenance that.  It is fundamentally wrong that victims of rape or incest have to leave the country to have that issue dealt with.  It is scandalous and a shocking indictment of our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#U02000","speaker":"1389","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>In the interests of moving this along, I will keep my comments very brief.  I wish to associate myself with comments of Senators Bacik and Ruane.  They made points I was going to make and so I will not repeat them.  I also thank Senator McDowell for his very insightful and considered contribution.  His contribution has played a vital part in moving along the debate in this House.<\/p> <p>I have been through two pregnancies and even in the most ideal of circumstances the state of pregnancy can be difficult and stressful.  One feels vulnerable and very lonely at times.  It strikes me that when the vulnerability of the unborn is talked about, the vulnerability of the pregnant woman is often forgotten about.<\/p> <p>I also make reference to the 12 year old child who travelled to the UK, as Senator Gavan mentioned.  Some of the commentary on that has suggested that the ideal solution would have been for the 12 year old child to have proceeded with the pregnancy and given the baby up for adoption.  No reference is ever made to the physical damage, leaving alone the psychological damage, that a pregnancy would do to a 12 year old child's body.  That child is vulnerable.  She did not become pregnant because she is in a good situation.  Something awful and tragic happened to that child.  We are proposing a solution to her that would leave her with permanent damage, compounding the damage that has already been done to her.  I cannot stand here and stand over that and let plenty more children and women go through this.  We need to look at the humanity of the pregnant woman and the vulnerability of the pregnant woman, and try our best to protect that.<\/p> <p>Last night I spoke about the need for the Minister to provide extra lactation consultants and extra public health nurses to assist mothers and their newborn babies.  I am sure the Minister is aware that we have a vast shortage of them.  We have a severe lack of perinatal psychologists.  I would love if Senator Mullen and more of our colleagues would join me in this call.  Let us look after the children who are born in this country.

I have had this discussion in my constituency office and with people who are passionately pro-life and are compassionate about this issue.  I understand it comes from a position of compassion because I absolutely understand the motivations behind those on the pro-life side.  I remember meeting a couple who were very upset about the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.  I said that I purely wanted a woman in a distressed situation to have a choice.  They said that she had a choice and I asked them what that was.  They said that she could go to Britain.  As has been said we are quite happy - we have passed this in a referendum - for women to have information.  We are quite happy to allow them to travel knowing exactly the reason for them travelling as long as they just do not do it here.

It is easy to lead on an issue that is popular, but it is not easy to lead in a debate that is difficult.  I take my hat off to the Minister, as he has allowed himself in his period in the Oireachtas to listen.  He moved from what I understand was his original position, in which he was not necessarily convinced of the need to legislate for the X case, to one in which he has allowed himself to discuss the matter within his own party and the Oireachtas.

It is time for the Irish people to have their say on this issue and it is time for us to repeal the eighth amendment.<\/p> <p>I followed last night's debate on my phone while I was sitting in London City Airport waiting to travel home, which I felt was fitting.  I could not help but think of the thousands of women who had made the same journey in the years gone by, many of them alone, frightened out of their wits and unable to get help in their own country.  The Minister gave a brilliant speech last night referencing how Ireland had failed these women.  I agreed with him.  I commend him on what he is doing.  As my colleague stated, he is showing strong leadership.  He did the same with the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015.  Doing that is not easy.<\/p> <p>It is not good enough for us to keep our heads in the sand any longer.  In reality, Ireland already has abortion services.  They are just in the UK.

Last week we read reports on the undemocratic process used in the Russian election, but what we do in a cherished way is legislate.  Last week when Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell took a public stance, she was excoriated in some quarters, but that was her choice.  In a similar fashion, other Members have different viewpoints.  Like Senator Paul Coghlan, I fully agree that there should be a free vote.  However, the fundamental question we are being asked is whether we should retain the article in the Constitution and I cannot outline my response as eloquently as Senator Michael McDowell.<\/p><p>There were those who opposed the process and the work of the committee for their own legitimate reasons, but Dr. Rhona Mahony and Professor Fergal Malone, to name but two, gave clear evidence to the committee.  The problem we have is that society evolves and moves at a quick pace in terms of technology, but, whether we like it, we are allowing back-street abortions to take place through the use of abortion pills.  As Senator Ned O'Sullivan said last night, if my sister or daughter came to me, I would try to put in place all of the supports needed to avoid a termination of pregnancy.  Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee is correct that there is huge compassion and humanity among those who favour repeal.  In this Chamber last night and today mother spoke who are full of love, care and concern.  As I said on Second Stage, I was a 2 lb premature baby.  I value and cherish life and want to see the lives of the mother and the unborn child protected.  None of us who favours repeal should be accused of lacking humanity, compassion or concern.

That is what we are meant to be debating.  If we listen to the testimony to the joint committee of those who grapple with this issue every day, there is a simple choice to be made.  I hope we will have an informed debate because it is about everything we do and say as people.  I also agree with Senator James Reilly that theology and so on come into it, but it is also about humanity, vulnerable women who do not have the support they need and cannot travel.

We all have a duty of care.  Abortion is happening every day in Ireland in the privacy of bedrooms and God knows what circumstances.  Granted, the abortion pill is a relatively safe method of dealing with the matter.  However, it is simply not a satisfactory policy to allow women to be unsupported by their general practitioners and medics in whatever guise in such circumstances.  That is not to speak about the women who, every day, travel out of Dublin Airport or take a ferry, depending on their financial circumstances or time constraints, to the United Kingdom and, in increasing numbers, the Netherlands and other countries to access care that we do not allow them to access in this country.  That is not a madly liberal view to have.  It is common sense that this country should at long last recognise that women need more compassion.  Those who do not want a scintilla of reform in this area believe what I am proposing is extremely liberal.  What I want to know is what do these legislators propose we do.  Should we continue to ignore and export this problem?  Should we start to invoke our laws and criminalise women?<\/p> <p>Senator Michael McDowell's points about the abortion pill were well made.  This would not happen in any other area of medicine because we would seek to stamp it out.  We have rigid policies in place to stamp it out where it does happen.  However, we cannot do so in this case because it would cause further harm.  Abortion pills had an instrumental and highly significant role in the deliberations of the joint committee.  Speaking for myself, I was unaware of the extent of their use.  Like my colleague, Senator Jerry Buttimer, I sincerely hope the information provided for the joint committee will be disseminated to members of the public in order that they can arrive at a full understanding, notwithstanding the cloud of emotive misinformation, that the reality is finally being addressed by policy makers.  We have to face up to the fact that Irish women are in this position every day and that we need to fundamentally trust them and their doctors.  Control has been at the heart of this issue until now and women need to get back some control over their health care.  The men and women of Ireland, when it comes to a vote in May, will have an opportunity to show the compassion women deserve.<\/p> <p>It is important to be clear on another matter and I am sure the Minister will make the same point.  Senator Mark Daly and other speakers made a point about the legislation.  The legislation on which the Minister and his officials have worked so hard in recent weeks is based on a cross-party committee's report.  Members spent hours in the bowels of this building hearing facts and evidence.  Despite what others would like people to believe, the proposed legislation is not Government legislation as such but cross-party legislation that is supported by the leaders of every party in the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>I will finish on the following point because I am aware that I am making another Second Stage speech.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#Y00300","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":184,"content":"<p>The Senator will probably not be the only Senator to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#Y00400","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Our medics are world class.

Many of those who argued against the Bill called for clarity.  I appeal to them to be clear on what their proposal entails.  We heard, for example, a suggestion that regulations could be made to deal with hard cases.  If we retain Article 40.3.3&deg;, regulations will not be introduced to deal with many hard cases because it will remain constitutionally prohibited to do so.  Senator Michael McDowell eloquently cited the possibility that the Director of Public Prosecutions could show mercy.  Leaving aside that women need rights, rather than charity, and that the mother and baby homes were considered mercy in their time, this is not at the discretion of the policing service in many cases.  If we think about the difficult cases, including cases of child abuse and rape, if we retain Article 40.3.3&deg;, nothing can be done to assist women, girls or children in such circumstances.  Furthermore, the existing provision may well prove a deterrent to pregnant women and girls who have experienced rape or suffered child abuse because the very fact of placing themselves in the legal sphere could potentially bring them under threat of criminality.  We can speak about cases of fatal foetal abnormality and real, concrete cases of women who face phenomenal and catastrophic health consequences, including permanent disability, blindness which has been discussed, a risk of brain haemorrhage and complications in their cancer treatment.  Doctors and medics have made it clear that such cases cannot currently be addressed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If we vote to retain Article 40.3.3&deg; and vote to say we should not have a referendum on it, and Members can choose to do so, I ask them to be honest.  I ask them, please, not to have conversations with people and talk about hard cases and how in certain circumstances they would feel differently, because they will have sacrificed any possibility of engaging with those situations.<\/p><p>What we have seen in the committee and in what is put forward by the legislation is those who are willing to grapple and engage with the realities.  To be very clear, when we again talk about clarity, caution, concerns and reassurance, what we will vote on is not the legislation.  We will vote on the possibility of having a way to act in these circumstances and situations.  It is important to note, however, that the proposals put forward through the Oireachtas have been carefully moderated and considered.  The proposals put forward by the Citizens' Assembly were moderated by the committee.  More conservative proposals were put forward by the committee than by the Citizens' Assembly.  The proposals put forward in the draft legislation by the Minister are in fact more constrained and more limited again than the proposals put forward by the committee.  The political body, elected by the people, responsible and answering to the people, has had a say in the nuance of this legislation.  It has been reflected and people have stepped up to their responsibility, recognising that since women and doctors are making hard decisions, we as legislators need to make hard, careful and considered decisions.<\/p><p>Many measures that have been introduced in the legislation by the Government indicate a very high degree of caution and address the concerns that have been raised by the other side.  Examples include the introduction of viability testing and specific protections for a viable foetus, the particular constraints in terms of health issues, and the fact that the committee disagreed with the Citizens' Assembly and explicitly excluded health grounds alone in terms of access to terminations.  I may not like some of those decisions, but I respect them and recognise that there is a mandate for them and that they have moved through these Houses in that way.  That is the real work of putting things forward.<\/p><p>If some Members do not like the proposal for 12 weeks, despite the clear evidence that has been put forward about how it engages with the issue of medical abortion and tablets, how it deals with the important issue of addressing situations of rape - we have seen again how hard it is to prove rape in Ireland - abuse or incest, and despite the fact that it has been shown to lower the number of terminations in other countries, then those Members are free to put forward their own legislative proposals.  They can go to the people and ask them to vote for them and elect them to put forward their legislative proposals, because that is the proper process.  It is very disingenuous of those to have been saying this is the last chance, this is the only protection, and this is the only measure.  They, as legislators, are in a position to put forward more conservative proposals and to test the public's will on that if they so wish.  That is their prerogative.<\/p><p>Not only is there legislative space to do these other things that have been discussed, to have more nuanced or detailed proposals, if that is what some Senators claim that they want, there is another thing that they can do which would show that the repeal of the eighth amendment would not be the end of any discussion or protection.  They can also talk to women.  That is an option that will remain open to them.  They can have conversations with women.  They can talk about how they can better support women in their choices, how they can give them more options, and how can they make sure there are better lone parent supports.  As I have said before, there has often been an absence in this House when we have debated those issues of child care and support for lone parents or for those with a disability.  Those Senators should be willing and show that they are willing to do the work in conversation with women around their options and choices.  That is an option that remains to them, and the Constitution is neither the only nor even the most appropriate way to communicate with women on the decisions they have to make.<\/p><p>We have heard that a vote in favour of this Bill to repeal the eighth amendment is a vote for the unknown.  I respectfully suggest that a vote to retain the eighth amendment, or Article 40.3.3&deg;, is a vote for the unknown, the conveniently unknown, where we do not have to know about what is happening to women, where we silence them, and where we ensure that we are not given inconvenient information about the hard and difficult circumstances people face.  One of the most striking posters I saw on a march relating to this issue was a young woman who had a sign that read, \"My silence, your comfort.\"  If we retain Article 40.3.3&deg;, we tell women to be quiet, that we do not want to hear about these circumstances anymore, and that they are potentially criminals, and we silence them and go right back into the invisibility, the silence and the unknown which we have relied on as a country for far too many decades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#Y00600","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I commend the Acting Chairman on his flexible approach to this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#Z00200","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#Z00300","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I had said that I was going to make a point of order because we are making Second Stage speeches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#Z00400","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I have tried to be fair to everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#Z00500","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Yes, and the Acting Chairman has taken the right decision.

It was the first ever move to take the law and the bishops out of our bedrooms.  It was defeated because it was opposed by the then Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, and a senior Cabinet Member, Dick Burke.  How courageous then, on reflection, was the great Jack Lynch, if I can call him that, because I believe he was great?  Jack Lynch moved the amendment to take away the special privileges and position of the Catholic Church in the Constitution and it was carried well.  On reflection, was that not great?

As those who know me will be aware, I have been very conflicted on this issue for an awful long time.  I was a councillor in Cork three or four years ago when this issue was considered by a previous committee, which was chaired by Senator Buttimer.  I listened to almost every word spoken during the committee's meetings.  Last year, I spent most Tuesdays in my office watching the witnesses come before the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  This has been a very informative debate.  I compliment the Members of this House for being so respectful to one another.  I think that has to happen.  In recent weeks, I spoke to my mother about the 1983 debate and how vicious and inappropriate it was.  I hope we will not go back to the 1983 standard of debate.  I hope we have moved on as a society.  My colleague from County Kerry has spoken about vicious Facebook posts.  I really hope that does not happen.  That kind of campaigning does nothing for nobody.<\/p> <p>I have listened to many of the contributions that have been made by Senators on both sides of the debate.  I respect everyone's views in so many ways.  People's views on this issue of conscience are informed by where they have been and what they have seen in life.  Personally, the older I get, the more conservative I am getting.  Ten years ago, I would not have flinched on this issue.  Ten years on, I have four kids.  I have gone through processes and I have seen things.  I have been involved in life.  I have seen scans that I did not think were going to happen, but did happen.  Life has changed me.  That is why I am so conflicted by this debate.<\/p> <p>I voted for the referendum last night because I believe it should happen.  I believe the people need to have a say on this matter.  I was seven years of age in 1983, which was the last time the people had a say on it.  I have a brother and a sister who were not even born when that happened.  They deserve to have a say on this.  Their views differ from mine, but they deserve to have a say.  I think the people need to come forward to lead this debate.  I am looking forward to a respectful debate in the coming weeks and months, regardless of what comes from it.  The Minister is going to publish the legislation prior to the referendum.  Who am I to stand against what the people vote for in the referendum?  I might not agree with what they have voted for, but I am sitting here as a Senator and not as a citizen.  As a legislator, I will have to support what the people have said.<\/p> <p>My personal view is that I have a deep issue with the 12-week proposal.  We went in for a scan at six and a half or seven weeks expecting bad news, but instead we got the unbelievable news that we were expecting twins.  That has stayed with me, changed me and made me a different person.  It has made me sit up at night to think about this vote and about what I would say tonight.  I was humming and hawing on whether I would contribute to this debate before I realised I needed to get it out there, to talk and to tell the Seanad what my view is.  My clear view is that the people need to decide.  It has to be a respectful debate.  I will legislate for whatever the people decide.  When I cast my vote in the referendum, I might not vote in the same way as the Minister, Deputy Harris.  When I am voting in this Chamber, I will do what the people want.  That is my view on this issue.  I believe the people have due power and due say over the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#AA01600","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I have a lot to say on this subject, but I will be brief.  There are people of conviction in this House today.  They are good people.  They are people I work with and respect.  It is clear from listening to the debate over recent times that these people of conviction oppose abortion for any woman in any circumstances, anywhere and anytime.  I fundamentally disagree with that.  My life has taught me that.  During a debate in this House in January, I referred to Nuala &Oacute; Faol&aacute;in's statement that abortion is not in anybody's utopia.  I do not speak for abortion as somebody who thinks it is a wonderful thing for somebody to have to try to decide to do because it really is not.  It is one of the toughest decisions that any woman has to make.  I believe we should be able to make such a decision.  We should be trusted to do so.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell mentioned the case of a young woman in the North who bought and took abortion medication and was reported to the PSNI by her flatmates.  They might be considered people of conviction, but in line with my worldview I would call them extremists.  They were probably good people and were acting in good faith.  The woman was given a three-month prison sentence, suspended for one year, in Belfast Crown Court.  We have heard of another unfortunate decision made in Belfast Crown Court today.  The case to which Senator McDowell referred did not happen in the dark days of the 1980s - it happened in 2016, which was just two years ago.  Would people of such extreme conviction go further if they were emboldened by an unthinkable \"No\" vote in May?  Would people who are against abortion for any woman, anywhere in the world and for any reason, report women in the South who buy abortion pills online and have them sentenced and sent to jail?  As Senator McDowell has said, that would be the logic and the law.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colette Kelleher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Would they again start pushing for a reversal of the right to travel and information, which, again, put a shot across the eighth amendment's bow, as Senator McDowell noted?  Would they start pushing for random pregnancy testing of women of child-bearing age at ports and airports?  That is the logic of those who would have us keep the eighth amendment.  Let us not be in any doubt about that.  Keeping the eighth amendment is not mainstream and is not moderate.  It is extreme, harsh and out of kilter with real women's lives.  Therefore, I am absolutely in favour of changing this very harsh measure in place in our country.  It is judgmental, controlling, unkind and very dangerous.  We can move to a kinder, better and more compassionate place and I hope we do.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#AA01700","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522229400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is appropriate that we would acknowledge the very careful consideration he has given in his preparatory work for what is probably the biggest social question we will face for a generation.  I said last night and I reiterate today that I believe the referendum should happen because the ultimate democracy is the Irish people through a referendum.  I fundamentally believe that the Constitution is the wrong place to deal with a health issue such as abortion.  We are the only country in the world that has an amendment like this enshrined in its Constitution.  No conservative country has it, no liberal country has it, no mature country has it, no modern country has it and no compassionate country has it.  No country that has a regard for women would have such a thing in its constitution.  I do not think it is right and fair and I do not think it should be allowed.  I appeal to the Irish people to go out on 25 May or whenever it is and vote to take this out of the Constitution.<\/p> <p>People talk about 12 weeks.  To be fair to the committee, which was charged with coming up with recommendations on this, it looked very carefully at the various options.  The problem with 12 weeks is quite simple.  People can now import medication to have an abortion.  Until the Internet became fashionable, we exported the problem.  Not alone are we exporting it, we are also importing it.  I appeal to people to let this referendum go ahead, pass this Bill today in the Seanad and then go out and campaign.  As I said yesterday, I respect people on both sides who have deeply held views and who are showing leadership on this.  The side I am supporting wants to remove the eighth amendment from the Constitution in the first instance because that is a question.  It is not about 12 weeks, nine weeks or any number of weeks.  It is a very simple proposition.  Do we believe having an amendment in the Constitution about abortion is right or wrong?  That is the simple question citizens and the people watching this today must ask themselves.  I have no doubt that the legislation will be debated with the same compassion, empathy and consideration in both Houses post-referendum if the people decide to remove the eighth amendment.  If the people decide not to remove it, the situation in this country will continue as is.  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act will be the fall-back position.  There will be no legislation so if somebody is raped and wants to have an abortion, she will either have to import the medication through the Internet or travel to England for an abortion.  If people find that they are carrying a child with fatal foetal abnormalities, the same will apply.  The situation will not change.  This question will not be visited again for 15 to 20 years at minimum so the Irish people must ask themselves very serious question.  It is not about 12 weeks, nine weeks or anything else.  The question is simple.  It is whether we believe dealing with this serious health issue should be in the Constitution.  Is it appropriate or not?  It is very important that during the course of the debate, we keep the lines clear in terms of what the message is.<\/p> <p>Assuming the Bill is passed and we have a referendum, a referendum commission needs to be set up.  However, the Government will probably have to give it a further brief in terms of dealing with social media.  Senator Ned O'Sullivan spoke earlier about some of the stuff about him that went up on social media.  This needs to be regulated.  I do not know how we can do it or if there is any way of doing it but I believe we must try to manage social media.  We will not have the type of long-term safeguards in place that we would like to have because that is a much bigger discussion but for the specific time bubble of the referendum between now and 25 May, there must be some sort of management and control of social media.

I fully respect every opinion that has been expressed here from both sides of this very sensitive argument.  It is important that we go forward from here respecting each other's views and opinions and not castigating those who may wish to retain the eighth amendment as being somehow antiquated or old because nothing could be further from the truth.  In my humble opinion, the Constitution has stood this country well since 1937 and it has given rights to the people such as the right to personal liberty, the right to freedom of expression, the right to freedom of assembly, the right to privacy and the right to life.  Which of those rights is more important than the other?  Would the right to life be less important than the right to privacy?  Is the right to life less important than the right to freedom of expression?  Is the right to life less important than the right to freedom of assembly?  In my humble opinion the answer is \"No\" and, therefore, I stand to retain the eighth amendment and the protection of the right to life.  It is as simple as that.  I am not coming from any religious background trying to argue something on behalf of any organisation outside these Houses.  I am coming here with my own opinion firmly of the view that we should retain that very unique protection of human life whether it is born or unborn.  For me, there is no difference because we were all there at one stage of our human existence whether we were the size of a finger nail or thumb, moving our eyelid in the womb or otherwise because to argue otherwise would be to say that a person who is 6 ft has more rights than someone who is 3 ft 5 in.  We cannot argue on the size of someone's being.  We cannot say that a Kenyan athlete is faster than an American athlete because he is smaller.  We cannot argue about human life on that basis.  Some would have us believe that we can.  I do not subscribe to that.<\/p> <p>The committee's recommendations are to relinquish the right to life in the Constitution and replace it with something else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018032800002#BB00300","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1522229400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow shortly.<\/p>"}]
