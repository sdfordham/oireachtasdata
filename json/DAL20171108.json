It is important to recognise that as a result of the significant gains made by those campaigning against water charges, there will be no immediate return to water charges as we have known them.  Those who did not pay water charges will not be pursued and those who paid will receive refunds.  The metering of existing and unrefurbished dwellings remains halted.  All of this welcome.  The effect of the Bill is to make domestic water a tradeable commodity under EU law.  The payments for excess water usage that will have to be made under the Bill represent the commodification of water.  This will facilitate the phasing back in of water charges over time by this or a future Government.  It may also prevent the holding of the proposed anti-privatisation referendum, or result in the use of a changed wording in the event of such a referendum, given that new private suppliers of water will be entitled to enter the market under EU competition law.  The Bill rules out, or does not provide for, the possibility of a referendum to enshrine in the Constitution this country's ownership of its water and water infrastructure.  A deliberate decision has been made.  My amendment to provide for the holding of such a referendum has been unfairly and wrongly ruled out of order.  The anti-water charges campaigners will certainly not allow water charges to be reintroduced.  Any attempt by this or a future Government to provide for their reintroduction will be challenged head-on by those of us involved in the anti-water charges campaign, just as we did in the past three years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800003#A01200","speaker":"1348"},{"type":"speech","time":1510135200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>When the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government swaggered in arrogantly three years ago, in the absolute depths of austerity, to announce the introduction of water charges, people said, &quot;No; enough is enough.&quot;<\/p><p>It was not just about water, as the Minister is well aware, and I am sure that movement absolutely rocked the political establishment in this country in its peaceful resistance and the solidarity shown.  In many ways it was a well-organised opposition to the water charges.<\/p> <p> We will now have a vote on this legislation which I believe introduces water charges through the back door and, despite what the Minister thinks, there is still an urgent need for a referendum.  As part and parcel of the last election, the majority of Deputies in this D&aacute;il were elected to abolish water charges, establish a public utility in place of Irish Water and hold a referendum.  A number of Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies went out to the gates of Leinster House and signed the petition by SIPTU.  I have the pictures of Deputy Cowen doing that and saying Fianna F&aacute;il would support a referendum on Irish Water.<\/p> <p> This issue has not gone away.  I have made the point before, although it is not really for the Minister's ears because he knows it, that water companies are waiting to grab water.  It is blue gold and they want to make their money on it.  They make huge amounts of money when it is privatised, as in Britain, where directors of water companies lend to themselves from their own banks.  They distribute shares among their shareholders and themselves while people on the ground pay excessively for water.<\/p> <p> Despite huge pressure on it, last year in Slovenia the Government brought in a provision in the constitution to keep water in public ownership and management.  We should be going the same way.  It is what the people demand.  People want to see a referendum on the public ownership and management of our water.  I will continue, along with the Deputies in opposition and the Deputies of Fianna F&aacute;il who supported that and signed the petition with SIPTU approximately a year and a half ago, to pursue vigorously the holding of that referendum.  We hope the Minister and those in his Department will not put up any barriers to it.<\/p> <p> We have reached a point where we will not see major water poverty in the country for a number of years.  However, we and the people will be watching closely future Governments and the steps they take and we will resist absolutely and vehemently any changes.

This legislation is a result of the process we, with Fine Gael, put in place.  In the first instance, a committee of experts sought to make recommendations on how water services would be funded in the future.  That in turn fed into an all-party committee, of which Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and others were part, and this committee in turn made recommendations by majority decision to the D&aacute;il.  The D&aacute;il itself then instructed Government to bring forward legislation to reflect those recommendations.  As I said on numerous occasions during the past number of weeks, I feel this does that.<\/p><p>I am sure the majority of the D&aacute;il will agree with that and, ultimately, the people will accept the decision of the D&aacute;il.  It will have been seen that we have given some weight to the votes in our favour to deal with this, as well as many other issues, that the public asked us to do during the course of the last election, for which we formed an alliance, namely, the confidence and supply arrangement.  That process is in train and we are very glad to be part of it.  We will hold the Government to account, scrutinising and analysing every effort it makes to address those issues.  If it fails to do so, we will not support budgets which do not address that in the future.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of public ownership, the committee, of which Deputy Jan O'Sullivan was a member, noted:<\/p><blockquote>The Committee notes that, while existing legislation already provides a statutory prohibition on the privatisation of Irish Water, the Thirty-Fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Water in Public Ownership (No 2) Bill 2016, which proposes that the following subsection be inserted after subsection 2 of Article 28.4 of the Constitution:&quot;3&deg; The Government shall be collectively responsible for the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system.  The Government shall ensure in the public interest that this resource remains in public ownership and management.&quot;<\/blockquote><p>We went a step further, in so far as Deputy Joan Collins's Bill got the approval of the House and was moved to the committee to further the process from which a referendum would ultimately emanate.  We remain committed to that.  We signed petitions and gave various commitments to members of the public, including the ones referred to by Deputy Joan Collins.  We will continue to honour that commitment and ensure the Government maintains it too.<br\/><br\/>The funding model, whereby water services will be funded by general taxation, as recommended by the committee of experts, was reaffirmed by the committee.  On public engagement and transparency, the previous Government made no effort to have the entity accountable to this House.  That is now addressed by virtue of a public water forum.  We will see the sort of accountability and transparency, under various headings for which it has responsibility, brought to bear on it by the House and for it, and ultimately the people, to pass judgment on it.  We also have the Department's Vote which will require committee approval, as is the case with all Departments.<br\/><br\/>I commend Deputy Catherine Murphy for her amendment, which, as I said last night, is the only one that made any sense.  It was the only one to copper-fasten the responsibility for the public funds given to Irish Water with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I withheld my support for that amendment because the Government, as affirmed by the Minister to the D&aacute;il yesterday, has given a strong commitment to prioritise legislation to amend the Comptroller and Auditor General Act in this regard.<br\/><br\/>On compliance with EU law, the framework put in place promotes conservation.  There are other recommendations on various forms of water conservation, as other Members well know but do not like to repeat, despite the good work they were engaged in to ensure consensus on them.  We will hold the Government to account for implementing them over the coming year.<br\/><br\/>Sinn F&eacute;in put down silly amendments.  Its first one personified that when it spoke about renaming the legislation the water charges by the back door Bill.  Why did it not continue with &quot;Water charges or fines by the back door for the 4% of the population who, after every effort and conciliation is made and assistance given to them to ensure compliance and conservation, still want to wantonly waste water and leave their taps on&quot;?  Will Sinn F&eacute;in incite people to bring this to a head and bring it to the floor of the House again?  There is an 18-month period before which time an allowance is calculated.  That allowance will be for every house up to eight persons.  If there are nine persons, they can prove it and be allowed for it.  There are allowances for people with medical difficulties which are cast in stone.  If Sinn F&eacute;in wanted to change the name of the Bill, it should have gone further with a Title like &quot;water charges or fines by the back door for those, who despite every help and assistance given to them in this Bill, still want to leave their taps on and expect to get away with it&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The recommendation on equity and fairness, as had been provided for in the confidence and supply arrangement initially, was that those who had paid would be treated no less favourably than those who had not.  We were all laughed at when it was divulged how that might emerge or could be squared.  If one was to go after those who had not paid, it would cost much more than paying back those who paid.  It was fair and appropriate, meeting with everybody's approval, despite the fact they felt it might never happen.  It is in the process of happening.  A campaign has been initiated already to ensure people get those refunds as quickly as possible, despite the protestations of others in the hope they might act as a Christmas Grinch to detract from a feel-good factor for some households which might require or be glad of it.  If others want to donate to charities or to the homeless, as was suggested by a campaign initiated last week, so be it.  That is people's choice.  I know some Members who initially paid the first water bill but then changed their minds and decided not to pay the others.  At least they will get something back and they can see what to do with it then.<br\/><br\/>There is also provision within the equity and fairness section to bring about and to measure parity for those on the public supply and those on rural and group water schemes.  Unfortunately, during the course of the deliberations of the expert committee and the Oireachtas committee, no information emanated which could properly calculate and compare the two.  Much capital assistance is given, for example, in the setting up of many of these group schemes.  Despite the fact somebody might be paying &euro;200 a year towards the provision of a service from a group scheme, were it not for the capital subvention and funds provided by the Government, they might be paying a lot more.  That needs to be measured to ensure we achieve the parity one would expect for the State to have relating to those who get a water supply, irrespective from where it comes.  That is an issue for which I and others should hold the Government and Department to account, along with those who represent those bodies, to ensure that figure is forthcoming, that measurement can take place and to insist, thereafter, that there is the sort of parity one would expect.  The whole area of metering was brought to a conclusion, as was recommended.  It remains the fact, save for new homes in the future.<br\/><br\/>The bottom line is this saga is coming to a conclusion.  I am glad of that, as well as the fact I could play a role, together with my party colleagues, in ensuring some value is given to the votes cast in our favour on this issue.  We did not get all we had sought because we accept in the art of negotiation there has to be compromise.  We have given a lot of value to that vote.  I do not believe this matter would have progressed in the way it has if we did not take that course of action.  Others simply sought to use this as a battering ram to ensure no Government could function after the day it was formed.  In my and my party's opinion, that would have created the kind of instability that we witnessed previously that was of no good to the country or the economy, despite the history that others have in ensuring that sort of instability, in some way, helps them with their political ideology and advancement.  It does not work in my book.  As a pragmatist of the centre, it is important we find solutions and move on.  There are more pressing issues with which the Government and the House should be dealing.  I commend the Bill and its recommendations.  I hope and expect the Seanad to deal with this expediently in order to put this issue to bed for once and for all and for people to get the refunds to which they are entitled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800004#B01300","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510136700,"counter":32,"content":"<p>It was interesting to listen to what the previous speaker said on this issue.  He started off his contribution by saying he wants to be able to deal with more pressing issues.  I do not see a more pressing issue than dealing once and for all with the legacy of the debacle that is Irish Water.  There have been a number of attempts to introduce water charges over the years.  It is a pressing issue.  The whole flip-flop of those in Fianna F&aacute;il on this issue has been enlightening to many people in our society.  We have said this for many years - it is not a case of pragmatism, it is a case of them being chancers.  This issue, more than many other issues, has exposed that.<\/p>  <p>  The biggest crying shame in all this is the hundreds of millions of euro that have been wasted in recent years which could have been spent on more productive areas, such as addressing housing needs and the crisis in health care, yet the previous Government and the one prior to that decided to proceed with a charging regime for water.  It is not over.  This Bill will be opposed.  Any attempt in the future to introduce a more restrictive or a more penal charging regime will be resisted.  The appetite for such resistance exists now.  Both the previous Government and Fianna F&aacute;il can be thanked for helping to radicalise quite a sizable proportion of Irish society and unifying it against the Government.  If nothing else, with this issue people have seen that they can win and that they can stand up to a Government and its decisions.<\/p>  <p>  The previous speaker suggested that those of us who were aligned to the Right2Change or who campaigned for the ending of water charges sat on our hands or went on holidays for ten weeks after the result of the election.  We did no such thing.  I can guarantee the Deputy that if he were to go into the communities we represent they would be happy that we represented what we stood for in that election.  The lie that my party did nothing, which has been continuously peddled in recent months, needs to be challenged when, in fact, we did act in that period.  However, when one has a door slammed in one's face continuously, one does not usually go through that door or knock again and ask, \"Please, sir, let me in.\"  Fianna F&aacute;il has suggested we did not engage in government forming.  Before and after the election, Fianna F&aacute;il, the previous Taoiseach and the current one continuously said - and it is said again now - that Sinn F&eacute;in will not form part of any Government.  That is happy days from my point of view.  I do not want to be in government with Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael but they cannot then at the same time say we were remiss in our duties because we did not involve ourselves in government forming.  If someone slams the door in one's face, one takes that as a given.  People need to look at their own history.<\/p>  <p>  As this Bill reflects a mere victory on this issue, I take this opportunity to congratulate the tens of hundreds of thousands of people throughout this country who mobilised on, got involved in and researched this issue because they were not led like sheep.  They formed their own opinions and took to the streets to campaign against the imposition of water charges.  I congratulate, in particular, those who got involved in the Right2Change movement that came about from the Right2Water campaigning.  That shows what can be done if there is unity among those of us who are progressive in this society.  It is a pity that the legislation which should be before the House ending fully any charges for water is not before it and that the current Bill does not contain a provision for a referendum that we all believe should held to ensure that a future Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael Government could never ever privatise the water that we enjoy in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800006#D00100","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1510136700,"counter":33,"content":"<p>As we move towards the close of the debate on this Bill, it is important to recall how we got here and what this was all about.  In this debate, and over the course of the past three years, all sides have tried to put their spin on what it was all about, and that spinning continues with people trying to put forward a particular interpretation of the facts.  The most ironic, almost laughable, spin that has been put on it are attempts by the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il to say that what is being achieved with this Bill today is somehow to their credit.  That is laughable because, although this Bill very deliberately leaves a back door open to the reintroduction of water charges, at another level it is a victory not for any political party and most certainly not for Fine Gael or Fine Fail but for the mass movement of people power against the water charges, a mass movement of peaceful civil disobedience in refusing to pay an unjust charge and then mass mobilisation on the streets on an unprecedented level which forced a historic climbdown by Fine Gael and Fine F&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  The people certainly know this but it is important to remember this as this Bill moves through its Final Stage that both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael have been committed for a long time to trying to introduce water charges.  Fianna F&aacute;il, when it was in government, wanted to introduce a water charge of &euro;400 a year and it had a PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, report detailing how it was going to introduce water charges.  Fine Gael then came in after it and that was the third attempt during the past 20 to 25 years by the political establishment to bring in water charges.  Austerity and the troika programme was the excuse and the proof that it was just an excuse was that they had tried to bring water charges in during the 1990s but they were defeated by a mass movement of boycott, civil disobedience and peaceful resistance on the streets.  Also, back in the 1980s attempts to bring in water charges were similarly defeated by a mass movement of peaceful resistance, ironically at the time it included leading figures such as the former T&aacute;naiste, Eamon Gilmore, who then subsequently went over to the other side and tried to justify the introduction of water charges when his party was in government with Fine Gael.  However, the people who remained consistent on this were the ordinary working people who fought it in the 1980s, fought it again in the 1990s and fought it again this time around and triumphed against the combined efforts of the two major political parties, with considerable support from those in the media and so on which seemed to think there was something barbarian or philistine about the opposition to water charges, when in fact that opposition was absolutely justified opposition to a regressive tax imposed on the less well off in our society and which was linked to a very well worked out and concerted agenda to privatise water resources, regardless of whatever the Government tries to claim now.<\/p><p>It is not just a theoretical supposition that the introduction of water charges and the establishment of Irish Water were a stepping stone to privatisation.  Privatisation commenced immediately when Irish Water was set up.  Look at the people who were involved.  Denis O'Brien, now implicated in the Paradise - or parasite - Papers of tax evasion, got the contract to put in the water meters, which was worth nearly &euro;1 billion, in shady circumstances.  I call that privatisation and very shady privatisation.  All the usual suspects of consultancy firms and accountancy firms, many of which are now also implicated in the parasite papers for assisting, and continuing to assist, the wealthy in Irish society to stow their money away in offshore tax havens, were also involved in Irish Water.  They got massive consultancy contracts to set up Irish Water.  Irish Water was a honey pot for wealthy, greedy private interests.  Much of its management operations, design and so on, when it was set up and now, were contracted out to private firms.  As soon as Irish Water was set up, it was being hollowed out.  While notionally it was in public ownership, in reality it was in the hands of private interests, whether private consultant, private contractors or big tycoons like Denis O'Brien and other big firms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800006#D00200","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510137300,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to desist from naming those who are not in the House.

Some of the early organising meetings of Right2Water took place here when we met the trade unions and set out a plan to establish a mass movement.

They have been achieved against the resistance of those in power by ordinary people on the streets fighting for change.  That did not just include the campaign to defeat domestic water charges.

The attitude the Government has taken to the amendments we tabled is telling.  The central justification the Government had for the charges all along was its concern to deal with the decrepit water infrastructure in the country and to promote water conservation measures, but actually there is nothing substantial or serious in that regard in the Bill.  The Government has refused to accept amendments that have tried to bring serious conservation measures into the Bill, such as the water conservation grant and regulations around building that would ensure water harvesting equipment is standard in all new-build houses.  That is something the Government has resisted.  If it was serious about water conservation, those are the sorts of measures it would introduce and it would own up to the fact that the reason the water infrastructure is in a mess is because the Government slashed the capital investment programme to water infrastructure during the austerity years.  Even now with the Irish Water business plan the Minister referred to, it is still way short of what is necessary to address the huge infrastructural deficit in water services.  We need to double the level of investment in water infrastructure rehabilitation if we are going to address the massive leakage out of the system, but there is no sign of that from this Government.  We have won a battle but the war is not over because the Government has left a back door open.  Any credit on this issue goes to the people on the streets who fought this battle over recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800007#E01700","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1510137300,"counter":51,"content":"<p>The next offering is from Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and, while there is no time limit to the contributions, we must concentrate on the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800007#E01800","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1510137300,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I will be short.  As others, I want to use the opportunity to congratulate the people who stood shoulder to shoulder on the streets of their estates to stop water meters being installed.  Many were not engaged in any of that activity, including many of the people in the House and the Minister.  The Minister must realise it was quite a sacrifice for people to get up at 5 or 5.30 in the morning, often in very dark and cold mornings, in all sorts of weather and mobilise with their neighbours to prevent the imposition of water meters in their estates.  The Taoiseach would know all about people who get up early in the morning.  This was done collectively through very peaceful civil disobedience.<\/p>  <p>  I clearly remember a neighbour of mine called Sandra who spoke to me about a week after being engaged in this activity.  She had been suffering from serious depression.  Her mental health had gone down since she lost her job as a consequence of the collapse of the economy.  I was interested to hear Deputy Cowen talk about the instability that those of us in the House who oppose water charges have brought to the country.  It is really rich coming from somebody whose party brought the economy down around our ears with the banking collapse some years ago.  One of the victims of that was Sandra who, a week after protesting against the metering in her estate, said her morale, dignity and self-esteem had been lifted completely as a result of this and she had stopped taking antidepressants.<\/p><p>That tells me that people who engage in shaping their own future by direct, collective action, by grouping together with others in solidarity, grow hugely, because they see they can have an impact on society and change it.  They see that politics is more than the 15 minutes in a person's life that they will spend in a polling booth ticking 1, 2, 3 on a piece of paper.  It means engagement, activity and trying to shape and determine the sort of society we want to live in.  If it has done nothing else, the water charges movement has proved that.  It has proved that people power, when inserted into the arguments and debates about the country, the world, and our economy can make a huge difference.  Every individual who engages in that people power feels the difference.  That lesson has been learned and will not go away. <\/p> <p> In the first few months we spent here before Fine Gael formed some kind of Government with the backing of Fianna F&aacute;il the discourse was that the centre must hold; it was more important than the disparity between left and right.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are doing everything they can to hold the centre.  Hence this Bill, which leaves not just the back door but the window, the front door and the skylight open to bring in water charges at the next opportunity that the next Government gets.  In the meantime, the victory lies with the people, the Sandras of this country, who fought locally in their estates and nationally by taking part in marches.<\/p> <p> When we started out on this journey I was a councillor on Dublin City Council and when John Tierney got the job of heading up Irish Water, with a big increase in salary, up to &euro;200,000, I believe we had a bit of a get together to say good luck to him.  I remember very clearly saying to him, \"Good luck in the war department because that is where you are going.\"  He did not last very long in that department but the war department spent a fortune, through his leadership, on consultancies, on bringing in contractors, on the Denis O'Brien - not to mention his name - Siteserv exercise trying to put in meters, putting people in prison and through long trials such as the Jobstown trial.  This has cost the country a fortune.  The people have seen through it and have seen it down, albeit after enduring suffering and sacrifice.<\/p> <p> Those of us who might remember Phil Hogan will remember that at the introduction of water charges, when he was Minister for the environment, he told everybody in this country that they would ultimately be paying between &euro;500 and &euro;600 a year for water.  He then said if we did not comply with bringing in water meters and paying charges our water would have to be cut down to a trickle.  He threatened at another stage to use the pay related social insurance, PRSI, of every man, woman and child, in every household, to get the cost of the water.  All that has been rolled back to the point we are at now, and some in this House are boasting about it and about issuing cheques to people who paid their water charges in time for Christmas.  This Government looks extremely foolish and it has been extremely foolish with our most precious natural resource.  That is why I echo the call from other Deputies for a referendum to stop the privatisation of water.  It is not just an add-on or extra, water is fundamental to life.  We cannot survive without it.  We can survive without food, as many hunger strikers have done for 70 or more odd days, but we would not last more than a week without water.  As it is fundamental to life and as we hurtle towards climate change with water under more and more threat, it is absolutely essential that we do not privatise it and put it into the hands of the greedy Veolia, Thames and SUEZ companies which gain billions of dollars from the privatisation of water in some of the poorest countries in the world.  That should never ever happen in this country.  Resistance to it means not charging for water but paying for it from direct taxation, bringing in tax justice and making those who are not paying taxes, pay them.  It has become absolutely apparent, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, from the \"Parasite\" Papers that there is loads of money to be got from taxation.  That taxation should be used to fund a service that is absolutely essential and crucial to this society.  Hats off to every man, woman and child who engaged in the resistance to this most neo-liberal, objectionable move by this Government and the previous one.  Until we get a proper socialist left wing government, I have no doubt it will continue with governments to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800007#E01900","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510137900,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I will be brief and stick to the Bill.  Anybody who thinks that the issue of water will be put to bed by this Bill is mistaken.  Irish Water has published a proposal to move towards what it calls its single utility by 2021 at the cost possibly of 1,000 jobs and seeking to bring to an end the service level agreements with the local authorities four years early.  That is going to have huge implications not just for the staff in local authorities but members of the public who access water services and the taxpayers.  That will be a major political issue directly relevant to this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Our understanding was that this Bill was intended to put into effect the outworkings of the special Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.  Notwithstanding my heated disagreements with Deputy Cowen yesterday, his comments earlier today were absolutely right.  There was a series of issues where there was unanimous agreement that we were expecting to be brought before the House in one form or another.  It is ironic that the one issue that caused deep disagreement at the committee was the one at the centre of this legislation but many of the issues on which there was unanimous agreement have yet to be brought before us.  That is why many of us sought to table amendments to this Bill, for example, to secure further support for a referendum on public ownership, for dealing with the issue of group water schemes and equity of those outside the public water system and to advance changes in conservation.  I listened very carefully to the Minister's interventions yesterday.  If he is going to bring forward those types of measures in line with what the committee agreed on we will support him on it but we will not accept further delays in those areas. <\/p>  <p>  One issue that received very little scrutiny, which was central to the committee and the European Commission, was funding certainty for water services.  Those of us on the Right2Water campaign made very firm proposals to the committee to ensure funding certainty by proposing a legally binding service level agreement between the State and the provider of water services for a decade.  That would satisfy the Commission's requirements as well as the funding needs for infrastructure, something that the Government has not supported.  We are back to the year-to-year budgetary cycles with the uncertainty that creates.<\/p>  <p>  When the committee first met, Fine Gael was divided on the refund of water charges.  At least Fianna F&aacute;il, Right2Water, the Labour Party and others supported it.  I want, however, to respond specifically to a comment the Minister made yesterday about the delays.  He said that he published the Bill at the end of September, which is true, and that he thought it was reasonable to get the Bill through the Houses by the middle of October.  The second week of October was budget week and there was no scheduling time available.  The idea that a Bill such as this, even if there was unanimous support for it, could be got through in a single week with adequate scrutiny, given the complexity of those issues not relating to refunds but the charge for so-called excessive use, was unrealistic.  Nobody on the Opposition side has sought to delay it.  We consented and agreed to dispense with pre-legislative scrutiny.  We wanted to have our say here because this was an issue of huge importance to many Deputies and our constituents.  We had a single sitting on Committee Stage.  Nowhere is there evidence to suggest that we have delayed the Bill but we should not have to make apologies for scrutinising or articulating our views on matters of huge public importance.  On the central issue at the heart of this Bill, which has been wrongly described by some people as a Bill about refunds, is the introduction of a charge for so-called excessive use, there are still unanswered questions.  I appeal to the Minister to address these in his concluding remarks because whether he is in favour of, or against, the charge for so-called excessive use people have a right to the answers. <\/p>  <p>  The biggest objection from this side of the House is that the infrastructure for the future introduction of a domestic, metered volumetric charge for water usage remains intact and in the future it can be extended by this Government or another one to a larger number of households at a higher cost.  That is our central objection.  Can the Minister confirm that the charge arising from this Bill will be a metric charge and that households above the threshold amount will be charged for every cubic metre or litre of water they use beyond that point? <\/p><p>Can the Minister provide clarity on what that charge will be because the legislation does not give us that and the public has a right to know?  Can he tell us how it is going to operate for households which have not been metered because if 54% or 55% are metered and the remainder are not and if there is a volumetric charge for so-called excessive use, almost half of households will not be able to have it applied?  Could that create legal problems for the State if there are two households on the same street, one of which has a meter and other does not and one of which is charged, while the other is not?  These are not questions designed to delay the progress of the Bill, rather they are legitimate questions to which people deserve answers.  <br\/><br\/>I note the one area in which the Minister accepted our <i>bona fides<\/i>on Committee Stage was the way in which waivers in respect of medical issues or household size would be rolled out.  I acknowledge that he gave a commitment to come back to us when the regulations were at draft stage to consult us.  I hope he will keep his word because obviously this issue is very important.  <br\/><br\/>One aspect of the Bill that surprises me - it is an issue on which Fianna F&aacute;il and Right2Water agreed - is that a household may fail foul of the charge for so-called excessive use, although it may not use water excessively.  It might live in a very old property or involve pensioner on a low income.  The water infrastructure on the property may be in such a bad state that it causes excessive leaks, yet there is no additional support for such households which might not be able to pay to rectify the leaks.  As a result they could face a fine or charge for water they are not consuming.  They would be more than happy to rectify the problem, but they might not have the means to do so.  In all sincerity, people have a right to answers to such questions.  Obviously, the Bill will proceed to the Seanad and if they are not addressed here, we will pursue them there.  Therefore, this issue will not go away.  Until the core agreement reached at the water committee that domestic water services be fully funded through general taxation and that there be a fully public and non-commercial utility protected in the Constitution, funded by the State to provide services for users on the basis of need, is put in place, we will continue to have these problems.  I do not think anyone in Sinn F&eacute;in or Right2Water will apologise for raising legitimate concerns on Second, Committee and Report Stages and I hope the Minister will provide us with the answers we rightfully deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800008#F00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510138500,"counter":56,"content":"<p>An old man once said to me that a bad law was an unjust law.  The setting up of Irish Water privatised water services installation, shut down small companies and destroyed work within the local authorities.  Irish Water held businesses and local authorities to ransom and forced county councils to give data for residents on the housing list, which was another breach of data protection legislation which was just dismissed by Irish Water.  It was, therefore, an absolute debacle.  One of the stipulations of the rules and regulations was that where Irish Water did excavate, it would put things back in the way it had found them, but that never happened.  It was shambolic, diabolical and a disgrace.  Irish Water terrified people.  A development plan in my county, an issue I raised in County Hall, was scuppered.  Irish Water refused to provide services.  It was farcical.  Irish Water has been telling county councils where they can and cannot develop houses or businesses because it was up to it to decide where water services would be provided.<\/p>  <p>  I again commend everybody who stood up and resisted the charges.

I thank Deputies for their co-operation in dealing with it in the past few months.  I thank the water charges committee for the extensive work it did, as well as the expert group and the joint Oireachtas committee for the time they took to consider the Bill.  I do not view it as a victory for the people.  I view it as political parties and politicians trying to use the issue to score points for their own political gain against a Government that is trying to recover an economy and a country.  It is a great disservice to the public they claim to represent.  After the general election in 2016, we had to put a Government together.  That meant putting stability above populism, which is exactly what Fine Gael sought to do.  Nevertheless, I hope the Bill will settle the matter for a number of years.  <\/p>  <p>  We have a single utility in Irish Water.  Regardless of whatever people might like to think about the good work it has already done, it has done good work.  It has proved itself in a number of instances in the work it is doing to help people who previously had been subject to \"boil water\" notices, to repair extensive parts of the water mains and infrastructure that had not been repaired previously and to help in times of crisis, including when Storm Ophelia struck in restoring people's water supplies, being part of the national emergency co-ordination group and working with ESB Networks to make sure the water infrastructure power supply was prioritised in those few days.  We have that single utility which is doing good work.  There is funding certainty for Irish Water in this legislation because of the different steps it sets out regarding the strategic plan for it, the policy statement that will come from me, the water services charging plan and the cost recovery mechanisms that will be involved in it.  We will have it in place for the years to come and also levels of transparency that were not evident previously.  These are all good things to have, particularly as we look to the future.  With all of the money we seek to invest in Irish Water, it is important that there be proper transparency in making that investment and in terms of what will happen.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett is right that the spin is continuing because simply to claim that this somehow and in some way represents water charges through the back door and also that the allowance is so generous that it will not capture swimming pools and water features is a ridiculous position to hold.  Nevertheless, the Deputy attempts to hold it.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to what Sinn F&eacute;in and parties of the left state will happen if the D&aacute;il changes or progresses its views in the future, I hope they are not suggesting they will stand against the democratic decision of the D&aacute;il if it makes that decision in the future because clearly the legislation puts that decision regarding the allowance figure of 1.7 on top of the average household allowance in the hands of the D&aacute;il.  I am not quite sure if Sinn F&eacute;in and Deputies on the left are saying they will stand against a democratic decision of the D&aacute;il, but the sentiment is clear in what they say.  When Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh asks why Fine Gael will not enter power with Sinn F&eacute;in, it is because of the undemocratic tendencies suggested in Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies' contributions.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputies claim there was an attempt at privatisation, but that was never the case and it is not the case today.  Owing to the funding arrangements for Irish Water, it is essentially impossible to do so.  I have no problem with retaining it in public ownership and holidng a referendum on the issue of public ownership, but we need to make the decision soon because Deputy Joan Collins's Bill is being brought to the committee.  If we think a referendum on the issue has priority over other referendums people want us to hold, for example, a referendum on the eighth amendment, that is a decision we must make and we must be responsible in coming to such a decision.  Again, I have no problem with holding a referendum on the issue of public ownership in the future, but there are other referenda that are just as important to people in this republic.  <\/p>  <p>  Once the Bill passes through both Houses, we will be able to begin the process of issuing refunds to as many households as possible.  Regrettably, it will not be possible to make them to all households before Christmas.  Let us be honest about the delays we have seen as the Bill has passed through the House.  Let us look at the number of speakers who contributed on Second Stage and the speeches they repeated on Second, Committee and Report Stages and in their concluding remarks.  Let us look at the number of amendments tabled, refused and resubmitted.  As Deputy Barry Cown pointed out, let us look at the substance of some of those amendments and what they were really trying to achieve, if it was not to cause a delay.  Let us look at some of the questions I had already answered that were asked again today.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin can go back and look at the record of the proceedings in the House yesterday, at the questions I answered related to the role of the independent regulator.  Perhaps Sinn F&eacute;in does not support having an independent regulator, but we do.  It will answer the questions about the actual amount to be charged.  It will be a metric charge for those with a meter.  For those without a meter, I imagine there will be a range of charges, but that will be a matter for the independent regulator to decide in consultations.  There is plenty of time to decide because, as we all know, even though an attempt was made to take these measures out of the legislation, there will be a 12-month period beginning in January during which we will review households' consumption of water.  Following that 12-month period, they will be issued with a notice and have six months to bring their usage below an allowance that allows for there being eight people in a household.  If they number more than four, they can apply for even more for individuals.  If there is a medical need, they will be able to apply for a waiver.  Again, to suggest this represents the introduction of water charges through the back door and somehow leaves something open or left to be done is complete nonsense.  <\/p>  <p>  I have already begun my engagement with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and that engagement will continue once the Bill has been passed.  I have to say it is a pleasure to deal with the group because it knows what it costs and what it means to have clean drinking water and treatment facilities provided for households.<\/p><p>The Government will continue to prioritise investment in our network and in the future of the country's water services.  We will continue to conserve water and improve that water services network into the future because of the importance this vital resource has for all the businesses and people in this Republic.  I accept this investment was not made in the past.  In the past it was not prioritised as an investment because water infrastructure is below ground and therefore perhaps not as sexy as hospitals and schools, but it is just as important.  We will continue to make that a priority and the Bill will allow us to do that.<\/p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800009#G00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1510139100,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 71; N\u00edl, 39; Staon, 0.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Joe McHugh and Tony McLoughlin; N\u00edl, Deputies Mick Barry and Ruth Coppinger.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800010#H00200","aye":["1368","1321","1332","1310","1293","1369","1220","1335","1260","1241","1273","1357","1218","1255","1336","1221","1217","1285","1298","1364","1261","1338","1436","1292","1274","1264","1300","1214","1331","1360","1237","1249","1365","1229","1311","1323","1337","1359","1223","1248","1290","1343","1243","1247","1363","1284","1283","1262","1295","1315","1328","1326","1312","1228","1296","1227","1267","1329","1278","1324","1265","1231","1334","1304","1213","1294","1344","1271","1277","1250","1358"],"nay":["1432","1238","1252","1361","1279","1306","1263","1316","1434","1309","1258","1259","1288","1303","1317","1266","1320","1319","1348","1353","1349","1299","1347","1362","1333","1433","1215","1269","1305","1280","1302","1325","1370","1327","1276","1367","1232","1235","1355"],"abs":[]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2017 [Seanad]: Order for Report Stage","time":1510139700,"counter":60,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800011#J00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1510139700,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Report Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800011#J00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510139700,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2017 [Seanad]: Report Stage","time":1510139700,"counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800011#J00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1510139700,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>In page 11, line 7, to delete &ldquo;5 years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;3 years&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>I just make the point at the outset that it is a bit mad that the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality is sitting to deal with business at the same time as this debate is taking place.

As such, the different groups have sent half their representations here for this debate.  It is a bit regrettable.<\/p>  <p>  While amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are not grouped, I would like, with the indulgence of the Chair, to make a verbal contribution on both together.  As they are related to much the same subject matter, it would be difficult to talk about one without discussing the other.  Amendment No. 1 deals with the waiting period for the first review of the suitability of the harmonised index of consumer prices for the setting of periodic payment order amounts.<\/p><p>Our proposal in this amendment is to reduce the time we have to wait for the review to be done from five years to three.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 relate to the crucial issue of linking periodic payment orders to the actual cost of health care.  As we pointed out on Second Stage, if this is not done, we run the very real risk that people who have been catastrophically injured in our health service will not receive funds sufficient actually to pay for the care that they need.  We have recently had representation from wards of court at the justice committee.  They described the complexities around some of these issues.<\/p> <p> On Committee Stage, we tabled a number of amendments that proposed the creation of a new index based, among other things, on the actual cost of care and for that index to be used in calculating periodic payment orders, PPOs.  Those amendments were defeated on Committee Stage, with the Minister of State noting that there could be problems with the reliability of a new index early on in the periodic payment order system.  In light of that, amendment No. 1 provides that the Minister would review the suitability of the index that is now being proposed in the Bill - the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP - after three years instead of five.  Amendment No. 2 provides that if the Minister forms the view that the index is not suitable, he will be required to specify a different one.  That is the nub of the two proposals before the House.<\/p> <p> It is worth pointing out that the original recommendation with regard to indexation of PPOs, which was unanimously endorsed by the judicial working group on medical negligence, was that an earnings and cost-related index be introduced as a guide to PPO costs.  However, the Bill before us uses the harmonised index of consumer prices as published by the CSO with no special provision for an index of care costs, which is the exact opposite of what the judicial working group recommended and completely ignores its unanimous recommendation.  Linking payment orders to the HICP ignores the real difference between general increases in consumer prices and the much greater increase in medical wage and treatment costs.  The working group on legislation to provide for PPOs points out that the Department of Finance, in its paper on PPO indexation, stated that an index based purely on either the consumer price index, CPI, or the HICP would not take direct account of wages and that the CSO's quarterly earnings, hours and employment costs survey should give the best outcome to recipients over the longer term.  Using the right index is actually critical, which is why so many of the working groups spent so long telling us what it should be.  What we are doing in this Bill is not that.  It is something different.  I think it does cause a problem which will get worse over time.<\/p> <p> There is another point of danger.  The word on the ground among people who work in the area is that if this proposed system is not changed to something else, plaintiffs will not go for PPOs at all, although that is what we want them to be doing.  They will instead take lump sums, which is what we are supposed to be moving away from.  It would be crazy if we went to the trouble of bringing in this legislation only to have it not used.  We are not really asking for that much.  We are asking that the review would occur in a timely manner, after three years instead of five.  We think three years is enough for trends to emerge without them having a potential negative impact on recipients.  We think five years is too long and could bring us into the territory where people are being negatively impacted.<\/p> <p> On amendment No. 2, the Bill currently provides that the Minister \"may propose\" an alternative index after the review, even if the review has found that the current index is not suitable.  We think that is ludicrous.  It should provide that if the Minister finds it is not suitable, he or she \"shall\" come up with an alternative.  I would not have thought either amendment to be hugely problematic, to be honest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800011#J00700","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510140000,"counter":67,"content":"<p>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle's guidance would be helpful.

Section 51L(2) provides that a review of the efficacy of the HICP index be carried out after an initial five-year period.  Deputies Wallace and Daly's proposed amendment would reduce that to three years.  I am sure Deputies will recognise that to get an accurate representation as to whether the HICP index, as the reference index on the basis of which PPO annual payments are adjusted, is working to the benefit of catastrophically injured persons, it will be necessary to have a sufficient number of cases and allow a sufficient amount of time to determine the efficacy of the index.  There are, thankfully, relatively few cases coming before the courts on an annual basis and in that context I consider that five years is the correct time period to establish whether the HICP is the appropriate index for use in cases involving catastrophically injured persons.  We are far more likely to have a good volume and range of cases on which to make an assessment after five rather than three years.  Therefore, while I appreciate the Deputies' intentions in seeking to accelerate the review, I believe that the best outcome for assessing the efficacy of these new measures can be achieved on the basis of a five-year review and am not accepting the amendment.<\/p>  <p>  By way of further information, I am advised that there are approximately 20 catastrophic injury cases involving State defendants per annum and an equivalent number involving non-State bodies.  Not all will involve PPOs as many will be resolved by lump sum payments.  The analysis of this index over three years could be too volatile, given the small number of cases.  The UK experience is that the CPI performed better over the past eight years than the earnings index.  There are good reasons for not doing that.<\/p>  <p>  On amendment No. 2, section 51L(4) provides for the making of regulations where a review of the prevailing index has concluded that an index other than the HICP would be more appropriate for use in catastrophic injury cases.  Deputies Daly's and Wallace's proposed amendment would make it mandatory for the Minister to make such regulations.  We have looked closely at this and can see merit in the proposal.  It makes sense to me that if an alternative index were considered more suitable for use than the HICP, the Minister should be required to make the necessary regulation, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.  In that context, I propose to accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800012#K00800","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1510140000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that we are on Report Stage of this important legislation.  As was indicated earlier, it is essential that we get periodic payment orders on the Statute Book to assist individuals who have suffered the most serious injuries.  As Deputy Clare Daly mentioned, a number of weeks ago we had representatives of wards of court in before the justice committee.  Many of them were family members of persons who had received awards many years ago.  One of the difficulties was that the courts that made the awards all those years ago were not able to calculate accurately the amount of money required in order to maintain the wards under care for a sufficient period.  It was instructive that many of the individuals were of an older age.  Their loved ones had received awards some 20 or more years ago.  The whole purpose of this legislation is to protect people in that position and to ensure that they will not be left in a position where awards have to be made by a court on day one and then, 20 years later, it is seen that the award was not sufficient.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of amendment No. 1, I agree with the Minister of State that three years is too short a period.  It is necessary for there to be a period of five years in order to assess the extent to which the awards made by the courts are sufficient and the impact of the harmonised index of consumer prices.  It is going to take some time to consider it.  The Minister of State has indicated that there are about 40 cases involving catastrophic injuries.  I think we need to build up a body of cases before decisions are made.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of amendment No. 2, before the Minister of State had spoken, I thought it appropriate to support the amendment.  It seems illogical that the Minister would recognise that there needs to be a new index introduced, and that there was another index that was more suitable, yet that the Minister would have discretion as to whether to introduce it.  It is also noteworthy that this requires the consent of the Minister for Finance.  We will be supporting amendment No. 2.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800012#K00900","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1510140600,"counter":75,"content":"<p>All Members want periodic payment orders which are far preferable to lump sum payments.  We are trying to facilitate a move in that direction because it would presumably and I hope be more beneficial to a catastrophically injured person.  It is very important that the chosen system be set up in a robust manner in order that people opt for it and will not have to rely on the lump sum payment.<\/p>  <p>  I hear what the Minister of State is saying about a period of three versus five years.  I would probably be less concerned if the Bill provided for an index such as that recommended by the various bodies we went to the trouble of setting up to consider the issue.  I would then have been happier to leave the review period at five rather than three years because the judicial working group on medical negligence, the working group on legislation to provide for periodic payment orders, PPOs, and indications from the Department of Finance all recommended a different index from the one included in the Bill.  That is regrettable, although I appreciate there will not be enough data available, but I would have been far more comforted if the recommended system were to be used and then reviewed after five years.  However, I do agree and in many ways would have been pressing the second amendment had the Minister of State not agreed to it.  Therefore, we have thankfully saved ourselves a vote on it.  It is the more important amendment and I am glad that it is being accepted.  At the end of five years I hope things will work out, although I do not know if that will be the case.

If the Minister and the Government think the index is fine, it should not be left at that, rather the Minister should outline the reasons for forming that opinion.  In view of the seriousness of the issue, the Oireachtas and the public need and deserve to know why the Minister decided not to use an alternative index.

The amendment would seem to require the Minister to lay a statement on the reasons for maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>provided for in legislation which would have been enacted by the Oireachtas.

That is not a stumbling block for the acceptance of the amendment which we put forward in the context of there being huge concern about the issue.  Many people are considering the legislation and many are concerned that the right index may not have been chosen.  As an index is being introduced in the primary legislation that is against the best advice of those asked to consult on it, we have come up on the wrong side of the advice offered.  Therefore, in terms of the review, what is to stop these valid viewpoints or concerns being articulated therein or how do we know that they will be taken into account or what criteria will be used?  One could argue that it reflects a nervousness that the Government might not be forthcoming in reviewing the orders because oddly it has chosen a method that was not favoured by the consulted groups.  It is not personal.  It may not even be this Government that will be responsible for the review in five years' time.  There should be an accountability mechanism in place such that people would know the reasons the index was not being changed, even though the expert advice had not been heeded the first time the index was brought in.  In view of the fact that the review will only happen in five years' time and perhaps periodically thereafter, it is not a hugely taxing amendment and I do not think it is a big deal.

We are dealing here with new definitions of the types of safety incident that cause serious and less serious harm; with mandatory open disclosure regarding serious incidents; with voluntary open disclosure of less serious incidents; and so on.  This is a huge group.  With the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's permission I would like to deal with one half of it first before dealing with amendments Nos. 38 to 47, inclusive, separately as they deal with a different issue.<\/p>  <p>  The first group-within-the-group is, we believe, the most important.  It deals with making the open disclosure of serious safety incidents in the health service mandatory.  Open disclosure is absolutely crucial.  When something goes wrong the patient has to know what happened and there also has to be an acknowledgment of the fact that something went wrong.  When somebody is injured because of a mistake it is imperative that there is openness all around.  At Committee Stage our amendment to provide for mandatory open disclosure of all incidents, whether major or minor, was miraculously accepted.  That was a very welcome development.  Following from that we had meetings with officials from the Department of Health at which we gave a commitment to table further amendments on Report Stage to the effect that near misses and very minor incidents would not be subject to open disclosure.  This is because the way in which our amendment was accepted on Committee Stage would probably have resulted in it being too burdensome for health care workers to go through open disclosure for every near miss.  We were very happy to meet the departmental officials halfway on this matter and we gave a commitment that we would limit what was agreed at committee.  That, then, is what these amendments are about.  <\/p>  <p>  What we now propose is, first, that in the cases of near misses and minor incidents open disclosure to the patient is something that the health providers can and should do but is not absolutely obligatory in law.  It is of course open to the HSE to make a disclosure of all incidents mandatory as a matter of policy if it so wishes.  This would not, however, be defined in law.  Second, and crucially, we propose that when it comes to more serious incidents and more serious harm, health care providers must be open with the patient about what happened and what the consequences for the patient might be.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to say that we have had a system of voluntary open disclosure in Irish hospitals since 2013 and all of the evidence and anecdotes so far point the fact that it has not done much good.  The United Kingdom, on the other hand, has a mandatory duty of candour.  It is not an unknown quantity and it has been shown to work very well.  The departmental officials, in fairness, agreed with us when we met them that they do not know which is best.  Everybody wants a system in which patients get information but it remains an open question as to which approach is best.  We believe that the UK example is the best model to follow because the open disclosure of serious incidents is simply too important for patients, safety, staff, and for our health service in general to be left on a voluntary footing.<\/p>  <p>  As we said before, we know that there is a problem with the culture in our health service.  We know this from the hepatitis C scandal; maternal deaths; baby deaths in Portlaoise and Portiuncula; and from cases of catastrophic injuries that have occurred in hospitals.  We know that the default position of the HSE in many of these cases is to admit nothing and to circle the wagons.  This is an entrenched culture that will not change without a lot of prodding.  As far as we are concerned, voluntary open disclosure will not work in this kind of culture.  Incidents will not be disclosed and honest health care providers will be penalised for making disclosures if nobody else is doing so.  We will end up with an awful prisoner's dilemma situation in the health service where each hospital will end up eyeing the others to see who is going to go first.  This will not be good enough.  There is no evidence to support the view that a voluntary system of open disclosure is better or more effective than a mandatory system.  That evidence is not there.  The UK example, however, shows that the mandatory model is a good one.  <\/p>  <p>  We also deal here with the new definitions that we propose in the second group of amendments in this section.  When an incident takes place that causes major harm, moderate harm or prolonged psychological harm to a patient, we propose that the service owns up to it and tells the patient what happened.  What this means, then, is that there is mandatory open disclosure in these cases.  This has been limited following the Committee Stage debate.  We have put forward the definitions of those kinds of harm and modelled them on the definitions of the types of harm given in the HSE's own safety incident management policy and on the impact table for incidents used to make what we are talking about here smoother to implement.  These definitions are also based on the definitions of harm given in the UK's duty of candour regulations.  It is worth noting that this duty of candour only mandates the disclosure of incidents above moderate harm, which is exactly what we propose in this legislation.  <\/p>  <p>  We define major harm as \"a permanent lessening of bodily, sensory, motor, physiological or intellectual functions, including the removal of the wrong limb or organ that is related directly to a safety incident and not related to the natural course of the patient's illness or underlying condition\".  Moderate harm is defined as \"harm that requires an unplanned return to surgery, an unplanned re-admission, a prolonged episode of care, extended time in hospital or as an outpatient, cancelling of treatment or transfer to another treatment area (such as intensive care)\".  Finally, prolonged psychological harm is \"psychological harm which a patient has experienced, or is likely to experience, for a continuous period of at least 28 days\".<\/p>  <p>  We consider that our proposals are reasonable and fair, taking into account the committee discussions and our subsequent discussions with the Department of Health.  We do not see how it could be argued that the open disclosure of more serious incidents should not be mandatory.  That is all that is on the table here.  We are talking about cases of serious catastrophic harm up to and including the death of a patient because of a mistake made in a hospital.  It would be lunacy to give hospitals permission to clam up about what happened in such cases.  We view these amendments, then, as incredibly serious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800014#M00900","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1510141200,"counter":99,"content":"<p>As Deputy Daly said, our aim here is to place an obligation on health care providers to be open with patients in the aftermath of a serious incident resulting in the patient suffering serious harm.  Our preference would have been to place an obligation on health care providers to always be open about any incident, no matter how minor, but in our amendments we have now restricted this to more serious incidents.  This is because, as Deputy Daly noted, requiring open disclosure of every small incident or near miss could - though not necessarily - make things a bit difficult for health professionals.  It remains open to providers to be open about near misses and minor incidents of course, but we are also trying to accommodate the qualms of the Department and the HSE over the strong need to make disclosure of more serious incidents obligatory.<\/p>  <p>  We have been told in previous discussions over mandatory versus voluntary approaches that the latter would make open disclosure more likely.<\/p><p>This is a tortured piece of reasoning for which there is no evidence.  The Committee on Health's report on open disclosure cites one piece of so-called research on voluntary systems being more effective.  In fact, this so-called research is a one page editorial in the <i>British Medical Journal<\/i>in 2000, 17 years ago, by a specialist in medication error from the US.  It relates to the area of medication error reporting and is focused on anonymous reporting of errors and, by extension, adverse incidents.  This is what the national incident management system, NIMS, is for.  It is nothing to do with open disclosure.  This is not a research article.  It is an opinion piece based on a very small number - four - outdated references, one of which relates to aviation errors.  None relates to disclosures of errors to patients.<br\/><br\/>The UK has a statutory duty of candour, as do Alberta, Quebec, Manitoba and Saskatchewan in Canada.  Quebec introduced its legislation on foot of scandals similar to those in hospitals here.  Litigation rates have remained exactly the same since, yet there seems to be considerable fear here that what we propose will lead to greater litigation.  That is not borne out by the evidence elsewhere.  Seven states in the USA have mandatory duties of candour, as does New Zealand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800014#M01000","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510141800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Leaders' Questions","time":1510141800,"counter":102,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800015#N00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1510141800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>At the beginning of last month, and indeed, before then, I raised the plight of section 39 bodies in the health area, specifically hospices.  They are being treated in a particularly shabby, cynical and dishonest manner in relation to pay restoration and funding for that by the Minister for Health and the Government generally.  This relates to the Lansdowne Road agreement and new public sector pay agreements.<\/p>  <p>  The hospice movement is one of the most cherished areas of care in our health service, uniquely enjoying almost universal approval from the public for the remarkable care, empathy and space that it gives to families and their loved ones at the end of their lives.  It also provides a range of services, including community-based care, respite and advice.  The clearest manifestation of this has been the public endorsement of hospices through extraordinary fundraising over the years, for both capital and current funding.  Hospices would not be able to keep their doors open were it not for the public support for fundraising that goes on constantly.  Therefore, I am surprised by the degree to which the Department of Health, the Minister and the Taoiseach have been stonewalling on a simple and key issue of pay restoration similar to that enjoyed by public servants in the HSE arising from the new public service pay agreement, Lansdowne Road and the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, pay cuts.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, have told me in replies to parliamentary questions that FEMPI did not apply to section 39 bodies, but it did.  There is a trail of documents.  I met representatives of five hospices who produced the documentation to this effect from Barry O'Brien, the national director of human resources, in November 2013.  He was very clear, writing of the consistent application and implementation of the provisions of the Haddington Road agreement and appointing an assurance team to work with all HSE and HSE-funded agencies to bring this about.  There is also a letter to the then CEO of Galway hospice on 7 October 2013 which refers to the implementation of payroll and related cost reductions in line with other publicly funded bodies.  The Labour Court made an adjudication against Milford Care Centre at the time, telling it that it must implement the cuts because that linkage with the HSE pay scales was there and was acknowledged.<\/p>  <p>  It is time to end the Jesuitical playacting around this issue and the splitting of hairs that characterises the Government's response to date.  The record should be corrected because the pay cuts were applied to hospices.  The funding should be restored to hospices and the link to the HSE pay scales should be restored forthwith.  I want the Taoiseach to confirm today that he will do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800015#N00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1510141800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I share the Deputy's very strong support for the hospice movement.  In my constituency, I have helped to secure funding for the St. Francis hospice in Blanchardstown, ensuring that it was opened and staffed when I became Minister for Health and building on the work of my constituency predecessor, Brian Lenihan, who ensured that public land was provided on which to build it.  It was paid for primarily through funds raised in the community.  As Minister for Health I also gave commitments to the new hospice being built for Wicklow and the recently opened hospice in County Mayo.  Everyone in the House is very supportive of the hospice movement which provides people with the possibility to spend their last days with dignity and care, whether in the hospices or receiving hospice care in their own homes.<\/p>  <p>  The specific issue raised by the Deputy was discussed at Cabinet yesterday.  I have asked the Ministers, Deputies Paschal Donohoe and Simon Harris, to examine the matter and come up with a solution or at least a clear answer in the coming weeks.  The Deputy will know that the difference between section 38 and section 39 bodies is not Jesuitical.  It is there in law in the Health Act, which I believe Deputy Martin himself brought through the House.  People who work for section 38 bodies are public servants and are paid for by the State while those who work for section 39 bodies are generally employees of charities or foundations or occasionally of businesses.  The way that the Government funds those section 39 bodies, which include most of our hospices, is through a block grant over which the hospices have significant autonomy, and they decide what they do with those funds.  Some of it will go towards paying staff while other parts of it will go towards equipment, possibly building costs, debt reduction or other costs.<\/p>  <p>  Over the coming weeks, we will have to assess whether the increase of the block grants, which many of these bodies have been awarded, was there to cover pay restoration in part.  We have to protect taxpayers and it should be borne in mind that the people who use hospice services and donate towards them are also taxpayers.  We cannot have a situation where we give a section 39 body the same money twice.  If the increase in the block grant that they received in recent years was sufficient to cover pay restoration, that is a separate issue than if it is not, and this is the question that will be examined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800015#N00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1510141800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>There is no point in the Taoiseach saying that we all support hospices and then he screws them.  That is what he has been doing on this issue for the past six months.  It is utterly dishonest.  The replies from the Minister and from the Taoiseach are dishonest.  The hospices' non-pay costs have increased significantly.  We all have correspondence from the hospices on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  It is very simple.  The pay linkage should be restored.  The Taoiseach can refer to the legislation but we all know the difference between section 39 bodies and the HSE.  The bottom line is that the HSE made it very clear that they would use the service level agreement to ensure that the section 39 bodies honoured the pay cuts, or in other words, if they did not, the HSE would cut their funding and do so to the equivalent level that it would identify.  This is terrible blackguarding that is going on here.  It is time to get rid of all the verbiage and the nonsense.  The hospices raise most of the capital funding and 25% to 30% of their current funding themselves, and the public contributes to that.  We carry on with this play acting here, pretending that there is some sort of wall between these bodies and the public pay scales.  There has always been a link.  They, along with the other section 39 bodies, have been excluded from the implementation of the new agreements, wrongly in my view, and in a very dishonest way.<\/p><p>It should be rectified as a matter of urgency because these staff will not be able to afford to continue over the next three years due to the breaking of the link between pay scales in respect of pay restoration by the Taoiseach's Government and the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800015#N00700","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510142400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>First, I reject that allegation and the language which Deputy Martin has just used in this House.

Apparently he is a champion of those who get up early in the morning and go to work, unless of course they are a family earning less than &euro;75,000 a year.  It seems that in Deputy Varadkar's republic the only people who deserve affordable housing are the well off.  Hundreds of thousands of working people are caught in Fine Gael's affordability trap.  They earn too much to qualify for social housing but not enough to rent or buy a decent home.  Where is the opportunity in Deputy Varadkar's republic for the young couple with an income of &euro;50,000?  They are forced to choose between paying up to 55% of their net income on rent or living with their parents for years in order to save for a deposit.  Where is the opportunity in Deputy Varadkar's republic for a couple in their late 50s who are separated or divorced from an earlier relationship?  They can manage their rent alright, but they fear for a future of real financial hardship after retirement.  Let us not forget the single working person on &euro;35,000 a year, even though the Government obviously has.  Such people are forced to live in shared accommodation because they simply cannot afford to buy or rent.<\/p>  <p>  Average rents are now between &euro;14,000 and &euro;23,000 a year.  Average house prices across the State are at &euro;250,000 and, in Dublin, somewhere in the region of &euro;400,000.  No doubt the Taoiseach will tell us that supply is the answer and that it is his Government's number one priority.  We all know, of course, that supply in and of itself does not guarantee affordability.  At the height of the boom, when the State was delivering 90,000 homes a year, the Taoiseach will remember that prices of rental and purchase of accommodation were rising through the roof.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will also tell us of his myriad schemes - help to buy, the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and home building finance Ireland.  This amounts to &euro;1.1 billion of subsidies to private sectors developers.  For what?  To provide tax relief for those earning over &euro;90,000 with enough savings to buy their own home.  Homes are for sale at &euro;320,000 in Dublin and &euro;280,000 elsewhere, courtesy of LIHAF and home building finance Ireland.  Nothing is provided for the hard-working families who earn between &euro;40,000 and &euro;70,000 a year.  Despite all the talk and all the subsidies for developers, it is clear there is no opportunity for working families to live in affordable accommodation.  My questions are very simple.  They are in fact so simple that the Taoiseach may be able to answer them without referring to his script.  What is the Government's definition of affordable housing?  What is the exact number of genuinely affordable housing units which will be delivered by the Taoiseach's Government next year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800016#O02500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1510142400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I cannot give the Deputy a numerical definition of affordable housing.

I was in my constituency on Monday with the Minister, Deputy Murphy, visiting the Hansfield area where more that 1,000 houses are under construction.  Some 150 of these are social housing and 800 to 900 are family and affordable housing.  In that part of my constituency there are houses available for &euro;320,000 and apartments available for &euro;220,000.  People able to secure a 35 year mortgage would pay &euro;880 a month, which is considerably less than people pay in rent in many parts of the city.

The definition which the Deputy has offered is entirely bogus.  I have no idea where he has gotten the threshold of &euro;75,000.  I will give him some examples of the kind of things we are doing for people who do get up early in the morning and work, at all income levels.<\/p>  <p>  In the recent budget we reduced the USC for everyone who pays it.  Some 70% of taxpayers will see a reduction in the USC.  We raised the standard rate cut-off point.  That benefits any individual earning more than &euro;35,000 and any single-income couple earning more than &euro;45,000.  We reduced prescription medicine costs for everyone - those who have medical cards and those who do not.  That applies to people of all incomes.  We have also expanded child care provision and introduced a guaranteed second year of pre-school for working people of all incomes.  In addition we have introduced subsidised child care.  There are now subsidies universally for working parents of all income levels.  There are also targeted subsidies for those on the lowest pay.  We have increased the minimum wage twice under this Government for those on the lowest pay.  We are restoring public sector pay, starting with those on the lowest incomes but extending up the line as time goes by.  I could go on, but those are just a few of the myriad ways in which this Government is standing up for people who work, people who get up early in the morning and people at all income levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800016#O02800","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1510142400,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Will the Taoiseach tell us about himself?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800016#O02900","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1510142400,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.

Hollywood has been rocked with accounts of rich and powerful men abusing their power over women and vulnerable young men.  In Ireland, women in the arts are speaking out about persistent sexual harassment they have experienced.  The Gate Theatre, which has been a recipient of public funds over many years, seemingly did nothing to protect the women who actually worked for it and in it.  What is becoming clear from all these examples is that sexual harassment is a universal experience.  Every single woman in this country and non-binary people know the stomach-churning feeling brought about by unwanted sexual advances and remarks.  Such harassment has an enormous impact on the self-confidence, health and self-esteem of women.  In that context, why did the Taoiseach trivialise this issue when he was asked about it and use it as an opportunity to score a point against political opponents?  When asked if such a culture existed in Leinster House, where hundreds of women work in countless capacities, the Taoiseach chose instead to talk about his experience of being interrupted by men and women from the Opposition.  In doing so, he belittled a serious issue and made it about himself.  He managed to turn #MeToo into #M&eacute;F&eacute;in.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Taoiseach made a comment saying inappropriate, boorish and obnoxious behaviour does not necessarily constitute bullying or sexual assault, but so-called low-level behaviour creates a culture of tolerance and acceptance of violence against women generally.  It should be called out.  Why else would sexual harassment, rape and domestic violence be all so under-reported?  Only 13 cases of sexual harassment were taken through the Workplace Relations Commission in 2016, yet in an EU survey of Irish women, it is indicated that 48% have been sexually harassed since the age of 15 while 39% have experienced severe forms.<\/p>  <p>  Are we to rely completely on the Internet for women to come out and disclose this?  Alternatively, is this State going to take measures to gauge the real extent of sexual abuse and harassment?  Does the Taoiseach take this seriously enough to commission a report now on sexual abuse and violence in Ireland, SAVI?  Such a report has not been produced in this country for 15 years.  Does it not say something about the priorities of this State that no such report has been produced because it would cost &euro;1 million, although the Taoiseach's new department of propaganda costs the taxpayer &euro;5 million?  Is it not shocking that Rape Crisis Network Ireland cannot produce any figures for 2016 because it had its funding cut by 70% in 2015?  Does the Taoiseach take this issue seriously enough to carry out a SAVI study now?  Will he properly fund agencies and refuges combating violence against women?  Does he believe a nationwide campaign about consent is now necessary in schools, colleges and workplaces to send a message of zero tolerance of this type of harassment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800017#P02500","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1510143000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I am afraid the Deputy is misinformed.  I was asked two separate questions.  One was on sexual harassment, and I gave a very clear answer to that.  It was an unequivocal condemnation of sexual harassment and sexual assault of any sort in any place, not least workplaces.  I was asked a separate question about macho behaviour in the House, to which I gave a separate answer.  I will assume the Deputy is misinformed and not deliberately trying to misrepresent me or conflate two different answers to two very different questions.<\/p>  <p>  It is very much my view that everyone is entitled to be treated with respect and dignity in the workplace.  There can be no tolerance of sexual harassment, assault or bullying in any form in any workplace.  It is very important that we recognise this.  I certainly want to express my admiration for the men and women who have come out in recent times to tell their stories of sexual assault and violence against them.  Perhaps that can change the culture in the future in order that people who engage in such behaviour against other individuals will think twice if they know they will be exposed for it.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Gate Theatre specifically, it receives significant public funding, as do many private bodies and companies.  The theatre is an independent body, however, and it has its own board and trustees.  It is incumbent on it now to honour its obligations under employment equality legislation to establish an independent inquiry and take necessary actions based on that.  The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, met representatives of the Arts Council last night.  It was an initial meeting to discuss general concerns over the mistreatment of women, bullying and sexual harassment in general across the arts sector.  I do not believe for a second that the problem is confined to the arts sector.  I am sure it is prevalent in all sectors.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the SAVI report, it is not a matter of money.  Funding for sexual and domestic violence organisations amounted to &euro;22.1 million this year, which is up &euro;1.5 million on last year.  That is just that part of the budget.  Therefore, a survey that costs &euro;1 million over three years could easily be accommodated within a budget that is well over &euro;22 million.  The question that has to be asked is a different one.  Are the statistics we already have adequate?  There are statistics - European statistics and Garda statistics.  If the statistics are not adequate, is a SAVI study the best way to get adequate statistics?  Is reporting a study, the methodology of which was determined 15 years ago, now the right thing to do 15 years later?  I have asked the key Ministers, Deputies Flanagan, Zappone, Doherty and Harris, to come together on this to examine two questions.  Are the statistics we have adequate and, if not, what is the best form of study that should be done to establish the true level of sexual harassment and sexual violence in the State?  Is it to be a repeat of a study whose methodology is 15 years old or should it be something else?  As I said before in this House, I have an absolutely open mind on this.  It is not a matter of money but a question of whether the study is necessary and, if so, the best way to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800017#P02600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1510143000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I do not believe anybody buys the idea that the Taoiseach was not convinced about producing another SAVI report with the same methodology.

In terms of the Government's actions to date, I draw the Deputy's attention to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.  It is legislation introduced by the Government that was enacted on 22 February this year.  It enhances and updates laws to combat sexual exploitation and the sexual abuse of children, including new offences related to child sexual grooming and strengthened defences relating to child pornography.  It also criminalises the purchase of sexual services, introduces new provisions regarding the giving of evidence by victims in sexual offence trials and introduces a new offence dealing with public indecency.  Other provisions include maintaining the age of consent to sexual activity at 17 years for a new proximity of age defence as well as a statutory statement of the law with regard to consent to sexual acts.  That is the legislative progress the Government has made this year alone.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned, funding for domestic and sexual violence organisations in the round was increased by &euro;1.5 million this year and in addition to that I have asked the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister for Health to consider the issue Deputy Coppinger raised on up-to-date statistics on sexual violence.

As I said at the time, most of the bank robbers are now deep in the boardrooms and not on the streets as used to be the case.  I believe it was important to speak on the issue, because episodes like the tracker mortgage scandal reveal where the real centres of power lie in the State.  The position is that there is no law for the bankers and the rich and another law for the rest of us.  That has only been compounded by the revelations contained in the so-called Paradise Papers.  Unprecedented levels of tax evasion or aggressive tax avoidance have been uncovered.<\/p><p>Prior to the American Civil War the rallying cry was, &quot;No taxation without representation&quot;.  That was a very noble aspiration.  It is a principle that has now been completely reversed, especially in this country.  It is clear that all of those who pay little or no taxation, including bankers, have all of the representation.  They have access to, and control the levers of power and have rights that the ordinary working person could not dream of.<\/p><p>During the 2016 debate in this House on the Panama Papers, the then Finance Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, said he was bringing forward legislation to enable tax defaulters to make a qualifying disclosure to Revenue.  He was very good.  The Minister went on to say that defaulters who have used offshore accounts or assets in their evasion will &quot;find themselves in a very difficult position if they do not come forward quickly to regularise their affairs with Revenue&quot;.  Could the Taoiseach tell me how many of those people have come forward?  I did not see any queues outside the Department of Finance but perhaps the Taoiseach knows the figures.  I suggest that not many came forward.  Institutional tax avoidance still appears to be rampant in the State.<\/p><p>AIB held an EGM last Friday.  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Minister for Finance was present at the meeting?  If not, he should have been, given that we have more than a 90% stake in the bank.  Colm Keena reported in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>on Monday details about AIB.  He referred to leaked files from the Isle of Man offices of the offshore law firm Appleby.  The files reveal Government-owned AIB refused to give the Revenue Commissioners access to data on its offshore customers when responding to a court order in 2015.  The bank refused to obey the courts of this land.<\/p><p>For most people on the outside listening to this today, and indeed for most of us here, the ins and outs of the international tax system are a complete labyrinth.  It is deliberately designed so that ordinary people cannot understand it.  What is not hard to understand however is the sense that such episodes reveal a large gaping hole at the heart of our democracy.  The massive double standard that operates in this arena rightly infuriates people.  In the meantime the Taoiseach makes great play about acting the tough guy with respect to social welfare fraud.  He said they should be named and shamed.  Unless I missed it, I did not see the Taoiseach outside the headquarters of AIB or Bank of Ireland with placards and hashtags saying that bankers should be named and shamed and that they should be outed.  It is a case of one law for the rich.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach knew all about the banking scandal in 2011 when he was on the finance committee.  He was told by Friends of Banking Ireland and other organisations yet the merry-go-round continues.  I want to know if the Taoiseach attended the EGM and what it was all about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800018#Q00500","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1510143600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I have never been a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance.

Tax avoidance is very much an international problem.  We know that when one country closes a loophole people seeking to avoid tax move on to the next country so what is required is an international solution to what is very much an international problem.  The OECD is the international body that deals with this issue.  It has defined Ireland as one of 22 countries that has a clean bill of health when it comes to tax transparency.  In addition, we have agreed to enter into information sharing, whereby for the first time the Revenue Commissioners will share with their counterparts in other countries how much tax companies have paid.  That is an important step forward so that revenue authorities in different countries will be able to share that information.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the Revenue Commissioners, they have said they will examine the Paradise Papers.

They also know what is going on in the banks because ordinary families have been terrorised and robbed.  I hope you do not get too annoyed with my choice of language, a Cheann Comhairle.  The bank robbers are deeply entrenched among the policy makers in the banks.  As I said two or three weeks ago, the Government just hopes this storm will go away and it will ride it out and nothing meaningful will happen to those people who are milking us dry day in and day out, and taking the lifeblood of the ordinary people.  We do not have any legislation to deal with the big boys and we are playing catch-up all the time.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach referred to so many million pages in the Paradise Papers.  The Government gets some cover from that.  It is a lovely name for them.  It is all confusion.  However, ordinary people are no longer confused.  They know the Government and the previous one had no will to tackle the bankers, tax avoiders and defaulters.  I know there is a difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion but I am talking about big business and the fact that there is no law for them while the rest of us are all subject to the rule of law.  That is not acceptable.  Even if the Taoiseach was not a member of the finance committee he was well aware of the carry-on of the banks as it was brought to his attention nine years ago.

It is important to examine the statistics produced by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation to see the extraordinary variance that arises among hospitals.  Deputy Martin mentioned a number in which the figures were very bad, including the hospitals in Limerick and Kilkenny.  These hospitals have new emergency departments and extra staff and resources.  In contrast, overcrowding at Beaumont Hospital is at its second lowest since the nurses started counting trolleys, and in Blanchardstown it is the third lowest.  In St. James's Hospital overcrowding is the lowest in five years and for St. Vincent's University Hospital it is the lowest in four years.  In Cavan General Hospital overcrowding is at its lowest in a long time.  If this demonstrates anything, it is that the problem is not simply about resources or staffing because there seems to be no connection whatsoever between staffing and resourcing levels and the level of overcrowding.  This is principally about clinical leadership, management and other matters.  That is what makes it so much harder to deal with.

The agenda included migration; Digital Europe; security and defence; and external relations.  The future of Europe was also discussed over breakfast on Friday, followed by a meeting of the European Council in Article 50 format - without the UK - to discuss progress in the Brexit negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of the meeting, I was invited, along with the Dutch Prime Minister, to join the leaders of the Nordic and Baltic countries - Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - who meet regularly ahead of European Councils.  Although Ireland is not part of a formal group in the EU, as a small northern European nation with an open trading economy, we have similar positions on many issues, particularly economic matters.  I was very pleased, therefore, to attend this meeting with like-minded partners and to have the opportunity to share our views, including on the future of Europe debate.<\/p>  <p>  The meeting of the European Council, which was attended by the leaders of all 28 EU member states, as well as President Tusk and President Juncker, opened with an exchange with the President of the European Parliament.  The shocking murder of the well-known journalist in Malta was raised by several leaders and Prime Minister Muscat thanked EU partners for their messages of condolence and noted that an investigation is under way.  On migration, the Commission confirmed there has been a decrease in the number of migrants travelling to Europe and, crucially, a welcome drop in the number of lives lost at sea.  I drew attention to the distressing human rights reports from M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res in regard to the reception facilities in Libya.  I also raised the question of support for Africa more generally, and said that Ireland will double its commitment to the EU Trust Fund for Africa over the next few years, taking it from &euro;3 million to &euro;6 million.  This is, of course, just one small element of our overall development aid contribution to Africa.  The House may be aware that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is currently visiting Africa.<\/p>  <p>  Digital Europe was one of the most important items from an Irish perspective, and I am pleased that the language we agreed for the conclusions reflects our ambitious approach and the input we provided, along with a number of like-minded countries.  On the question of the taxation of digital companies, I emphasised that this must be considered at a global level, given the nature of the digital economy.  The OECD is the best forum for this and I insisted on including a reference to the OECD work in the conclusions.  The Commission has also been invited to present proposals early next year but these will require further discussion and, as a taxation issue, any decisions will be subject to unanimity.<\/p>  <p>  On security and defence, it was confirmed that discussions around permanent structured co-operation, or PESCO, as it is known, are ongoing, with some aspects still to be settled.  The ambition is to be ready to launch it in December.  Ireland will, of course, not do anything that compromises our long-standing policy of military neutrality or that undermines the constitutional guarantees which are reflected in the protocols to the Lisbon treaty.  EU leaders agreed to return to security and defence issues at our meeting in December.<\/p>  <p>  External relations were also discussed on Thursday evening, including in regard to Turkey and Iran.  Prime Minister May also spoke about developments in the UK in regard to Brexit.  The situation in Catalonia was not discussed.<\/p>  <p>  On Friday morning, President Tusk chaired a useful exchange on the future of Europe, based on his Leader&rsquo;s Agenda.  There was support for his proposed approach, which envisages further additional meetings at the level of Heads of State or Government.  This issue is very important for Ireland as we want to ensure the Union continues to work for our citizens.  In this context, under the leadership of the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, we will shortly launch a citizens&rsquo; engagement programme to allow for broad debate on the future of Europe.<\/p>  <p>  We then met in Article 50 format to discuss the Brexit negotiations.  Michel Barnier confirmed that, in his view, there has not been sufficient progress to enable us to move to phase two of negotiations on future relationship issues.  However, in light of the progress that has been achieved, we agreed to start considering within the EU 27 what might go into additional guidelines regarding the framework for the future relationship and possible transitional arrangements, ahead of moving to a discussion of phase two as soon as the time is appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s overall priorities are clear: to protect the peace process; to avoid any new barriers to trade or the movement of people on our island; the maintenance of the common travel area and all the associated rights that come with it; an effective transitional arrangement leading to the closest possible relationship between the UK and the EU; and to work for the future of the European Union, with Ireland at its heart.  As I noted, Prime Minister May made some constructive comments over dinner on Thursday, including a rejection of any physical infrastructure on the Border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  However, further clarity is needed and I would urge the UK to provide more detail on how its stated commitments on EU citizens&rsquo; rights, the UK financial settlement and Ireland-specific issues will be given meaningful effect so that sufficient progress can be made and, ultimately, an agreement can be reached.<\/p>  <p>  The agenda for the next formal meeting of the European Council is not yet available.

It is extraordinary.  Simply saying that we accept the constitutional set-up of the Spanish state is not good enough in the face of that.  On that basis, the people of Catalonia simply do not have a right to self-determination because the rest of Spain is not going to vote for the right of the people of Catalonia to self-determine - that is just not going to happen.

While we respect the constitutional position of Spain, given that it is a matter for Spain to determine its own constitutional structure, as it would be for ourselves, the physical suppression of an act of democracy was unacceptable.  It worsens a situation considerably when people are imprisoned or prosecuted for political reasons.  The ambassador explained that the judiciary acts independently, but we should express a view on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  My question directly relates to the Taoiseach's conversation with President Tusk and the leaders' agenda.  The Taoiseach mentioned the permanent structured co-operation on defence, PESCO.  According to the leaders' agenda, the Council will launch PESCO on 14 and 15 December, which is not far away.  President Macron of France has proposed an EU army and a shared defence budget.

I do not know whether one can break them up.<\/p><p>My question is similar to the Minister's - I mean, Deputy Howlin's - on defence co-operation.  I am interested in the possible development of us joining a Nordic-Baltic group on the fringes of the Council.  Did the approach to defence co-operation arise in that group?  I ask this question specifically because, as Deputy Howlin stated, the Council meeting was held just after the meeting with the French President.  While the Taoiseach's comments after that meeting did not refer to defence as being one of the issues for discussion, the French President - I only have the French version with me - stated: &quot;<i>sur les politiques de d&eacute;fense, il y aura des discussions en politique interne en Irlande, mais la France continue &agrave; promouvoir <\/i>[my French is not very good] <i>cet agenda de convergence et de coop&eacute;ration renforc&eacute;e<\/i>&quot;.  My French is only leaving certificate French like the Taoiseach's, but if mine is up to it, the French President was pushing the issue of defence co-operation and internal Irish political discussions around that were centre stage.  How will the question of defence co-operation play out in that regard?  Are we working with other countries on a common response?  When I asked Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, a similar question two weeks ago, he was in favour of further defence co-operation.

Such an attack on a journalist strikes at the heart of democracy in our society.  This particular murder is chilling.  Ms Galizia's family members have been clear, in that they believe European assistance is required if those behind the murder are to be found.

We know that immigration and the portability of social welfare rights are considerable issues in the politics of many Nordic countries.

I emphasised our full support for the territorial integrity of Spain and respect for its constitution.  I acknowledged, as Deputy Martin has, that it does not appear that there is a clear majority in Catalonia in favour of leaving Spain, and certainly not leaving the European Union.  Catalonia would leave the European Union if it left Spain.<\/p>  <p>  I expressed our concerns and those of the Irish people about the police violence which occurred in Catalonia and which we saw on our television screens.  During the discussion, I spoke about our history and how the use of police violence and attempts to suppress free speech and free association can radicalise people who are not radical and turn people who are not nationalists into nationalists.  I was pleased that the point I made was understood by the Spanish officials, namely that perhaps some of the actions taken by the national government in Catalonia could have been counter-productive for Spanish unity.<\/p>  <p>  There are two sides to the story.  I encourage anyone who has not yet done so to speak to his or her counterpart in Spain or to the Spanish ambassador.

I urge people to be cautious and, at the very least, listen to both sides of the story before coming to a conclusion.<\/p>  <p>  I also suggested dialogue was crucial to resolving the political differences which exist and that it has to be for Spain and its citizens to determine their preferred constitutional and political arrangements through their democratic institutions.

The programme is co-funded by the EU&rsquo;s European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD, to a\u00a0sum of &euro;2.19 billion over the programme lifespan.  This EU funding is supplemented by Exchequer funding, bringing the total allocation to &euro;4 billion, a substantial vote of confidence in Irish farming.  The programme covers a suite of measures, both ambitious and broad, and supports all farming sectors.  These measures reflect the issues, challenges and opportunities which Irish agriculture faces, and were put in place after lengthy consultation and analysis.  The programme aims to enhance competitiveness, to encourage more sustainable farming practices and to deliver real and quantifiable results for rural communities and the rural economy generally.\u00a0 Achieving these results is very much dependant on farmers engaging with and participating in the various schemes and initiatives on offer and I am pleased to say that, as with previous rural development programmes in Ireland, farmers are enthusiastically signing up to schemes under this rural development programme.  In fact, Ireland leads other member states in terms of our implementation of the rural development programme and currently has the second highest rate of drawn-down of EU funds among all member states.  The average EU financial rate for draw-down\u00a0of funds up to the end of August 2017 was 22.68%, whereas Ireland&rsquo;s execution rate was 39.01%.  This progress is testament to the successful roll-out, uptake and implementation of schemes under the programme to date.<\/p>  <p>  I fully anticipate that based on current up-take and projections, the entire budget allocation of some &euro;4 billion for the rural development programme will be spent and that the entire &euro;2.19 billion of EU co-funding will be drawn down. \u00a0It is expected that the majority of funds will be spent by the end of 2020, although there will be some carry-over.  Under EU regulations governing the rural development programme, funds for multi-annual commitments entered into by the end of 2020 may be claimed up to the end of 2023.  Rural development programme spending is also subject\u00a0to the annual Estimates process and budgetary rules, but this\u00a0should not affect the overall spend and any European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development,\u00a0EAFRD, funds unspent in a year are carried forward to subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of rural development programme participation levels, I am pleased to say that there\u00a0has been excellent uptake to date. \u00a0At this stage of the programme, some multi-annual schemes such as the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, beef data and genomics programme, BDGP,\u00a0and the organic farming schemes are now closed and\u00a0are fully subscribed.  Other\u00a0schemes such as areas of natural constraint, ANC, are applied\u00a0for on an annual basis,\u00a0and others such as the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, will continue to recruit participants in tranches.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Reaching the targets set out within the rural development programme is central\u00a0to meeting the objectives of the programme and to producing the desired results and outcomes.\u00a0 It is therefore important that\u00a0progression toward these targets is kept under review.  To this end, and in line with\u00a0EU regulatory requirements, my\u00a0Department carries out an annual review of implementation by reporting on indicators collected on all schemes and measures.  This annual implementation\u00a0report,\u00a0and a citizens summary on the results of this assessment is, once approved by the Commission, published on the Department&rsquo;s website.  We will continue to review the implementation of the programme to ensure that we\u00a0are on target to meet all identified objectives and that all EU funding is fully drawn down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800027#Z02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1510149600,"counter":329,"content":"<p>The Minister continues with the fallacy that all is hunky-dory with the rural development programme when it is clear that he and the Government are failing to live up to the promises they made about spending on the programme and the participation rates across the various schemes.  At present, only 30% of the funds have been used, which means that &euro;2.7 billion of the funds promised to farmers have still to be spent by the end of 2020.  Participation rates across all the schemes are running behind target.  For example, participation in the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, is 27% behind the original target of 35,000 participants.  The participation rate in the knowledge transfer group schemes is running at nearly 50% behind the target, with 19,000 farmers signed up when the initial objective was 27,000 farmers.<\/p>  <p>  The green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, in particular, is running behind the promised commitment the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, made on behalf of Fine Gael and the Government in respect of the rural development programme and the &euro;1.4 billion over the course of the scheme.  On the basis of calculations and responses to parliamentary questions which I have received, it is clear that the maximum spend now will be no more than &euro;214 million per year.  The former Minister, Deputy Coveney, promised it would be &euro;250 million per year when the scheme was at its maximum.  When one calculates all of that, it means that spending under GLAS can be no more than &euro;1.18 billion by 2021.  That is allowing for it to run into the next rural development programme and for everybody in GLAS to be fully paid.  It is over &euro;200 million less.  It is time for the Minister to come clean.

Data from Pasturebase Ireland indicate that production is running about 1 tonne dry matter per hectare ahead of last year.  Notwithstanding this, grazing conditions deteriorated from mid-August on farms\u00a0with heavier land.  This has given farmers a number of challenging weeks managing livestock, with animals having to be temporarily housed and difficulties with securing later cut silage.  I note that there appear to be reasonable supplies of feed and fodder available across the country for those farmers who may have to supplement their own fodder supply.  Given these challenges, I have asked Teagasc to work locally in areas with fodder difficulties so as to\u00a0support good budgeting of fodder supplies on farms for the winter ahead.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission agreed to my request for an advance payment of the 2017 basic payment scheme, BPS.

It is worth noting in the context of the last CAP when the then Minister, Deputy Coveney was in office, Ireland campaigned for a significantly lower reduction than the one which was ultimately achieved, but the level of political resistance to it across members states is very substantial.

In deference to my Sinn F&eacute;in colleague, I stress that we do not want to see the expansion of the industrial sitka spruce type of afforestation but rather the development of native broadleaf species, particularly in uplands.  I suspect that these are precisely the areas where these very controversial industrial wind farms will be developed.  Major questions lie over these farms in terms of the contribution they will make to net carbon reduction in real terms.  On the other hand, we know that native broadleaf forests contribute in a measurable way to net carbon reduction through acting as carbon sinks.  We also know that they enhance biodiversity and, critically, help mitigate flooding downstream.  In Wales, big projects are going on lands which would not be considered suitable for industrial or commercial forestry.  Native broadleaf species are being grown on the uplands for their biodiversity benefits, for their carbon sink benefits, but also because they mitigate flooding.

This is his core area of responsibility.  It is not at all as if Coillte is abandoning its core objective on these lands, which may have potential for wind harvest.  The nature of much of Coillte's estate is that they are elevated lands which, apart from being suitable for growing trees, also have the potential for quite a substantial wind harvest in terms of energy generation.  During the meeting I had with it, the company really wanted to convey that it is very anxious to get back to the core business of growing trees and putting more trees in the ground.  To do that, it must be able to generate the funds from its assets and to sweat them, including land which has potential for wind generation.  Appropriately managed, such measures will secure funding which will enable it to drive the core business forward.

We have, in recent years, been struggling to meet that level of ambition.

It must be borne in mind that Coillte is not entitled to benefit from that grant aid.

The new statutory instrument will, to the extent that it is possible, take on board the issues of concern regarding procedures and processes highlighted in the High Court judgments on this matter.  It will also amend SI 125 of 2016 to address certain minor technical and drafting issues arising.<\/p><p>In June 2016, I advised the Oireachtas that, subject to addressing some important legal and administrative issues, I was hopeful about moving towards a system of sequential application of EU points in conjunction with the prosecution process, having consulted the Attorney General's office.  I made it clear that this move was subject to addressing some important legal and administrative issues to ensure compliance with EU law.<\/p><p>There has been extensive examination and consideration of all the issues in regard to meeting our EU obligations to implement the points system in the interim.  The firm legal view available to me is that it is not possible to deliver on an effective and dissuasive points system, as required under EU law, by assigning points to licenceholders upon successful prosecution.<\/p><p>Accordingly, as is the case with SI 125 of 2016, it is intended that the new statutory instrument will provide that points assigned to a holder of an Irish licence will remain assigned regardless of any criminal proceedings pending, or the outcome of any such proceedings, in respect of the serious infringement concerned.  Under the new statutory instrument, the licenceholder may appeal on a point of law a decision of the independent fisheries adjudicator to the High Court.  In the 2014 statutory instrument, this appeal was &quot;final and conclusive&quot;.  This aspect of the provision has been removed.<\/p><p><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/font><\/i><\/p><p>It should be noted in this context that pilot infringement proceedings by the European Commission for non-implementation of the EU points system have been taken against Ireland.  It remains an option for the Commission to proceed to formal infringement proceedings in respect of the licenceholder system.<\/p><p>There are also serious implications with regard to the release of funding under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF.  Implementation of the EU points system was an <i>ex ante<\/i>condition for the approval of Ireland's EMFF programme, given that the programme is intended to facilitate the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy in Ireland.  The European Commission has signalled in writing that the delivery of funding under Ireland's EMFF operational programme is firmly linked to the implementation of the points system.  This programme is investing &euro;241 million of EU or Exchequer funding in total in the fisheries sector over the lifetime of the programme, which is crucial at a time of Brexit uncertainty.  The immediate concern is with regard to the control and data collection funds.  The European Commission wrote in July 2017 advising that due to the non-implementation of the points system, EMFF funding allocated for control spend will be suspended.<\/p><p>Having an effective, proportionate and dissuasive system of points for all fishing vessels, Irish and non-Irish, operating in our 200 mile zone is beneficial to maintaining the sustainability of fish stocks on which our seafood sector is dependent.  This system will ensure that the vast majority of our law abiding fishermen are able to compete effectively and look forward to a sustainable future in the industry. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800031#DD00900","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1510151400,"counter":383,"content":"<p>The word \"shortly\" is not satisfactory.

I recognise fully the potential difficulties farmers and citizens, including those in the Border counties, are likely to face in the event of a hard Brexit, given the highly integrated nature of agri-trade and commercial, social and cultural interaction on the island of Ireland.  However, from the beginning of the Article 50 negotiations Government policy has been to maintain a trading relationship with the United Kingdom as close as possible to the current configuration and, in the case of the island of Ireland, to avoid any kind of border.  The position of the Government on this matter could not be clearer.  As a response to Ireland's concerns, the special position of Ireland is explicitly recognised in the Article 50 negotiating guidelines which indicate that flexible and imaginative solutions will be required to avoid a hard border.  That is also the position articulated in Prime Minister May's letter triggering Article 50 on 29 March 2017 and it is equally reflected in the position adopted by the European Parliament.  The need to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the common travel area is a critical part of this dynamic.  All of the institutions of the European Union and the UK Government are <i>ad idem <\/i>on these principles and I believe there is also a broad political consensus in this House to do so.  Clearly, the best protection for farmers in Border counties lies in the avoidance of a hard border.<\/p><p>In the meantime, my Department and I have been actively engaged in assessing the potential impacts of Brexit on the Irish agrifood sector, consulting stakeholders and engaging with political counterparts across Europe to sensitise them to the particular issues on the island of Ireland.  This work is being done in conjunction with the overall Government response led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  An issue of particular concern to my Department, for example, is the need for any post-Brexit trade arrangement to deal comprehensively with sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, standards and controls in order to avoid the need for border controls for animals, plants, and products of animal or plant origin.  However, the most immediate challenge for farmers is the impact caused by the significant drop in the value of sterling against the euro.  My Department and I, in co-operation with the Government and other Departments and agencies, are attempting to mitigate the consequences through a range of actions under two distinct pillars - competitiveness and diversification.  My Department introduced a number of measures in budget 2017 to help to reduce costs and improve competitiveness at farm level, including the introduction of a &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme, agri-taxation measures and increased funding under the rural development and seafood development programmes.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>In budget 2018 I provided for a &euro;50 million Brexit package to provide priming for a new low-cost loan scheme for farmers and food businesses, to provide additional funding for Bord Bia's marketing and promotional efforts and to fund the kind of investment in competitiveness, innovation and product development that will be critically important for the development of the Irish food sector post-Brexit.  I also provided &euro;25 million in additional funding for the areas of natural constraint scheme and &euro;626 million for rural development measures, including a 40% increase in funding for TAMS, all of which will be of assistance to farmers in the Border area.  The Government remains very focused on supporting farmers and the agrifood industry through the challenges ahead.  I will continue to consult the industry as the negotiations develop and press Ireland's case for continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs or burdensome customs and administrative procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800032#EE00100","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1510152000,"counter":394,"content":"<p>On his recent visit to Cavan the Minister had the privilege of taking a guided tour around McCarren's where, as he is well aware, there has been significant investment.  He is also aware that a third dryer was opened recently in Lakeland Dairies.  The mushroom industry in the constituency has been badly affected since the announcement of Brexit, following which the Border counties will be at the coalface.  They will be affected most by the possible imposition of tariffs.  The possible removal of tariffs in low-cost regions such as South America will result in their being opened up to trade with the United Kingdom, which will make it extremely difficult for Irish farmers and producers to compete.  In counties such as Cavan and Monaghan the imposition of controls along the Border would make it much harder, slower and more costly to move produce and products from the North to the South.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referred to Bord Bia.

There are many agribusinesses along the Border such as the aforementioned McCarren's, Lakeland Dairies, LacPatrick and Strathroy in the North.  We have, effectively, an all-island agrifood economy.  Some 50% of our beef exports and 30% of our dairy exports are to the United Kingdom.  A significant challenge is presented in that regard, particularly in the production of cheddar cheese, for which there are no ready-made alternative global markets.  Our objective is to try to ensure we get as close to the current trading arrangements as possible.  One of the issues that is often overlooked in the public debate in which there is a concentration of effort on Border tariffs is the one I raised in my initial reply, namely, that of SPS, sanitary and phytosanitary standards.  If, for example, we have a situation where there is agreement on tariffs and it is a benign arrangement which will not change significantly, we could still be snookered on the basis of a variation in standards with the UK production system which would oblige us to police all movements of goods over and back across the Border.  The application of equal standards here and in the United Kingdom post-Brexit is really important because it would also protect us, for example, from cheaper imports into the UK market which would undermine our market position there.

Imports from Northern Ireland were worth more than &euro;500 million.  Milk and milk products are so important for my constituency.  More than 800 million litres of milk are imported from the North annually, much of which is processed and exported from the South.

Perhaps our memories are short, but we do not want to find ourselves slipping back into a situation where the Border will become something far more than a line on a map and that will have a psychological and political effect that could lead us back to a darker period in our history which none of us want to revisit.  The economic argument is significant, but in many respects a hard border and the things that could flow from it are really important also.

Between 1990 and 2015 greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector reduced by 5.5%.  It is important that the facts are correct.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 80% of all stored cattle manure in Ireland is produced as slurry, the remaining portion being a solid fraction or farmyard manure.  For the majority of the country, the approximate storage period is 16 to 18 weeks.  Virtually all pig manure is produced as slurry, while all poultry manure is of a solid or semi-solid composition.  The quantities of livestock manures from farm holdings currently processed by way of treatment facilities such as anaerobic digestion, AD, is insignificant.  This is\u00a0influenced by the predominance of grazing systems and it\u00a0not being\u00a0cost effective to mobilise for the scale of commercial AD plants.<\/p>  <p>  Methane accounts for approximately 22% of Ireland's greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions, of which approximately 12% of methane emissions in agriculture result from the storage and management of animal manures.<\/p><p>Current research into reducing methane emissions is primarily focused on reducing emissions per unit product, that is to say, reducing emissions intensity.  This research is primarily focused on improving productivity per animal and thus decoupling animal numbers from production.  Most of this research is focused on developing economic breeding indices, extension of the grazing season, reducing beef finishing times and reducing total methane per animal as well as optimising beef and dairy animals.  Many of these measures are currently in use or being commenced.<br\/><br\/>Currently the Environmental Protection Agency is funding a desk study to review our country-specific emissions factors and other parameters relevant to the estimation of methane emissions from livestock enteric fermentation and manure management.  The purpose is to determine what changes are required to ensure improvements in farm efficiency that will mitigate methane captured in the livestock and manure methane sections of the inventory.<br\/><br\/>Carbon audits by our food agency, Bord Bia, are placing new emphasis on reduction in emissions intensity of beef and dairy produce.  According to the Ireland's national inventory report published by the EPA in April 2017, methane is the second-most significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland.  In 2015, emissions of methane decreased 10.4% on the 1990 level having increased progressively from 1990 to a peak in 1998.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>The national inventory report also stated that nitrous oxide emissions decreased by 16% from the 1990 level to 2015.

Emissions of nitrous oxide subsequently show a clear downward trend following reductions in synthetic fertiliser use and organic nitrogen applications on land as a result of the effect of the CAP reform on animal numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800032#EE01200","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510152600,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Our information contradicts the Minister's information.

In terms of the carbon footprint per kilo of output our dairy industry is the most efficient in the world and our beef is the fifth most efficient.  Whether we are fifth, sixth or first, we all acknowledge that in the dairy and beef sectors we must do far more.  The industry is up for it.  However, we are seeking a fair crack of the whip in terms of the public debate.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider the efforts farmers are making.  Deputy Wallace comes from a farming constituency.  Farmers there are leading the way in terms of their embrace of new technologies and ideas, especially carbon footprint measuring on farms.  We are extraordinarily efficient in this regard.  The post-dairy quota era has proven that we have broken the link between increased output and increasing greenhouse gas production.  Since 2015 we have increased our dairy production by 13.2% but our greenhouse gas emissions have only gone up by 1.6%.  This is significant in that we are breaking the link between increased production and increased greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p>  <p>  We need to continue that direction of travel.

It is responsible for the overall administration, promotion and development of the horse racing industry.  The racing regulatory body - the Irish Turf Club - is a private body charged under legislation with responsibility for the integrity and the reputation of Irish racing in Ireland and internationally.<\/p>  <p>  Horse Racing Ireland has informed me that there are proper anti-doping protocols in place and all Irish horses are tested to the required international standards.  HRI confirmed that all thoroughbred horses, once returned in training, are subject to random, unannounced testing by the Turf club at any time.  Winners of every race run in Ireland are tested.  All samples are tested to the standards required by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities, IFHA.  Samples are tested both at the authorised Irish laboratory and accredited international laboratories.<\/p>  <p>  HRI's medium-term aspiration is to develop an Irish laboratory to the highest international standard possible, that is, an IFHA reference laboratory, of which there are currently only four or five in the world.  This will require significant investment and HRI has committed to this expenditure in its strategic plan for the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  The board of HRI, in conjunction with the Turf Club, established a 16-member industry-wide anti-doping task force, which includes representatives of all sections of the racing and breeding industries, including HRI, the Turf Club, the Association of Irish Racehorse Owners, the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association, the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association, Weatherbys Ireland and the Irish sales companies.  In February 2016, HRI published a report by the Irish thoroughbred industry anti-doping task force, setting out recommendations to ensure the drug testing regime for Ireland's racing and breeding sectors operates to the highest international standards.  The organisations represented on the task force are committed to ensuring the drug testing regime in the Irish racing and breeding sectors is one that can meet current and future challenges.  The organisations the task force represents strongly support a robust anti-doping strategy in Irish racing and breeding.<\/p>  <p>  The task force is being reconvened to finalise the steps being taken to extend testing to the breeding industry, an area which does not fall under the Turf Club's current direct jurisdiction.  Considerable progress has been made on the key principles of a testing regime which will now be applied to the pre-racing segments of the industry, including the breeding sector and the sales.  Elective testing already takes place at blood stock sales in Ireland and no positive tests for anabolic steroids or substances prohibited at all times have been recorded.  More than 1,500 samples are taken each year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800034#GG01300","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1510153200,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I remind the Minister that Ireland's so-called global leadership in equine matters will be severely challenged unless we address the use of drugs and employment rights - or lack thereof - in the horse racing industry.<\/p><p>Contrary to the Minister's assertion, many of the policies are heavy on spin and fairly slight on substance.  Unlike human sporting activities where athletes can be selected for testing at any time or any place, drug testing protocols in horse racing are not random in many instances.  If the horse is not at a licensed race course or the trainer's yard, in other words, back on the owner's premises, the regulatory authority here, the Turf Club, must give the owner five working days' notice, not including Saturday or Sunday, of its intention to test the horse.  In other words, a race horse that could be full to the brim of performance enhancing drugs would have the whole week to be detoxed before an examination.

This is most regrettable as the horticulture sector is experiencing strong market demand after a number of challenging years.  I am confident that as our economy continues to grow the nursery sector will likewise prosper.<\/p><p>In 2016, Ireland's horticulture sector contributed over &euro;430 million to the value of output at farm-gate level.  The horticulture sector is estimated to be directly responsible for over 6,600 jobs with many more employed indirectly, both upstream and downstream.  Within the total horticulture farm-gate output value of &euro;430 million, the hardy nursery stock sector and the protected amenity plant sector combined to contribute almost &euro;51 million in 2016 to the value of output at farm-gate level.  This value was up from an estimated &euro;44 million in 2015.<\/p><p>While market prospects for amenity plant growers are certainly very positive I am conscious of the challenges, not least from the recent storms, currently facing the industry and my Department, along with the various State agencies, Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland, are working closely to support the industry through a number of measures.<\/p><p>The scheme of investment aid for the development of the commercial horticulture sector is the main support offered by my Department to the amenity or nursery sector.  This scheme facilitates capital investments in a broad range of specialised horticultural equipment and buildings by providing grant aid on approved costs at a rate of 40%.  In the case of young applicants under 35 years of age the rate of grant aid increases to 50%.<\/p><p>This scheme is highly regarded by the industry and is an excellent vehicle for investment in all sectors of the horticulture industry.  I sought an increase in the budget allocation for the scheme in 2017 and this increase has been maintained through the allocation of &euro;5 million for the scheme in 2018.  In light of the sectoral demand, I am working to advance the launch of the 2018 commercial horticulture scheme.  A timely launch of the 2018 scheme is recognition of the most recent challenge to the sector but is also a clear signal of my continued support for, and commitment to, its ongoing development.<\/p><p>Under the scheme, &euro;6.4 million in grant aid has been paid to applicants from the nursery stock and related amenity plant sectors over the period 2008-2016.  This has supported investment of almost &euro;16 million by the sector.  In the current year a further &euro;1.1 million in grant aid has been allocated under the scheme to 29 applicants from the nursery stock and related amenity plant sectors.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>This year, approvals under the scheme were issued to an overall total of 156 applicants across the horticulture industry.  Many of the 2017 scheme applicants have already been inspected and paid.  The processing of more recent claims is ongoing and every effort is being made to deliver payments as quickly as possible to assist growers that may be facing cash flow issues.  For 2017 the commercial horticulture grants scheme was allocated a budget of &euro;5 million and my staff advise me that they expect the full budget available for the scheme this year will be utilised.<\/p><p>Maintaining the increased allocation of &euro;5 million in funding for the 2018 scheme of investment aid for commercial horticulture reflects this Government's commitment to ongoing support for Ireland's horticulture sector.  The competitive nature of the commercial horticulture grants scheme combined with the scheme's flexibility and ability to react to evolving situations are two key strengths in supporting this highly dynamic sector.<\/p><p>Growers, including amenity plant nurseries that wish to apply for the scheme are encouraged to prepare and submit their applications as soon as possible.<\/p><p>In terms of other supports for the sector I would also like to add that the &quot;SBCI loan scheme&quot; launched in last year's budget was a great success and a number of horticultural businesses have benefitted from these low interest loans.  As part of the recent budget, &euro;25 million has been secured to facilitate the development of a new Brexit response loan scheme for farmers, fisherman and food businesses in 2018 and further details about that scheme will be announced in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800035#HH01100","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1510153800,"counter":454,"content":"<p>With respect, the Minister outlined the importance of the sector and no one will question that.

This has not been addressed by increasing the Garda presence in the area.  Instead, we have seen an absolute savaging of Garda resources, with garda&iacute; on the beat simply unable to deal with the crime with which they are expected to deal.  Somebody has to listen.  The Ashbourne Garda district may be a relatively new district with much of its population having moved there over the last ten to 20 years but it deserves the same policing response and resources as every other part of the country.  It simply does not have that and as a result, the levels of burglary and anti-social behaviour are running amok.  It is fair to say that the public does not have confidence in Garda response times or in the Garda presence in the area and as a resident of the Ashbourne Garda district, I share a lot of their concerns.  I have no difficulty in expressing confidence in the ability of garda&iacute; to investigate crimes and indeed, they seem to have had some success in recent days.  However, I have a severe lack of confidence, as do my constituents, in terms of the Garda presence on the ground throughout the district, but specifically in Stamullen and Gormanston.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, 321 burglaries were recorded in the Ashbourne Garda district while in the entire county of Westmeath only 241 were recorded.  The number of garda&iacute; in the Ashbourne Garda district is around 100.  The number in the entire county of Meath is 321 but there are 241 garda&iacute; in Westmeath.  There is a higher crime rate, in terms of burglaries, in the Asbourne Garda district compared to the whole of County Westmeath but the district has around one third of the garda&iacute; deployed in that county.  That is outrageous, unsustainable and it cannot go on.  It is completely wrong.  I hope that the Minister for Justice and Equality, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the forum on the future of policing are all listening because this is wrong.  It is wrong that there is not equality for my constituents who are citizens of this republic.  They do not have the same Garda service that many other counties can take for granted.  It is simply wrong, unsustainable and is not conducive to the public good or the betterment of civic society.  This must change.  The people have been complaining about it for long enough.  The people of Stamullen, Gormanston, Duleek, east Meath, the fringes of Drogheda, Dunboyne, Dunshaughlin, Ratoath, Ashbourne and everywhere in between are sick of what is going on.  Garda&iacute; simply cannot do the job they are being asked to do because there are not enough of them.  <\/p>  <p>  We have another specific problem in that Garda stations in Drogheda, Balbriggan, Maynooth, Kilcock and Kingscourt which are adjacent to this particular Garda district cannot serve it.  That is something that must change because we are completely isolated and do not have enough resources.<\/p><p>It cannot go on and garda&iacute; should not allow this situation to continue.  The public simply will not put up with it.  I am not encouraging any form of protests in this regard but constituents have suggested that people would protest at Garda stations - that is how bad it has become.

Local Garda management has established an incident room in Laytown and all these incidents are being fully investigated.  In addition, extra patrols under Operation Thor are being provided in the Stamullen and Gormanston areas to assist local garda&iacute;.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda divisions, and the Minister has no direct role in day-to-day matters.  The Minister wants to assure the Deputy and the House that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 reserve members and 4,000 civilians.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Meath division, on 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 293.  There are also 16 Garda reserves and 29 civilians attached to the division.  He is further informed by the Commissioner that, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 46 of whom have been assigned to the Meath division.  In addition, another 200 trainee garda&iacute; are scheduled to attest later this year, which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to 13,500 by the end of the year, an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment, which was introduced in 2010, resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources to deploy increasing numbers of garda&iacute; across every Garda division, including the Meath division, in the coming years.  The Deputy asked that these significant issues, about which he is rightly concerned, would be brought to the attention of the Minister and I assure him that will be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800037#KK00200","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1510155000,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I do not accept this answer.  I do not accept it is correct to go back to 2010 to place the blame for all the problems.  I am raising a problem, not just in regard to Garda numbers at a national level, which, thankfully, are increasing under the confidence and supply agreement, but in regard to the disparity in Garda resources between different parts of the country.  This is outrageous and is not accepted by the citizenry of this country, certainly not by my constituents.  There are a lot more burglaries in my area and a lot fewer garda&iacute; than in a neighbouring county, when there does not seem to be any objective justification for this.  Westmeath is not a Border county and there are no special Garda units at national level that are based there, or none I am aware of.  This is wrong.  Criminals are aware of this.  There is no point covering it up - they know this.  They know we have an excellent motorway network.  There are four motorways throughout this Garda district - the M1 at Stamullen and Gormanston, the M2, the M3 and the M4, which goes through parts of the constituency or is adjacent to it.  These are providing easy access in and out in regard to burglaries and, indeed, anti-social behaviour, as we have seen in recent weeks.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Minister of State on the need to encourage everybody to give any information they have to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I wish An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na all the very best with its investigations.  However, it is my contention that it simply does not have enough men and women on the ground to do the job the State expects it to do.  This will have to be taken seriously.  It is a threat to good order and governance in this country that there is this sort of disparity.  I know senior garda&iacute; at a local level are shouting about this internally but it is not being listened to.  It is about time someone listened and said that while this is a new area, and while these are not towns which traditionally had a huge population, they do now and they need to be recognised as such.<\/p>  <p>  The crime levels which are publicly available from the Central Statistics Office make the case that I am making.  The Minister of State said the number of garda&iacute; in the Meath division is 293.  My figure from a few weeks ago is 295 so have we lost two garda&iacute;, even in the last few weeks.

While there are historic reasons for that, the last Government and this one did a lot in this regard, which needs to be acknowledged, aside from the supply and confidence agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister wishes to inform the Deputy and the House that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, and that the needs of all divisions, including Meath, are taken into consideration in the allocation of Garda resources.  In budget 2018 the Government will support the continuation of the high level of investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recent years and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I am sure all Members will welcome that the civilianisation effort is also increasing within the force.  Some &euro;300 million, including &euro;205 million under the capital plan, is being invested in ICT infrastructure over the period 2016-2021.  This will allow garda&iacute; to deploy the latest cutting-edge technologies in the fight against crime and will facilitate progress on important reforms arising from the Garda inspectorate's report on crime investigation.  The capital plan 2016-2021 provides for an investment of &euro;46 million in the Garda fleet in order to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet.  This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013-2015, which was covered by the last Government.  In the period from 2013 to end of 2017, almost &euro;44 million will have been invested in the fleet, with 2,000 vehicles coming on stream in that period.  I believe every Member of the House will acknowledge that was a huge issue in every Garda district across the country.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and the Minister expects that the Meath division, like other Garda divisions, will benefit from the new resources becoming available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800037#KK00400","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Infectious Diseases","time":1510155000,"counter":488,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800037#KK00450"},{"type":"speech","time":1510155000,"counter":489,"content":"<p>This issue concerns the outbreak of measles in north County Dublin in the last few weeks.  It has happened a few times in recent years and is an issue I feel strongly about as a pharmacist.  From a public health policy point of view, vaccination would be considered, after water sanitation, as the single greatest success story in terms of health worldwide in modern times.  The concern here is that very few people are actively working now who have seen measles and witnessed families lose children at a young age.  Once a disease disappears, the burden of that disease can quickly be forgotten.  I am sure there are people around these Houses who remember children being born and dying very quickly but, while death is obviously very serious, measles can also cause brain damage, blindness, deafness and many complications due to secondary infections.<\/p>  <p>  Today, for the benefit of the Minister for Health, I want to identify areas where we have been complacent, given this has led to an increased number of cases.<\/p><p>Continued high vaccination rates are vital if we are to ensure a sustained protection of the population from diseases.  Facts and science save lives while miscommunication and untruths destroy them, given how they have been shown to affect vaccination rates.  This country has faced challenges with the HPV vaccine, so it would be regrettable if we were to let our vaccination rate drop below approximately 95%, which is considered the point at which the population is afforded herd immunity.<\/p> <p> A small issue arises regarding vulnerable communities, for example, those with limited education levels or language barriers and migrants from countries where health policies and vaccination protocols are different.  Speaking professionally, I know that some communities have cultural fears of engaging with our State institutions, medical people and people in positions of authority because their status within this country might not be ideal.  The Minister of State should address these groups in particular, given that they may not have access to the same information, knowledge or history that some of us in this country have, for the betterment of their health as well as the health of the wider population.<\/p> <p> Recently, doses were offered to pupils in an attempt to increase the vaccination rate, but there must be a public health process whereby we highlight to people who have never encountered measles and only know it as a word what it is, how bad it can be, how to identify it, how contagious it is and how difficult it is to contain.  Someone can get measles just by being in a room that a person with measles has been in.  People do not even need to have direct contact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800037#KK00500","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510155600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to update the House on this matter.  Measles is an acute and serious viral infection and is highly infectious.  As Deputies are aware, there is an ongoing measles outbreak in north Dublin and Meath.  The HSE east's department of public health has been notified of eight confirmed cases of measles in the north Dublin area and five in County Meath, predominantly among children.  Other cases are under investigation.  The source of the measles outbreak has not yet been identified.  Confirmation of further cases associated with this outbreak can be expected in the coming weeks as contact tracing and other measures proceed.<\/p>  <p>  An outbreak control team has been convened to investigate and control the spread of this potentially serious illness.  The local HSE departments of public health, where the cases are identified, are investigating and implementing control and communication measures with local GPs, hospitals and others in the relevant communities.  NGO groups working in those communities have been alerted and asked to share information through their networks about this outbreak.<\/p>  <p>  An alert has been sent throughout the health system, including to emergency departments, consultants in microbiology and paediatrics, hospital managers, directors of public health nursing, and GPs.  Hospitals and health care facilities are requested to raise awareness among staff in order that the triage and isolation of suspect cases is achieved, thereby helping to prevent the further spread.  Suspect cases should be notified to HSE departments of public health and samples should be sent to the national virus reference laboratory to facilitate rapid diagnosis.  All people identified as contacts of the measles cases are being notified and advised of the risk by departments of public health.<\/p>  <p>  Immunisation is regarded as one of the safest and most effective health care interventions, and the importance of vaccination is acknowledged globally.  Diseases that used to be common around the world can now be prevented by vaccination.  Vaccination is effective in preventing measles.  In Ireland, measles immunisation was introduced in 1985.  In 1988, the MMR vaccine, which combines measles, mumps and rubella vaccines, replaced the single measles vaccine.  The MMR vaccine is available free of charge as part of the primary childhood immunisation schedule.  In 2016, vaccination rates for MMR at 24 months were 93% and have been above 90% since 2008.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, however, and due to the success of our programme, many vaccine-preventable diseases have become so infrequent that we have lost the collective memory of how serious and deadly some childhood illnesses can be.  The lack of awareness of measles and its infectiousness may have contributed to the spread in the current outbreak.  Although the uptake rate is high, this outbreak and a number of prominent measles cases last year demonstrate that we must not be complacent.  Since the only protection against measles is vaccination, I encourage parents and guardians of all children and teenagers who have not been immunised yet to protect their children by getting them vaccinated.  Young adults who have not been immunised should also get this important vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  I will address some of the other issues that the Deputy raised after her next contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800038#LL00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1510155600,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  In the wider European context and given the movement of people, there have been 44 deaths owing to measles in EU countries since 2016.

Of those who got measles in 2016, only 58% were unvaccinated.  Just because someone is vaccinated does not mean that he or she is safe, so this is everyone's problem.  Anyone who is immunocompromised, old, sick or otherwise vulnerable is especially at risk.  As I have stated at the Committee on Health, if there is a measles outbreak in this country, trolleys will be the least of our worries.  We will have sick people with HIV and autoimmune diseases dying from a disease that had effectively been wiped out in this country.

However, 43 cases were notified in 2016, the bulk of which were part of an outbreak associated with an imported case.

The public health awareness work of local GPs and district nurses has taken on board the alert issued by the Department and the HSE.  We will continue to monitor the situation.

I am doing so on behalf of the people I represent.  Over 100 families are employed by the company concerned.  I ask the Government to intervene with a bank which is owned by the taxpayer, AIB, to ensure the sale will not go ahead or that it will not go ahead without discussing the matter with the Morrisseys, the family who own the lots.  A lot is riding on the sale.  Some 100 jobs are in the balance, as well as what they contribute to the local economy.  The sale will also have an impact on the marketplace because there are three super players in the quarry industry in this country who control everything.  A previous quarry sale resulted in the closure of viable entities.  As a result, there were job losses and a lack of competition in the market.  If Morrisseys is not kept in the market, there will be job losses and a further deterioration in the level of competition in Ireland.  The company supplies most of the county councils in the south east.  It has a 100-year record and worked with AIB while in receivership, fulfilling almost &euro;3 million worth of contracts in the course of the receivership.  It has an excellent record with AIB, yet it is being forced into a public sale.  Instead of this, AIB could very easily get value for the sale which involves a sum in the region of &euro;4.6 million by selling properties directly to the Morrisseys who currently own the quarries.  There would be no loser if the sale was conducted in that way.  The bank would achieve value for money.  The money would be raised privately and not involve AIB money.  The 100 jobs and competitiveness in the marketplace would be maintained and it would ensure a company which has worked for 100 years in the local community was kept in business.<\/p>  <p>  If we can do anything through a bank which is owned by taxpayers, this is one step we could take to show the people of Ireland that we are interested in their plight and attempting to save jobs and indigenous businesses.  It is one action the Government could take to show that it is interested.  That action should be taken by the Minister for Finance today.  He should contact AIB and instruct it to hold off on any sale until it negotiates with the current occupiers of the quarries, the Morrisseys.  In terms of the impact on the local economy should the quarries be closed, separate from the level of competition in the market, 100 families will be affected.  The suppliers of goods and services to these quarries will also be affected.  If we have an interest in rural Ireland, this is the time to stand up. <\/p>  <p>  In its advertising, AIB states it is \"backing brave\".  Let it back the brave who spent 100 years building a company and worked with it during receivership, kept jobs and fulfilled contracts.  Let it back the brave who are still willing to work with AIB, using their money, and allow them to stay in business.  That is the challenge for the Government if it wants to save jobs and continue what is a very successful business, notwithstanding the effects of the downturn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800039#MM00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1510156200,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  As a local Deputy, I can understand the situation.  My constituency, Clare, faced a similar situation a few years ago when a major quarry and concrete company closed.  We know the devastation caused on a personal basis, as the Deputy outlined, for the many families concerned.<\/p><p>The company was established in the 1930s and was a major supplier to the construction industry during the boom.  It went into receivership in June 2014 owing debts to AIB.  The company had an interim examiner appointed shortly afterwards but was subsequently placed back into receivership.<\/p><p>I am aware that a number of the quarries owned by Dan Morrissey Ireland Limited are due to go to public auction shortly on the instructions of the joint receivers, as the Deputy outlined.  I understand Enterprise Ireland had limited engagement with the company.  In 2007 the agency paid it a &euro;4,500 environment management grant.  Although Enterprise Ireland does not fund companies to assist them to trade on the domestic market, its potential exporters division was in contact with the company to discuss exporting options and understands it was not exporting.  The agency, therefore, was not in a position to assist further.<\/p><p>Supporting enterprise development in all regions of the country to support job creation is a key objective of the Government, with initiatives such as the regional Action Plans for Jobs seeking to build on the capabilities and strengths of each region to maximise enterprise growth and job creation.  The regional action plan initiative is working to promote regional and rural job creation by bringing different stakeholders in each of the eight regions together to identify innovative and practical actions to be taken across a range of Departments and agencies.  The success of this project is crucial to the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create an additional 200,000 jobs, 135,000 of which would be outside Dublin, by 2020.  The most recent quarter 2 2017 figures from the CSO also show that over 80% of all jobs created in the previous year were created outside Dublin.  The enterprise agencies are making a significant contribution to employment in the regions.  Some 61% of new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland firms in 2016 were outside Dublin, while 52% of new jobs by IDA Ireland firms in 2016 were outside Dublin.<\/p><p>The south-east plan which covers the area under discussion is the key policy response for supporting employment growth in the south-east region, with public and private stakeholders actively engaged in delivering a range of innovative and practical actions set out in the plan.  The core objective of the plan is to create a further 25,000 jobs in the region by 2020 in the counties of Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford and reduce the unemployment rate to within 1% of the State average.  Sectors targeted as part of the plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region such as agrifood, manufacturing, engineering and tourism.  Key targets include a 30% to 40% increase in investments by overseas companies in the region by 2019.  The first two progress reports on the implementation of the south-east plan show that good progress continues to be made in implementing the actions.  Some 13,000 jobs have been created in the south east since the regional Action Plans for Jobs initiative was launched in January 2015.  In addition, the unemployment rate in the south east fell from 12.8% in 2015 to 8.1% by quarter 2 of 2017.  Numbers on the live register in County Carlow have fallen by 1,538, or 29%, in the past two years.  However, there is still work to be done.  The unemployment rate in the south east is still over one percentage point higher than the quarter 2 national average of 6.4%.  The enterprise development agencies will continue to make every effort they can to develop new employment opportunities in the region.  <\/p><p>Carlow is home to seven IDA Ireland clients which, between them, employ just over 800 people in a range of manufacturing and service operations.  Enterprise Ireland has 85 client companies based in Carlow which created 373 jobs in 2016, bringing total employment by Enterprise Ireland clients in Carlow to 2,973.  I referred to some of the Deputy's questions in my reply.<\/p><p><b>Deputy John McGuinness:<\/b>The Minister of State has not answered my questions.  He has studiously avoided every single point I have made on behalf of Morrisseys and the 100 jobs which are at stake.  He has ignored everything I have said and the letters written to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and AIB.  It is disgraceful that he would come into the House with no facts or figures and make no effort to explain whether he will contact AIB, ask it to stop the sale on behalf of the taxpayer and protect the jobs which are at risk.  He never mentioned the Morrisseys, the offers made or whether he would intervene.<\/p><p>That shows complete disrespect for this House and its Members.  The job of the Ceann Comhairle is to protect the interests of the Members but the Minister of State has not answered the question.  I ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to insist that the Minister of State, either now or at some other stage today, provides the answer to the questions asked.<\/p> <p> This is why people are so cynical about politics.  The Minister of State refuses to discuss the issue at heart while I have cut to the chase and gave the facts.  I ask the Minister of State again if he will tell the bank, which this country owns, to stop the sale of this quarry and protect the 100 jobs and competition in the market.  Today the Minister of State is ignoring not just the plight of my constituents but the issue at hand.  There are three superpowers in this country that own all the quarries and they dictate the price of the product; it is a cartel.  The Minister of State has addressed none of this.  He has expressed sympathy and said he knows about this because of his experience in Clare.  Why did he not do something with that experience and at least give the facts asked of him instead of reading this drivel into the record?  He is ignoring a fair attempt on my behalf to put a request that it is absolutely necessary for the Minister of State to address.  Stop this sale through AIB to a super group that will result in the loss of jobs and have an effect on 100 families.

He would have seen flagged in the rail review serious safety issues apparent in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann due to the lack of investment over the past decade and maintenance of vital infrastructure.  In the budget a couple of weeks ago, the Minister for Finance indicated that transport had procured an additional &euro;9.6 million.  That is the only additional funding for the entire transport portfolio.  It is fair to say the Minister has no interest in public transport and he certainly has no plan.  Did he mislead the D&aacute;il when he gave a commitment to convene the stakeholders' forum?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800040#NN00900","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1510156800,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I refer the Minister to the Taoiseach's comments yesterday.  The Taoiseach is on a salary of over &euro;180,000 and he supports the chief executive of Irish Rail, who gets over &euro;211,000 per year.  He told the D&aacute;il the rail workers' demands are unaffordable.  These demands equate to a pay rise of 3.75% after ten years of pay freezes, two years of pay cuts, increased productivity and rising passenger numbers.  That is along with all the austerity imposed on us, including property tax, universal social charge and everything else.  Apparently, an increase of 3.75% is unaffordable.  Where does the Government get off?  It is affordable to increase salaries for chief executive officers, the Taoiseach and Ministers but it is apparently not affordable to meet reasonable pay demands that are only keeping track with increased costs of living.<\/p>  <p>  Many workers earning between &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000 are enemy No. 1 for demanding a modest pay rise after a decade of these cuts and pay freezes.  Since 2008, this State has cut subvention for rail from &euro;181 million to &euro;117 million.  There were eight years of cuts, which were demanded by Irish Rail to plug the gap in funding, and this made employees work harder and longer for less work.  Wage costs fell by &euro;25 million and there has been a decrease of 20% in the staffing of the company.  On the picket lines this week I spoke with drivers and other staff who are in fear of their lives running trains up and down the country with only two staff on them, the driver and AN Other.  Often they deal with assaults, threats and can witness suicides.  They are put under great duress.  Trains are operating with a skeleton staff and they are not getting decent pay rises that would keep them ahead of cost increases.<\/p>  <p>  What does the Minister have to say about that?

I share their disappointment that we have seen a second day of strike action at Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann but I am pleased, as I am sure they are, that both sides have accepted an invitation from the Labour Court to attend talks tomorrow morning.  Deputies know I have consistently stated that difficult matters like these can only be resolved through open, constructive and realistic engagement between the company and its employees.  I encourage both sides to engage constructively on the matter, as I am sure they are now intent on doing.<\/p>  <p>  I have responsibility for policy and overall funding for public transport.<\/p><p>I am not  involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport.  Industrial relations and pay are a matter for the company and its employees.  I have made clear time and again that I will not intervene in areas where it is not appropriate for a Minister to intervene.<\/p> <p> In relation to funding of our public transport services I recognise that subvention levels were reduced during the recession, as the Deputies frequently and rightly point out.  Most areas of public expenditure were reduced.  However, the public service obligation, PSO, subvention increased last year, again this year and will increase yet further next year.  Over the three years subvention will have increased by some 35% in total.  In 2018, &euro;285 million of Exchequer - taxpayer - funds will be allocated.  The precise allocations to the individual transport companies will be decided by the National Transport Authority, NTA, in accordance with the various contract arrangements.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann receives a significant portion of the total PSO funding available for all the public transport companies.  In 2016 alone, it received 57% of the total PSO funding available for the CI&Eacute; group and carried about 20% of the total passengers.<\/p> <p> In budget 2018 we also announced &euro;2.7 billion of Exchequer capital investment in public transport infrastructure and facilities over the next four years under the capital plan.  This represents a 30% increase over the original capital plan allocations for 2018 to 2021 and will allow roll-out of a number of key infrastructure programmes to address congestion and emerging capacity constraints on our public transport system.  The forthcoming ten year national investment plan, to be published in the coming months, will provide a ten year capital envelope for public transport to 2028.  In answer to the question from Deputy Munster, a few months ago I made a commitment to engage in a dialogue with a wide range of public transport stakeholders and the process for setting this up has already begun.  A constructive meeting took place on 10 July with all relevant trade union representatives and I found the exchange to be both useful and informative.  I requested each of the unions to make submissions on the format and issues that might be covered by the proposed dialogue.  They expressed an eagerness to do so and I look forward to receiving all of those submissions.  Only one has been received to date.  As previously indicated in this House, I would also welcome any suggestions that opposition spokespersons, including the two Deputies here, might have.  However, as I have frequently stated, the proposed dialogue cannot take place under the threat of or during industrial action.  I hope we will be able to go ahead with that dialogue shortly.<\/p> <p> I welcome the intervention of the Labour Court and hope that the discussions, which will start tomorrow, will provide the basis for a lasting agreement between the company and its employees.  It is vitally important for the travelling public and also for the staff and for the company itself that public transport continues and that the dispute is resolved in a realistic, fair and sustainable manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800040#NN01100","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510157400,"counter":510,"content":"<p>This comes back to the Minister's commitment to the stakeholder's forum.

Their working lives have been ruined by the sort of rotas they are expected to work.  They are now working in a very difficult, demoralised workplace.  The company is riding roughshod over them.  The Minister should not let that happen in this instance, and should not use the threat of insolvency against Irish Rail workers.  Passenger numbers and revenue are at an all time high in Irish Rail.  This is due to the productivity of and the cuts endured by the workers.

However, it is important to note that equality is a contentious political issue.  All politicians in this House purport to pursue the objective of equality, but they do so in different ways.  Neither I nor Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin believes we have a monopoly of wisdom when trying to pursue the principle of equality, but we believe what we have put forward in this legislation would have a significant impact in seeking to diminish a particular type of discrimination and inequality in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Politically, the pursuit of equality has become pronounced in recent years.  When one looks at the Official Report of D&aacute;il debates, one sees that in the past 20 years the term \"in pursuit of equality\" was used frequently in the House and outside it by politicians.  The objectives they seek to achieve in using the word \"equality\" are broad ranging.  Of course, equality does not mean uniformity.  It does not mean that we must live in a North Korean environment in which we all live in the same type of house, all earn the same money and all must do the same job.  Sometimes it is important to distinguish equality from the principles of other political doctrines which sometimes use equality to advance their political theories.<\/p>  <p>  As legislators, we have a significant responsibility to ensure there is equality before the law.  We must also understand the limitations on politicians.  All we can do is try to change the law in order that the change we make will have an impact on society.  It is not always the case that changes in the law can have the effect of changing society, but in this area it would send a significant message.  As the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, know, equality is not a modern principle, although it is evoked frequently in modern political parlance.  It is an ancient philosophy that dates back to ancient Greece and Rome.  In addition, there are references in some Christian writings to what was regarded as equality.  Looking back at those ancient times we probably would not regard those societies as equal, but it is important to note that at the time they emphasised that because of a man's or a woman's ability to reason, there was an inherent equality between men.  Although they did not emphasise women as much, that can be read into it.<\/p>  <p>  We also must consider the impact of the principle of equality on modern political philosophy.  In the 18th century the American war of independence and the United States Declaration of Independence referred to how all men were created equal.  The same principle was present in the French Revolution later in the 18th century.  We can also consider our historical development.  The Proclamation of independence expressly states the Republic guarantees the equal rights and equal opportunities of all of its citizens.  No doubt that was one of the reasons when the Constitution was drafted in 1937 and came into force thereafter it specifically included Article 40.1 which states all citizens shall as human persons be held equal before the law.  Even though we have that principle and constitutional right in the Constitution, it is important that the Legislature take steps to ensure equality is not simply an academic reference but is given life through statutory import.  That has not happened with sufficient clarity to date.<\/p>  <p>  We note that after the Constitution was enacted, it was left to the courts to interpret how and whether the right to equality under the Constitution had been violated and how it should be remedied.  That has been done by the courts on many occasions.  It was done for the benefit of women who did not receive equality, for example, in the case involving their inability to serve on juries.  That only arose as a result of a case taken before the High Court.  The High Court declared that it was a violation of the principle of equality under the Constitution that women could not serve on juries.  Sometimes it also happened in the case of men.  The Adoption Act 1974 precluded widowers from adopting but allowed widows to adopt.  That provision was struck down by the courts.  Sometimes, however, they courts failed to recognise the principle of equality.  The case taken in the 1980s by Senator David Norris was rejected by the courts.  The law was subsequently changed by this House.<\/p>  <p>  In the 1990s a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government put some flesh onto the bones of the principle of equality in the Constitution.  In 1998 there was a significant statutory development in the area of equality when the Employment Equality Act was passed by the Oireachtas.  Shortly afterwards, in 2000, the Equal Status Act was passed.  It is important to note what these Acts provided for because in this legislation we are seeking to amend them slightly by adding a further ground.  Under the Employment Equality Act 1998, employers were prohibited from discriminating against employees or potential employees on nine specific grounds set out in the legislation.  One cannot discriminate against employees on the basis of their gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race or being a member of the Traveller community.  Each of the provisions in the Employment Equality Act has been a welcome addition to our legislation.  Shortly after the enactment of the Employment Equality Bill, the Equal Status Act 2000 was passed.  Similarly, it provided for the nine grounds I have just mentioned, whereby one was precluded from discriminating against individuals when providing services for them.  All of that legislation is of benefit.  <\/p>  <p>  I am sure the Minister of State appreciates that equality legislation is extremely difficult to police.  Sometimes it is difficult to decipher whether an employer or service provider is discriminating against an individual on the basis of any of the nine grounds listed.  However, the benefit of having them in our law goes beyond the fact that people can be legally held to account.  The greatest benefit is that it conveys a message that the State does not consider discrimination on any of the grounds as acceptable.  With this legislation we are seeking to add a further ground to the nine grounds listed in the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act.<\/p><p> We propose to add a further ground, the disadvantaged socioeconomic ground, making it ten grounds in all.  Disadvantaged socioeconomic status would mean a socially identifiable status of social or economic disadvantage resulting from poverty, level or source of income, homelessness, place of residence or family background.  Like every piece of legislation there is a political reason we are introducing it.  I will explain it by recounting to the House stories told to me about things that happened to people in my constituency, which I believe are unacceptable.<\/p> <p> First, at a clinic, a woman asked for my assistance in her job application to a large employer - I will not identify it or where she came from - and I was happy to do so.  She told me she would not put the address where she resides on the job application.  She lived in a local authority estate and told me that she was not putting her address on the form because she believed that she would be discriminated against because people from that estate did not get jobs.  Certain employers discriminated against people from the estate because it had an association with antisocial behaviour or minor criminal activity.  I was surprised by this and asked others in the area if they had a similar experience.  I was astonished by the extent to which people who live in this local authority estate told me that when they applied for certain jobs, and to certain employers, people who live there do not put down their address because they believe they are discriminated against because of where they live.  As so many of them believe this, I think it is sufficient evidence to advance the idea.  That is part of the reason we are advancing this ground to change the Employment Equality Act, as it stands.<\/p> <p> I will tell a second story, which is similar but relates to the Equal Status Act.  I was speaking to a woman in a local authority flat complex where she lived, who told me about her children.  I was very surprised when she told me that she did not send her young son to a local national school, but to a private school in the area.  I was astonished at the efforts to which this woman went to ensure that her son got the best from his early life.  She made valiant efforts on his behalf, and one can imagine the amount work she had to undertake to put him through a private primary school.  She told me that she had applied on her son's behalf to the closest national school but that it would not accept her son.  She said none of the people in the local authority flats who had applied to this school had had his or her son accepted there and as a result all the children from the flats had to go to another national school which was further away.  She said it was very rough and she did not want her son to go there.  It is unacceptable for national schools, our schools, to discriminate and say they will not take children from the flats.  For this reason we are bringing forward this small piece of amending legislation to change the Equal Status Act and the Employment Equality Act.  I am hopeful that there will be support for it in the House.<\/p> <p> The legislation is of a type that is extremely difficult to police but when one looks at the law at present, one is not allowed to discriminate against people because of their sex or their sexual orientation, but there is no law prohibiting discrimination against a person because, as in the examples I just gave, someone comes from a block of flats about which an employer may have a negative view or someone wants to send his or her child to a local national school and the child does not get in because it does not take people from those flats.  That behaviour is unacceptable.  I do not believe that it is widespread in Irish society but we should change the equality legislation nonetheless so that type of discrimination it is not permissible.  Neither is the type of discrimination outlined in the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status particularly widespread but it is extremely important that our legislation sets out that one cannot discriminate against people because they are women, they are gay, because of their age or religion - religious discrimination was the most significant type of discrimination since it affected so many people up to 1828 under the Penal Laws - and in modern times we should similarly say that one should not discriminate against people because they come from a poorer background.  I believe this to be the more common form of discrimination in this society rather than the other types which are already outlined in the legislation.  It is not a competition between the different grounds.  Each is commendable and should be there but I see no reason that we should not keep trying to evolve and promote our laws on equality.  They continually change along with the society in which we live and it is important that we send out a message that it is unacceptable for people to discriminate against individuals on the basis that those people come from a disadvantaged socioeconomic background.<\/p> <p> I apologise for going on for too long, and will hand over to my colleague, Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800042#TT00200","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510158600,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak to this Bill which seeks to extend the scope of current employment equality legislation by prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disadvantaged socioeconomic or social backgrounds.  Put simply, this Bill seeks to enhance equality.  As my colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan, said, even though there is much talk about equality both inside and outside this Chamber, we do not do much by way of legislation to protect or improve it.  It is easy to say we believe in equality but what does that mean?  According to one dictionary definition, it is \"the state of being equal, especially in status, rights or opportunities\".  It is the area of status and opportunities that we hope to address with this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Discrimination based on socioeconomic or social backgrounds has been growing problem in recent years.  It is chilling to listen to Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan speak on the school situation in particular, where some schools did not take children from certain addresses estates.  Many people living in disadvantaged areas have found it difficult to secure jobs simply because they live in a certain area or estate.  Their applications are not being considered on merit and they face arbitrary barriers which have a detrimental impact on their lives.  This form of inequality needs to be tackled. <\/p>  <p>  The Bill Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan and I have brought forward aims to address this growing problem by explicitly banning discrimination on the basis of disadvantaged socioeconomic or social background.  This should help ensure that people living in disadvantaged areas are protected from discrimination alongside those who are unemployed or are relying on social protection supports.  This should help break the vicious poverty trap that many people fall into.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il recognises that enhancing social conditions and creating better opportunities for people is the fundamental method of supporting disadvantaged communities.  This Bill is just one proposal for tackling inequality and breaking down the barriers which exist for those living in disadvantaged areas.  Unfortunately, we live in a world where assumptions based on socioeconomic status or address can often restrict opportunities for minorities or disadvantaged groups mainly in job opportunities but also, as we heard, in education.  Some progress has been made in diversity but many other areas need work to minimise or reduce prejudice.<\/p>  <p>  Studies have shown that individuals sometimes make drastic changes in their personal information in order to achieve better results in the business and-or academic fields, where a surname or location can be life changing.<\/p><p>It is likely that those from eastern parts of the world will anglicise their names.  We have seen that happen among people from other countries who have chosen to live in Ireland and to apply for jobs here.  It is done prior to applying for positions offered by companies.  Again, there are many people living in certain estates who say that they have to change their addresses for job opportunities because the areas in which they live are associated with deprivation, anti-social behaviour or other elements of criminality.<\/p> <p> Socially identifiable status or socioeconomic disadvantages resulting from poverty level, source of income, place of residence or familial background should not be a measure, or used as a measure, to treat one person less favourably than another.  We have to have a developed, fair and united society where true equality of status, rights and opportunities is not fictional.  That can only be the product of a joint, cohesive process being developed for each and every one of our citizens.  As a republican party, Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to fighting discrimination and inequality.  As my colleague said, we have a proven record in providing leadership in the field of equality legislation, particularly in respect of the two major parts of Irish equality legislation, which we certainly want to enhance at this point.  It is fair to say that there is evidence of significant discrimination on the grounds of socioeconomic status in key areas.  We must do our best to ensure that there is equality wherever there can be.  <\/p> <p> As my colleague said, it is sometimes difficult to police the prohibitions which we have in the nine areas of discrimination, and in respect of the tenth area which we are proposing in this Bill.  Nonetheless, it is very important to state that there is a significant benefit in setting out the grounds on which discrimination is unacceptable in law.  It would certainly help to send a strong message that any level of discrimination in any of these areas is totally unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800043#UU00200","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510159200,"counter":527,"content":"<p>We all share the common objective of wanting to protect all persons living in Ireland from discrimination in their daily lives.

If we are to amend these important pieces of legislation, we need to ensure that the amendments are precise, appropriate and targeted at addressing a particular need.<\/p>  <p>  This Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017, tabled by Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan, proposes to extend the discrimination grounds to include a new ground, that of disadvantaged socioeconomic status.  The Government agrees with the principle of what the Deputy is attempting to achieve with this Bill.  Let us be clear on that.  We agree with the principle.  Like the Deputy, we do not wish to see anybody denied access to employment or to goods and services because that person lives at a particular address or belongs to a particular type of family.  The Government is also conscious of its international obligations in this area.  There are, however, flaws in this present Bill which are so serious as to prevent Government from supporting it.  <\/p>  <p>  It is a shame that the Deputy did not choose to submit this Bill to pre-legislative scrutiny prior to publication, as all Government Bills must be submitted.  Committees have done fantastic work in this area.  I would have been delighted had that happened because we all would have been advised by the committee's deliberations and all Deputies could have looked at the Bill in light of them.  Government legislation has to go through this process but Private Members' Bills do not.  That is a flaw in our system.  I have said it before and I am saying it again.  It is a weakness in our system.  If Private Members' Bills are to be treated seriously, they should also go through pre-legislative scrutiny.  Many of the flaws that I will identify could have been addressed through that process and a more nuanced Bill presented to this House as a consequence.<\/p>  <p>  A general principle is that statute law should be certain, clear and precise.  In a Bill such as this one, one can clearly see that certainty and precision are essential so that the law can be easily interpreted by the person experiencing discrimination, by the courts and by employers, service providers and businesses.  Unfortunately, this Bill is characterised by ambiguities and subjectivity.  The Deputies who have already spoken have said that this is an area in which it is very difficult to work.  Unless the legislation is very clear, it will be almost impossible to work.  This Bill, if enacted, would introduce an ambiguous and wide-ranging definition of disadvantaged socioeconomic status into the Equality Acts.  The definition would encompass six separate elements - poverty, level or source of income, homelessness, place of residence and family background.  <\/p>  <p>  As proposed, the definition of disadvantaged socioeconomic status could give rise to differing interpretations depending on the context.  As such, it differs from the existing equality grounds which set out clear characteristics that a person either fulfils or does not fulfil.  On the civil status ground, for instance, a person will immediately know if she or he is single, married, divorced, separated, widowed, a civil partner or a former civil partner.  Equally, on the Traveller community ground, a person is either a Traveller or she or he is not.  That is not subject to interpretation.  It is clear.  The strength of the current clear definitions in the equality legislation is two-fold.  A person at risk of discrimination can immediately know whether or not the protected grounds apply to his or her situation.  Equally, and just as importantly, employers or providers of goods and services can know the precise situations which constitute prohibited discrimination.  They have to be able to know clearly what differences of treatment are permitted and what are not.  Employers or providers of goods and services can then put systems and policies in place to guard against discrimination by themselves or by their staff.<\/p>  <p>  However, the elements included in the proposed definition of disadvantaged socioeconomic status generate more questions than answers.  I propose to go through some of the questions which, in my view, arise from the definition proposed in this Bill.  Taking the first element of the definition, namely, poverty, how would a person be defined as being in poverty?  Would it be a person in consistent poverty or someone in relative poverty?  The Bill is not clear on that.  That is very serious.  Turning to the second element, that of level of income, how would disadvantaged income levels be defined?  Would it be relative to a specific income threshold?   What about someone who is asset rich but income poor?  Would it be relative to the income of others?  Would it extend to include any person denied a means-tested benefit because he or she was above a specific income threshold?  Where is the line drawn?  It is not clear at all from the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Similar questions arise in respect of source of income.  What constitutes disadvantage in this context?  Will everyone on a social welfare payment be termed disadvantaged?  Will someone working in a specific type of work be considered disadvantaged?  Could the definition include a criminal who gained income through criminality and whose source of income was dubious?  We have had those debates here before.  The place of residence aspect of the definition also raises questions.  Would it be restricted to someone from an area of high income disadvantage?  Could a poor person living in a wealthy area also qualify?  Would it extend to someone living in a particular type of residence, such as an institution?  Could a prisoner be eligible to take a case for discrimination arising from his or her \"place of residence\"?  Could the definition encompass someone living in a rural area who was not poor but who had more limited access to employment opportunities?  Could a person living in a rural area take a claim if he or she had poorer access to postal or broadband services, for instance, than an equivalent person living in Dublin?  Turning to family background, this element seems particularly ambiguous.  Who is this element intended to encompass?  Would it include a person in a lone parent household, a person from a Traveller family, a person from an ethnic minority family, a person whose parent was not an Irish national, or an adopted person?  What does it mean?<\/p>  <p>  These questions need to be answered so that we can be clear as to the situations likely to be encompassed by this equality ground.  As it stands, the definition's ambiguity could expand the number of potential cases that might be taken under the equality legislation exponentially, particularly as the Equality Acts encompass indirect as well as direct discrimination.<\/p>  <p>  The ambiguous definition proposed in this Bill could lead to unintended consequences.  We could see a situation in which individuals with a good education or training and easy access to finances could take claims based on the level of income or place of residence elements of the definition.  Wealthier individuals could challenge their exclusion from means-tested benefits citing disadvantage on the basis of level of income. <\/p><p>Such individuals could potentially force State resources to be redirected towards addressing their circumstances rather than targeting those resources at persons in greatest need.  It might be difficult, in this context, for public service providers to set criteria restricting the provision of non-statutory services where resources were limited and certain groups needed to be prioritised.  The provisions in this Bill also carry the risk of interfering with ministerial discretion in allocating funding to specific areas.<\/p> <p> The Government has taken action in a more targeted manner to address instances of discrimination where it believed there was a clear need to do so.  The Government took action to prohibit discrimination in the letting of residential accommodation on the basis that a person is or is not in receipt of rent supplement or a housing assistance payment.  The Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 amended sections 2 and 6 of the Equal Status Act 2000 so a person could not be discriminated against when renting because he or she is getting rent supplement, the housing assistance payment or any other social welfare payment.  This means landlords can no longer state, when advertising accommodation, that rent supplement or the housing assistance payment is not accepted, and they cannot refuse to rent accommodation to a person because he or she is in receipt of a social welfare payment.<\/p> <p> The Government's view is that the case for the amendment of the equality legislation must be based on clear evidence.  At present, we do not have objective evidence that individuals are actually experiencing discrimination because of their address or background.  We are relying on anecdotal evidence, which may provide a very partial picture.  In this regard, Deputy O'Callaghan told us two stories of people he met.  That is fair enough but we need to know the exact extent of any such discrimination.  We also need to isolate the potential discrimination from any other factors that might affect the person's employment status.  A person might find it difficult to get employment because she or he has poorer educational qualifications.  An individual might find it harder to get employment in a rural area with more limited job opportunities.  If we are to amend the equality legislation, we need to be sure that discrimination is what we need to tackle rather than other factors, such as training needs or educational disadvantage.<\/p> <p> I recognise that this issue is inherently complex, as the Deputies have said, and that it is very difficult to arrive at a precise definition.  As Deputies will be aware, a report on this question was undertaken by UCC in 2004.  The report, Extending the Scope of Employment Equality Legislation: Comparative Perspectives on the Prohibited Grounds of Discrimination, which I read recently, found that discrimination on the basis of socio-economic status is not necessarily revealed by distinctive external features.  It also found that there is extreme difficulty in providing proof of discrimination, particularly where the burden of proof lies with the victim of discrimination.<\/p> <p> Before proceeding with a flawed Bill, we need to examine this issue in more detail so we can proceed on the basis of a solid evidence base and a targeted definition of need.  Accordingly, the Government proposes to commission research to establish the extent and prevalence of discrimination on the basis of place of residence or related factors.  Such research would also have the purpose of establishing whether such discrimination was occurring in regard to employment or access to goods and services, or both.  It would establish whether a legislative response was needed and, if so, which Acts needed to be amended.  The researchers would be also asked to devise a more precise formulation for the additional equality ground if it were decided that this were needed.  In taking this process forward, the Government would seek to work with appropriate State bodies and agencies, such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  The Equality &amp;amp; Rights Alliance has also done some useful preliminary research in this area, as outlined in its report, An Analysis of the Introduction of Socio-Economic Status as a Discrimination Ground.  I am sure most Deputies present have read it.  My objective is to set the research process in motion imminently.  The immediate priority will be to draft appropriate terms of reference.<\/p> <p> As I said at the outset, I share the concern that we should seek to address barriers that create disadvantage for individuals in our society and prevent them from realising their potential.  We can work together to devise appropriate solutions to this challenge but this Bill's ambiguity is such that, however laudable its intentions, it does not provide an appropriate way forward.  Accordingly, the Government cannot support it.  We want to carry out research on this and share and debate it with colleagues in the House, and we then want to proceed with a fact-based agenda.  I recommend against accepting this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800044#VV00200","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510159800,"counter":529,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an mBille seo, ach freisin na leasuithe at&aacute; ceangailte leis.  I welcome this Bill and the proposed amendments.<\/p>  <p>  Up to this point, the Irish Government has failed to introduce a new socio-economic status ground in equality legislation.  This Bill will go some way towards ensuring Ireland meets its obligations under both EU and international law.  It will, in effect, bring us into line with most progressive case law across Europe.  The amendments the Bill proposes will prohibit discrimination on the basis of socio-economic status.  We are all aware that people from areas regarded as being deprived, or areas with high rates of anti-social behaviour or crime, face significant discrimination, for example, in gaining employment or promotion.<\/p>  <p>  It is a sad fact of life that, even in this age, people often have to disguise their home addresses for fear of being discriminated against when applying for a job or going for a job interview.  Many people from my constituency, Dublin North-West, have come to me and told me about such discrimination.  It has probably got worse during the long years of austerity.  In fact, it has almost certainly increased the amount of inequality.  This Bill, which amends the equality legislation, will help to break down the barriers to opportunity for people from lower socio-economic backgrounds.<\/p>  <p>  Discrimination also occurs in housing and education.  This is often based on socio-economic status.  To their credit, many colleges and universities are increasingly recognising that people from certain deprived areas, or from more disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds, are less likely to attend third level institutions or opt for further education.  Many third level institutions have, and are putting in place, positive initiatives that both open and widen access to third level courses for students, regardless of their socio-economic background.  The reality, however, is that students from certain areas regarded as being deprived or with high rates of anti-social behaviour are greatly under-represented at third level.<\/p>  <p>  Today, many third level institutions are taking the initiative and, without the benefit of legislation, are helping to tackle social exclusion through innovative and targeted initiatives, often in partnership with businesses, local communities and various organisations across the education sector.  Such positive moves by universities and colleges allow students from more deprived socio-economic backgrounds to realise their full academic potential.<\/p>  <p>  As a society, we have made progress on equality and rights.  The marriage equality referendum is an example.  Discrimination against any person, on grounds of religion, ethnic background, disability, mental illness or gender, is anathema to the objectives of a progressive, modern society.<\/p>  <p>  Over the years, I have met constituents who have been afraid to give their address for fear of discrimination or bias in the consideration of qualifications or even looking for a job.  Equality should mean equality but that is not always the experience, particularly among those with working-class backgrounds.  This is even more the case if they have a disability or suffer from mental illness.  A measure of any society is how it treats citizens, especially the young and old, irrespective of their socio-economic background.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment of section 2 of the Equal Status Act 2000 in subsection 1 is extremely important and should send out a strong signal that, irrespective of where one comes from or one's background, one should be treated on a par with others.  It is one thing legislating for issues of equality but the only real judge is action.  As we have seen regarding issues pertaining to Traveller and minority rights, the State has failed.  Changing the mindset requires education and long-term initiatives.  This Bill should send out a strong message.  While it is not perfect and there are many issues arising, everyone should be supporting its thrust.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800045#WW00200","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1510159800,"counter":530,"content":"<p>On behalf of my party, I welcome and support this Bill.  I have long believed there should be prohibition of discrimination on socio-economic grounds in the two Acts to be amended.  I commend the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies and the Equality Rights Alliance on their work in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the discussion so far has focused on addressing disadvantage.  I wish to make two points on this, the first being that disadvantage is a lot more complicated than merely having a certain address or living in local authority housing.  Increasingly, it is a lot more dispersed in our communities.  In some respects, it may be less visible, which makes it more difficult to tackle.  For all that, tackling it is no less important.<\/p><p>A word that has been absent from the debate so far is &quot;class&quot;.  Essentially, we are talking about class.  Sometimes &quot;working class&quot; and &quot;disadvantaged&quot; are used as synonyms but I do not believe that necessarily should be the case.  Acute disadvantage is a very specific issue whereas the working class in Ireland is a much more substantial category, although there is a substantial cross-over.  That is a slight digression but it is an important point nonetheless in terms of understanding disadvantage.<br\/><br\/>I accept the comments and the intention of the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, as <i>bona fide<\/i>but I am disappointed with his response, which is a very technical one.  It is entirely within the scope of these institutions that the Bill could proceed even to pre-legislative scrutiny after Second Stage, which is facilitated in certain committees.  There is international precedent for such legislation.  The European network of legal experts in gender equality and non-discrimination shows that legislation in 20 of the 35 European countries provides protection against discrimination on a ground related to socio-economic status.  We are behind the curve in that regard.  Among other things, Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibits discrimination on the grounds of social origin and poverty, among others.<br\/><br\/>I will now turn to the substance of the Bill.  As a people, we often delude ourselves into believing that Ireland is a classless society.  Perhaps that is changing now.  Some of that is underpinned by the fiction that the party system in Ireland, the two big parties of the supposed middle, was a function of that society.  However, I very much believe that class is real and always has been real.  We have all heard stories of people being refused employment on the basis of their address or using a different address for employment.  In <i>Angela's Ashes<\/i>, Frank McCourt uses a different address to try to disguise the fact that he came from a lane in Limerick.  Class difference and discrimination on that basis always has been a fact of life in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>In the context of this debate I am reminded of the English writer, Owen Jones, who wrote the very excellent book <i>Chavs<\/i>, which documented very clearly how words such as &quot;chav&quot; and stereotypes of working class people were deemed largely acceptable by the media and treated as mere banter, whereas in reality they were enforcing structural and very real inequality and discrimination.  The reality is that the opportunities afforded to working class people in this country are substantially less than people who are better off.  In this city the obvious example is access to higher education.  In Dublin 6 access is in excess of 90%, in Dublin 17 it is 15% and in Dublin 10 it is 16%.<br\/><br\/>I will provide another example of discrimination.  I read an excellent article by Patrick Freyne in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>on 22 July last.  I would recommend it to the Minister of State.  It detailed the use of stop and search powers on young people, particularly from the inner city and other working class areas.  It provides testimony of the impact that has on young people from those areas.  Experts in the area include Gareth Noble and Dermot Walsh.  They agree that such discrimination has an effect.  It is in such areas that discrimination is experienced on an everyday basis and currently there is very little remedy for it.  If enacted, the Bill would provide a remedy and a ground for taking action.<br\/><br\/>I am disappointed with the Minister of State's response.  It is possible to tighten up the definition.  I find it very difficult to accept that some of the examples given would be entertained by a court, but if the Minister of State is of the view that it is merely a problem of definition then surely the issue could be addressed on Committee Stage.  If the principle and the pieces of legislation that are intended to be amended are clear then I do not see any reason the situation could not be rectified given that we are, apparently, all united on the principle that socio-economic discrimination should not be allowed.<br\/><br\/>Two very clear and precise areas of discrimination that could be addressed by the Department, which are not included in either of those Acts, are discrimination on the basis of political belief or on the basis of trade union membership.  If the Minister of State is interested in precise definitions, they are two perfectly precise areas that are within the gift of the Minister of State to deal with in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800045#WW00300","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510160400,"counter":532,"content":"<p>Like other speakers I support the thrust of the Bill.  The Minister of State has raised a number of issues such as pre-legislative scrutiny.  I am conscious that we have identified areas of high socio-economic deprivation in the past and we introduced programmes such as RAPID to tackle them.  As a society we have identified that particular areas needed to be addressed and supported.<\/p>  <p>  I am also conscious of the effect on people who live in areas that have a high level of crime or gangland killings of the coverage by newspapers and television.  Someone in such an area can be impacted if he or she goes for a job interview on a day following a news story.  Regardless of what is said, it is in the back of an interviewer's mind that he or she is from a particular area.  We have all heard stories in our constituencies about people who held the strong view that the interview was over as soon as the interviewers heard where they lived.  We all accept that is wrong.<\/p>  <p>  We are all aware from history of what happened in the neighbouring jurisdiction where people were discriminated against in the past because of the area in which they lived, the school they attended or their perceived political allegiance if they considered themselves as Irish.  They suffered discrimination in the areas of jobs and housing.  Thankfully, we have moved on in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The intention of the Bill is to identify those areas that need to be examined in terms of discrimination.  Other speakers referred to the fact that it is illegal to discriminate against people because of gender, race, sexual orientation, religious beliefs or because they have a disability or are a member of the Traveller community.  We have been successful in addressing discrimination in those areas.  We do need to examine how discrimination affects people.  We need to do a lot more to tackle racism, sexism and homophobia in society.  The intention behind the Bill is a positive start.  Hopefully, it will give people a firm legal avenue to challenge such discrimination.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure we would all accept that we need a renewed focus on tackling poverty and inequality in society.  We must devise a suite of social and economic measures to tackle this man-made inequality.  I do not believe enacting legislation will solve those problems but it will go some of the way towards resolving them.  Legislation would also empower and encourage people to take cases where they feel there is discrimination.  That is what has happened where such legislation has been introduced.<\/p>  <p>  There are other areas we could examine in terms of discrimination.  Reference was made to trade unions, for example.  Some CEOs regularly boast about not hiring anyone who is a member of a trade union.  We are still waiting on robust collective bargaining legislation.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to introduce legislation on discrimination against ex-prisoners, in particular those who qualified under the Good Friday Agreement.  All sorts of promises were made about those prisoners but they are still discriminated against when it comes to travel and adoption.  The situation affects men and women and it must be addressed.  Ex-prisoners are discriminated against when they try to get taxi plates because of their former political status.  Such discrimination is wrong and goes against the Good Friday Agreement and it should be outlined in future equality legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  It gives us an opportunity to start thinking about what is wrong with society.  Clearly, discrimination on the basis of where people live, a poor background or because they are not wealthy would go against the ethos of everyone here.<\/p><p>There is clearly a need to change.

We have had sight of the Equality and Rights Alliance publication by Tamas Kadar - forgive me if I am mispronouncing his surname.  The analysis includes a recommendation for the introduction of socioeconomic status as a discrimination ground.  The document refers to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Ireland ratified in 1989.  It also refers to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which was also ratified in 1989 but, as of yet, Ireland has not adopted the optional protocol.  Those covenants speak specifically to the issue of this legislation.  The Equality and Rights Alliance Publication states:<\/p><blockquote>Property is seen as a broad concept including real property (e.g. land ownership or tenure) and personal property (e.g. intellectual property, goods and chattels, and income), or the lack of it. As a discrimination ground, birth is seen as covering descent and inherited status (e.g. caste) as well as those born out of wedlock...A person&rsquo;s social and economic situation when living in poverty or being homeless may result in pervasive discrimination, stigmatization and negative stereotyping which can lead to the refusal of, or unequal access to, the same quality of education and health care as others, as well as the denial of or unequal access to public places.<\/blockquote><p>We could extend this to the right to a job or the right to be deemed eligible to apply for a job and the need to prevent being discriminated against on the basis of one's location.<\/p><p>I was hopeful that the Government response would be such that we could facilitate a further teasing out of the difficulties that exist in respect of the definitions.  If it is the case that we have adopted and ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, then I am at pains to understand why the provisions have not been transposed.  I stand open to correction on this point and the Minister of State might clarify in his response why the issue at hand as it relates to this legislation has not been dealt with.  This is the basis on which we will support the legislation.<\/p><p>The culture that exists in the House now is such that individual Members propose legislation and it then goes through a process of legislative scrutiny.  In this way we can at least facilitate Committee Stage interaction so as to tease out the issues at hand and any difficulties that the Government might have.<\/p><p>It has come to our attention today that a Minister of State of the Government has been found by the Workplace Relations Commission to have discriminated against a woman under the Employment Equality Act 1998.  An article appeared today on the <i>independent.ie<\/i>website.  It speaks to the WRC ruling in which the adjudication officer found the comments of the Minister of State to be outmoded.  She stated, &quot;It was ill-advised of the Minister of State to have so pointedly obtained information that had nothing to do with this candidate&rsquo;s suitability for a position, and a position for which she had determined she was eligible to compete.&quot;  The adjudication officer found that &quot;the woman was put in a difficult situation in a job interview by reason of probing questions which went to the heart of her married and family life which historically could not be considered gender neutral questions&quot;.  We are talking about equality.<\/p><p>If it is the case that a Minister of State of the Government or his Department has been ordered to pay &euro;7,500 in compensation, then it is incumbent on the Minister of State to come before the House forthwith.  It seems clear to me that he is absolutely and utterly in breach of the law.  The Minister of State must now consider his position as a result.  I find it an absolutely shocking situation that a member of the Government is in breach of such fundamental legislation.  The decision and finding against him was unambiguous.  I believe it puts his position as a Minister of State in jeopardy, having been in breach of and having broken the law.  He needs to consider his position as a result of that breach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800047#YY00200","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1510161000,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I think I might be sharing time, but we will see.<\/p>  <p>  I will take up where Deputy Sherlock left off.  What the Minister of State said was incredible.  His explanation that he was trying to put the prospective employee at ease beggars belief.  Indeed, it beggars belief that a person would ask such questions of an interviewee, prefaced by \"I should not be asking you this but...\".  He then went on to ask whether she was a married woman, whether she had children and how old they were.  The idea that these questions would put an interviewee at ease is not really credible.  These are precisely the types of questions that do not put someone at ease.  I am not saying that the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, was going to discriminate against the woman in question, but women know that they experience discrimination on the basis of having children and domestic responsibilities.  This is done by employers, who, obviously, are not open about it.  At the very least, it was a poor lapse of judgment by the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan.  The D&aacute;il deserves an explanation for it.<\/p>  <p>  We support the Bill.  We support the adding to the grounds of discrimination a person's social and economic background and disadvantaged socioeconomic status.  I agree with the previous Deputy that part of what we are talking about is class discrimination, to put an accurate term on it.  This is simply a reality.  Class discrimination exists all around us from an individual level to societal level.  At individual level the examples are numerous and include feeling unable to put one's actual address on job applications or feeling discriminated against on the basis of a person's job, address, accent, clothing or whatever.  Class discrimination happens on a daily basis for individuals from working class backgrounds in this country.<\/p>  <p>  It also happens in a societal sense.  We live in a society and system that is built on class discrimination.  The health outcome disparity between better-off areas in Dublin and more disadvantaged areas of Dublin is striking.  The gap is striking because people are three times more likely to have cancer coming from a working class community than from a relatively affluent community.  This is because of a lack of a national health service that is free at the point of use.  Lifestyles issues can come from the pressures of not having access to resources, unlike better-off people.  This can make people far more likely to suffer from bad health.<\/p>  <p>  Another recent example is the Stardust fire.  Families of victims have been fighting for 36 years for justice for the 48 working class young people who were killed in the fire.  Those responsible have never been held responsible for what took place.  It was a by-product of the callous disregard for working class life.  When we talk about wealth and inequality and the kind of things we are seeing in the Paradise Papers and so on, we can see that it is societal as well.<\/p><p>I expected the Government would allow Second Stage to pass and have the Bill discussed in committee given the international pressure and consensus on this issue among non-governmental organisations, activists, etc.  It is poor form on its part that it is opposing the Bill in such a legalistic fashion.  It appears the Government will lose the vote on Second Stage on Thursday.  Will it then hide behind the money message and the issue of incidental expenses to prevent discussion of the Bill on Committee Stage?  If so, its position will be absolutely disgraceful and Fianna F&aacute;il should not stand for it.<\/p> <p> I raise a broader but related point.  Class discrimination is not a series of things that happen to individuals in capitalist society but a systemic issue.  It is what the system itself is built on and it is highly relevant given that yesterday was the 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution.  The constitution of the 1918 Russian Soviet Republic proclaims the need to abolish the exploitation of men by men and the division of the people into classes and to suppress exploiters, establish a socialist society and achieve the victory of socialism in all lands.  Unfortunately, Fianna F&aacute;il did not draw its inspiration for this Bill from that constitution, which was a by-product of a revolution of working people who overthrew the rule of exploiters and took wealth out of their hands to be productively used for the majority of people.<\/p> <p> While we favour the Bill and the outlawing if discrimination, what is fundamentally needed is systemic change to remove the discrimination facing working class people.  We should contrast the state founded in Russia 100 years ago with the State founded in Ireland a few years later following a brutal, repressive counterrevolution.  In Russia, people worked an eight-hour day, there was housing and jobs for all and social gains were made, including in women's rights and LGBT rights.  The Bolshevik government immediately separated church and state, whereas in this State, which was constructed by Fianna F&aacute;il and the forerunners of Fine Gael, the combined establishment parties acted to entrench the influence of the church in society, with the result that women still do not have bodily autonomy and proper sex education remains absent.<\/p> <p> Prior to Stalinist degeneration, elected representatives and officials in the new Soviet state lived on an average worker's wage.  We should compare this with Charlie Haughey and his Charvet shirts and, to a lesser degree, Ministers and Deputies living in relative luxury while working people suffered badly in the 1980s.  We hear people give out about class discrimination while wanting public representatives to live on salaries that are much greater than the average industrial wage.  Instead of the rule of working people, the State created here was based initially on the rule of big farmers and, subsequently, property developers and bankers.  Effectively, this State operates for the super-rich.  The consequence of this has been housing provision being put out of the reach of working class people, with 500,000 young people now forced to live at home and 3,000 children who are homeless.  This is acutely felt today.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il, even more clearly than Fine Gael, continues to be the developers' party.  It was in the Galway tent with the developers in the noughties, while young people had massive mortgages imposed on them in order that developers would profit.  These developers are benefitting from the housing crisis for working class people and the discrimination they face in accessing housing.<\/p> <p> The crisis in mental health has been caused by the capitalist crisis.  Mental health problems have increased by 22% in the past five years.  Incredibly, they increased by 122% among young women aged between 13 and 22 years in the same period.  The most striking recent example of discrimination and inequality in society has been the publication of the Paradise Papers, which once again lift the lid on how the super-rich and big business, the parasites on society, steal, squander and hoard the wealth that working class people create.  The Russian constitution of 1918 should give inspiration as to what should be done with the wealth of the 1%.  It should be seized and taken into democratic public ownership so that the needs of all can be met. <\/p> <p> We support the Bill but we have no illusion that it will fundamentally end the class discrimination on which the capitalist system is based.  In the words of Jeremy Corbyn, it is a \"rigged system\", one which is based on making as much profit and amassing as much wealth as possible for the 1%.  To do away with discrimination, we need a democratic socialist society in which everyone can develop to his or her full potential and we have real change and equality in a society built on solidarity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800047#YY00300","speaker":"1433","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510161600,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murphy for observing the time limit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800048#ZZ00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1510161600,"counter":538,"content":"<p>While I do not have any hesitation in supporting the Bill, like the previous speaker, I am under no illusion that it will create equality.  The two Acts to which previous speakers referred which prohibit discrimination on nine grounds are not adequate to prevent discrimination on socioeconomic grounds.<\/p>  <p>  To respond to the Minister of State, having read the Bill, I also note problems with the text, specifically the general nature of the legislation.  However, that is not a good reason to reject the Bill at this point.  While the Minister of State set out many of the problems with the Bill, he ignored countries which have introduced this type of legislation.  If he chooses to set out problems, it is incumbent on him to consider the countries which have successfully introduced legislation and to consider the issue of rights.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire referred to our obligations under Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  I do not like repetition but as has been pointed out, the recent overview of equality legislation in Europe prepared by the European network of legal experts noted that 20 of 35 European countries have already introduced legislation to prevent discrimination on grounds related to socioeconomic status.  As a member of the European Union - the Government repeatedly boasts that Ireland is the best in class when it comes to the EU - I would have expected the Government to have studied the best legislation in place on the Continent and at least placed it before the House.  Belgium, Hungary, Croatia and other countries have legislation in place and France is working on similar legislation.  I will not waste my time listing all the countries with this type of legislation in place.<\/p>  <p>  Discrimination on any ground prevents full participation in society.  There is an onus on a Government when a Bill of this nature comes before the House to set out its pluses and minuses.  I believe the Government has set its mind fundamentally against giving rights on socioeconomic grounds at any level.  I am pleased to note the Minister of State is shaking his head.  My colleague, Deputy Thomas Pringle, who is unfortunately not present and would love to participate in this debate, used his Private Members' time to introduce legislation on socioeconomic rights, which was rejected out of hand by the Government.  Deputy O'Callaghan may wish to correct me but I believe Fianna F&aacute;il also opposed Deputy Pringle's legislation. <\/p>  <p>  Coincidentally, one year ago, I asked the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to outline the steps she was taking to introduce socioeconomic status as a discrimination ground following legislative and case law trends across Europe.  In her reply, the T&aacute;naiste stated: \"I do not have plans at this stage to introduce socio-economic status as a discrimination ground in equality legislation.\"  She also noted that the Oireachtas did not support a Private Members' Bill which sought to insert into the Constitution a statement relating to socioeconomic grounds and clearly indicated that the Government had no intention of going down this route, either in the Constitution or in legislation, because she believed the best way to introduce equality was through policies.  While I happen to agree with her on the issue of policies, the Government's policies have caused discrimination on the ground.  Inequality is built into its housing strategy, the privatisation of health services and so on.<\/p>  <p>  I am afraid I am left with no option but to agree with Fianna F&aacute;il on this Bill.  I do not believe we will solve any problem without considering the policies which the T&aacute;naiste and then Minister for Justice and Equality honestly referred to in November 2016.  Unfortunately, this Government and its predecessor have built discrimination into their policies. <\/p>  <p>  I propose to address the comments made regarding local authority houses and estates.  I cringe when I hear the much repeated mantra about deprivation, criminality and anti-social behaviour on local authority housing estates because it is not accurate.  Criminality exists at every level of society.<\/p><p>We have had the bankers but we do not use the same language at all when it comes to people outside a local authority estate.  I ask Members of the D&aacute;il to be careful in their use of language in regard to local authority estates.<\/p> <p> Many of the problems in local authority estates have been caused by the negligence of successive managers and staff at local authority level and by Government policy in failing to provide enough money and allowing problems get out of hand in a small number of estates rather than dealing with them.  I have also seen local authority apartments knocked that were far superior to any of the private accommodation that has gone up in a middle-class area in Galway city.<\/p> <p> I cringe and react when I hear this language used repeatedly in terms of deprivation.  One has to ask the question, why did some areas have this label applied to them?  What was the role of the local authority or of the Government?  What was the reason for inaction?  <\/p> <p> While I welcome and support the legislation and look forward to detailed scrutiny of it and teasing out the problems, we certainly need to look at Government policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800048#ZZ00300","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510162200,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Bogfaimid ar aghaidh anois go dt&iacute; na Rural Independents.

As the explanatory memorandum for this Bill makes clear, statutory intervention to expand the protection of both Acts to prohibit discrimination on the basis of disadvantaged socioeconomic or social background would involve an amendment to the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that persons can no longer be discriminated against on the basis that they come from a disadvantaged socioeconomic area or background.  For instance, if this Bill was enacted, employers could not discriminate against a job applicant because he or she came from a disadvantaged local authority estate or an area that is associated with higher levels of criminality or anti-social behaviour.  Furthermore, it would not be permissible for service providers to discriminate against people because of where they live.  I welcome that.  Surely this is something we can all support.<\/p>  <p>  I have questions, however, around where the burden of proof lies in determining whether discrimination has actually occurred.  There are also concerns around how we strike the appropriate balance in this area.  That is delicate and difficult for employers.  If we are forever expanding the grounds on which discrimination can be claimed, then it will become almost impossible for an employer to legitimately refuse to employ someone.  I hope some of these issues can be teased out during this debate and when the Bill proceeds to Committee Stage and some amendments are tabled, and I hope to table some.<\/p>  <p>  I support Deputy O'Callaghan in putting forward this legislation.  In regard to the Acts of 1998 and 2000, respectively, one is talking about nearly 20 years ago.  It is timely that we would have some movement here.<\/p>  <p>  There is a cry, daily if not hourly, for all kinds of legislation on equality and we have had referendums and everything else.  There has been significant emphasis put on such matters.  Where is the fairness here in terms of the most basic human right - the right to have a job, to work and to self-determination?  I believe people are entitled to a fair day's pay for a fair day's work but they have to get the work.  I agree with the previous speaker, the Acting Cathaoirleach, Deputy Connolly, who is double jobbing.  Like myself, she is able to go from the floor of the House to the Chair go tapaidh.  Fair dues to her.  I agree some people suffer discrimination.  The best of people live on council estates in different parts of the country.  It should not be because of where one comes from.  We have to be fair.  I am an employer.  I suppose I should declare that.  I have a staff.  I normally do not have to conduct interviews because people come looking for work and I take them on if they are suitable.  The question of where they come from never enters into it in my book because in south Tipperary we know most people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800049#AAA00700","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1510162200,"counter":546,"content":"<p>As long as they are from Tipperary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800049#AAA00800","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1510162200,"counter":547,"content":"<p>Not quite.

I am only making the point that businesses cannot work without good employees but one must have respect for employees as well.  It is a two-way street.  If we are discriminating just because of where people come from, where they were born, who their parents were or whatever, that is wrong at a time when we have such a plethora of calls for equality on this, that and the other.

In other areas there is too much legislation but with the 20-year gap here, this is a timely review.  I hope that when it is teased out in committee, amendments have been tabled and it passes through the House, it will not languish somewhere as has happened with some legislation, where it gets forgotten about and never gets implemented.

In the interest of so-called new politics, it would be advisable to let it go to Committee Stage.  If there are elements that are a problem, Deputy O'Callaghan is probably willing to listen.<\/p>  <p>  Regardless of where a person comes from, it is a matter of whether he or she is able to do a job.  Members come from different backgrounds.  If one is able to do a job in any walk of life, no matter where one comes from, it should not make a difference.  It is important that employers have that motto because at the end of the day it is about doing the job.  It is not about where one comes from, where one lives, what one does, who one's father or mother was, or anything like that.<\/p>  <p>  There is another matter that needs to be addressed.  There are people, especially those with disabilities, trying to get work who, unfortunately, if they go one hour over this so-called threshold, are afraid they may lose their allowance.  We need to address that.  It is the same for those who are unemployed, especially in parts of rural Ireland, who might go to work for someone but it takes so long to get back on benefits if it does not work out, it is not enticing enough.  We need to bring in a new system to ensure that we accommodate such persons, especially those with disabilities and the unemployed, so that they are not afraid to go to work.<\/p>  <p>  In many rural areas, there may be summer work or seasonal work but the fear is that if one takes it up and it does not work out or it does not last the full year, two years or whatever, one is caught and is back to square one.

I know that it is not personal and that a departmental official would have assisted in drafting the speech, but as always, it focused on the many reasons not to do something.  The Minister of State reeled off a series of examples, some of which were extreme, and asked what we would do in this or that instance.  The focus of the Government should be on finding reasons to do things rather than looking for ways to undermine or throw them under the bus.  Sadly, the Minister of State's contribution was not in keeping with his normal commitment to the House and his normal contributions on various subjects which are always so thoughtful.  I regret that whoever penned the particular response to this most thoughtful Bill got out on the wrong side of the bed.  We should be seeking to embrace equality, rather than undermining it or kicking the can down the road.  Clearly, it is going to be passed and we are putting it into purgatory for Bills.  No doubt it will be put in the room that stores all of the reports on unbalanced regional development about which I have harped on in this House and Seanad &Eacute;ireann for many years, but I would like to think this Bill will see the light of day.<\/p> <p> Another point about more general equality issues is that we have a lot of equality legislation in place, to some of which Deputy Jim O'Callaghan alluded, but we do not follow or enforce it.  I have come across instances where the State is inadvertently sponsoring discrimination against people.  One example I would like to bring to the Minister of State's attention relates to protocols within the Department of Education and Skills governing the process under which teachers are transferred on particular grounds.  When challenged, there are protocols to outline the procedure which is followed but, following court cases, they are at the discretion of education and training boards, ETBs, and other governing bodies.  That is regrettable because it discriminates against people on the basis of mental health.  There are legal cases that I can bring to the Minister of State's attention privately on this matter.  <\/p> <p> As I do not want to eat into the time available for my colleagues, I simply ask the Minister of State to take on board those few brief points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800049#AAA01100","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510162800,"counter":551,"content":"<p>As my colleagues have outlined, the Bill seeks to extend the remit of the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of disadvantaged socioeconomic or social background.  While both laws already protect against discrimination on nine grounds, including disability, and the European Union's equal treatment directives require members states to introduce equality legislation, it is my contention that persons with disabilities require extra protection.  I have previously referenced in this Chamber the repport of the Social Inclusion Forum which shows that those in receipt of disability payments are at various stages of poverty and deprivation to the extent that their socioeconomic status is affected in almost all circumstances.  This is certainly a contributing factor when they present for interviews or transfer from accommodation.  <\/p><p>Goal No. 10  of the United Nations' sustainable development goals adopted in September 2015 aims to reduce inequality within and among countries.  Its targets include empowering the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of economic or other status.

However, those who are already in the system find themselves lagging even further behind the general population and need the extra protection and security.<\/p><p>  I am conscious of the fact that I am focusing on one aspect of the Bill.  However, as spokesperson for Fianna F&aacute;il on disability issues and given the limited amount of time available, I decided to go down that route.  It is important that persons with disabilities be afforded every protection, particularly in the light of the fact that we still await formal ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, something for which I have been calling since the Government took office.  I was told this time last year that the convention would be ratified by the end of 2016.  Now I am being told that it will be ratified before the end of this year, but in the meantime the Minister of State with responsibility who is a member of the Government is talking about heading off to North Korea to solve the world's problems.  It must be noted that even though North Korea is a dictatorship, it has actually ratified the UN convention and that we are lagging very far behind.  I ask the Minister of State to have a word with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and ask him to stay put and get on with completing his business here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800050#BBB00200","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1510162800,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I commend my colleagues, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan and Fiona O&rsquo;Loughlin, for their work on this Bill and their commitment to fight discrimination.  As a republican party, Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to fighting discrimination and inequality.  We have a proven track record in advancing equality proposals.  The two major parts of equality legislation in Ireland were introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il.  However, we believe the current legislation needs to be strengthened to continue the fight against inequality.<\/p>  <p>  A growing problem in recent years is discrimination based on socioeconomic or social background.  Many people living in disadvantaged areas have found it difficult to secure jobs simply because they live in a certain area.  Their applications are not being considered on merit and instead they face arbitrary barriers which have a detrimental impact on their lives.  This form of inequality needs to be tackled.  Given the current housing crisis, many people are no longer able to live in their area of choice.  It is now determined by cost and how much a person is earning.  Someone's address should not determine whether he or she is suitable to be employed.  Being rejected after a job interview can severely dent someone's confidence.  Many people I have met during the years tortuously dwell on being turned down.  Rejection is very unpleasant but to lose out on a job because of where one lives is a bitter pill to swallow.  If someone is suitably qualified and able to perform a job, his or her address should not and must not be a determining factor.  <\/p>  <p>  If the Bill were to be enacted, employers would not be able to discriminate against a job applicant because he or she came from what would be perceived as a disadvantaged address or an area associated with higher levels of criminality or anti-social behaviour.  Similarly, children applying for admission to schools could not face discrimination on the basis of their address.  In the past few years school boards of management have come under increasing pressure because schools are oversubscribed.  I particularly welcome the Admission to Schools Bill which explicitly bans discrimination in school admissions.  Every school must be welcoming of every young person, regardless of his or her race, ability or disability and now address.<\/p>  <p>  There is evidence of significant discrimination on the ground of socioeconomic status in key areas such as employment, education and housing.  The economic crisis has exacerbated this discrimination and the ensuing inequality.  The Bill aims to address this issue.  The current legislation sets out nine grounds on which discrimination is prohibited, namely, gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community.  Ireland is changing, as we saw clearly when the marriage equality referendum took place and a majority voted that marriage could be contracted by two persons without distinction as to their sex.  The Marriage Act 2015 amended marriage law to give effect to the constitutional amendment.<\/p>  <p>  Persons who are living in poverty or poor neighbourhoods and who are unemployed and relying on social protection payments experience discrimination based on their socioeconomic status.  It creates a vicious circle from which it is difficult to escape.  This perpetuates their disadvantaged status.  Some of these instances of discrimination can only be tackled effectively by using a socioeconomic status ground.  It is accepted that this ground would be more difficult to police than many of those mentioned in the legislation.  Nonetheless, the very fact that it would be contained in legislation is important as it would send a strong message to employers and service providers that discrimination of this nature was not permitted.<\/p><p>International and European human rights organisations have increasingly called for the introduction of a social origin ground in equality legislation.  The Bill aims to act on these recommendations by formally forbidding discrimination based on socioeconomic and social background.  Fianna F&aacute;il recognises that enhancing social conditions and creating better opportunities for people are the fundamental methods of supporting disadvantaged communities.  The Bill is just one proposal to tackle inequality and break down barriers for those living in disadvantaged areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800050#BBB00300","speaker":"1220","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510163400,"counter":554,"content":"<p>The debate has confirmed the support across the House for ensuring individuals or groups in Irish society will not in any way be disadvantaged by virtue of their socioeconomic status when seeking employment or access to services.  I can confirm that the Government strongly shares that view.  However, I do not believe the Bill provides the answer to the challenge.<\/p>  <p>  Adding a new ground of socioeconomic status to equality legislation would be inherently complex.  It has been attempted on a number of occasions without success.  I remind the D&aacute;il that the question of including socioeconomic status as a ground of discrimination in equality legislation was examined and rejected by the Fianna F&aacute;il Government of 2002-07, as well as by the recent Fine Gael-Labour Party Government.  The reasons given for rejection by both Governments remain as valid today as they were then.  In this context, the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, referred to the UCC report of 2004 which confirmed the extreme difficulty in providing proof of discrimination on this basis.  The International Labour Organization Committee of Experts has also noted that the problem of discrimination based on &ldquo;social origin&rdquo; is &ldquo;unquestionably one of the most difficult to define&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The inclusion of such a ground in equality legislation is relatively new at European level and definitions vary between EU member states.  Some such as Belgium and Denmark have introduced the concept of \"social origin\" in their equality legislation.  Others such as Latvia are using the concepts of \"property\" and \"place of residence\" to address discrimination on socioeconomic grounds.  Meanwhile, Lithuania uses the term \"social status\".  The application of such concepts in case law at EU level is still in its infancy.  Equinet, the network of equality bodies, has indicated that equality bodies are only now beginning to develop greater clarity on how the new ground could be operationalised.  We should be careful about moving down a road where concepts, definitions and applicability are still very much in an area of uncertainty, lack clarity and are somewhat in flux.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, indicated, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s Bill proposes a definition of \"disadvantaged socioeconomic status\"&rsquo; which, in essence, is ambiguous.  That ambiguity creates the risk of exponentially increasing the number of potential claims under equality legislation.  The potential impact on the public and private sectors could be significant.  If the number of claims were to rise exponentially, it could impose an undue burden on business, employers and public service providers.  Care must be taken to ensure measures do not go beyond what is reasonable, proportionate and, above all, necessary.  Moreover, as the Minister of State pointed out, a general principle is that statute law should be certain, clear and precise in order that it can be easily interpreted by the person whom a law such as the one that has been proposed seeks to protect.  It should also be easily interpreted by the courts in order that employers, service providers and businesses are clearly aware of their obligations under law.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has taken a series of measures to strengthen the equality legislation and target specific economic areas such as access to housing.  As the Minister of State said, the Government brought forward the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 which prohibits discrimination in the letting of residential accommodation on the basis that a person is or is not in receipt of rent supplement or the housing assistance payment.  The Government considered that this was a clear instance where there was concrete evidence of discrimination and where amending the equality legislation would achieve the objective of ending such discrimination.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, the Government brought forward the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 which established the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and set it on a sound footing, independent of the Government, answerable to the Oireachtas and well funded.  The Act also introduced the concept of a public sector equality and human rights duty.  That duty imposes an obligation on public bodies to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect the human rights of staff and service users.  It provides a means of addressing structural issues and developing the capacity within the public service to promote equality and human rights.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is working with public sector bodies to embed the duty into their work and realise the potential of this important provision in law.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, A Programme for a Partnership Government has committed the Government to developing the process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights.  The Oireachtas is playing a key role in that process.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has been given a specific mandate to support this work.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is working actively with a range of Departments to develop their capacity in the area of gender budgeting.  Such tools have the potential to target structural disadvantage in an effective manner.  Their benefit is that they do not require an individual victim to go through the process of taking an equality claim and undergoing the difficult process of proving discrimination.  Instead, they promote the process of structural change at organisational level.<\/p>  <p>  Equally, the equality legislation may not be the most effective legislative instrument to combat exploitation or tackle disadvantage.  The enactment of legislation focused on a specific problem issue may be more effective.  Socioeconomic disadvantage may be caused by working conditions.  One of the Government&rsquo;s legislative priorities is to address the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and to strengthen the regulation of precarious employment.  This was a commitment in the programme for Government and the draft legislation which was approved by the Government earlier this year aims to fulfil it.  The draft legislation aims to address a number of issues which have been identified as being areas where current employment rights legislation can be strengthened.  Perhaps this would be a more appropriate way of enhancing the rights of people disadvantaged by socioeconomic status as there is a particular emphasis on low-paid, vulnerable persons in the workforce.<\/p>  <p>  The legislative proposals will address the following key areas: ensuring employees are better informed about the nature of their employment arrangements and, in particular, their core terms at an early stage of their employment; strengthening the provisions around minimum payments to lower paid or vulnerable workers who may be called in to work for a period but not provided with any work on their arrival; prohibiting zero hour contracts, except in cases of genuine casual work, emergency cover or short-term relief work for that employer; ensuring workers on low-hour contracts who consistently work more hours each week than provided for in their contracts of employment are entitled to be placed in a band of hours that reflects the reality of the hours they have worked over an extended period; and reinforcing the anti-victimisation provisions for employees who try to invoke a right under these proposals.  The proposals are the result of extensive consultations which included a public consultation process following the University of Limerick study of zero hour and low-hour contracts.  They were also informed by a detailed dialogue process with IBEC and ICTU over a period of several months.<\/p>  <p>  The challenge of addressing socioeconomic disadvantage requires policy solutions as the primary response.  Greater socioeconomic equality can be achieved through greater participation in education, effective labour market activation measures and other social supports and the creation of increased employment opportunities.<\/p><p> Much progress has been made in the field of education in the past two decades.  For example, only 68.2% of students in the 2001 DEIS cohort stayed in school up to and including leaving certificate.  That number rose to 82.7% for the 2009 cohort, with more than 93% of those students completing the junior certificate.  The DEIS plan has set ambitious goals for 2019 and expects to see a number of successes in higher education enrolments.<\/p> <p> Similarly, progress has been made in creating employment opportunities for citizens and migrant workers.  In March 2011, 441,000 persons were on the live register.  That figure has essentially halved.  The corresponding figure for October 2017 was 236,000, down more than 40,000 in one year.  Just as importantly, the number of long-term claimants decreased by more than 23,000, or 18%, in the same period.  These live register figures confirm that people in every field of employment, regardless of skill set and postcode and including those with professional and technical backgrounds, are getting employment.  Employment opportunities are opening up for all.  The reduction in numbers on the live register was greater for plant and machinery operatives - down 16.3% - than for those in professional and technical occupations, which figure decreased by 10%.<\/p> <p> For many reasons, the Government believes it is premature to proceed with this ambiguous and flawed legislation.  I must recommend against its acceptance while stating that my colleagues in government and I strongly share the view that no individual or group should be subjected to discrimination.  I will keep the House updated on our extensive programme of work tackling disadvantage and providing opportunities for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800051#CCC00200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510164000,"counter":556,"content":"<p>T&aacute;imid ag dul ar ais ar&iacute;s go dt&iacute; Fianna F&aacute;il.

My party and I are committed to fighting discrimination and inequality at all levels in society.  To that end, we introduced the Employment Equality Act and Equal Status Act in 1998 and 2000, respectively.  With this Bill, these prove Fianna F&aacute;il's commitment to making merit the only ground on which to assess someone's suitability for employment.<\/p>  <p>  Current legislation exposes an area of inequality that needs to be resolved.  With the introduction of this Bill, it will be established that an employer cannot discriminate based on disadvantaged socioeconomic status.  Regardless of someone's socioeconomic disadvantage arising from poverty, level or source of income, homelessness, place of residence or family background, an employer will not, and should not, be able to put one person above another.  If passed, the law will ensure that people are employed based on merit alone.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to contribute on the Bill, as it tackles a problem that has been festering for many years.  With this law in place, it will be a clear breach of the law to discriminate between job applicants based on, for example, the addresses on their CVs.  A person's family background will not affect his or her job prospects.  Someone who has lost a home will not face discrimination when applying for a job.  When such cases arise in County Wexford, they are difficult to witness.  Bright, hard working and determined people are losing out because the law does not protect them.<\/p>  <p>  These arbitrary symbols will not affect people's employment if this legislation is passed.  The Bill's strength is its ability to nip the problems facing those living in disadvantaged areas and those who are unemployed in the same manner.  The Bill will help to stamp out the vicious cycle facing many people who, having been turned down for jobs for discriminatory reasons time and again, are often forced to stay in poverty traps.  It gives young people hope that they will be able to press ahead, climb the ladder in the workforce and sketch out life's purpose.<\/p>  <p>  It is a credit to my party colleagues, Deputies O'Loughlin and O'Callaghan, that the Bill has come to the floor of the D&aacute;il.  International human rights organisations have long called for the introduction of a social origin ground.  This Bill is just one step on the long road to breaking down the barriers faced by those living in disadvantaged areas or from disadvantaged backgrounds.  This Bill is about sending out a message to employers that discrimination in the workplace is illegal.  Ultimately, the legislation's impact will be telling for those who feel the law and politics are not on their side.  This Fianna F&aacute;il Bill shows how that is changing bit by bit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800052#DDD00400","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1510164000,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I will conclude by thanking all Members who contributed to this debate.

I am not seeking to steamroll through our legislation just for the sake of getting it passed.  Rather, it is an advancement of our equality laws.  Care needs to be taken in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and the Minister of State asserted that the Bill was ambiguous and would be difficult to enforce.  It must first be acknowledged that both seem to recognise that there is an issue, namely, that people are being discriminated against unfairly on the basis of what I have described as their disadvantaged socioeconomic background.  I accept that this is a more difficult ground to police and enforce than is the case with the nine other grounds.  Regarding the gender ground, for instance, it is clear if a person is male or female.  The point being made by the Government is that it is more difficult to assess whether a person is from a disadvantaged socioeconomic background.  I accept that, but a part of the responsibility of legislators is to try to develop and advance the law.  Pay discrimination on the ground of gender was deemed unacceptable previously.  We recognised that in the 1970s, but we need to keep developing our equality laws.  All constitutional rights must be updated.  They are dynamic.  Deputies have a responsibility to ensure that constitutional rights are recognised in statutory frameworks to ensure they take into account ongoing difficult social circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  There is a recognition in the House that people are being discriminated against because of where they come from and their backgrounds.  I have tried in the Bill to give as best a definition as I can to describe \"disadvantaged socioeconomic status\", but let us be clear, it will be more difficult than describing gender.  However, just because something is difficult does not mean it is something we should not attempt to do.  The definition that Deputy O'Loughlin and I have set out refers to a particular identifiable status of social or economic disadvantage - this is not difficult to understand - resulting from poverty, level or source of income, homelessness, place of residence or family background.  These are not difficult to decipher or interpret.<\/p>  <p>  The most important aspect of equality legislation is that it is stated in statute that one cannot discriminate against people on grounds of race, gender or sexual orientation.  It would be an addition to our equality legislation were we to include in that disadvantaged socioeconomic status.  It is difficult to prove breaches of any of these equality grounds.  If someone decides not to employ a person because she is a woman, it is difficult to prove, although some of the recent circumstances cited by the Ministers seem to have made that easier.  In practice, it is difficult to prove any breach of these grounds, but that is not a reason for not doing this.<\/p><p> Deputy Connolly mentioned a number of points to which I wish to reply.  She stated that it is not appropriate to keep referring to local authority estates and areas as being areas of deprivation and areas where there is criminality or antisocial behaviour.  I fully agree with her.  What is being referred to for the purposes of this Bill is the fact that people are discriminating against individuals because they perceive, wrongly, that from where they come are areas of antisocial behaviour or where there are high levels of criminality.  That is the reason we are mentioning it.  It is the discriminator who is wrongly relying on those grounds.<\/p> <p> We also must recognise the report recently prepared by Kieran Mulvey on foot of the Government's request into what was happening in north inner city Dublin.  One of his findings was that there were high levels of unemployment and social deprivation in the area.  We cannot hide away from the fact there are local authority areas which need significant State investment and the people there need some support.  The Bill would give those people some support so that they could say that the State and its legislators are on their side and are trying to do something to deal with the discrimination which they accurately perceive exists.<\/p> <p> Deputy Connolly referred to the fact that a number of months ago Deputy Pringle introduced a Bill which proposed to amend the Constitution by putting into it social and economic rights.  She suggested that Fianna F&aacute;il voted against the Bill.  She is right, but that Bill was different from what is being put before the House today.  This Bill would give effect to the principle of equality in Article 40.1 of our Constitution.  Deputy Pringle was perfectly entitled to put forward a Bill.  He wanted to put socioeconomic right into the Constitution so that they could thereafter be interpreted and applied by the Judiciary.  It is our responsibility to make laws for the people of this country, and I urge people to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800052#DDD00900","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510164600,"counter":565,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1510164600,"counter":566,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 9 November 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800053#EEE00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of D\u00e1il","time":1510164600,"counter":567,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800053#EEE00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1510164600,"counter":568,"content":"<p>Moltar, d'ainneoin aon n&iacute; i r&uacute;n na D&aacute;la inn&eacute;, m&aacute;s rud &eacute; go dtiocfaidh an dara ch&eacute;im den Bhille Oidhreachta 2016 chun cr&iacute;che um tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na, n&iacute; tos&oacute;idh an D&aacute;il ag 10 a.m. ach go gcasfaimid le ch&eacute;ile ag 12 me&aacute;nlae.<\/p>  <p>  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in the resolution of the D&aacute;il of yesterday, that, in the event of Second Stage of the Heritage Bill 2016 being brought to a conclusion this evening, the D&aacute;il shall not meet at 10 a.m. tomorrow but shall meet at 12 noon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800053#EEE00500","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1510164600,"counter":569,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

A survey of US and Canadian physicians revealed that disclosure attitudes were similar in both countries, with 98% agreeing that serious adverse events should be disclosed and 78% supporting the disclosure of minor adverse events to patients.  In another study, 99% of paediatricians endorsed reporting serious adverse events to patients' families.<\/p><p>Despite this, evidence from the UK and the US has shown that before open disclosure policies were introduced, only around one-third of harmful events were disclosed to patients.  Evidence from a study in the UK which examined what has happened there since it introduced a legal duty of candour found broad support among those interviewed.  One doctor said:<\/p><blockquote>I have learned that being open is also quite a self-preserving thing to do.  The worst thing is if the patients get it into their heads that there is some sort of cover up going on, then they get the bit between their teeth and solicitors get involved and it is all very difficult.<\/blockquote><p>Another doctor put it this way:<\/p><blockquote>If you are very honest and straightforward and treat the patients right, then often they take a generous view towards the mistake as opposed to getting very litigious about it which, I think, they are more inclined to do if there is a big cover-up and people are not honest.<\/blockquote><p>With mandatory open disclosure for serious incidents, everybody wins.  It is better for health care staff, patients and the health service as a whole.  It would very likely reduce costly and drawn-out litigation.  It will not place too heavy a burden on health care staff particularly if, as we are told, the HSE and NPSO are committed to training and encouraging a culture of openness without blame.

The House will be aware that Part 4 of the Bill, as initiated, provided for the voluntary open disclosure of patient safety incidents and that an amendment was made to section 12 on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 29 June last to instead provide for mandatory open disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 31 seeks to return to the original intent of voluntary open disclosure in this Bill.  The set of new amendments brought forward by Deputies Daly and Wallace for consideration today clearly recognise the burden that would be placed on the system by making all patient safety incidents, including near-misses, the subject of mandatory open disclosure.  The amendments seek to change the definition of a patient safety incident and introduce a significant modification to the approach to open disclosure, creating a two-tier system in respect of patient safety incidents.<\/p>  <p>  Category A incidents which result in the death of a patient, major or moderate harm or prolonged psychological harm to the patient would be subject to mandatory disclosure provisions.<\/p><p>Category B incidents relate to incidents that have caused less serious harm, which is defined as harm which does not meet the criteria for major harm, moderate harm or prolonged psychological harm.  Category B incidents also include no-harm incidents and near misses.  Category B incidents would be subject to voluntary disclosure provisions.<\/p> <p> The amendments are extensive and detailed, and they reflect the attention and commitment that Deputies Daly and Wallace have brought to open disclosure as a critical patient safety issue.  More time is needed, however, to consult on the changes to the meaning of \"patient safety incident\".  Creating a two-tiered system of patient safety incidents for open disclosure in the health service without having fully explored the implications of the definitions proposed creates a real challenge for assurance of implementability of the legislation.  Moreover, time is needed to consider the legislative implications that may arise in the open disclosure provisions of the Bill as a consequence to the amendments.  I say with the greatest respect to the Deputies opposite that the last thing any of us want is legislation that is open to challenge.  It appears, with the import of these amendments, that not only would the legislation be open to challenge but it is wide open.  This would defeat the joint aim that we all have to promote open disclosure and learning from patient safety incidents when they occur.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Health has given serious reflection to the Deputies' proposals and agrees there are merits in progressing legislation regarding mandatory open disclosure for a defined set or list of serious events.  The Minister's view is that a reasonable approach at this time is to proceed with voluntary open disclosure in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill as initiated.  Provision for mandatory reporting of serious events to the appropriate external agency is already included in the general scheme of the health information and patient safety Bill.  He is proposing a rescoping of these approved patient safety elements to provide for an addition of mandatory open disclosure to accompany the list of reportable serious patient safety events in the health information and patient safety Bill.  At this stage, and subject to Government approval and legal advice, it is envisaged that such a list would be the subject of ministerial regulations and could be tested and amended as necessary.<\/p> <p> The Minister would welcome the opportunity to work with Deputies Daly and Wallace, as well as other Deputies and stakeholders in the preparation of these legislative proposals.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, also commits to examining all options to expedite the patient safety provisions currently within the health information and patient safety Bill.  With this commitment in mind, I am proposing amendment No. 31, which amends section 12 of the Bill, to provide for voluntary open disclosure as was the original intent of the legislation when published and debated.<\/p> <p> It is important to provide some further context but we can come back to it.  The goal of the Minister for Health from the outset has been to create a safe space where there can and should be full disclosure of the facts surrounding a patient safety incident and the implications, if any, for the patient&rsquo;s care and treatment.  There has been considerable deliberation of the advantages of a mandatory or voluntary open disclosure framework.  That took place before the Minister for Health came to the view that a voluntary approach offered the best way forward in this Bill.<\/p> <p> There are issues of real significance here within my remit and that of the Minister for Health, who proposes we return to the original wording of section 12.  I ask the Deputies to appreciate and understand why we should accept amendment No. 31.  I am not in any way questioning the sincerity or the desirability of the proposals from the Deputies opposite.  I am very concerned about the import of this legislation should we go down the road of making these amendments as they are proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800053#EEE01200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510165200,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I have a few questions, further to the Minister's clarification.  Will the Minister make the exploration of the impact of a potential mandatory open disclosure or will it be the Minister for Health?  Will it be a combined effort?  Is there a timeline for it?  When Deputy O'Callaghan met officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, they said work would be ongoing.  I would like to have a timeline.<\/p>  <p>  I suppose there is a contradiction as the Minister mentioned a potential challenge.  At the justice committee earlier today we heard about a definite challenge to another general scheme of legislation that the Department appeared to reject.  Both Mr. TJ McIntyre and Mr. Simon McGarr mentioned a definite challenge to a general scheme, having challenged the legislation previously.  A potential challenge should not be the simplistic factor given by the Minister for rejecting what are constructive amendments from Deputies Wallace and Daly.  They are trying to go beyond a cultural change by putting forward a practical framework they feel would go further.  It would bring what Deputy Wallace has stated are changes with the studies, surveys or scientific approach that have brought a positive outcome internationally around mandatory open disclosure.  The Department and the Minister have serious concerns about the legislation with amendments as currently proposed.  When will this proposed legislation come about?  Will the Minister outline some of the concerns submitted to the Minister and the Department?  Before discussion of these amendments on Committee Stage, was there an intention to go further than voluntary open disclosure?  Will the Government park the disclosure issue at the proposed amended position.  It is important for us to know.<\/p>  <p>  I take the Minister's word around voluntary open disclosure and he has said it is the appropriate position now but without future legislative proposals and a timeline for that, the matter is really being kicked to touch.  I do not want to see that because a cultural change will not happen without a strong legislative framework to drive the process.  It would be better for the patient, the health service and the health care profession to have open, honest and transparent disclosures of whatever an incident might be anyway.  Leaving this parked as a voluntary process for the long term would not achieve the cultural change we all want to see in this House.  I would like the Minister to answer those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800054#FFF00200","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1510165200,"counter":578,"content":"<p>There are a couple of issues.<\/p><p>The Minister said we were introducing a two-tier system.  That was not our choice.  We succeeded in getting an amendment passed which meant that all reporting was mandatory.  We believe this is absolutely necessary to guard against the cultural deficit that exists inside the HSE in particular.  However, having met officials from the Department of Health, who had concerns about the impact of that, we agreed at their behest that we would adopt the British model and zone in on the more serious incidents.  It is disingenuous to use a gesture that we made in order to deal with the Department's concerns as a reason for saying our amendments are not fit for purpose.  <\/p> <p> It is also illustrative that we were contacted by the Department yesterday, who said that the definitions we had were quite good and that there was nothing wrong with them per s&eacute; but that our proposal would be moved in a different piece of legislation.  I have a couple of problems with that.  The idea of what we are proposing being open to challenge was not introduced previously.  This is a new argument.  Departmental officials agreed with us.  It was an amicable meeting and there were no hard and fast sides to the debate, but rather there was an agreement that what we should be striving towards is a position of the best open disclosure possible.  The departmental officials agreed with us that the evidence was not there to support the contention that it is game over in terms of voluntary disclosure.  On the other hand we have good examples of mandatory reporting in other jurisdictions.  The Minister, at the eleventh hour, is saying the Department of Health will introduce legislation in the future.  The problem we have is that five months have passed since Committee Stage.  We made ourselves available at every turn to meet the Department.  There is no meat on the Minister's proposals for how this will be dealt with.  It is civil service time, and we have lost a valuable opportunity.

The Minister says it is more suitable for the Department of Health, and that may be the case.  We respect that.  However, this is the legislation before us now and it is the only legislative provision this Oireachtas will have the chance to consider in its lifetime.  That is fair to say, based on the length of time it takes to get anything moving in here.  The issues are far too serious when we consider some of the catastrophic incidents which have occurred in our health service, and the appalling pain and extra hardship that was put on families in trying to get access to information.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister said that voluntary disclosure is the best way to deal with open disclosure.  That viewpoint is not supported by evidence.  It is an opinion, and the Minister is entitled to that opinion.   There is a substantial body of evidence to say that in places like the UK the mandatory reporting mechanism has been successful.  In the face of an organisation that is culturally challenged and instinctively covers up problems, I believe reporting has to be mandatory.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister said that the Department of Health will immediately examine it.  My response to that is that if it is so important and such a priority for the Department, why has that not been done already?  These issues are not new.  This legislation has been before the Houses for a long time now.  There is a lethargy and a delay factor here, and in the years it will take to get the alternative legislation in place many people who could have benefitted from our proposals will miss out.  <\/p>  <p>  I return to the point we made that we met the Department in good faith.  It was not acrimonious; there was a rational discussion between adults where we acknowledged that there is no magic wand and that our viewpoints were perfectly valid.  There was no feeling that this would be subject to challenge so it could not be done.  The Department said the committee had made the provision too broad and that we needed to distinguish between the incidents.  That is what we have done.  Our definitions are clear.  They are linked to other HSE definitions and they are not definitive.  The Minister would be still able to bring in regulations, so we will definitely be supporting the committee's original view.  We are hoping that Fianna F&aacute;il is still with us in this regard.

We do not see them as controversial at all.  This group of amendments relates to section 8 of the Bill.  It aims to take the power to judge whether a patient was placed at risk or could have been injured out of the sole hands of the health service provider.  That is all that these amendments seek to do.  In the original general scheme of provisions on open disclosure, a patient safety incident was defined as either an incident in which a patient was harmed where there was reasonable grounds to believe that, during the provision of a health service to the patient, the patient was placed at risk of injury or harm; or an incident where, but for timely intervention, the patient would have been harmed.  The definition of a patient safety incident is important as these incidents will be subjected to open disclosure in the Bill.  In the Bill before us, the provisions in the general scheme have been changed such that an incident will now only qualify as a patient safety incident if the health service provider has reasonable grounds to believe the patient was at risk or to believe that, but for a timely intervention, the patient would have been placed at risk.  In our opinion this puts far too much power in the hands of the service provider.<\/p><p>We know from both broader global literature on open disclosure and from our own experience of our health service that fostering a culture of openness and transparency within a health service is a very difficult thing to do.  We know from the brutal experience of the HSE that the first impulse when something goes wrong is to pull up the drawbridge, fortify the barricades, deny all and circle the wagons.  In this sense, we do not think it makes sense to leave the final word on whether a patient was placed at risk with the health service provider alone.  They will certainly be in a good position to judge whether this was the case, and our amendment does not preclude them from making that decision.  It just means that they are not the only ones who can decide what is a patient safety incident.<\/p><p>We would hope that, if the amendment was passed, in the vast majority of cases the health service provider would hold up its hands, admit a patient was placed at risk, and try to make it right.  In reality, in many cases only the service provider will have this knowledge.  We accept that is the case.  If patients were put at risk, for example, during surgeries or scans and so on, the patient would obviously be none the wiser as to whether he or she was placed at risk.  There would be some instances in which the health service provider would be the only one to know.  These amendments deal with the small minority of cases in which the patient knows and the health service provider does not own up.  It allows scope for a patient, or somebody connected to him or her, such as his or her family or a loved one, to rely on the legislation and to have what happened to him or her classified as a patient safety incident, thereby granting him or her access to open disclosure of all the circumstances around how and why he or she was placed at risk.<\/p><p>Information is power.  Quite often what patients or their families want is reassurance that what happened to them will not happen to somebody else.  That is why it is very important for our health service to learn from those situations.  We believe that, as with open disclosure generally, allowing patients this scope, if they spot something which they believe put them at risk, should actually help hospitals, which often have a deep cultural aversion to accepting errors and to learning that the sky does not fall in when they do so.  It will also help hospitals to put measures in place to ensure that mistakes are not made again with possibly more serious consequences.  We think this is only a good thing.  It is a relatively minor thing and we hope that the Minister agrees with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800058#KKK01000","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1510167000,"counter":614,"content":"<p>I had not intended to speak on this amendment but, such is its importance, I want to actively support my colleague, Deputy Daly, in respect of it.  One thing I have learned in my professional life and on a human level is that institutions simply cannot be trusted.  No institution can be trusted.  If he looks at the record of the HSE in Galway city, the Minister will see that, on every single occasion on which there was crisis, the reaction was to close ranks in a most effective manner.  The unfortunate case of Savita Halappanavar only came to light because of the persistence of a journalist.  If that tells us anything it is that we cannot trust institutions.  Since then there have been a number of other inquiries in Galway, which I will not go into, but in which I have some personal involvement.  From my personal experience I see absolutely no commitment from the HSE or from institutions in general to learn from mistakes, to acknowledge them and to actively involve the patient or the patient's family.  I find this particularly unacceptable given that, in the end, a lot more of taxpayers' money is spent on inadequate internal investigations, inadequate external investigations, investigations which pretend to be independent and, finally, the appointment of independent people.<\/p><p>That has been my experience, both professionally and personally, over my lifetime.  Unfortunately, I have not seen any inclination on the part of institutions to learn.  Therefore, I support the amendment.  I hope the Minister considers it and accepts it in the spirit in which it is meant.  The result would be to make an institution healthier, and there would be less litigation, not more.  Ultimately, everybody makes mistakes, including institutions.  A problem arises only when the institution does not admit a mistake.  This costs the taxpayer more money in the end.  Most people are not litigious.  Most simply want to be part of a system, learn and have mistakes acknowledged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800058#KKK01100","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510167600,"counter":616,"content":"<p>I wish to follow up on the comments of Deputy Catherine Connolly.  I am a great believer in trusting everyone until they prove unworthy of it.  I raised yesterday with the Taoiseach the case of a woman called Jane Johnstone, who was having an horrendous time with the HSE in Wexford owing to her having had the audacity to stand up for herself and her two autistic children.  I wish it were otherwise but the HSE has not earned our respect with its behaviour.  As Deputy Clare Daly said, the tendency just to circle the wagons whenever a problem arises and to enter the zone of denial is rampant within the organisation.  Perhaps Wexford is particularly bad but we have had such an horrendous experience with the HSE there for so long over a number of issues.  All we are recommending tonight is the introduction of best practice to change behaviour.  The idea that behaviour will change if we leave it to the institution is not valid because our experience has taught us otherwise.<\/p>  <p>  The English have mandatory reporting of serious incidents.  Their problems with the National Health Service are probably not quite as bad as our problems with the HSE.  The English have found mandatory reporting to be positive.  Introducing rules and regulations that guarantee better practice represents a common-sense way forward and it is not revolutionary.  It is common sense because we want better practice from the HSE and a better service for the people who engage with it.

It is an important definition based on the World Health Organization international classification for patient safety.  That definition covers three concepts: incidents that caused unintended or unanticipated injury or harm to the patient; incidents that did not result in injury or harm at all, known as no-harm incidents; and incidents that were prevented from happening by timely intervention or by chance, commonly described as \"near misses\".  In the case of no-harm incidents, section 8 refers to the health service provider having reasonable grounds for believing the incident placed the patient at risk of unintended injury or harm.  Similarly, in the case of near misses section 8 refers to the health service provider having reasonable grounds for believing that, in the absence of the incident being prevented, injury or harm could have occurred to the patient.<\/p>  <p>  The intention behind these amendments is to cover any no-harm incident or any near miss where any person has the reasonable belief that the patient was put at risk.  It would usually be the provider that would have the knowledge that a no-harm incident has occurred, or that there has been what can be described as a \"near miss\".  The Minister for Health appreciates that the intention behind the amendments is to cover where the patient or family believes a no-harm incident or near miss has actually happened.  His view, however, is that it is the provider which makes the disclosure of the no-harm incident or the near miss, and it should therefore be because the provider reasonably believes the patient had been placed at risk or that an incident had been averted, rather than because somebody else has that belief.  If a patient or his or her family has a concern that a no-harm incident has happened or that there has been a near miss, they could, of course, make the provider aware of the concern, and the provider could then look into the issue.  If the provider came to the conclusion that there had been no harm incident or a near miss, it could make the open disclosure then.

Few as they may be, they are important nonetheless.  We do not have a problem with the definition of the patient safety incident <i>per se<\/i>.  The difficulty we are trying to deal with, however, is that it is only the health service provider which will decide whether it is the case.  We accept that, in the overwhelming majority of cases, the health service provider will be the one that will know this, but the Minister said that if the patient or patient's family becomes aware of something, they can tell the health service provider, and that if the provider then decides it is a patient safety incident, the legislation will offer protection.  However, this is missing the key point, namely, that in this scenario we are dealing precisely with an institution that does not accept responsibility and whose tendency is to circle the wagons.  It does not preclude the health service provider from making its decisions or from having information referred to it by patients or their families but I am referring to the cases where this does not happen.  All the amendment does is make what I propose possible where the patient or his or her family have clear grounds for believing the patient was placed at risk.  An example could be where a doctor or nurse fills an intravenous antibiotic bag with penicillin even though the patient is allergic to it.  The patient might shout &quot;Stop&quot; before the line goes in.  This could be regarded as a patient safety incident even if the doctor or management swore blind it never happened or that, even if it did, there were no reasonable grounds for believing the patient was at risk.<\/p><p>We accept there is a small number of cases but if we are trying to change an embedded culture, we need to put everything into the hands of the patient, where possible.  What we propose is not onerous, or anything like it; it is simply catering for the minority of cases in which a patient may have access to information on an incident and the health service provider may be in denial that the person has the opportunity to avail of the protections of this legislation.  We do not see it as a big deal at all.  It would help to develop trust and a better way of viewing our health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800059#LLL00400","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1510167600,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I repeat that if a patient or any member of the patient's family has a concern that a near miss has occurred or that a no-harm incident has happened, it is quite logical, reasonable and, dare I say, obvious that he or she would make the provider aware of it and that the provider, having been made aware of it, would examine the issue.<\/p><p>In the event then that the provider forms the view that there had been a no-harm incident or near miss there would be an open disclosure on the part of the provider.

This group of amendments is essentially about the same issue, namely, making it mandatory for service providers to apologise at an open disclosure meeting.  At present it is up to the service providers if they want to say sorry when something goes wrong.  We do not think that is good enough.  We had a really long discussion on the matter on Committee Stage.  However, I did not find the Minister's objections to be satisfactory.  He mainly said that if one made it mandatory they would only apologise begrudgingly and sure that is no good at all.  I do not accept that logic.  It is clear from the definition of a patient safety incident in the Bill that it means something went wrong.  The Bill provides for an optional apology by a provider for something that went wrong.  I find that utterly bizarre.  The open disclosure meeting would not take place at all if an incident had not happened in the first place.  In that sense, we do think it is dangerous to make an apology optional because we are creating a situation whereby health service providers can say to a patient that they hurt them, this is how it happened and that is the end of it, that they are not going any further on that.  That is wrong.  Even a gritted-teeth apology is better than no apology.<\/p><p>Voluntary apologies are all the more bizarre when we look at the very strong protections that exist for apologies in the Bill.  The entire Bill is crafted in a way in which any apology given is not an admission of liability.  It cannot be entered as evidence of liability in court so even if our amendments in regard to information provided in the course of open disclosure being admitted are accepted, apologies would still be protected by this legislation so there is nothing to fear here.  We drafted our amendments to section 10 in the way we did precisely because apologies are so important to people.  It touches on a point made by Deputy Connolly earlier.  This would save the State money because people do not want to turn to litigation.  Quite often all they want is an acknowledgement that people are sorry for the wrong that was done to them.<\/p><p>I wish to make two points about open disclosure.  One is that there should be a full explanation of all the circumstances in terms of what went wrong and joined to that would be an apology.  To acknowledge the fact and not to apologise for it is like a double insult.  It is leaving open the possibility of people going into incredibly stressful incident meetings and open disclosure meetings where they are hurt, confused and probably fuming.  It is fundamentally accepted culturally that when one hurts someone, one should say sorry.  The only people who do not believe that are psychopaths.  It is a normal way of good human interaction.  When a patient hears that the health service provider has wronged and hurt him or her and then shrug its shoulders and does not take it any further, I believe some patients would be so incensed by that that they would launch civil suits that they would not otherwise do when all they were looking for was an apology in the first place.  I think it leaves us open to more costly civil action &ndash; costly for the patients to be fair but also costly for the State.  That will leave us with a lot of hurt and angry people, which is not what we are supposed to be doing.  The Bill is supposed to engender confidence in the health service.<\/p><p>My final point on the issue of mandatory apologies is the following.  I am sure the Minister will say that in the vast majority of cases the health service providers will apologise.  That is great.  Perhaps they will but perhaps they will not.  Let us even say they will.  We would be happy with that, but the problem in leaving an apology as an option in the Bill is that we are explicitly giving service providers moral cover if they do not apologise.  I think that, perversely, will make apologies less likely.  In fact, by not making it mandatory and given all the protections that exist for apologies we are undermining the confidence of health service providers in the strong protections for apologies that already exist in the Bill.  They will rightly wonder if an apology is not an admission of liability and, if they cannot be admitted as evidence of such, why they are optional.  Any basic, decent human being would say that if one does something wrong one should apologise.  I think we are leaving a gap of doubt from which uncertainty would flow and that is just not good enough for the service providers or the patients.<\/p><p>The Minister used an example on Committee Stage.  He reminded us of when we were children and our parents would tell one's brother to apologise if he hit his sister and he reluctantly said sorry.  In the case of bad behaviour from a brother, should a parent say a child should not apologise?  Is it not the case that the next time such an incident occurred the brother would know he had to apologise or he would be embarrassed in front of his sister by his parents giving him a clip around the ear and making him apologise?  It is part of learning.  We have a dysfunctional health service that needs to learn.  The fact that it must learn to apologise is pretty sickening to be honest but I think it is a reality and we should train it because the health service is like a delinquent child and it needs a lot more intervention than most children in the State do to correct its defective behaviour and to make providers behave like decent human beings with compassion and empathy.  If it is the case that they will all apologise anyway, that is great, but the amendment is for the cases where they do not.<\/p><p>Sadly, the experience of all Deputies who have had constituents come to them about this is that many elements of our health service providers do not do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800060#MMM01200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510168800,"counter":634,"content":"<p>This issue was the subject matter of debate on Committee Stage.  Deputy Daly is right.  I do not believe we should read section 10 in isolation.  Section 15 deals with matters to be addressed by the provider before making open disclosure of an incident.  It is in this context, perhaps, that the issue of the apology would be best framed.  I say as much because open disclosure is fundamentally about communicating with patients and their families when matters go wrong.<\/p>  <p>  We referred to the issue on Committee Stage as being a human experience for everyone concerned in the context of open disclosure and a consequent or subsequent apology.  Since then, serious thought was given to whether an apology should be an automatic consequence of open disclosure.  The Bill, along with the Health Service Executive policy on open disclosure and the Medical Council code of conduct, takes the approach that where an apology is appropriate to the specific circumstances of the incident, then of course it should be given.  Section 15 sets out what the provider must do before the making of an open disclosure.  The provider must make an assessment of all the circumstances of the patient and the nature of the incident itself.  At this point while considering the matters to be addressed before an open disclosure is made a decision should most likely be made in respect of an apology.<\/p>  <p>  I believe it is reasonable to form the view that an apology should be a meaningful exercise and that it should be something more than simply a box-ticking exercise.  It has to be more than a question of the provider making an apology and then moving on.  It has to be more than a question of whether the provider considered an apology and whether it was forthcoming.  I do not believe an apology should be given simply because the provider is told to apologise.  It should not be mandatory for an apology to be forthcoming.<\/p>  <p>  We should be mindful of the fact that it is not possible to predict every situation.  We propose that each patient safety circumstance should be treated individually.  Then, if the decision is to be made on the matter of an apology, it should be made by the provider taking into account all the circumstances of the case, including the health, capacity and form of the patient at the time of and after the incident in question.  I believe it is eminently reasonable to form the view that an apology needs to be appropriate to the particular circumstances of the case.<\/p>  <p>  The object of the exercise is to ensure we can create the best circumstances for open disclosure to take place having regard to the fact that this will be a human experience for everyone involved.  Otherwise, the apology will simply become a matter of form, indifference or something less than substantial - a box-ticking exercise.  I do not believe this is the intention of Deputies Daly and Wallace in the context of these amendments.  Of course there will be circumstances where an apology is absolutely necessary.  However, I believe the best time and place to deal with these is when the pre-open-disclosure issues are taken into consideration under section 15.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800061#NNN00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1510168800,"counter":635,"content":"<p>The Minister did not make the point that I had thought he would make.  I am actually more shocked now &ndash; perhaps it is the lateness of the hour or maybe I gave him surplus credit.  I assumed he would say an apology would happen anyway and the provider would apologise, so there would be no need to make him or her apologise.  Instead, the Minister's explanation has been rather shocking.  He said that it is up to every individual provider to decide whether he or she apologises.  He said they should make the decision and that it is eminently reasonable for them to look at it in the context of the circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The circumstances of an open disclosure meeting are precisely that something has gone wrong and the patient has been impacted.  In that scenario, if there are providers working in our health service who do not believe it is appropriate to apologise or who believe they need to individually assess whether to bother giving an apology, I do not believe they should be clinicians in our health service.  In any sphere of life it is part of the A,B,C of our culture and interaction as human beings that if someone does something wrong, that person apologises.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Minister that the apology should be meaningful - of course it should.  The Minister said that if we make providers do it, it will not be genuine.  I do not believe that.  We are dealing with a dysfunctional organisation that needs to be trained and told.  It is regrettable that this is the case.  Is it not utterly shocking that we have to tell those involved that this is the case?  In any event, that has been the experience of people the length and breadth of the country.  In their experience, providers do not want to apologise because they are afraid of litigation and of being held to account.  We specifically kept in provisions that protect apologies from litigation and any malpractice cases and so on.  The health service providers have nothing to fear by this and everything to gain by improving their relationships with their patients.  Then, when something goes wrong they should say they are sorry.  They may do it first time around and not like it because they do not have the humility to admit they were wrong, but the circumstances are that the meeting is being held to admit that they were wrong.

When a patient safety incident is due to an identified error, omission or failure in the delivery of care, of course there always should be an apology.  However, that should be a meaningful and substantial apology with due acknowledgement of the failures in the delivery of care.  However, I do not believe we can allow a situation whereby it becomes merely a routine or box-ticking exercise.

I will address the first issue and Deputy Wallace will discuss the latter issue.<\/p><p>Section 10 requires substantial amendment and we were disappointed that the amendments we proposed to the section on Committee Stage were defeated.  The section holds that neither information provided nor an apology made during open disclosure will be admissible as evidence in court in regard to any action that arises from the patient safety incident that has been disclosed.  It also holds that information provided and any apology made will not be admissible as evidence of any professional malpractice or misconduct in a professional misconduct investigation.  As we stated on Second Stage, the idea that factual information provided at an open disclosure meeting would later be denied in court by a health service provider is ludicrous and contrary to the principles of natural justice.  As the Medical Injuries Alliance pointed out: &quot;It would be abhorrent to the administration of justice if a Court were precluded from considering all existing information necessary to establish relevant facts which are or may be in dispute, before making a decision which determines disputed facts.&quot; <\/p><p>Another major issue arises with the proposal to prevent a patient from being able to rely on any information provided during an open disclosure process.  Rather than diminishing mistrust, this provision is likely to breed more distrust.  If, for example, a patient is provided with a clear and frank explanation of how an adverse incident occurred and the very same facts and version of events are subsequently denied in court by the service provider, how will this build trust in the health service?<\/p><p>We have less difficulty with the proposition that information provided pursuant to the legislation cannot be deemed to constitute an admission of liability in the legal sense.  We have not proposed to remove this provision in section 10(1) because we do not have a problem with it.  Our amendments would also retain the protections for apologies currently provided for in the Bill and apologies could not be submitted as evidence of liability.  Deputy Wallace will elaborate on that point in a moment. <\/p><p>The purpose of the amendment is to emphasise that where there is a dispute regarding liability, it is essential that the court is able to consider all factual evidence gathered on foot of the incident in question, including any facts obtained during open disclosure and all records created for the purpose of making that disclosure.  We must view this issue in the context of court proceedings.  Allowing information and records provided as part of an open disclosure process to be entered as evidence in court proceedings does not necessarily mean the court proceedings will succeed.  All the legal safeguards that normally operate in such circumstances will apply in any case because even if the information and documentation gathered as part of the disclosures process were admissible as evidence of fact, the patient would still be required to establish liability, absent a formal acknowledgement or admission of same.  As such, the question of liability still has to be determined.<\/p><p>We are providing only for access to factual information.  This offers ample protection for the service provider, particularly when one considers that the burden of proof a patient must discharge in any civil action is set very high.  It must be proved that a doctor has been guilty of a failing for which no other reasonable doctor of like skill or experience would be guilty.  That is a high threshold. <\/p><p>Another significant issue is that if information gathered or provided as part of the disclosure process cannot be admitted as evidence in court, it will result in court cases becoming much longer and more expensive.  Dr. Tom Ryan of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, in his submission to the Joint Committee on Health's pre-legislative scrutiny hearings, stated: &quot;When litigation does occur, it is preferable for it to be conducted speedily.&quot;  The State spends tens of millions of euro fighting damages claims, as do the individuals involved in making such claims.  It is a shocking fact that the State spends more on fighting clinical damages claims and paying out damages than it spends on maternity services.  If the current provisions on open disclosure are allowed to stand, it is likely that litigation costs will increase because if one party to a civil case has access to relevant factual information and the other party is denied access to this information, legal battles will become more hard fought, lengthy and costly.  In addition, one has the emotional and psychological damage done to those who are already victims in these types of cases.<\/p><p>If the amendments are not accepted and in the absence of being able to use the independent factual information to which I referred, patients will be forced to pay for and obtain their own independent medical experts to give the expert evidence needed to substantiate or establish that their care was substandard as well as causation.  Given that this will have already been established through the open disclosure process, they should not be forced to shoulder this additional burden to obtain this information.  The system is highly deficient in this regard. <\/p><p>Similar provisions apply in respect of information in professional misconduct hearings.  Again, factual information should be provided at such hearings, which are not as onerous as cases involving civil actions.  There is no reason this information should not be provided. <\/p><p>The Francis report in Britain led to the establishment in the United Kingdom of a statutory duty of conduct.  The Queen's counsel who produced the report, Robert Francis, made the reasonable point in regard to professional misconduct proceedings that professional regulators would be far more lenient on those who owned up to errors with a serious effect on patient safety than they would be with those who denied it or tried to cover it up.  Mr. Francis stated: &quot;We need a situation where the legal advice is going to be, &quot;I know this is unfortunate, but you are going to be better off by telling them about it and being honest and open about it than not&quot;.&quot;  He is exactly right on that point and we have a long way to go before we reach anywhere near that stage.  Denying people taking civil proceedings access to factual information that they were given previously in an open disclosure process later is an incredibly serious flaw in this Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800062#OOO00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1510169400,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I will address the amendments in the group which deal with apologies and the provision that an apology shall not constitute an admission of liability.  This is a crucial issue.  As noted in the discussion on the second group of amendments, apologies are one of the most important aspects of any open disclosure process.  The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care reviewed this matter and reported that a full and sincere apology following an adverse event is a key element of successful disclosure and that, for patients, an apology is the most valued part of open disclosure and fundamental in the reconciliation process.<\/p>  <p>  There is evidence to suggest that apologies assist the recovery of harmed patients, promote forgiveness and the early resolution of disputes and reduce litigation and legal costs.  That is why we propose to retain the provision that apologies should not count as an admission of liability and cannot be submitted as evidence of liability in court.  We want to encourage apologies and health care providers to be comfortable giving them.<\/p>  <p>  The importance of apologies in medical practice is reflected in the fact that many jurisdictions have passed so-called apology laws.  These laws provide that apologies by health practitioners do not constitute an admission of liability and they exist to encourage health practitioners to say \"Sorry\" when things go wrong.  Such laws are in place in many US states and Canadian provinces.  Crucially, what all these apology laws have in common is that they only indemnify apologies and do not have anything to say about information gathered during open disclosure or other forums.  Our amendments are essentially modelled on this concept.  An apology is not a legal admission of liability and should not be treated as such.  Information and facts about an incident are information and facts and should be treated as such, not excluded from evidence in subsequent proceedings.<\/p><p> My final point in regard to this group of amendments is that in the UK a mandatory statutory duty of candour was introduced in 2014 after the Mid-Staffordshire health care scandal on the recommendation of the Francis report.  The UK duty of candour has nothing to say about protection from liability.  All it says is that if something goes wrong and a patient is harmed, the health care provider has to own up to it, provide full information on the incident, say \"Sorry\" to the patient, provide the patient with help if he or she needs it, and tell the patient when further inquiries are undertaken into the incident.  Liability is not mentioned.<\/p> <p> I note the following in the review of potential costs conducted by the British Government before the UK brought in its 2014 duty of candour regulation.  One of the most commonly cited barriers to providers being candid is the fear that being candid and providing more up-front information about patient incidents can lead to a risk of increased litigation and that offering an apology might be interpreted as an admission of liability.  On the other hand, it has also been suggested that being candid can reduce litigation costs as often the main motivation for bringing about a medical negligence claim is to seek more information about mistakes in care or due to a perceived failure of the provider to apologise.<\/p> <p> Overall, the evidence on the likelihood of litigation is unclear.  Despite this, the Bill seems to be built on the presumption that openness with information and apologies will inevitably lead to more litigation and more pay-outs, but the evidence for that does not exist.  There is no evidence to say that it does that is not contradicted by other evidence to say that it does not.  The British review referred to is almost painful in its Tory focus on the potential costs of open disclosure in terms of increased litigation sidelining the moral and ethical obligation of openness to a significant degree.  Even they could not come up with any evidence of litigation increase.<\/p> <p> We are at nothing in legislating for open disclosure if we do not in every way encourage openness.  We are doing a massive disservice to patients and we are standing in the way of improving the health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800062#OOO00300","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510170000,"counter":642,"content":"<p>The Deputies will agree that this is groundbreaking legislation.  It may well be overdue but it is appropriate and novel.<\/p>  <p>  The important aspect of section 10 is that we ensure that there will be cultural buy-in to this new legislation.  In this regard, the Bill provides for certain protections for information given to the patient at an open disclosure meeting, including that the information and written statement given to the patient are not admissible as evidence of fault or acceptance of liability regarding the patient safety incident or in any subsequent medical negligence action that might arise from the consequences of the incident.  I will briefly set out why the provisions were included.<\/p>  <p>  It has been said before that the perceived fears of medico-legal consequences of open disclosure can act as an obstacle to that disclosure.  This was recognised by the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance in its report, Building a Culture of Patient Safety.  The commission recommended that legislation should ensure that open disclosure, which is undertaken in compliance with national standards, cannot be used in litigation against the person making the disclosure.  The HSE evaluation of the national open disclosure pilot also identified what can be described as a perceived fear of medico-legal consequences as presenting a difficulty, challenge or obstacle.<\/p>  <p>  I want, and I am sure the House needs, to ensure cultural buy-in to the concept of open disclosure.  I might add that, in its pre-legislative scrutiny report on the open disclosure provisions, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health stated it was sympathetic to claims on the part of stakeholders that cultural buy-in to open disclosure is necessary to ensure its success.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the open disclosure provisions in the Bill is to create a framework in which this can be brought about.  The Bill is clear on the detailed information to be given to the patient.  It is equally clear that the legal protections will only apply when the disclosure is made in accordance with the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that the input of my colleague, the Minister for Health, in this Bill be recognised, particularly in the context of the Report Stage amendments that we have been dealing with this evening, all of which refer to the health service providers' liability in the area of health and patient care.  In this regard, the Minister for Health believes that the Bill will bring benefits to patients, with the supports for open disclosure in the Bill helping to ensure that patients will get the information they want in a timely manner following an incident.  It is important to say that patients will, of course, have access to their medical records and that this legislation does not impact in any way on the use of these records by the patient.<\/p>  <p>  Having regard to the fact that what we need is to ensure that we have a climate for cultural buy-in and that the Bill works well to the benefit of the person in receipt of the service, I am not in a position to accept the Deputies' amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800063#PPP00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1510170000,"counter":643,"content":"<p>In some ways, we are going around in circles.  We believe that this is genuinely bizarre, if we are talking about changing culture, etc.  We accept the idea that the information would not be admissible as evidence of fault or liability, and our amendments do not remove any issues in terms of liability.<\/p>  <p>  What we are talking about is information regarding the facts.  We are talking about an open disclosure meeting where the person is told what went wrong.  If the person decides to take a civil action later on, he or she still has to go to court.  That evidence will be produced.  It will be up to the court to determine whether liability is with the health service provider or whatever.  The case still has to be heard.  As far as we are concerned, the idea that somebody would be given factual information that later would be contradicted and the person could not say anything about that, is ridiculous.  It neither negates the protections that are there for apologies nor amounts to an admission of liability.<\/p>  <p>  Such laws in other states only indemnify an apology.  They do not say anything about the information gathered in the course of an open disclosure.  What we are talking about here is the information gathered in the course of an open disclosure.  As it stands, without our amendments, the patient or his or her family would be prevented from relying on that information in civil proceedings later on.  There is no guarantee they would win the proceedings or anything like that, but the idea that they would go in with only half the information when they know, having been told at a meeting a couple of months beforehand, what actually happened and not be able to use that, is incredible.  It is mad.  It would breed substantially more distrust.  It will undermine the value in this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  It is regrettable that the Minister has not taken on board these amendments.  Not only would we be saving people emotional damage, we would be saving the State a lot of money if we brought in these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800063#PPP00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1510170600,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I am sure the Deputy will agree that the objective here is to ensure that the patient acquires the appropriate information, receives an apology and that a process of redress is initiated.  The facts of the patient safety incident will, of course, be recorded in the medical record file of the patient in any event.  These facts will be there.  It is important that we would consider a process that will ultimately lead to what we would regard as the best outcome for patients.  It seems to me that section 10 provides an appropriate level of impetus for the cultural change to which I referred earlier.  It facilitates the acquisition of information on the part of the patient after the incident.  Presumably, that will be accompanied by an apology and will be followed by an appropriate process of redress, often without any need to resort to the courts at all.<\/p>  <p>  We need to ensure that we have legislation that will bring about a cultural change from the current deficient situation and also ensure that there will be an appropriate level of buy-in, without which this legislation will be a disappointment and will not work to the benefit of those at whom it is directed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800064#QQQ00100","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1510170600,"counter":645,"content":"<p>In fairness, the people at the coalface of these issues who actually deal with litigation would very much dispute that argument.

The 36 hours of debate in the Seanad and the 99 amendments tabled are an indication of the concerns people have about many aspects of this Bill.  It has many poor aspects which are causing great disquiet and outrage in different sections of our community, including wildlife groups, environmental activists and small farmers.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of areas that the Government must reconsider.  The Government's late amendment on hedgerows is of particular concern because it removes the oversight of local government and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to allow landowners to remove hedges based on their own unprofessional assessment.<\/p>  <p>  When the Bill was originally up for debate some months ago, we were able to attend a number of presentations from wildlife groups including BirdWatch Ireland, the Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations, the Hedge Laying Association of Ireland and the Irish Wildlife Trust, all of which expressed very real concerns about the potential knock-on effects of parts of this Bill.  The measures it contains in respect of the extension of hedgerow cutting and gorse burning dates to run from August through to March are of particular concern.<\/p>  <p>  At present, it is only lawful to burn vegetation or cut hedges between 1 of September and last day of February in each year.  The Bill seeks to extend burning season by one month into March, and cutting season by one month into August.  We have been warned by wildlife experts that the move will negatively affect the bird-breeding season and the legislation will weaken the laws that are there to protect breeding birds and other biodiversity.<\/p>  <p>  Given that climate change is already impacting on nesting patterns in Ireland, this measure is at odds with a national and international conversation that is taking place in various forums, including the Citizens' Assembly at the weekend.  There is more immediate danger in these measures for particular species that are already at risk, such as yellow hammer which nests in hedgerows and still has chicks in nests at specific times.  Others birds such as barn owls and curlews, of which there are only 125 pairs left in Ireland - a quite shocking statistic - are also of concern.<\/p>  <p>  A primary concern that was addressed on Committee Stage in the Seanad was the sheer volume of hedge destruction which would be allowed under the Bill.  Amendments have gone some way to limiting the hedge-cutting trial to be relevant only on hedges by roadsides.<\/p><p>That is still 20% of our hedgerows.  It is a lot and will have a negative effect on species of birds that nest in August.<\/p> <p> We wish to highlight that the importance of our already deteriorating hedgerows cannot be overstated.  They provide both a habitat and a source of food.  They are full of berries and other foods that birds, bees, butterflies and other wildlife depend on.  August is an incredibly important month for these species, many of which are pollinators and are already in decline internationally.  To remove such an important food source at that time of year from species essential to the growth of plant life and future food cultivation in general would be incredibly short-sighted and ultimately self-defeating.  To ignore the science on this matter would be incredibly irresponsible, and that is why there has been such an outcry.<\/p> <p> Pollinators, including bees, butterflies and other small insects, perform a very important function, a service which human intervention could never provide.  This is the delivery of an effective pollination that is vital to crop yields, particularly those of oilseed rape, apples, peas, beans, strawberries, raspberries and clover crops, which are very important in the local and national economy.  These are also sustainable food sources that are less damaging than cattle, for example, in terms of carbon emissions, and they may play an important role in the changes needed at a global level.  At the Citizens' Assembly last Saturday, a professor of European agricultural policy at Trinity College Dublin, Alan Matthews, made the point that \"at a global level, meeting the climate mitigation challenge will require action on food demand patterns, including reduced levels of food waste and shifts towards less meat-intensive diets in developed countries\".  In that context, the function that pollinators perform cannot be overstated in ensuring food security and in turn enhancing consumer choice, healthy diets, as well as boosting the economy.  It is a win-win scenario.  Without their service our lands would be barren of other kinds of habitats that are essential to other types of wildlife, including humans.  If the bees are under threat then so is our food supply and so are we.  That is what is at stake.<\/p> <p> These species currently face huge challenges in access to food and places to live, sickness and disease, poisoning with agro-chemicals and other pollutants, as well as climate change.  There are also dangers in trade agreements, such as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, which are very relevant because they threaten our right as a state within the EU to vet and regulate against dangerous practices and the use of potentially dangerous and damaging chemicals in agribusiness.<\/p> <p> Currently, a third of Irish bee species are threatened with extinction.  Historically, bees have played an important role in Irish life and heritage; the copied architecture of monks and their beehive-shaped dwellings are still visible on our landscape.  Beekeeping was one of the earliest cultivation industries in the country.  Ireland has 20 species of bumblebee and 80 species of solitary bees.  Half these species are in serious decline.  In 2011 the Irish pollinator initiative attempted to pool expertise to tackle this decline and develop positive action.  In 2012 the Office of Public Works, in conjunction with the Botanic Gardens, reintroduced bees into the gardens in Dublin in order to help to restore the bee population.  Great effort was put in on that occasion, with exhibitions and literature produced in an attempt to educate people on the importance of protecting our bee population.  To now introduce, only five years later, legislation that would threaten the food source of bees is entirely regressive and a bit bizarre.<\/p> <p> The extension of the cutting and burning seasons is, according to the Bill, a trial study.  Two years are built into the legislation, which may be extended by a further three years by joint resolutions of both Houses.  The terms of that trial are not clear and this is enough time to do significant damage, so there is no protective measure in place.  What is the desired outcome?  If it is about road safety, which is of course a very important matter, why are we suggesting legislation that would effectively hand control of that safety to individual landowners?  It does not make sense.  It is a blanket measure that, left open to self-regulation and self-interpretation, has the potential to be very damaging.<\/p> <p> Contradictions were pointed out in the lack of joined-up thinking by Senator Alice-Mary Higgins in the Seanad.  She pointed it out, for example, in respect to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, in which Ireland has clearly indicated that hedgerows constitute a large portion of our habitat maintenance and greening in order to qualify for the greening section of the CAP payment.  It is almost a third of the payment.  The two Departments seem to be on different pages.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, under the current Green, Low-carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme, GLAS, lists extensively very specific measures that will be applied in respect of hedgerows, such as the margin around each hedgerow, whether there is a bee box and which particular species is being supported and how.  This legislation is completely at odds with that, as the Senator pointed out very effectively in the Seanad debate.  It would exempt hedge cutting from the list of offences under the Wildlife Act if a landowner believes the hedge is a threat to road safety, which he or she is not qualified to do.  This shifts power from the road authority to individual landowners and allowing them to self-define their exemptions from the cutting season makes a mockery of the purpose of having cutting seasons in the first place.  The road authority should remain the only authority to cut outside of the cutting season.<\/p> <p> There is also the matter of waterways.  We know many small farmers are opposed to this Bill as they see it as a clearing of the land and furthering an agenda of pushing them out to make way for big agriculture.  It is a form of privatisation of the land in much the same way as the section on canals is an attempt to fully privatise our waterways and, in doing so, push the historic barge dwellers effectively off the water and out of their homes.  For many that choice of living was not simply a lifestyle choice but was the only affordable option for them to own their own home.  This Bill intends to give new powers to Waterways Ireland to make changes and enforce by-laws in the areas of its jurisdiction.  It is proposed to extend the types of by-laws that Waterways Ireland can enforce and, tellingly, the obligation to maintain the natural and physical heritage of the waterways is not one of those by-laws.<\/p> <p> This has been drafted without a satisfactory consultation with the current canal users and, naturally, they feel very strongly that they have been left out of a process with a serious impact on them.  There are currently more than 200 permanent canal residents who have homes on our waterways and the new powers granted to Waterways Ireland's officers in this legislation are extreme.  The Minister agreed to increase the level of consultation with users groups and local authorities on new or updated by-laws, extending the consultation period to 90 days, but this should be an ongoing consultation.  Given the delay in having this debate, this might be something the Minister could clarify.  I have raised this on numerous occasions with previous Ministers to ensure that the rights of those barge dwellers are protected.  We should promote and facilitate houseboats as an alternative lifestyle choice, a potential amenity and a tourist asset.  We can see that in areas like the Netherlands.  Those people resident on our waterways have rights and should not be subjected to an authority that changes by-laws whenever it suits that will adversely affect day-to-day living arrangements.  It is far too draconian as a power.<\/p> <p> This Bill will give powers of stopping and inspection, including the boarding of boats and barges, exercising of search warrants and issuing of on-the-spot fines.  We are talking about people's homes and their private domain so that is excessive.  These powers are akin to powers currently only exercised by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>That would be unprecedented.  Section 7A allows for authorised officers to impose fines at their own discretion if they believe an offence has been committed, which must be paid within 21 days and with no option to appeal except in front of a judge.  This is incredibly harsh and is an unwarranted amount of power.  Many people living on houseboats do so because it is all they can afford.  They do not have the money for fines or legal proceedings.  I do not understand why this agency would be given such punitive powers when other agencies do not have them.  That deserves an explanation.  I believe a wider plan to privatise our waterways is behind the introduction of these new powers, and I believe it will serve to ensure that certain groups of people, namely, those who cannot afford it, will effectively be priced out and off the water, which would be regrettable.  I urge the Minister to accommodate amendments as much as possible and not to push through poor legislation that will cause significant problems which will have to be addressed at a later stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800067#TTT07400","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510173000,"counter":742,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be able to speak about this Bill.  Its principal purpose is to amend the Heritage Act 1995 on foot of the report of the critical review of the Heritage Council and to provide for the regulation of the cutting or burning of vegetation.  I will confine my remarks mainly to Part 3 amendments to the Wildlife Acts.  In section 7, which concerns the current provisions in the Wildlife Acts, section 40 referred to prohibits the cutting, curbing, burning or destruction of vegetation with certain strict exemptions from 1 March to 31 August during the nesting and breeding season for birds and wildlife.  The provisions of section 7 give the Minister power, by regulation, to permit the burning of vegetation in March, a month normally closed to burning, and during such periods as may be specified by the Minister.  The regulations may also set out conditions or restrictions to protect particular habitats in areas where such burning is permitted.  These powers will expire after a two-year pilot period, although there is provision for continuation by way of resolution by each House of the Oireachtas for periods not to exceed three years.  I have a problem with that.  Climactic conditions are changing regularly.  My colleagues to my left may not agree with me on climate change, but we are being told about it every day of the week.  We can see a huge change in climactic conditions, whether it has anything to do with climate change or not.<\/p>  <p>  We have a nonsense rule which confines slurry spreading to certain months of the year.  There should be no such thing.  People should be able to spread slurry when they are able to and when it provides the best advantage for the land.  This can stop run-off and help with our animal husbandry and fish in our rivers.  Some 99% of farmers are good custodians of the land and our wildlife, as are the gun clubs and the fishing clubs, including the Ardfinnan, Ballybacon, Grange and Newcastle gun club, whose members have gone up the hills and restocked them with gorse.  They do tremendous work, but they need to be able to burn when the land is dry.  They cannot burn when it is wet.  It is like cutting turf in that it cannot be cut on a wet day.  Common sense must prevail here.  We do not need a plethora of agencies telling us what we can and cannot do.  Are we going to become a nanny state?  These are the type of people who protect the countryside.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Clare Daly, who I respect, said that the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is the only organisation which should be allowed to cut hedges.  That is nonsense.  In Tipperary there are signs in the famous village of Soloheadbeg, where in two years we will celebrate the first shots of the War of Independence.  The RSA put up a disgraceful sign which I have been trying to have changed for 12 months.  It is spelled incorrectly, and to change it back we have to seek the permission of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  It is baloney.  The problem with this country is that there is too much control of things.  We cannot do any bit of work on the N24 or any of the major roads without getting permission.  One would get an audience with the Pope faster than an audience with the RSA.  I have met the Pope several times, but I cannot meet the head of the RSA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800069#VVV00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1510173000,"counter":743,"content":"<p>The Deputy should speak to the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800069#VVV00300","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1510173000,"counter":744,"content":"<p>I am speaking to the Bill.

We have plenty of legislation, including a piece last week concerning fast tractors and another today which suggests that we will be locked up if any of our children go out driving at the age of 17 or 18 without a licensed driver accompanying them.  There will be no one in this House because we will all be driving our kids around.  It is unworkable and is a symptom of a nanny state.  However, despite this we are going to have bushes growing out into the middle of the road where one could hardly fit a bike, never mind a machine or a car.

Every roadside hedge should be cut.  It is as simple as that.  Farmers are allowed to cut the tops of hedges, but the sides should also be cut.  As Deputy Danny Healy-Rae will probably elaborate, the birds are not so foolish that they will nest on the roadside near traffic.  They will go in and nest inside in the fields, of course.<\/p>  <p>  This is nonsense.  It is simply creating more regulation and keeping people in good jobs, with their briefcases and their travelling expenses and everything else.  It has gone mad.  It is mad for employers as well.  There is so much regulation that it has lost meaning.  A regulation was signed a few weeks ago by the Minister when all the representative bodies, including the IFA, the ICMSA and the Farm Contractors of Ireland were up in Naas for a meeting to continue the consultation.  They were then told it was signed in a month earlier.  Fair dues to the Minister, Deputy Ross, who saw that it was a sham consultation and withdrew it.  There is too much of this going on.  People are running amok.  We cannot change the spelling of Soloheadbeg because we have to get permission from the TII.  Soon we will not be able to use the leithreas without getting the permission of the TII.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is a country woman herself, from Monaghan and the border with Cavan.

They are volunteers.  They are taxpayers who have paid their taxes and are doing the work that they want to do and that they love doing, to help and foster nature and wildlife.  We are not all mad with machines, cutting the heads off people along with everything else.  We are constantly being talked at by the head of the RSA.  I had a man who had a good idea on how to save people's lives.  He got an appointment, after waiting for 12 months, in Sligo.  The lady from the RSA did not even turn up.  The appointment was made through the Minister's office.  That is the contempt that ordinary people with good ideas about road safety are treated with.  These people need to be reawakened, brought back down to reality, and made understand that people in Ireland must live, exist and have roads that are safe and where we can see signposts or have a view to make sure that cars or buses or lorries are not coming the other way.  A lorry mirror costs &euro;200 and they are driving out in the middle of the road because bushes are hitting them on each side.  We should be allowed to cut almost all year round, with the exception of the very high season, to ensure road safety.<\/p>  <p>  There are many regulations on road safety, yet when it comes to the simple things, the people in question cannot see beyond their noses.  This also applies to the waterways which are governed by another quango that is trying to enhance the experience for people with big boats and forgetting all about ordinary people.  The same applies to the fishing clubs.  I salute the work that the fishing and gun clubs do.  There is a wonderful fishing and gun club in my area which does tremendous work, as there are such clubs in many other areas of the country as well.  They do not need the RSA to tell them what to do because they would not know gorse from furze, or a snipe from a swan.  They do not care.  They have such contempt for the ordinary people who know all about the countryside and want to protect it.<\/p>  <p>  We need amendments to this Bill.  I deal with the beekeepers in Tipperary who are part of a wonderful organisation.  I will meet them and talk to them, because they are worried.  They have concerns, but the ordinary people of Tipperary should be consulted.  The ordinary people are not out to damage beehives or limit the production of honey.  Fences by the roadside make up a small minority of the fences in rural Ireland.  Some years ago we were paying people to set aside land and leave it idle.<\/p><p>It was crazy EU policy again.  Now, we cannot cut the bushes or hedges.  Some semblance of common sense must be introduced in this Bill.  Somebody must put manners on the Road Safety Authority, RSA, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the plethora of agencies like them and not let them treat people like minions, as Cromwell and the British landlords did.  People have to be able to exist rather than kowtowing and tipping their hats to these people.  That went on for long enough.  These home-grown people are worse, getting away with it because of so-called education.  They roll out their files and come along flashing their badges to tell people to get out of the river or the like when the people are trying to clean the bridges to stop the roads being taken away.  It is futile and wasteful.  They should be put to do meaningful work such as supporting and learning from the gun clubs, fishing clubs and the people who look after and preserve the mountains for the wild species that need them.  They should be learning from them to get an understanding.  They should be sent out to do that for a fortnight every year.  Perhaps they could do it voluntarily as well, like the volunteers who already do this work after having paid their taxes and reared their families.  It is farcical.<\/p> <p> I am very concerned about these issues.  We must have some common sense because the lunatics are running the asylum with all the regulations.  I am not referring to this House.  We pass good legislation and then we find it is not enacted for two years.  However, the rules and guidelines these people want are pushed in overnight.  We must have common sense and allow people to travel the roads with or without their mother or father in the car.  I do not mind if they are restricted to certain times of the day and certain speed limits.  All of us cannot be at home to drive our daughters and sons around and let the country collapse into oblivion.  Who will pay these fat cats then?  Is that the type of anarchy they want?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800069#VVV00600","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510173600,"counter":748,"content":"<p>This Bill appears to be about allowing the cutting of hedges in the month of August, an extension of a month, on a trial basis and the burning of scrub in the month of March, also on a trial basis.  That is what it amounts to, after all the talk and hullabaloo in the Seanad.  I can assure the Minister that we will table amendments to the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Roads must be kept safe at all times for the people who travel on them.  The Minister and the Minister of State have a role to play in this regard.  Roadside hedges must be kept cut all year round for the safety of the people who use the roads.  I have been travelling to Dublin for a year and a half.  The roadside of the motorway is cut day after day.  It is shaved.  A rabbit would not get enough to eat on the side of the motorway given the amount of cutting that takes place from where the motorway starts until it reaches the Red Cow.  With regard to all the talk about birds, I do not object to birds, bees or any other wildlife.  However, there is a place for them.  The people who support the wildlife cannot put other people's lives at risk for the sake of birds.  The birds are not so foolish as to make their nests on the side of the road only to have a lorry come along and blow their feathers off so they will be left standing naked on the side of the road.  That is a ridiculous notion.  The country is wide enough for the birds to nest.  I am all in favour of them nesting but not on the roadside.  We must keep the roadsides safe for the people who are travelling on the roads.<\/p>  <p>  Consider the storm that occurred a few weeks ago, when trees and branches fell down on people.  That must be stopped.  A branch the length of one's arm, from the elbow to the top of the finger, could kill somebody if it fell off and hit the windscreen of a woman taking her children to school.  There is no need for that.  In France there is no tree within falling distance of any road.  We should do the same.  Our people are as valuable and important as the people of France.  Some school buses cannot get up and down country roads.  Farmers' vehicles, including lorries carrying hay and bales, are having their windows and mirrors broken.  Deputy Mattie McGrath said that a mirror costs &euro;200.  Mirrors for some school buses and other vehicles can cost &euro;900 to &euro;1,300.  Consider what could happen if the bus hits a branch sideways and it comes in through the side window.  Two, three or four children in the school bus could be killed.  What is happening is ridiculous.<\/p>  <p>  On top of that, leaves are falling into drains and blocking them.  If there is any rain it leads to ponds on the side of the road because the water has nowhere to go.  The drains are blocked by the leaves.  Take the example of people walking.  People are told to walk and exercise because they are told they are all obese.  I probably am one of them as well.  We are told to walk but we cannot walk our country roads with the briars.  One's eyes would be picked out.  People are also tripping and falling.  In addition, they cannot ride their bicycles safely due to the hedges and briars growing out across the road.  People have never paid more in taxes, be it property tax, PRSI, USC or other charges, yet they see no services for them.  If they saw the hedges being cut it would mean a great deal to them.  Motorists cannot see around turns.  The country roads in places such as Gneeveguilla, Scartaglen, Rathmore and Kilcummin are all blocked by bushes and briars and it is only with the height of ingenuity that people can travel in these places at all.  There is a place in Shrone, Cathair Crobh Dearg, where the school bus driver is giving out that he cannot travel to collect the children anymore.  That situation is replicated in other areas.<\/p>  <p>  During the storm a couple of weeks ago roads were blocked and power lines were down.  The Minister for transport and power has a responsibility for the power as well.  The closures and outages for days cost companies millions of euro.  That was due to trees putting the power out.  People with disabilities such as amputees could not use their hospital-type beds because they had no electricity.  They also could not operate their oxygen apparatus.  Those people were severely impacted because the trees along the power lines and along our roads are not being cut.  It is a sad reflection on Members of this House if we allow this to continue and we cannot ensure that people can travel the roads safely.<\/p>  <p>  Consider the Sheen Falls in Kenmare.  Due to the wind blowing in from the bay and knocking the trees down - a tree was being knocked down almost every day when there was any amount of wind - the people there took it upon themselves to cut some down.  Lo and behold, some objectors arrived and made them apply for licences.  Then there was a big investigation into why they were cutting the trees down.  They were cutting the trees down for the safety of the people travelling on the road but some do-gooder came along and objected.<\/p>  <p>  Fortunes are being spent on marketing and selling my county and our country.  However, that is all spoilt by the hedges being overgrown throughout the summer.  Places could sell themselves if the hedges were cut.  People will recall that 50 or 60 years ago there were section men along every road.  The local authorities at the time knew the value of cutting their hedges.  They had to cut them with scythes and slashers.  It was hard manual work, but it was done.  We have all kinds of saws and hedge cutters now, but no roadsides are cut.  It is all left to stand and grow out across the road.  There are now tunnels on many roads where one cannot see the daylight.  The Minister knows that what I am saying is right.  That must be addressed if we are to claim to do anything in this term of the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also refers to burning scrub and provides that farmers will be allowed to burn scrub in the month of March on a trial basis.  At the same time, the farmers are being penalised if their lands are overgrown.  These lands cannot be cut with a forage harvester, lawn mower or any type of mechanical equipment.  The only way to put the place in order and keep it that way for the Department's officials who come out to check the land is to burn it off.<\/p><p> If one goes back a few years, Coillte used to help farmers to burn off their places but now farmers are stopped from doing that.  It is supposed to be a great concession on a trial basis, I believe it is for two years, that they may burn in the month of March.  It is a help but it must be understood that this has to be allowed to continue to allow farmers to do it when the weather is right for it.  As we have said in the Chamber several times, the farmer knows best how to mind and care for his land without any interference or any advice from do-gooders around the country who do not own even a patch of land but who try to exert control.  It is as though farmers do not own their lands at all now because they are told what to do and what they cannot do.  It is very sad because whether it was handed down to them or whether they had to buy it at exorbitant cost, and many of them had to do that, farmers are the best custodians of the land and they should be left at it.  They never wronged the countryside, and those who are there now value their properties as much as those who came before them.  All they want to do is hand it down in the same way they got it from their parents or forefathers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800070#WWW00200","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510174200,"counter":750,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and call Deputy Catherine Martin who has 20 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800071#XXX00200","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1510174200,"counter":751,"content":"<p>T&aacute; an Comhaontas Glas go m&oacute;r i gcoinne an Bhille seo mar is l&eacute;ir don dall go mbeidh impleachta&iacute; gan aon mhaith ag eiceola&iacute;ocht na h&Eacute;ireann agus cruth&oacute;idh an BilIe seo slad m&oacute;r milltineach ar oidhreacht nad&uacute;rtha na t&iacute;re.<\/p><p>Just as my party colleague, Senator Grace O&rsquo;Sullivan, opposed this Bill when it was before the Seanad, the Green Party will oppose it here.  As far as the Green Party and the green movement is concerned, this legislation is anti-heritage and should be assigned to the scrap heap.  Despite the hard work and justified concerns of many legislators from varied political backgrounds who vehemently opposed this Bill, the Minister persists on her mission to destroy our heritage.<\/p><p>I am taken aback that this Government and the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, would call on us to sanction the destruction of our beautiful habitats, our indigenous wildlife and our natural heritage.  I was hoping, more than expecting, that the wild fires which raged out of control over the past year would have woken up this Government and the heritage Minister to the scale, urgency and gravity of the problem.  Upland areas across the nation have been set alight.  We have watched in horror throughout this year as over 1,500 ha of forestry and 2,000 ha of bogland were devastated by fire in Connemara, as the lake at Goug&aacute;nbarra glowed with the reflection of roaring flames.  The fires have roared even closer to home in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown in Ticknock.<\/p><p>In just under two months, from 24 March to 22 May of this year, the Irish Wildlife Trust recorded 97 illegal wildfires in rural areas.  Some 39 of these were in special conservation areas which are protected by EU habitats legislation.  The current law and the penalties or sanctions imposed on those convicted of such destructive vandalism fail abysmally to protect Ireland&rsquo;s heritage.  However, instead of putting in place real disincentives, carrying out a real investigation into what happened and providing appropriate support to those affected by the forest infernos, the Minister&rsquo;s sole response appears to be a determination to pass this anti-heritage slash and burn legislation.<\/p><p>Those who have helped destroy our forests can rest peacefully in their beds, knowing that this heritage Minister is not pursuing them for causing millions of euro of heritage destruction, and she is not putting in place emergency legislation or even an investigation to assure the hundreds of thousands of people who care about our heritage that those arsonists will face the full rigours of the law.<\/p><p>This has been a golden but clearly missed opportunity for the Minister to leave a real positive protective mark.  Instead with this Bill she has chosen to travel in the opposite direction, fuelling the flames.<\/p><p>Currently upland burnings are restricted to the period from the start of September to the end of February.  We should be working tirelessly to ensure that strictly controlled fires take place solely within this timeframe.  Instead, with wanton disregard to both wildlife and public safety the Minister seeks to extend this inherently dangerous burning period, to enshrine in law the destruction of Ireland&rsquo;s nature.  I congratulate the Minister.  Coming so fast on the heels of her recent decision to designate 46 of our prehistoric raised bogs as natural heritage areas, not to mention their obliteration as having any further benefit as crucial carbon sinks, it assures only one thing: that her heritage legacy will reap havoc for not just this generation or the next generations but for generations to come. <\/p><p>Burning outside of the current season jeopardises a vast array of wildlife.  For many birds, such as the endangered curlew whose population is in decline, March is a month of nesting.  This is the time when they establish their territories, create their nests and prepare for laying their eggs.  Curlews are facing global extinction.  Alex Copland of BirdWatch Ireland has said that there are only 125 pairs of curlews left in Ireland and that the Minister&rsquo;s proposed change in the rules would be the last straw for curlews, that there would be too few left and they would die out.  Fires at this time can eradicate future breeding and decimate already declining populations.  It is saddening that the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, shows such scant regard for these creatures.  However, I am delighted that it is not only the Green Party that sees this Bill for what it is.  As long as protecting the environment is seen as the party policy concern and preserve of only one party nothing effective can happen.  It is incumbent on us all, party and non-party, to protect our environment, to fight for it and to call out lazy, destructive pandering to a few who have no regard for the huge and far-reaching destructive consequences of such damaging legislation.<\/p><p>We need courageous leadership to face down vested interests in order to protect our heritage.  Extending the burning season is not leadership.  To put it in simple terms it is environmental sabotage.<\/p><p>The Minister does not seem content at destroying our uplands.  She is also hell bent on attacking our hedgerows and the wealth of wildlife to which they are home.  Our hedgerows act as linear forestry in Ireland.  They provide feeding for birds, insects and mammals.  They are integral to biodiversity, pollination, nesting and future feeding.  Bumble bees and wild honey bees will also suffer by extending the permitted times to slash and cut down vegetation and flowering wild plants.  The president of the Irish Beekeepers&rsquo; Association, Gerry Ryan, has said that:<\/p><blockquote>allowing the destruction of vegetation in August would be devastating for Ireland&rsquo;s bees.  Clover and blackberries are still in flower.  The bumble bees and honey bees need these blossoms and flowering ivy to build themselves up to survive the winter.<\/blockquote><p>My colleague, Senator Grace O&rsquo;Sullivan, with great cross-party and non-party support in the Seanad, challenged the extension by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, of hedge-cutting season.  After weeks of debate on the matter in the Seanad, the Minister slipped in an insidious amendment at the 11th hour.  I congratulate the Minister and give her ten out of ten for consistency.  This convoluted amendment effectively overrides all the work done by the Seanad to protect our environment and goes so far as to undermine the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.<\/p><p>This Act stipulated strong oversight of any hedge cutting that takes place during nesting seasons on the grounds of health and safety.  The Minister&rsquo;s amendment, however, appears to remove this oversight, encouraging and ensuring that hedge cutting which is destructive to our environment will be a near free-for-all.  It provides for no real monitoring and no disincentives for lawbreakers intent on wrecking and ruining nature.<\/p> <p> And what about the concerns about the pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill?  Was that scrutiny performed when the Bill was under consideration by the last Government?  Has the Attorney General been asked to review the legislation in light of the amendments made on the final stages in the Seanad?  These are questions which need to be answered.  Was the Attorney General satisfied that the provisions of the Bill, and in particular those contained in section 8, would be in compliance with the strategic environmental assessment directive and the birds and the habitats directives?  My party and I call on the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to withdraw this Bill but I realise that my pleas, and the pleas of so many others who are not aligned at all to the Green Party, may fall on obstinately deaf ears.  It seems as though the Minister is impervious to the criticisms of this Bill.  It seems she is blind or immune to the destruction it will wreak on our countryside.  It seems that, despite her ironic job title as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, she is anything but pro-heritage.  I regret to say she has demonstrated no care for the heritage of our nation. <\/p> <p> The question for members of Fianna F&aacute;il, therefore, is whether we can rely on them to help quash this Bill once and for all.  Fianna F&aacute;il has a real opportunity to be a party of Opposition.  It has an opportunity to hold this Government to account and to safeguard and protect the future of the Irish countryside.  I call on Fianna F&aacute;il to seize that opportunity and to do right by this nation.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party can, if it so desires, remove itself from the shackles of supply and confidence, as this has nothing to do with the supply and confidence deal and therefore it is free to do the right thing.  In fact let us all, as Members of this House, set party politics aside and unite in opposition to this Bill in order to secure our nation&rsquo;s natural beauty for the generations to come.  Let new politics give this Government a deserved political bloody nose by binning its proposed charter to destroy our environment.  We must stop this Bill in its tracks because the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is on a mission to destroy our heritage.  She is a Minister for heritage who has only shown disregard and disrespect to our heritage, our wildlife and our biodiversity.  With this Bill she holds the match with which she will set our country&rsquo;s wildlife aflame.

I welcome the passion and the commitment of the previous speaker and I compliment her on her idealism and on expressing the facts as she sees them.  No doubt the Minister will reply to her points.  There is on fundamental area, however, on which the Deputy is wrong.  This Bill will not destroy our heritage.  Specifically in the context of Part 4 of the Bill, it will actually improve and protect our heritage.  Currently the Heritage Council must co-operate with public authorities, educational bodies and other organisations and persons in the promotion of the functions of the council.  In section 11 of this Bill the Minister is changing this and strengthening it to provide that it will now be a function of the Heritage Council to &quot;co-operate with, engage with, advise and support public authorities, local communities and persons in relation to the functions of the Council&quot;.  The council will now have to engage with, advise and support public authorities, local communities and persons in respect of its functions.<\/p><p>As was said in an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, I think that the Heritage Council has done a fantastic job in the 20 years for which it has been in existence.  Clearly, I would like to see an increased budget.  Obviously the Minister will respond to that call later on.  Last year there was an increase in the budget of &euro;1 million.  I am not quite sure of the position today.  I do know that the core priority of the council is the promotion of jobs, education and tourism related to heritage in local communities.  That is its core business and I think it is strengthened.  I reject the principle that the Heritage Council is weaker as a result of this Bill.  It is not.  In this context, specifically speaking about the issues which I raised, it is stronger.  We should build on the work of the former Minister, the President, Michael D. Higgins.  He was a very imaginative and dynamic Minister.  I believe that as the economy improves more and more funding will become available for these wonderful, hugely important heritage projects up and down the country, which are so important in themselves and in the context of increasing employment and bringing tourism into our country.<\/p><p>One of things which I like in the Heritage Council's plan, which is for the period up to 2022 if I am correct, is its commitment to help out in the housing crisis wherever it can.  It makes comment about the many heritage buildings in our country which are lying empty, dilapidated and vacant.  If it has not already been done, it is time to make an inventory of heritage buildings which are empty or abandoned and which could, and should if at all possible, be used to meet our housing needs.  If I may mention one such building, I was in Cork at the weekend and I was looking at the old psychiatric hospital.  It is a wonderful red-brick building which overlooks the River Lee.  It was damaged in a very serious fire recently.  I was looking at it and I said to some people to whom I was talking that it would be lovely if it was repaired and put into habitable condition.  We could have habitable dwellings in it.  I do not know the internal structure of the building, but we could have apartments or family homes in it.  There could be a huge community living in it.  It is now a vast and dilapidated historic space which is unfortunately empty.  If that were applied up and down the country, we could make significant improvements.  I welcome the commitment from the Heritage Council that it is prepared to help from a heritage perspective.  Obviously it would not have the money to do it alone, but it is prepared to help, assist and promote and to ensure that issues such as this are dealt with.<\/p><p>As we face into the European year of cultural heritage - of literature, arts and crafts - our Heritage Council can also continue to function and to improve the services which it provides so well.  I praise it particularly for its wonderful website.  Anybody can have a look at it.  I particularly like its involvement with schools and students.  I do not have the exact figure, but I believe it has interacted with something like 12,000 or 13,000 students.  I can be corrected on that figure.  Clearly, it is making sure that the promotion of heritage in the broadest possible sense, particularly among our young people, is something which is available and resourced.  The council goes so far as to identify individual people around the country who are qualified and capable to carry out all sorts of heritage projects, including in the areas of science, history and geography.  One sees pictures of people on nature walks, which shows the council improving people's awareness of our culture, flora and fauna.  I am not an expert on flora and fauna at all, but I do know that, unless we work together as a Parliament and as a people, we will lose significant, unique and special plants and animals.<\/p><p>The history of industrialisation and western civilisation generally has been appalling in that respect.  I acknowledge absolutely the threat to our environment, including flora and fauna, from climate change and the impact of industrialisation and urban growth or creep on the rural countryside.  I welcome commitments to retain green zones around developing cities and towns, develop heritage parks and increase investment to support, acknowledge and protect our considerable biodiversity.<\/p> <p> If the European legislation is not strong enough, it should be stronger.  I am not competent to judge the charges that have been made tonight but have no doubt the Minister will reply to them.  On balance, I would like to see conservation and protection become a priority.  I have no doubt this is the Minister's intention.  I acknowledge the arguments made.  I trust the heritage people to give us the answers on protecting our rich and important heritage.<\/p> <p> The role of the Heritage Council is small in the context of the OPW and other better funded organisations.  This Bill arises from a review of the work of the council some years ago and it makes recommendations about it.  The support of the council is very important if we are to retain traditional farm buildings and protect our urban and rural environments.  While I acknowledge that some of the views aired are heartfelt, I believe they are missing the point, at least in this area.<\/p> <p> We could go further.  Many years ago, I stood up for their heritage of my town when a listed building was demolished in the middle of the night by a crowd of developers.  They would have enjoyed doing so again only the law was changed.  I found out who the friends of my heritage were, and they included the ordinary people of my town and members of the County Louth Archaeological and Historical Society.  People from archaeological and cultural bodies all over the country supported our fight to have our heritage built up again.  The Drogheda Grammar School has been rebuilt with handmade brick and it is just like it was before it was knocked down.  We managed to protect the footprint of the building and it is there for all time, certainly the next 200 or 300 years.<\/p> <p> The Heritage Council and such bodies are important in helping, informing and supporting.  The council's grants are many and varied.  In many cases, they are quite small.  I am not belittling any grant that is given to anybody - I certainly would not - but I would like to see a significant increase in the council's budget.  On my iPad, I noted 16 pages of bodies that the council supported.  Works included walled town projects and the mediaeval festival.  These are all important because they are driving our other agenda pertaining to jobs and attracting tourists.<\/p> <p> The heritage tourists coming to Ireland are primarily in their 40s or a little older.  They are generally well educated and have a lot of money to spend.  That is what the profile indicates.  Tourists from France, Germany, America and England are very clear about what they want and like in our country.  One can look at the numbers oneself.  The tourists want an authentic and enriching experience and to immerse themselves in local culture.  They want to see our beautiful scenery and engage with history and culture.  They want to meet friendly people.  These are the factors everybody present wants to support and strengthen and that offer people a unique and special experience when they come to our island, which, unlike other parts of the world, is not blessed with the sun.<\/p> <p> By developing our tourism industry, we will encourage many more people to come, including the sightseer and the culture seeker.  The latter are people to whom exploring a country's sites and finding out about its culture are the key motivations for going on holiday.  If we develop our industry, they will stay longer in our country and spend more.  They are affluent, well travelled, highly educated and socially concerned.  They are interested in learning while on holiday and seek themed and authentic experiences.  Some 43% of these visitors come from mainland Europe to our country.  Therefore, there are many good things to be proud of and hope for, and there are many good and important battles to be fought.  Obviously, I will be listening to what the Minister will say on the charges made.  In some cases, they were unnecessary and unfair.<\/p> <p> We must all work together, build our heritage, support our communities, educate, inform and move forward together.  It is not that the farmer should be fighting with the conservationist.  It is not that we should be losing our biodiversity.  It is none of these things. rather it is about working together and, as I stated, encouraging and supporting one another.  All of our aims are the same.  We want a better country.  We all want to protect our heritage and to grow our jobs.<\/p> <p> Some of the work I would like to see done may be for the OPW or another organisation.  When I visit places, I love looking at the culture, heritage and built environment and taking on board the social and political history.  I would like it if we could use our imagination even more.  In 1860 in Drogheda, the British army was resident.  I believe they were called sappers.  They surveyed all the buildings in the town.  It was a huge job of work.  I spoke to the map people in the Phoenix Park and learned they could create a three-dimensional model of Drogheda town in 1860 quite easily.  One could create it digitally and one could have it in one's museum.  We should consider such initiatives, which are in all our bigger towns and cities.  Through the historic record, we could recreate what places were like years ago.  Some videos on the Internet indicate this is not uncommon in other countries.  I would really like to see it.  If we had interactive digital imaging of our history and culture, it would make a huge difference for people who want to come here, and it would educate and inform us all.<\/p> <p> Annagassan is in County Louth and it was the primary site of the Vikings in Ireland, long before Dublin existed.  There was a bit of a battle there in the 900s and the site was completely abandoned.  It has not been built on or disturbed since.  Local people in Annagassan would love to see archaeological work there.  Some has been done, and people believe the place is unique and special.  I am informed that the archaeological features of Linn Duchaill are unique and special, certainly the best on this island.  Finding features of archaeological interest, building up a picture of life at the time in question and having a visitor centre in a place such as Annagassan to show its wonderful heritage are really useful and positive.<\/p><p>If we use our imagination and work with such bodies as the Heritage Council, the OPW and anybody who has an interest in this area we could devise a national plan, fund it and create jobs in areas where there are not enough jobs at the moment.  That would be hugely beneficial to society.<\/p> <p> I am happy with the parts of the Bill I have spoken about, but I understand people are concerned about other parts.  There is no doubt they raise serious questions but I do not believe the Minister is the person some have painted her to be.  I reject what was said in that regard.  All my knowledge and experience of the Minister would indicate the opposite to the charges that have been personally laid at her door.  I believe they are wrong.<\/p> <p> I hope the Minister will get an increased budget in order to increase awareness.  There is hugely increased awareness about heritage and the work bodies such as the Heritage Council are doing.  However, sometimes those who do work are not seen and the commentary is that not enough people know what the Heritage Council does.  The council needs to fly its flag a bit more, come forward more and get more funding.  I welcome the principles outlined in the legislation, which I have enumerated.  They are ones I support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800072#YYY00200","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510176000,"counter":756,"content":"<p>Deputy Fitzmaurice has the next speaking slot but under new politics he has kindly agreed to allow Deputy Niamh Smyth a few minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800074#AAAA00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1510176000,"counter":757,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fitzmaurice for facilitating me.  I will begin by refuting some of the comments made by Deputy Catherine Martin.  First, I congratulate her on her election tonight as chairperson of the new women's caucus in Leinster House.  However, I refute her accusations that I or the Minister, two rural Deputies from the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, care any less about the biodiversity or heritage of our country or constituency.  Heritage is one of the most important portfolios any Minister could have.  I sat on the heritage board in Cavan County Council for a number of years out of sheer passion for the natural and built heritage and culture of my community as well as my county and constituency, and I represent my country here.  I do not think it was fair of Deputy Catherine Martin to make some of the accusations she made tonight.  I will deal with them in the course of my contribution.  I again thank Deputy Fitzmaurice for allowing me to speak first.<\/p>  <p>  As spokesperson on arts and heritage, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Heritage Bill.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il take very seriously the protection of our natural wildlife and protected habitats and species.  However, we will examine further proposals and amendments on subsequent legislative Stages that will improve the Bill.  In some cases, road fatalities have been caused by hedgerows and that cannot be ignored.  It would be a case of burying our heads in the sand if we did not acknowledge that.  There were 187 deaths on the road in 2016, a 15% increase on the previous year.  I do not for one moment suggest that was due to hedgerows but, in fairness to Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, he spoke in a practical way about the obstacles some careless landowners present that are a danger to people driving on the roads and, as he indicated, specifically for school buses.  Hedgerows can present a danger for bus drivers, oncoming traffic and children travelling on the buses.  It is vital that roadside hedges are maintained to ensure the highest standards in road safety and to make sure human lives are protected to the maximum extent.<\/p>  <p>  While the Bill extends hedge management for the additional month of August, Fianna F&aacute;il successfully tabled an amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad restricting the extension specifically to roadside hedges only, as a proportionate policy approach, taking conservational considerations on board.  In addition, changes in the Bill are qualified in that the Minister would have to bring forward regulations to give effect to such changes and specify the period of the extension and the geographic area covered.  Regulations currently prohibit cutting, digging, burning or destruction of vegetation from 1 March to 31 August during the nesting and breeding season for birds and wildlife.<\/p>  <p>  The main amendments to the Wildlife Act proposed in the Bill make changes on a two-year pilot basis regarding extending the period of hedge cutting of roadside hedges only, and the burning of vegetation.  However, this increased flexibility is qualified in that the Minister would have to bring forward regulations to give effect to that and specify the period of the extension and the geographic area covered.  During the pilot period, the Department of Culture, Heritage, and the Gaeltacht will conduct a research programme to consider if the changes have had any impact on wildlife.  That will facilitate a fact-based approach to future decisions in this area.<\/p>  <p>  I will be brief given that Deputy Fitzmaurice has facilitated me with speaking time and I do not wish to overdo it.  Canals come under the remit of the Bill and it would be remiss of me not to mention the restoration of the Ulster Canal.  I have to be parochial, no more than the Minister.  It is a flagship project for the Minister.  I hope it will be further enhanced in any developments in the national planning framework or in capital expenditure plans and that we will see the project move forward.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Dowd referred to heritage officers, of which there are 28 in local authorities across the country.  The Heritage Council is doing fantastic work.  It is really flying the flag in terms of local authorities, education, heritage week and the golden mile competition.  All of that is embedding and nurturing an appreciation and passion for the heritage of the country and the island.  I acknowledge Anne Marie Ward and Shirley Clerkin, the heritage officers in Cavan and Monaghan county councils.  I again thank Deputy Fitzmaurice for facilitating my contribution tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800074#AAAA00300","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1510176000,"counter":758,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It is a long time coming to our turn on it.  I welcome much of what is contained in the Bill.  It is a pity that it is just a pilot scheme.  It should be introduced for a longer term, but in fairness to the Minister, she has made an effort in introducing the pilot scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I do not think it is a good idea to personally attack a Minister.  I may have had many protracted talks with the Minister down through the years but I do not think a person should come out with the likes of some of the contributions I heard earlier.  Many people right around the country would agree with what the Minister is doing in most of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  When one drives around the country, there is a major problem whether one is in a car, lorry or tractor regarding grass and hedges growing out on the road.  Whether we like it or not - the RSA will blame this, that and the other when it has a tantrum - we in rural Ireland know what is causing many of the problems.  People have done work voluntarily in areas to make sure that no one is killed or injured on the roads but unfortunately what has happened in recent years is that one had to go through such a rigmarole to get a problem sorted that nothing was done.  In my opinion, lives have been lost because of it.<\/p>  <p>  To be blunt, I am sick of listening to the Saturday and Sunday drivers who come out from cities and tell people who come from a managed landscape how to run it.  Let everyone be very clear; everyone tells people in rural Ireland how to live their lives, how to protect their land and how to do this, that and the other, but the reality is that for the past 100 or 200 years people in rural areas have managed the landscape and have brought it to where it is today.  They did not need all the so-called experts telling them how to do it or coming out on Saturday and Sunday telling them how to keep it.  They are the people who learned it.  One should remember that if people who live in rural Ireland make a mistake, it costs them.  It is their pocket that is affected so they do not do it a second time.<\/p><p> Earlier, I heard reference to the likes of the curlew and the hen harrier.  Unfortunately, it is these do-gooders who let go many of the minks that have taken out many of these birds.  That is regrettable to see.  A person born in rural Ireland is brought up to grow up with nature.  A person born in rural Ireland knows to make sure that birds are not hurt.  The way and nature of people who live in rural Ireland is a credit to them.  These are handed on.  They do not simply come from reading a book or going to college.  They come from nature and are handed from one person to another.  I do not like people referring to the uneducated thugs down the country who need a little education and who should be told what they need to do.  Above all, no one will tell us what to do.<\/p> <p> Reference was made to burning.  We have seen the fires and there is no point in anyone saying there were no fires.  However, there were fires in Portugal and America too.  We are back to the one word again.  If we do not ensure we have a managed landscape, then we will end up with fires.  That is the reality of it.  I put forward proposals - I hope they will be looked at - for areas that suffer from a lack of industry in the locality.  I believe there is an opportunity to set up co-ops and ensure that we undertake controlled burning.  We could pay those involved and put them on something like a rural social scheme.  We could train them and ensure it is done well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800074#AAAA00400","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510176600,"counter":760,"content":"<p>That is what BirdWatch Ireland is looking for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800075#BBBB00200","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1510176600,"counter":761,"content":"<p>Deputy Byrne, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800075#BBBB00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1510176600,"counter":762,"content":"<p>I am supporting him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800075#BBBB00400","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1510176600,"counter":763,"content":"<p>These people are well able to do this.  If that were done, it would be a good thing.  What is happening at the moment is that some of these so-called NGOs are telling us how to live our lives in rural parts of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  There is a great deal of new legislation dealing with canals in this context.  A previous speaker referred to the new de-designation of 48 national heritage areas.  It is a pity the person did not read the reason they were de-designated.  It was because we looked at the best possible scenario to increase active raised bog habitat.  We came up with the tier 1 and tier 2 set-up.  By doing this, we ensure that we have the best possible active raised bog habitat.  That is why those responsible went for the tier 1 option.  Some people do not like to read this.  Accurate information is needed.<\/p>  <p>  One aspect of the Bill concerns me.  I read a section earlier and I will talk to the Minister later on about it.  I am referring to the new reference to an authorised officer in section 7.  If I have it right, such a person has a right to go in on private property.  I question this provision.  I would debate the point in the context of a High Court ruling on private property rights.  I am referring to sections 7B, 7C and 7D as proposed to be inserted by section 5.  I realise a garda can get a warrant and go in wherever he wants, that is understandable.  However, I question how valid the provision would be for an authorised officer who is not a garda.<\/p>  <p>  In rural parts of Ireland we have seen people trying to do good in recent years.  Unfortunately, some were brought up for cutting a little grass or hedge on the side of the road.<\/p>  <p>  The new GLAS scheme is one example of how nature can attack itself.  Under the new GLAS scheme a farmer can put in sand in various areas, for example, down a field.  Farmers have done that.  The bee population has grown as a result.  However, the bees went in towards the ditches and bored holes in them.  Then, the badgers came out from the woods &ndash; I actually saw an example of it this year.  As well as swiping at the bees, they are swiping the honey and the lot.  Sometimes nature goes against itself.<\/p>  <p>  In the last storm we saw some problems arise, unfortunately.  Our thoughts are with the people who lost their lives.  I am all for ensuring that a person should not cut a tree without planting another tree in response.  However, there is a great deal of difficulty, especially with ash dieback.  Ash dieback is a major problem throughout the country.  One could look at an ash tree and not know whether it was ready to fall.  We must ensure that the trees on the side of the roads that are causing problems are cut.  We should be honest about it.  Most of these trees are stuck abroad on the side of the road and they are causing problems.  The proof is in the amount of wires that have been pulled down belonging to the ESB.  The ESB has had to put up approximately 700 km of cable.  Telephone wires have been taken out as well.  In some remote areas, it has taken longer than weeks to replace them.  Something needs to be done for the people who lost their lives.  Most of the big trees grow 50 ft or 60 ft.  I am not talking about ordinary trees.  There is no problem with a hedgerow with whitethorn and all the various trees, but the big overhanging trees are a major problem.  If we keep letting this go, more people will be killed.  I speak bluntly here.  The first thing to say is that we need to ensure that we plant two trees for every one felled and I would have no problem with that.  In any event, I believe we need to ensure that is done for safety reasons.<\/p>  <p>  There seems to be a myth around that people in rural Ireland are going to go into every field and start cutting bushes and trees in the first week in March.  In case people might not know it, much of the land is wet in March.  Some people think that in August the farmers will be flying in and cutting this and that.  They will not.  They do not do something unless it is necessary work.  Anyone who watches farmers knows that they always watch the nesting seasons.  It is a pity that some of these commentators do not come down and watch the way people live in rural parts of Ireland to understand what the inhabitants are brought up with.<\/p>  <p>  The big problem has been on the roads.  The Minister should talk to any of the school bus drivers or lorry drivers.  They are in trouble with their mirrors.  Approximately &euro;5 million per year is the cost to insurance companies for car transporters that get caught with branches along the roads.  Unless we sort that problem, it will continue to cost the economy.<\/p>  <p>  We can have nature and we are brought up with nature.  I believe that if we work with the community and farmers, then we can have everything working together.  However, there is absolutely no point otherwise.  We hear the way some people bullyrag others about the managed landscape.  I heard someone refer earlier to Connemara.  It is true that there were fires in Connemara and in other parts of the country.  There were fires outside Dublin as well.  Who gets the immediate blame?  It is the fault of the farmer.  Then, the complaint is that the farmer was not fined.  That is all that is in anyone's head.<\/p>  <p>  I am a long time going around rural parts of Ireland, but I do not know that people go out willy-nilly in the height of warm weather and decide to set a fire.  Unfortunately, some people who may be visiting an area could throw something out a window and that could cause a fire.  In any event, the farmer gets blamed.  It was sad to see it happen in the instance I have outlined.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine said that if a fire went through a farmer's holding, the grants may be stopped.  I am not suggesting it was the Minister who said this and, in fairness, the Department had to clarify the point later.  Everyone has seen bog fires since they were knee's height down through the years.  The area regenerates.  If a bog fire started years ago, it could spread across five townlands.  Are we to blame everyone who has a bog for that?<\/p><p>Was the fire started maliciously?  In most cases, the fire will not have been started maliciously, although I am not arguing that none was started maliciously.  Unfortunately, some people were at work along the sides of roads with large volumes of traffic.  It is disingenuous of the so-called do-gooders to blame farmers.  We have managed the landscape for years yet we are treated like pupils in the classroom who are told what to do by teachers.  I will examine more closely the authorised officer set-up because, based on my experience over the years, I am concerned about some of the proposals in the Bill.<\/p> <p> I welcome the proposal to extend the burning season.  While I am aware that this is part of a pilot scheme, the Bill provides that the two-year period may be extended, which is welcome.  I hope the measure will receive support.  While there is no problem listening to concerns people may have, there is no point ramming something down the throats of people who have been doing something for their entire lives and know how our communities and environment work.  To do so would be like me telling people in the centre of Dublin what they should do.  There would not be much logic in doing that as I did not grow up in Dublin and do not know the ins and outs of the city.  People learn as they go along, not in school.  It is like a baton that has been handed on from generation to generation.<\/p> <p> People in rural Ireland who make a mistake must fix it themselves at their own cost.  If they make a mistake once, they will not make the same mistake again.  People in rural Ireland should be recognised and applauded for what they have done over the years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800075#BBBB00500","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510177200,"counter":765,"content":"<p>T&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith deacair chomh deireanach san o&iacute;che-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800076#CCCC00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1510177200,"counter":766,"content":"<p>T&aacute; s&eacute; iontach mall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800076#CCCC00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1510177200,"counter":767,"content":"<p>T&aacute;, ach d&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; mo dh&iacute;cheall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800076#CCCC00400","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1510177200,"counter":768,"content":"<p>N&iacute;l ag an Teachta ach ocht bomaite.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800076#CCCC00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1510177200,"counter":769,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate, however late it is.  I will disagree with my colleague, Deputy Fitzmaurice, in a few moments, much as I regret doing so.<\/p>  <p>  The difficulty with the Bill is that the Minister is trying to do too much.  I wish I could support the legislation but I cannot do so.  Before zeroing in on one or two aspects of the Bill, I will return to the comments made by Deputy Fitzmaurice and one or two previous speakers.  It is unacceptable to reduce this debate to differences between those who are educated and those who are not educated or to a rural versus urban issue.  That is not the nature of this debate.  I will have no part in a divide and conquer approach.  The issue is not the right to cut hedges versus nesting birds or the need to maintain diversity.  As with climate change, the issue involves every one of us.  It is unfortunate, therefore, that a divide and conquer approach has been adopted and we are not discussing what is necessary to allow farmers and those with lands who need to cut hedges to be protected, while also protecting diversity. <\/p>  <p>  I understand the consultation process, particularly in respect of sections 7 and 8, resulted in 188 submissions being made, the vast majority of which appealed to the Minister not to extend the cutting and burning season.  I also understand the submission made by the Environmental Protection Agency called for more research to be undertaken.  What is the point of engaging in consultation if one does not listen to the submissions made as part of the consultation process?  If the vast majority of those who made submissions appealed to the Minister not to extend the burning and cutting season, why has she chosen to proceed with this measure and introduce an amendment in the Seanad which removed the oversight that was in place?<\/p>  <p>  The proposed measures run counter to everything we are trying to do to mitigate climate change, create environmental sustainability and promote Ireland, particularly through Origin Green and the green image of our agriculture sector.  It also undermines the message of the Wild Atlantic Way which F&aacute;ilte Ireland has spent a fortune promoting.  It seems as if one part of the Government is doing one thing, while another part is doing something else and there is no connection between the two.<\/p>  <p>  I have not seen in any of the documentation from the Government side a scientific basis for introducing the proposed changes in section 8.  I choose my words carefully when I say these changes would seem to impact on Ireland's commitments under European Union regulations and do not appear to have been formally discussed with the relevant EU institutions.  If they are introduced, there is no doubt they will place additional pressure on already threatened species.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has not carried out an assessment of their implications for road safety.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed measure is described as a two-year pilot project.  How can a measure that covers 26 counties, lasts for two years and for which no methodology has been provided or baseline data recorded, despite two years elapsing since the Bill was introduced, be described as a pilot project?  Moreover, the National Parks and Wildlife Service is already at breaking point because it does not have sufficient staff and resources and no additional resources have been promised.<\/p>  <p>  I am tempted to say it would be for the birds to proceed in the manner proposed because these measures go against practically all of the submissions made in the consultation process.  They are not based on scientific knowledge because the clear message from the scientific evidence available to us is that they should not proceed.  Britain, our nearest neighbour, has learned from its mistakes in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  As someone who comes from Galway, I wish to respond to the Deputy Fitzmaurice's comments on recent fires.

They are not to be dismissed lightly.  Extending the open period for burning without learning is not a way to proceed.  I am still waiting on a reply - this is not a reflection on the Minister - in order that we can learn from these events.  What has Coillte learned from the fires and who or what caused them?  I do not know the answers and I am certainly not apportioning blame.  We must wait to find out the cost of the damage done by the fires.  In addition, the damage caused to the environment was not taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  I have no choice but to repeat what previous speakers said.  Burning in March destroys occupied nesting territories.  This debate has been reduced to the birds and bees and air quality not mattering.  It is crazy to approach a debate in this manner, without realising that all of nature is intertwined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800076#CCCC01400","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1510177200,"counter":778,"content":"<p>A Theachta, t&aacute; br&oacute;n orm cur isteach ort ach t&aacute; s&eacute; in am an D&aacute;il a chur ar athl&oacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800076#CCCC01500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1510177200,"counter":779,"content":"<p>T&aacute; s&eacute; sin ceart go leor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110800076#CCCC01550","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510177200,"counter":780,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510177200,"counter":781,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 11 p.m. until 10 a.m. on Thursday, 9 November 2017.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
