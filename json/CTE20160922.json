In July 1984, I married my wife Eithne.  In May 1985, we had twins, Se&aacute;n and Ciara.  The following July, we had another set of twins, Kevin and Brendan.  Ten months later, Eamonn was born.  A year later, Conor was born.  We then had a daughter, Meave.  In essence, we had seven children under the age of five, which gave us a certain notoriety in our home town of Newry.<\/p> <p>  On 15 June 2013, I celebrated my 60th birthday.  I got up the following morning, Sunday, 16 June, to prepare for my family, including my mother and my sisters, Eithne's mother, father and sisters and others who were coming to the house to celebrate my 60th birthday.  At approximately 10.45 a.m. I went to the back garden with two of my sons to erect a gazebo.  At approximately 11.45 a.m. I was called into the front room of the house where Vinny and Caroline Toner were waiting for me with my wife Eithne.  I was told to sit down and we were given the news that Kevin had been killed in a hit-and-run in New York during the night.  We were lucky, I suppose, in that we did not get a cold call from America.  Kevin had gone out there to his friend, who is Vinny and Caroline's son.  When he heard the news that Kevin had been killed he contacted his mother and told her to break the news to us.    <\/p> <p>  We are a well known family in the town.  My father taught in the Christian Brothers school for 43 years and my mother was a teacher in the Sacred Heart school.  I also taught in a school in the town for 40 years.  Eithne was involved in drama circles and the children we all very well known.  When the news broke in Newry that Kevin had been killed the whole town went into a frenzy of fund-raising.  It was amazing.  At a pub quiz on the Tuesday night, &pound;42,000 was raised.  On the Thursday night, there was a fun run and walk, from which &pound;20,000 was raised.  Kevin had been in Australia and a fund-raising event was held there.  There were also fund-raising events in New York.  Essentially, Kevin's employers paid for his body to be brought home and so we were left with the massive sum of &pound;150,000 that had been fund-raised in less than a fortnight to bring Kevin's body home.  <\/p> <p>  About a fortnight after Kevin's death, a young man from Carryduff was killed in Thailand.  We contacted the family and offered to pay to have their son's body brought home and that is how the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust came about.  We decided to use the money we had been given to help other families visited with the same tragedy as us.  This was going to be Kevin's legacy and so we wanted to do it right and set about applying for charitable status.  We are from County Down and as such our application was made to the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland.  In January 2015, almost 18 months after we had applied, we got charitable status.  Members will be aware that to be a charity, one has to prove need.  The reason our application took so long was because the commission wanted us to means-test people while in the depths of despair and we were unwilling to agree to that.  We were eventually given charitable status on a \"relief of stress\" basis.  In other words, when a family contacts us we relieve them of the stress of arranging the repatriation of their loved one and we also pay for it.<\/p> <p>  It is just over three years since Kevin was killed.  Since then, we have brought home more than 212 bodies.  Members may recall that in November last eight young people died in Perth in Australia in the space of two weeks.  All of those killed were young people and the deaths were totally unrelated, including two young lads from Omagh and Coleraine who were killed when a slab fell on them, a suicide, a young man killed in a car crash and another young man following a fall from scaffolding.  Not only do we pay for the repatriation, we will arrange it.  We take the process out of the hands of those who contact us.<\/p> <p>  I refer members to the growth of the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust.  In the first year, starting from 16 June 2013 when Kevin was killed to 16 June 2014, the trust repatriated the bodies of 26 people.  In the early days, not many people were aware of the trust or what it did and so we were reaching out to people at that stage.  The trust operates on a 32 county basis.  When we hear about the death abroad of a person, we make contact with the parish priest, GAA club and so on in the area where the family lives.  In the first year, we repatriated 26 bodies.  In the second year, we repatriated 42 bodies.  The trust was a little better known at that stage but we were still reaching out.  In June 2015, we had a meeting with the then Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Deenihan.  Previous to that we had a meeting with officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Despite our having repatriated 70 bodies at that stage, we had not had contact from the Department.<\/p><p>We were awarded the GAA President's Medal and decided we would introduce ourselves to the Department.  We eventually got a meeting with the former Minister of State, Jimmy Deenihan, and as a result, every Irish consulate and embassy in the world was given our number.  Since that meeting, the numbers using our help have really risen.  A family may contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department will then give the family our number.  When the family contacts us, that is when we do our business.<\/p><p> There have been repatriations from quite a lot of countries, including many young people from Australia and America.  Originally, our aim, essentially, was to help young people but that is not the way it works.  We will help everybody and anybody who needs our help.  We draw a line at somebody who has lived in America for 70 years and whose dying wish was to be buried in Ireland as that is not what we do.  Over the summer we took home an 87-year-old woman from Bulgaria who died while on holiday.  We brought home a baby from Madrid who was stillborn seven months into the mother's pregnancy.  We will help anybody who needs our help and the committee can see how we have helped with repatriations from many countries.  The numbers going to Dublin or Belfast are quite big because they are cities.<\/p><p> We work on a 32-county basis.  We have taken people home to the Falls Road and to the Shankill Road and do not discriminate.  If people need our help, we will help them in any way we can.  Costs vary, even within the same country.  As a result of the expertise we have gained and because Australia has operations like the Claddagh Association in Perth and Irish welfare associations, whenever somebody dies in Australia, we are contacted.  As the numbers are so great, we will have used certain undertakers previously who know us and the operation will run quite smoothly.  It is the same for America.  If somebody dies in the Far East or any country where there is a language difficulty, I will use the services of a professional repatriation company.  We use a firm called Albin's in London and because of the amount of business we give it, unfortunately, the firm is very quick to go about its business in getting a body home as soon as possible when we contact it.<\/p><p> With respect to governance, I understand that lately, some charities have muddied the water for others.  We are very much a family-run charity and none of us gets paid.  None of us expects to be paid or wants it.  Everything we did was from the kitchen table, with filing cabinets in the bedroom; the house was taken over by it so on 5 September, we moved to an office and employed an administrator.  That is our only expense.  Our trustees include chartered accountants, a credit union manager and Kevin's friends.  They are all professional people.  The governance is very tight.  We meet monthly and everybody is well aware of where the money is going.<\/p><p> I was invited to speak to Deputies by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin after providing help with a case in Cork.  People are very much aware of us and are behind our work.  We are family-run and nobody gets paid.  I explain what I would like from the Government whenever I met Deputies.  We have a family ethos so I would like every cent given to the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust to go to what it was meant for.  If a person gives a euro or a pound, 100 cent or 100 pence should go to that.  I am not seeking funding or donations but rather something to cover the cost of the office and our part-time staff.  I have quoted a figure of &euro;30,000 per year.  In the first year that would go to kitting out the office, as well as paying its running expenses and those of the part-time staff.  The same &euro;30,000 next year would get me either a second part-time staff member or one full-time staff member.  The service we give to the Department is good and I am not asking too much.  I thank the committee for its attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016092200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Bell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474551000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Bell sincerely for the presentation.

Out of that particular tragedy, with his very generous nature and great magnanimity, Mr. Bell established this trust, which I know has done so much good work for so many families.  I am familiar with some families in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan who are extremely appreciative to Mr. Bell and his family for the great assistance they were given when, unfortunately, they lost loved ones abroad.  Throughout the country there is an awareness and appreciation of the work, particularly from the families which have unfortunately suffered terrible tragedies.  Mr. Bell mentioned the trust has been involved with repatriating 210 bodies in a relatively short period, which demonstrates the great loss of life among the Irish community abroad, including people travelling or on holidays.

Will Mr. Bell advise us as to its status and how long it has been with the charities regulator?  Mr. Bell's request for some funding is something I would certainly support.

I note that the trust does not means test people.  It is very difficult to ask that question, particularly when a family has suffered a loss.  Mr. Bell made the point that if people have insurance, they will reimburse the trust later.  Does that happen often?  Some people do not take out insurance for various reasons.  Has the trust rethought its view means testing?  An amazing amount of money was fund-raised in two weeks.  Does the trust still fund-raise?  Apart from the money end of things, the fact that the trust looks after the arrangements must be commended.  When people suffer a loss and they are not in the country concerned to deal with arrangements and do not know where to go, the trust provides an amazing service to those people who find themselves in difficulty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016092200002#D00300","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474551000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The service he is providing is unbelievable.  I live in Chicago and I am very involved with emigrant rights.  There have been terrible tragedies in Chicago in the past number of years, including those involving the McShane girl from the North and the young O'Reilly boy from Galway.  The traumatic circumstances when the parents travel over are heart rending.  I am sure that happened with Mr. Bell.  I certainly support the service he provides.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Bell raised some issues and it would be no harm for the committee to highlight them.  Insurance is a massive problem with regard to young J1 visa holders in Chicago or elsewhere in the United States.  Many of them do not realise that if they get injured and alcohol is involved, they are not covered.  It is a major issue.  There was an incident in Boston recently as well.  It is our job to highlight that.  When Mr. Bell speaks to the different organisations he deals with, will he please emphasise that their children should have proper insurance if they are travelling abroad?  Tell them about the danger of alcohol, as they will not be covered by insurance if it is involved.<\/p> <p>  I am very aware of emigrant support because I am involved in organisations in Chicago that applied to the emigrant support unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is a ferocious stickler, and rightly so, about accounts.  That was the case for ourselves earlier for a number of years.  We had to have everything down.  It must be a meticulous application or it will not be granted.  I strongly advise Mr. Bell to get his accounts together for an application to be made.  Otherwise, it will not be granted.<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Bell and his family for the unbelievable service they are providing.

I attended the presentation Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin organised and I heard much of what Mr. Bell said.  It is extraordinary work.  After the presentation, Deputy Martin, Mr. Bell and I had a discussion about appearing before this committee.  I have been a member of this committee for a number of years and we had not heard about Mr. Bell's work, but this meeting, which the Chairman organised and the members supported, has done a great deal to highlight it.  It was reported on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning, which again will make people aware that there is such support available.  Obviously, during the trauma people experience they do not know where to go.  Nothing can prepare one for such an event in one's life.<\/p> <p>  I agree with my colleagues on the application.  We will support it and follow it up.  When it is sent in, perhaps Mr. Bell will write to the Chairman and let us know that, even if there is a draft set of accounts.  There appears to be some confusion but we will get clarity on that.  I understand that the Department is very particular on the issue of money, as it should be, but Mr. Bell is seeking administrative costs to ensure that 100% of everything that is raised goes for its intended purpose.<\/p> <p>  The committee is working on its draft work programme at present and is due to discuss it this afternoon.  As public representatives we have had varying degrees of interaction with our consular services abroad in situations such as this.  Mr. Bell has more knowledge than all of the people in this room because he would have dealt with our consular service in every jurisdiction in the world where Irish people are located.  It would be helpful to us in the committee, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our citizens to have a standardised system that takes account of things that have gone right and things that have gone wrong.  In one case I was obliged to interact with our consular services in certain countries and the response I got was less than enthusiastic.  I was told that the person's remains would not be returned for two weeks.  Absolutely nothing could be done.  That was the response of our Department on the ground, yet when I phoned around and contacted the authorities directly, the remains were on the airplane three days later.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Bell understands how traumatic the event is in the first place, but delay adds to the trauma.  When somebody has to wait, it heightens the sense of loss.  Obviously, the person has flown out from Ireland to another country, they know nobody and often there is no support network, because the Irish embassy or even a consulate can be far away.  It might not be an English speaking country so translators and the like, which might not be provided by our consulate, should be provided.  I would welcome anything Mr. Bell can tell us on how we could provide a standardised system.  I could not believe the response I received from our consul.  Most of the service has been excellent, but there should be a standard whereby a citizen of the State can and should expect certain actions to be taken by our consulate in a country when a loved one passes away.  They should not be told that there is nothing it can do.  That is unacceptable.  Mr. Bell's work has been outstanding and we are delighted to support him.  However, his knowledge and assistance to us on what could be done better would greatly assist those who find themselves in a tragic situation such as the one in which Mr. Bell found himself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016092200002#E00500","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474551000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>It is so important, and I believe this is an Irish trait, to get one's loved one home as quickly as possible.

I am aware of that myself.  We were so lucky.  Kevin was killed on the Sunday morning.  My wife Eithne's cousin, Neasa N&iacute; Dhomhnaill, lived in Manhattan.  She knew many people and would not take \"No\" for an answer.  His post mortem took place on Sunday afternoon.  He was with the Armagh Gaelic team and its members drove her to every office that had to be visited.  She would not leave each office until she got what she wanted.  Kevin was brought home on an airplane on Tuesday night and was in our house on Wednesday morning, which was three days later.

I sympathise with him on the loss of his son, Kevin.  Unfortunately, every Member of the Oireachtas has received telephone calls from loved ones, family members and constituents regarding the death of somebody abroad.  The first call is to us and then we call the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I acknowledge the tremendous work the Department does for families that have lost a loved one abroad.  There is a huge Irish community in the UK, Australia or the United States and the community rallies around and provides tremendous support to the family of the person who has died.  Unfortunately, however, that support is not there in far eastern countries and there is a great deal of red tape.  Sometimes, as Mr. Bell rightly said, we do not have consular services in the country and one might have to contact another country.  It is great to know that one can contact somebody with Mr. Bell's experience.<\/p> <p>  I understand the issue with fundraising.  In such a tragic situation it is amazing how the people in the United States, Britain and Australia rally around.  The people at home also rally around.  The first issue, and it is something that is in the Irish blood, is how to pay to get the person home.  This is particularly the case with the GAA.  The tremendous amount of work done by the GAA must be acknowledged.  Mr. Bell mentioned the Armagh team Kevin played for and how it rallied around and helped.  I dealt with a case recently in which a young guy on his way home from Australia decided, as is the usual case, to travel through the Far East and visit a number of countries.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, he was in a serious accident - I believe it was in Vietnam - and lost a leg.  The family did not have the means to bring him home but the community rallied around and he got home.  He is now doing well.  Has Mr. Bell considered extending the scope to help families such as these?  As Senator Lawless stated, and as I have said previously, we cannot emphasise enough how important it is to have insurance but many young people do not believe it is crucial.  It is also important that we know about the issue regarding drink.  Has Mr. Bell considered broadening the scope to include people seriously injured in accidents?

A particular family was quoted approximately &pound;40,000 to bring somebody home from Spain.  We are well supported but if this cost was arose two or three times, we would be wiped out.  It is heartbreaking for us.  We receive requests and we can offer donations towards the cost, but it is far outside our league to be honest.  We also receive requests regarding, for example, the repatriation of a Polish or Lithuanian person who has been killed in car crash in Ireland having lived here for years.

We understand the need for accounts and relevant funding streams.<\/p> <p>  We will take up with the charity regulator the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust's application for charity status.  I sincerely hope we can advance this.  We can write as a committee, those of us who are Deputies can table parliamentary questions and our colleagues in the Seanad can also raise the issue.  Mr. Bell will have the full support of the committee and its members in advancing the application.<\/p> <p>  In the past I heard the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, speak about insurance and creating awareness of the need to have travel insurance.  This was referred to by Deputies O'Sullivan and Grealish and Senator Lawless.  At our upcoming meetings we will discuss the Department's draft strategy for the coming years, which we received yesterday.  Perhaps we can place particular emphasis on this in the Department strategy so that there will be a continuous effort to create awareness among people who are travelling on the need to maintain their insurance.  They may have insurance for the journey out but for no longer than that, or it may expire while they are travelling.  We need to create awareness about this, particularly when so many people travel.  Unfortunately, some emigrate to seek employment.  However, more and more people travel for recreational purposes such as sightseeing and visiting friends abroad.  There is a huge movement of people and the insurance issue is something about which we need to create better awareness.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Bell and his colleagues see the absolute support they have from the committee for their work and also the appreciation of the outstanding work Mr. Bell and his family and other support groups have done to help ease the plight of so many families who unfortunately have suffered tragedies.  In counties Cavan and Monaghan, which I represent, the work of the trust has been very beneficial in repatriating bodies.  The families and local communities subsequently raise major funding to assist the work.  Not only does the family appreciate the support, so does the broader community.  As I stated, the committee will fully support Mr. Bell to the greatest extent possible in the extremely valuable work he does.  We thank him very much for attending.  I emphasise that Mr. Bell has been very magnanimous and generous in coming here to outline how the birth of the repatriation trust came about in the most tragic of circumstances for him and his family.

I appreciate the opportunity to meet the committee this afternoon and I welcome the Senators who were appointed since I last appeared before the committee in June.<\/p> <p>  I will make a few brief comments on the mid-term review of my Department's 2016 Estimate.<\/p><p>I understand that in addition to discussing the expenditure position to date in 2016, the committee is also interested in discussing progress in achieving the targets published in the 2016 Revised Estimates Volume and the emerging position as regards 2017.  While I presented my Department's 2016 Estimate to the select committee in June last, which was not long ago, a number of significant developments have taken place in the meantime, not least of which has been the decision on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, Brexit, an issue I appreciate the joint committee will probably want to explore. <\/p><p> As regards expenditure this year, members will be aware that the total gross allocation provided to my Department for 2016 is &euro;810.47 million.  This is broken down into &euro;297.47 million by way of current expenditure and &euro;513 million in capital expenditure.  Total expenditure by my Department until the end of August was &euro;414.2 million.  Overall, this is approximately &euro;26 million behind the initial profile of expenditure to the end of August.  In terms of current expenditure, the position as of the end of August shows that it was &euro;177.6 million, which is approximately &euro;10 million behind the original profile.  The main reason relates to non-pay expenditure and is due to a number of factors, including late receipt of invoices by agencies and delays in relocating a significant number of staff - more than 300 - in certain departmental units and offices.<\/p><p> It is possible, therefore, that the Department will not spend all of its &euro;297 million current expenditure allocation in 2016.  I advise the committee, however, that there will most likely be a need to spend some additional current pay and non-pay moneys in the remaining months of 2016 to meet issues that have been emerging following the Brexit decision in the United Kingdom.  I do not expect significant savings to be made on the current side of the Vote by the end of the year.  <\/p><p> Capital expenditure until the end of August was &euro;226.56 million, which is almost &euro;16 million behind the original profile.  Again, there are number of reasons for this, including time delays and slower than anticipated progress in rolling out particular programmes.  Despite falling somewhat behind profile, I expect there will be a full drawdown of the Department's capital allocation in 2016.  As regards the possibility of additional capital moneys being provided to my Department in 2016, any decisions on this matter would have to be agreed in dialogue with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in light of the overall emerging end of year position.  However, I confirm our capacity to use additional funding in the current year should it be available.<\/p><p> I will now focus on interim results.  As I indicated, I understand the joint committee may wish to discuss the progress achieved in meeting the departmental targets published in the Revised Estimates Volume 2016.  I am happy to discuss with members the outputs that have been achieved on foot of the expenditure incurred to date in 2016.  I will give a brief outline of these outputs later.  I advise, however, that much of the detailed data gathering to determine the achievement of output targets such as those published in the Revised Estimates Volume can only practically be carried out on an annual basis.  For example, the definitive source for determining the number of jobs being directly supported by my Department's agencies is through the enterprise agency annual employment survey.  This survey is normally carried out as close as possible to the new financial year.  Members will appreciate, therefore, that the definitive position in respect of the achievement of a number of the Department's metrics and outputs, as published in the 2016 Revised Estimates Volume, may not be determined until the agency annual employment survey has been completed.  Nevertheless, it would be helpful to the joint committee if I were to briefly outline some of the highlight achievements thus far this year.  I will focus initially on programme A, jobs and enterprise development.  With the permission of members, I will then say a few words on programme B, innovation, and programme C, regulation, given the absence of my ministerial colleagues, the Ministers of State, Deputies Pat Breen and John Halligan, both of whom are abroad on official business. <\/p><p> In terms of programme A, jobs and enterprise development, members will be aware that 2015 was a record year for the Department's enterprise agencies.  Together, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the local employment offices, LEOs, delivered more than 44,000 gross jobs and more than 25,000 net new jobs last year.  In the first half of 2016, the momentum in job creation continued.  More than 2 million people are in employment for the first time since 2008.  As regards the efforts of the enterprise agencies, IDA Ireland is on track to equal if not better its record performance of 2015 in terms of the numbers of new jobs being delivered.  The agency advises that Ireland won 115 projects in the first six months of 2016 as against 110 projects won in the same period of 2015.  Investments approved by the end of June will lead to the creation of approximately 9,100 jobs over the coming months and years.  I understand the committee has been supplied with examples of IDA Ireland's client company job announcements thus far in 2016 and their regional spread.  <\/p><p> In terms of supporting regional balance in the delivery of new jobs, I apprised the select committee in June of the details of IDA Ireland's regional property programme.  In this regard, IDA Ireland has identified a total number of 34 sites across 22 counties as part of the regional property advanced facilities programme out to 2020.  It is intended that construction of the first three advanced facilities in Castlebar, Sligo and Tralee will be completed this year.  The next round of locations in Galway, Dundalk and Limerick will progress through design and planning this year.  The planning process for the last round of locations in Athlone, Carlow and Waterford will commence in 2017. <\/p><p> The Government's commitment to regional balance in job creation was reaffirmed by the specific commitment in the programme for partnership Government to provide &euro;500 million to accelerate job growth across the regions.  Of this additional funding, &euro;200 million will be used to allow IDA Ireland to build additional advance facilities in regional towns.  I am determined to ensure the agency has the necessary resources to continue the roll-out of its advanced facilities programme to enhance the ability of each and every region to attract much needed inward investment.<\/p><p> Aside from IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland also has a key role in job creation by developing and supporting Irish enterprises to help them to start, grow, innovate and win export sales in global markets.  Enterprise Ireland companies created more than 21,000 gross permanent full-time and part-time jobs in 2015.  The agency's clients also achieved record sales of more than &euro;20 billion last year.  This progress continued in 2016 with Enterprise Ireland well on track to achieve a target of 40,000 new full-time jobs over the three-year period of its current strategy running to 2016.<\/p><p>I understand Enterprise Ireland supplied the committee with examples of job announcements made by its clients to date this year.  Allied to the work of Enterprise Ireland is the role played by the local enterprise offices, LEOs.  These are first-stop shops which provide advance and financial assistance to those wishing to start growing their businesses in local areas.  The LEOs have continued to build on their strong 2015 performance in the first half of 2016.  LEOs approved almost 500 projects across the State to the end of June.  These projects involve a total investment of over &euro;8 million and it is estimated that they will deliver 960 jobs.  The LEOs have also provided training courses for over 13,500 participants, together with mentoring services to some 1,500 participants.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the regional action plans.  Many of these, and other enterprise supports, are underpinning our eight regional action plans through which we are aiming to deliver an additional 200,000 jobs by 2020 and 135,000 of these are to be in rural and regional areas.  On their own, the regional action plans will not solve everything.  They are complemented by other programmes on which the Government is working at national level.  These include the national action plans for housing and jobs, skills strategies and infrastructure projects.  The action plans can get things working from the bottom up, in partnership with the enterprise sector, to build on local strengths and to help deliver jobs in every region.<\/p><p> With regard to Brexit, notwithstanding the continued strong performance of our enterprise agencies, the UK's decision to exit the EU clearly represents significant challenges and possible opportunities for the immediate and long-term future.  The Government fully recognises the importance of carefully managing the uncertainty that the UK vote has created.  For my part, I have been closely engaged with our enterprise agencies particularly IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  Both agencies have been proactive in developing their plans to highlight Ireland's attributes as a key European FDI location and in positioning Irish businesses to strengthen their performance in the UK and in other markets.  I am happy to apprise the committee later in more detail on what I, the Department and our agencies have been doing in recent months in this regard.<\/p><p> I hope the foregoing gives the committee a flavour of the activities that are supported by the expenditure so far in 2016 across programme A &ndash; jobs and enterprise development.  I do not anticipate the need for any additional current moneys in the remaining months in 2016.  While there may indeed be savings in some areas of current expenditure, there may also be a need to spend some additional current pay and non-pay moneys in other areas to meet the emerging issues in the aftermath of the Brexit decision.  Overall, I anticipate that my Department will be in a position to stay within its 2016 current expenditure allocation.<\/p><p> With regard to capital expenditure, I will be exploring the possibility of additional capital moneys being provided to my Department in 2016 in the context of the forthcoming Estimates process.  Members of the committee will be aware that discussions have commenced in respect of the 2017 Estimates.  From my Department&rsquo;s point of view, there are a number of emerging issues which require consideration in the context of the Estimates process.  First, I will be seeking to ensure the funding commitment in the programme for a partnership Government to support the acceleration of export led growth across the regions is commenced.  I am also conscious of the importance of ensuring that our enterprise agencies have the necessary resources to respond to the immediate and longer term impacts of Brexit.  I will also be exploring the possibility of additional funding to ramp up innovation investment, not least given the ambitious targets under Innovation 2020 and our national commitments under Europe 2020.  I will also be looking to secure some additional resources to further enhance capacity in some of our regulatory bodies.  The committee will appreciate that the Government will consider these issues along with other priorities as part of its Estimates 2017 deliberations in the coming weeks.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to make these opening remarks.  I hope they have been of assistance to the committee.  I am happy to take any questions from the committee on programme A on jobs and enterprise development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016092200002#A00600","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474551000,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Aire.

Obviously, the jobs growth that has happened in recent years is to be welcomed, particularly from the figures given by the Minister on the support of the agencies and the net growth of 25,000 jobs supported by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices.  Following on from looking at that document a number of questions have arisen.  The target percentage for projects outside Dublin and Cork has decreased and I want clarification around that.  With regard to capital expenditure and where it goes, what determines such expenditure?  The Minister outlined a number of regional areas where that would happen, with three projects this year, and including Limerick where I reside.  She referred to the planning phase but perhaps she could clarify what actually determines each regional centre?  I am referring to the capital expenditure for regional expenditure in subhead A5.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to Brexit.  What are the Department and IDA Ireland doing to try to attract organisations such as the European Medicines Agency with headquarters in the UK to transfer their operations here?  Holland and the Benelux countries are in direct competition with Ireland in this regard.  We must gain a competitive advantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016092200002#C00300","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1474551000,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I want to ask a few questions under subhead A5 on the job announcements in IDA Ireland-supported client companies.  The one that jumps out is Uber.  If people do not know, Uber is a very large, smart company that provides an application for people to perform taxi business.  As I understand it, 100 jobs were initially created, mainly in the Limerick area.  My research into Uber and its record shows that the company has created some 30,000 jobs - it did not create them, as such, but it operates with some 30,000 drivers in Britain and Ireland.  However, there are several pending court cases around Uber's treatment of its workers and whether it fulfils contracts with them.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify if she is at all concerned about that record and the fact that Uber is being taken to labour relations bodies, particularly in Britain, for illegal deductions from the pay achieved by some of its drivers and for paying well below the minimum wage in many cases.  I also understand that in dealing with an app from a company such as Uber, a driver does not necessarily have to have a public service vehicle licence as normal taxi drivers must do.<\/p><p>As we know, the deregulation of the taxi industry in this country has caused severe pressure and competition on those who have gone to the bother of training, paying the expenses for their licences and fulfilling their commitments to buy the plates.  Will the Minister comment on why IDA Ireland money &ndash; public money &ndash; should be supporting what appears to be totally unethical workplace practice?  What are the value returns for us?<\/p><p> Let us consider page 26 under subhead 5 and some of the companies that we are allegedly supporting.  It seriously begs the question of why public money is being used to finance organisations such as Credit Suisse, Amazon or Coca Cola.  These are giant multinational corporations which, surely to God, should not need the support of IDA Ireland.  If they do, what are we getting back from them in return?  These companies are also availing of low corporation tax and other tax breaks as we have seen recently with other companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016092200002#C00400","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1474551000,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Deputy Smith mentioned Coca Cola.

Sometimes when we look at the numbers it appears rather skewed because the same company may go to the same site on several occasions.  There is another point I am keen for everyone to understand.  As the majority of the increases in jobs that IDA Ireland brings are with existing companies, there is no need for site visits at all.  Another point I am keen to make is that not every company announces jobs.  The changes may not be showing up in our statistics.  Site visits to all the regions have increased.

On page 26 of the Department&rsquo;s document, as furnished to us, there is a table of the 2016 job announcements in IDA Ireland-supported client companies.

I have spent all summer visiting the regions to see how it is implemented and will bring that information to Cabinet and it will then become public.  I am passionate that these jobs must go to regional and rural areas.  For example, this morning I announced jobs in Dublin.  I will be in Limerick on Monday and I was there last week.  It is all over the country.  We have announced perhaps 1,400 jobs this week alone and I will announce two more sets of jobs tomorrow.  It is happening, but perhaps not as quickly as I would like.  Some counties are more attractive than others.  For example, if there is an airport in a county and if the infrastructure and broadband are good, then it is attractive.  The broadband service is not good in some rural areas.  I am so sorry that they did not shout much louder during the negotiations when I heard so much about water.  I wish that I had heard about broadband from the people in the country who, for the most part, pay for their water.<\/p> <p>  We have made major announcements in respect of Cork, Limerick, and Carrick-on-Shannon.  Waterford is doing very well, as is Dublin.  IDA Ireland is bringing more people on site visits.  The figure in that regard has risen to 42%.  It is very conscious that the Government - in its programme for a partnership Government - has told it to put an emphasis on the regions.  I probably speak to Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland every second day.  That is the first question I ask them.  When they tell me they are going to Dublin, I am almost disappointed because I want them to go to the regions.<\/p> <p>  I have a breakdown of the figures for 2015.  I understand that it is possible to pick and choose counties but, as Deputy Niall Collins knows - particularly as we have spoken about it in my office - we are discussing regions, not counties.  This is a Government strategy to ensure that jobs go to the regions.  A total of 64% of Enterprise Ireland jobs and 85% of LEO jobs were outside Dublin.  We need to promote the LEOs more.  They do a good job.  They delivered 7,122 jobs in 2015.  We hear very little about them because they are so low key in the community and yet they are very important.<\/p> <p>  We are very conscious that Brexit could have huge implications for Ireland.  Senator Davitt spoke about the construction industry.  It and the agrifood sector are under pressure in respect of pricing and so on.  It is very difficult to deal with that because of the currency fluctuations and the negotiations about when the UK Prime Minister will trigger Article 50.  We have to wait because we do not know what they are going to do or what they are looking for.  I have been in Brussels and met Commissioners Biekowska and Malmstr&ouml;m on trade and internal affairs.  They do not know what is going to happen.  It is all under negotiation.  We are very conscious that we must ensure there is no hard border and no tariffs, that there is a free travel area and free movement of people, goods, capital and services.  That all has to be dealt with in the negotiations.  All Ministers and the Taoiseach are very conscious of that.  The Taoiseach has set up a special Cabinet committee and appointed a special Secretary General, John Callinan, to be in charge of that.  I meet Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the senior officials in the Department once a week to go through exactly what we need to do for the future when Article 50 is triggered.<\/p> <p>  We only give work permits where there are skill shortages.  That is decided twice a year.  We review the categories of jobs for permits.  I will ask the officials in the Department to review the position.  We also have received inquiries about lorry drivers.

I might raise the issue slightly differently and we would probably both come to the same point.  Why would a particular property be purchased and what factors would influence that?  Does IDA Ireland have a policy around hubs?  How are those hubs chosen?  How is a particular industry chosen for a particular region or area?  For instance, we have the pharma industry in Cork and there is another hub in Blanchardstown.

The Deputy asked why some sites were selected for advance facilities.  A key component of IDA Ireland's property strategy is that provision for prospective investors, and such facilities were constructed and completed in Athlone and Waterford.  When examining the suitability of a site for an advance facility, IDA Ireland looks for the following: overall marketability of the location and ability to align with the potential project pipeline; locations which have third level education institutes; locations which are attractive for new staff to reside in the area; urban centres with the appropriate level of infrastructure to support the development; and urban centres with track records in FDI and EI client performance.  If I were to select one of those, the one I keep hearing about when I meet FDI clients is third level education institutes, and they talk about conversion courses and about the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training, NIBRT, which is an add-on education course for bio-pharma, and that is really important.<\/p> <p>  That feeds into Senator Reilly's question about why some areas rather than others are used as hubs.  To take the example of Galway as a health tech area, the required experience has been built up over years.  The same applies to Limerick which had the Dell plant which closed but it had those human resources, people with that experience, and that is why companies like to invest in that area.  Investors like airports and good roads, and that infrastructure needs to worked on in the counties.  I am conscious that the Limerick to Cork road needs to be looked at.  That has been mentioned to me on a number of occasions and I ask the county councils and those with responsibility for that area in government to make sure it is given priority.  In terms of the clusters of development used, Athlone is becoming very popular because of the Athlone Institute of Technology, as is Waterford, which has a good institute of technology.  Those in the institutes will meet representatives of the industries that are investing here and they will provide the courses they require.  That is very attractive for those industries.  We are fighting very hard to get FDI into the country and it makes it easier when we have education institutes that respond to the needs of industries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016092200002#F00900","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1474551000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>It would be useful if the Minister could arrange for her officials to provide us with more detail on this.

I have several questions that span a few different areas so I ask her to bear with me.  Her brief is a wide one.<\/p> <p>  There is a lot of talk about what we should spend more money on, be it money from the fiscal space, Supplementary Estimates or whatever.  Now that the Minister has had a reasonable amount of time in the Department, where does she believe less money should be spent?  The briefing documents from the Minister's officials are very useful.  Naturally, they focus on the good news, and the various agencies are to be congratulated wholeheartedly on doing what appears to be a superb job.  There is virtually no focus, however, on what is not working and, inevitably, across such a complicated area there are programmes and initiatives that are not working, programmes that probably should be shut down, and moneys in areas on which we should stop spending.  First, where does the Minister believe we should spend less money in her Department and in the agencies?  Related to that, were more money to be allocated or if we were to find &euro;50 million somewhere that we should no longer be spending, where would be her first one or two big priorities for additional spending?<\/p> <p>  My second question is on the LEOs.  The output metrics seem to be fairly good.  My question is on client satisfaction.  My anecdotal evidence is that some of the LEOs are doing a very good job, and some of them are not necessarily doing such a good job.  It is variable throughout the country.  Has the Department any client satisfaction metrics?  In retail, it would be mystery shopper type metrics.  Is anyone engaging systematically with the clients of the LEOs to discover where they are doing well, where they need more support, the ones that are working and where there is good practice that might be able to be shared?<\/p> <p>  My third question is on funding for IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs.  I read in the report that the claim is that two in every five jobs in the country are now in some way related to IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland or a LEO.  It is a big claim.  I am not saying it is wrong, but it is a bold claim to make.  If it is true and if IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are doing such a good job, and I have no reason to believe they are not, does the Minister believe there is a case for significant additional funding?  Has anyone done a cost-benefit analysis on giving IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland or the LEOs an additional &euro;100 million or &euro;200 million?  As an example, the Minister for Health came to the Oireachtas a few months ago and asked for &euro;500 million.  He got it without too much debate.  The previous Minister for Health walked in a few months before that and asked for more than &euro;600 million extra, and he got it without too much debate.  Is there a case for a cost-benefit analysis to examine what &euro;100 million or &euro;200 million would do for IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland?  Have they come to the Minister advocating for new programmes, new countries or new sectors?  In terms of what seem to be extraordinarily effective agencies of the State, should we be investing more money into the enterprise sector through those agencies?<\/p> <p>  With regard to my fourth question, and I am sorry for moving around the areas, there has been much talk about Brexit and providing additional supports, primarily through Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs, for the indigenous sector.  I was talking to an economist in IBEC during the week who pointed out that 90% of our exports are from the multinational companies but that the 10% that comes from the indigenous small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, accounts for half of the export related jobs.  A total of 40% of our SME exports are to Britain.  It is clear, therefore, that there is a major risk, and potentially a big opportunity, there.  The Minister mentioned that the agencies are dealing with Brexit and that there would be additional funding in the next budget, but I would argue that is too late.  Brexit will happen within about 18 months, so the time between now and then is the time for the sector to get ready.  How much money has been allocated for this year and for next year as additional activity to the State agencies to deal with Brexit?<\/p> <p>  My next question is on broadband, which was mentioned by several members.  It is a point, but it is related to the Estimates.  A decision was taken to privatise the new fibre optic network.  That is a very serious mistake for enterprise development throughout the country.  Ireland has an incredibly poor record of regulation in this area.  ComReg has not done its job, nor do I believe it will do a particularly good job with the new privatised fibre optic network.  What is most likely to happen is exactly what has happened here already when we privatised a telecoms network, which is that it will be bought by one of two bidders, repackaged, securitised, sold on international markets, and end up on the desk of some trader in Singapore, London or elsewhere.  He or she will be heavily incentivised to minimise investment and maximise return, which means monopoly-type pricing and underinvestment throughout the country.<\/p><p>We would be able to keep that network in public ownership for a relatively small amount of money and I seek the Minister's view in this regard.  While I am aware this matter is under the aegis of the Department of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, it has the potential to adversely affect enterprise development nationwide for many years.  Consequently, I seek the Minister's view in this regard.<\/p><p> My final question pertains to the so-called vulture funds.  As the Minister may be aware, the so-called vulture funds are using an element of tax law called section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Through that provision, they are able to buy tens of billions worth of Irish assets and essentially operate them tax-free.  Irish companies such as AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB or Irish investment firms are precluded from section 110 status.  Arguably, one therefore has a serious competition issue in which regulated Irish entities such as fund management agencies, banks, etc. are being obliged to bid against essentially unregulated foreign entities that need pay no tax on the profits.  This obviously is an issue I am taking up with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in an effort to close it down but as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, does the Minister believe it is reasonable that the Irish firms should be asked to compete with foreign firms when the former are obliged to pay all taxes due whereas the latter, through section 110 status and other tax avoidance mechanisms, essentially are paying no tax?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016092200002#G01500","speaker":"1230","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474551000,"counter":130,"content":"<p>The Minister might allow me to ask a question as well.

As Deputy Quinlivan noted, some LEOs are working better than others and we want to put in place best practice nationwide.<\/p> <p>  To revert to the issue of money well spent, when I refer to the 180,000 people who are unemployed, I wish to put a lot of emphasis in the plan for 2017 on women's entrepreneurship and on getting women back to work, as well as on the long-term unemployed and youth employment.  All these sectors require considerable resources, particularly in the case of the long-term unemployed and youth employment.  The Department simply must get a grasp on these issues and make sure it helps people to find confidence in the first instance because sometimes they have been out of work for a long time.  Moreover, some young people have never worked and again have lost confidence.  Consequently, there is a huge body of work to be done and all that requires resources.  LEOs and further colleges of education are excellent at getting people back into work.  There also are conversion courses, as well as the new apprentice model, and I will be pushing that to make sure this happens for younger people in particular.  These are the areas on which I will focus and for which I will ensure resources are made available to make sure that jobs are created.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about more money for the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  Such an increase is included in the programme for Government, which allocates &euro;200 million for the IDA and &euro;300 million for Enterprise Ireland over the next five years.

The briefing, on page 33, shows us that Microfinance Ireland, MFI, since it was set up in late 2012, approved &euro;14.1 million in loans to 944 businesses supporting just over 2,000 jobs across all sectors and every county, and in 2015 approximately two thirds of approved loans went to support start-up companies.  Later, the briefing states that its funding does not feature in the 2016 Estimate although it is possible that a second tranche of funding to MFI will feature in 2017.<\/p> <p>  I make the wider point that in terms of return for finance, although we do not know the quality of the jobs which I referred to earlier as being an issue here, it would seem that this is a good investment in terms of supporting local start-ups.  Given my particular interest and knowing that there are many around the country who would be looking for finance, there are many renewable energy projects at a community level that could be financed in this way.  Could the Minister explain why there is no funding listed in the 2016 Estimate for MFI, and if this is one of the areas that perhaps Deputy Donnelly was referring to that the Minister thinks should not be funded so much?  Is it not value for money?  What is going on here?  Could we try to support local start-ups a little better?  We seem to be throwing a lot of support at the big companies.  I am concerned also about the small ones, as, I am sure, is the Minister.

The impetus is from the grassroots and communities.<\/p> <p>  I was recently invited to my own little village, Milltown, which has probably 200 residents.  It was remarkable to note the amount of enterprise in that little village.  It includes agrifood enterprises and indigenous small community businesses.

I heard Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith make points on it but there are hundreds of thousands of people employed.  Let us not forget the retail sector.  Some 275,000 people are employed right across the sector.  I actually chaired the Retail Consultation Forum and put it on my list to ensure that we do our very best for our towns and villages.  Owing to the trickle-down effect, people with jobs and spending power can go to retailers and spend.  This is so important.  It all leads back to having a job.  A job gives pleasure and boosts morale.  That is why it is so important.  The Department works really hard in this regard.

This investment underpins enterprise development and drives commercialisation of research to build national competitive advantage across our economy.  In 2016, the programme will provide funding of over &euro;330 million to support strategic investments in research, development and innovation, in addition to the development of human capital.  This funding specifically supports the activities of a number of offices and agencies, namely, Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, which supports the research, development and innovation programmes, the Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutes, the Tyndall National Institute, and the Patents Office.  The funding also supports Ireland's membership of a number of international research organisations, including the European Space Agency.  This investment to date has been key in embedding a national, world-class innovation system.  It has allowed Ireland to become a leading location for scientific endeavour, attracting world-renowned companies providing much-needed, well-paid and sustainable employment.  Over the past decade and a half, Ireland has built up a strong science base and has steadily improved its ranking on the European Innovation Scoreboard, having moved from tenth place to sixth in 2016.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland has already delivered more than 640 of its targeted 850 collaborative research projects for 2016.  It has already surpassed its target for member companies of its industry-led technology centres.<\/p><p> Later this year, I will launch a new Enterprise Ireland-IDA Ireland meat technology centre to support food innovation.  The period 2015-2016 also sees Enterprise Ireland expanding its technology gateway network in order to support local industry's innovation needs.<\/p><p> Science Foundation Ireland invests in academic researchers and research teams to generate new knowledge, produce leading edge technologies and support the development of competitive enterprises, particularly in the fields of science, technology, engineering and maths.  Already this year, it has made 175 awards, including &euro;40 million in funding, to more than 200 researchers across 24 major research projects, as part of its investigators' programme.  A significant portion of SFI's budget is committed to ongoing funding of industry-relevant research at its 12 large-scale research centres, with the involvement of more than 200 companies.<\/p><p> In terms of international programmes, through Ireland's membership of the European Space Agency, Irish companies are on target to secure more than &euro;12 million in contracts in 2016 to develop and deliver technologies and projects.<\/p><p> Horizon 2020 is the EU's programme to support research and innovation.  Ireland has a national target to win &euro;1.25 billion in funding over the lifetime of the programme.  To date, we have won more than &euro;247 million in funding, which is ahead of our national target.<\/p><p> The publication of Innovation 2020 last December represented an important milestone in the ongoing evolution of Ireland's research system.  To date, of 53 actions identified for initiation in 2016, three have been successfully completed and the remaining 50 are in progress.  All of this investment is helping to ensure that there is an impact. <\/p><p> In 2016, we will continue to drive the commercialisation of Irish research.  In addition, we will deliver more than 30 new spin-out companies.  We will also meet our 2016 target of 125 technologies for transfer into industry from the higher education sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016092200002#K00700","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474551000,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.

I will give an example.  In her initial contribution, the Minister said we needed well paid and sustainable employment.  The public hiring framework for researchers in this area is very restrictive.  The entry salary is &euro;32,000.  They are not allowed to provide increments for any private sector experience or for any foreign academic experience.  They are allowed to provide increments for public service.  For example, someone who has spent ten years working in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on bovine inoculation can be paid significantly in excess of &euro;32,000.  However, an employer with SFI money who wants to hire an Oxford professor or someone from Google or Facebook can only hire that person on a salary of &euro;32,000.

The regulation programme funds the activities of a number of offices within my Department, such as the Companies Registration Office, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, the Labour Court, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, which is coming to an end, and the Low Pay Commission.  The programme also supports the activities of agencies such as the Health and Safety Authority, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority.<\/p> <p>  As regards activities so far in 2016 under the regulation programme, the committee will be aware that a new director general, Oonagh Buckley, has recently been appointed to the WRC.  Kevin Foley has been appointed as the chair of the Labour Court.  I know members of the committee will join me in wishing them both well in their new challenging roles.<\/p> <p>  The committee may also be aware that the Low Pay Commission recently presented its report to me in respect of the national minimum wage.  The report, which recommended increasing the national minimum wage for an experienced adult worker to &euro;9.25 per hour, has been brought to Government and will be considered as part of budget 2017.  <\/p> <p>  The committee will know that reform of the workplace relations body has been the most significant reorganisation of the State's industrial relations and employment rights machinery in almost 70 years.  The workplace relations reform programme is nearing the completion of the process to implement newly designed world-class workplace relations services, which are simple to use, independent, effective, impartial and cost-effective.  One of the main elements of this reform was the establishment of the WRC in October 2015.  The commission's new strategic plan for 2016 to 2018 sets out how the commission will provide effective dispute resolution services, implement the newly established adjudication services and put in place revised inspection and enforcement arrangements.  The WRC also has new targets to be achieved within the life of the plan to reduce waiting times for cases before it to three months from date of receipt and to ensure its decisions are issued within 28 days.  I will be monitoring the new body's progress in meeting these targets.<\/p> <p>  The official launch of the new online application processing system for employment permits will take place in the coming weeks.  This was one of my Department's commitments in the action plan for jobs.<\/p> <p>  The committee will also be aware of the establishment of the CCPC on 31 October 2015.  The commission has a strategy statement up to 2018 and prioritisation principles.  It has developed its work plans which set out its work targets for 2016.  A new responsibility for the CCPC arose from the enactment of the grocery goods regulations.  The CCPC is working closely with those retailers affected in order to promote a culture of compliance.<\/p> <p>  I will leave my introductory comments on programme C at that.

The WRC rearrangement will probably take some time to bed down but it will be beneficial in the long term.  Up to now, someone applying for retribution because employment law was not being fairly applied could wait four or five years to have an unfair dismissals case heard.  Hopefully, this will end and workers' cases will be heard within a reasonable period.<\/p><p>The number of Health and Safety Authority, HSA, inspections has increased quite significantly.  A former Deputy, Joe Higgins, once famously said that there were more dog licence inspectors in the country than there were workplace inspectors.  Thankfully, this has changed and there has been quite a rise in the number of workplace inspections by the HSA.  Is the Minister satisfied with that level of inspection?  Is she satisfied that we have enough inspectors?  Given that at least one fatal accident has taken place in the construction industry recently, does she think we might need to increase the number of inspections, particularly in the area of construction?<\/p><p>I am concerned - as, I am sure, are the company's former workers - about the timeframe for legislation and the outcome of the investigation into what happened at Clerys.  It is not lost on workers that heaven and earth are moved very quickly when an issue such as the Apple tax case arises but it seems to drag on when it comes to the question of retribution, equality and justice for workers.<\/p><p>I want to talk about the Low Pay Commission.  When it was announced that an extra 10 cent per hour would be added to the national minimum wage, I felt personally responsible and embarrassed because it dawned on me that I am a member of this committee.  In the name of God, what is the commission thinking when it decides to give 10 cent per hour to workers when even the programme for a partnership Government contains a commitment to bring the minimum wage up to &euro;10.50 per hour within its lifetime?  If the process continues at the pace, it will be 2028 before we get to &euro;10.50 per hour.  For the Low Pay Commission to say to so many workers throughout the country that they should get an extra 10 cent is an appalling outcome.  It might as well have given them nothing.  The increase is insulting.  When we discussed programme A, the Minister said she is very determined to promote foreign direct investment, that these are all very good jobs which pay very well, that getting people back to work is her priority, that she is particularly concerned about women and young people and that she thinks having a job must be a pleasure and a boost to someone's morale.  Adding 10 cent per hour to the minimum wage, which is already at the very low level of &euro;9.15, is a kick in the teeth to people in the context of their morale.  When the Minister looks at this, she must take into consideration the fact that everything from rent to mortgages to insurance costs to the price of medication has increased quite considerable in this country and not at the rate of the cost of living index.  The cost of insurance has increased by 40% or 50%.  The latest report from <i>daft.ie<\/i>shows that rents have increased by 12% in places such as Dublin and Cork.  How does the Minister explain low-paid workers being offered an extra 10 cent per hour?  None of us in this House is working for that kind of money nor would we.<\/p><p>Edel McGinley produced statistics showing that most low-paid people are in the hospitality, food and retail sectors where profits in the past couple of years have spiked above what they were before the crash.  How we do explain offering workers in these industries, most of whom are women and young people, an insulting ten cent per hour?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016092200002#N01000","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1474551000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>That is something the committee might look at when we-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016092200002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1474551000,"counter":237,"content":"<p>It is part of this section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016092200002#O00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1474551000,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I will deal with the national minimum wage.

Data on the impact of the last rise in the national minimum wage to &euro;9.15 has not yet become available.  The national minimum wage affects many small Irish businesses in the retail, hospitality and food sector which often operate in rural areas and whose profit margins can be very low.  These were the aspects that were taken into consideration.  The Low Pay Commission looked at the impact of a rise in the national minimum wage on Border areas where the recovery has been slow.  Sterling exchange rates may have a particular impact in these areas.  It also gauged the impact of Brexit on certain sectors like retail and hospitality.  I understand that the setting of the national minimum wage divides opinion.  I would have liked if we could have given &euro;10 or &euro;20 but that is not what happened.  When the Low Pay Commission discussed the national minimum wage, it was about achieving the right balance for the circumstances.  It is important to make the right decision for the country.  This Government has stated that we support increasing the national minimum wage to &euro;10.50 by 2021 but the programme for a partnership Government states clearly that the Government will rely on the annual recommendations of the Low Pay Commission in respect of the level of adjustment each year.  We must now decide if we accept the expert recommendation of the Low Pay Commission based on its analysis, its public consultation and its meetings with all interests.  The Low Pay Commission has stated that incremental increases in the national minimum wage do not harm growth.  A sudden sharp increase may harm growth and employment levels.

I am concerned about the rate of remuneration for certain members of the commission.  The chair of the Low Pay Commission earned &euro;22,493 from 2015 to the first quarter of 2016.  In that period, according to a response to a parliamentary question I asked, he attended 22 meetings.  That works out roughly at &euro;1,000 per meeting.  The same person has the nerve to recommend a ten cent increase for workers on the minimum wage.  Surely if ever there was an example of gross hypocrisy, this is it.  Deputy Smith outlined it quite well.  It is embarrassing and insulting and will go nowhere towards reaching the minimum wage we need or even any progress towards a living wage.

One member, Professor Donal O'Neill, does not receive fees in accordance with the \"one person, one salary\" principle.  I have a list of the amounts that were received by the different members of the commission.  The commission met on 11 occasions from September to June.  It received a significant number of submissions from various groups and individuals with an interest in the national minimum wage.  The chairman and members of the commission also met on two occasions in Monaghan and Dublin with a wide range of interests.  They included individual workers and businesses, employers and employee representative groups and community and voluntary sector organisations.  This enabled the commission to get as broad an understanding as possible of the issues relating to the minimum wage.  As well as attendance at meetings, members are required to spend time reading, reviewing and assessing material.  This includes submissions from various bodies and interest groups, relevant studies and reports in areas relating to low pay and a considerable amount of economic and statistical data.<\/p> <p>  The commission is working on two additional reports we requested.

We are seven months into this D&aacute;il and we have yet to sit down with the Minister and have time on both sides to explore anything.  The observation relates to the vulture funds.  I would like to formally raise it with the Minister.  There are many legitimate Irish companies trading, registered and paying taxes in Ireland who would like to be able to bid for NAMA portfolios or other portfolios.  They are bidding against foreign companies who are acting legally in this country but who are paying no tax due to the tax laws here.  I wanted to raise the issue with the Minister because it is a very serious competition issue and it would appear to give very unfair advantage to foreign vulture funds over Irish banks and pension funds.  The Minister does not need to comment on it.  I just wanted to formally raise it with her.  I think it is very relevant to her brief and we have not had a chance in this committee to talk about anything other than expenditure so far.<\/p> <p>  There seems to be a great opportunity to streamline compliance and regulation for business, particularly SMEs.

Many fall from heights of 9 ft. or 10 ft., for example, when they go up onto a shed, fall through and get killed.<\/p> <p>  The other message is about reverse parking, which had to be explained to me.  When farmers are leaving their tractors or machinery at night they should reverse park into the spot where they are going to leave it.  That prevents situations where they come back out in the morning and do not see a child or older person who has followed them.

N&iacute; haon dochar ard&uacute; leis an Roinn an pointe a d'ardaigh an Teachta Moynihan maidir leis na scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al, scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; a bh&iacute; ann le fada, agus an chaoi go bhfuair an Roinn r&eacute;idh leo ag &uacute;s&aacute;id g&eacute;arch&eacute;im airgeadais na t&iacute;re ar bhealach suarach agus, i mo thuairim, pearsanta.  Is beag airgid a bh&iacute; i gceist ach ba spreagadh iontach &eacute; do scol&aacute;ir&iacute; i gceantair Gaeltachta.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom gur cheist airgid a bh&iacute; i gceist agus b'fh&eacute;idir gur cheist &iacute; sin gur fi&uacute; a ard&uacute; leis an Roinn.<\/p> <p>  T&aacute; roinnt ceisteanna a bh&iacute; spesi&uacute;il ansin maidir leis an gc&oacute;ras oideachais go ginear&aacute;lta agus scoileanna.  T&aacute; an ceart ag an Teachta Moynihan gur scoileanna beaga iad formh&oacute;r na scoileanna Gaeltachta, go h&aacute;irithe bunscoileanna.  T&aacute; an-tionchar ar na scoileanna sin ar an nGaeilge sa cheantar agus ar an gceantar tr&iacute; ch&eacute;ile.  Mar a luaigh an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v n&iacute;os luaithe, t&aacute; na ceantair Gaeltachta ar fad faoi bhr&uacute;, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in &oacute; thaobh cursa&iacute; Gaeilge de ach &oacute; thaobh inmharthanachta.  I gceantar Chonamara, mar shampla, d&uacute;nadh bunscoil i mbliana agus t&aacute; slad eile acu at&aacute; ag moilli&uacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; de bharr p&aacute;tr&uacute;n na t&iacute;re &oacute; thaobh an l&iacute;on duine at&aacute; ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; faoin dtuath, chomh maith le ruda&iacute; practici&uacute;la ar n&oacute;s an deacracht a bh&iacute;onn ag daoine cead plean&aacute;la a fh&aacute;il ina gceantair f&eacute;in.  T&aacute; siad ag bogadh amach &oacute;na gceantair d&aacute; bharr.  B'fh&eacute;idir gur obair bhaile eile &eacute; sin.<\/p> <p>  Maidir le na scoileanna, d&uacute;radh liom go mbeadh an polasa&iacute; oideachais Gaeltachta &aacute; sheoladh an mh&iacute; seo.  N&iacute; cos&uacute;il anois go mbeidh.  Beimid ag faire amach agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh cuid de na freagra&iacute; sna polasa&iacute; oideachais Gaeltachta.  Caithfear aitheantas a thabhairt don Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna ar an mbealach a thug s&eacute; faoin bpr&oacute;is&eacute;is seo.<\/p><p>Bh&iacute; an t-uaf&aacute;s cruinnithe ag an Roinn sna ceantair Ghaeltachta uilig.  Bh&iacute; pr&oacute;iseas buy-in an-mhaith &oacute;n phobal agus bh&iacute; an chuma ar an sc&eacute;al go dt&iacute; seo go raibh na hoifigigh a bh&iacute; ag pl&eacute; leis an gceist seo sa Roinn go hioml&aacute;n tiomanta don phr&oacute;iseas seo.

Mar shampla, f&eacute;adfadh m&uacute;inteoir amh&aacute;in a bheith ag freastal ar c&uacute;pla scoil.  F&eacute;adfadh c&oacute;ras pr&iacute;omhoideach l&aacute;rnach a bheith ag d&eacute;anamh an obair bainist&iacute;ochta ar fad ar cheithre n&oacute; c&uacute;ig scoil seachas an ceithre n&oacute; c&uacute;ig scoil sin agus an pr&iacute;omhoide ag caitheamh leathl&aacute; n&oacute; l&aacute; ioml&aacute;n ag pl&eacute; le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; riarach&aacute;in.  Scaoilf&iacute; saor iad le bheith ag m&uacute;ineadh sa scoil f&eacute;in.<\/p><p> Ar&iacute;s, th&aacute;inig roinnt mhaith molta&iacute; ar aghaidh maidir le c&eacute;n chaoi a bhfuil na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; in ann d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an measc&aacute;n teanga at&aacute; ann anois.  Mar shampla, bh&iacute; cruinni&uacute; againn anuraidh ag troid le haghaidh an dara mh&uacute;inteoir a fh&aacute;il le haghaidh Scoil Inis Me&aacute;in, mar shampla, &aacute;it a bhfuil pobal f&iacute;or-bheag.  L&eacute;irigh Orlaith Breathnach, pr&iacute;omhoide na scoile sin, ag an cruinni&uacute; i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath, an measc&aacute;n at&aacute; ann.  Ceapaim go bhfuil deichni&uacute;r sa scoil.  N&iacute;l na figi&uacute;ir go hioml&aacute;n cruinn agam ach t&aacute; roinnt acu sin a bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu mar an teanga baile, do chuid eile acu B&eacute;arla &eacute; agus do chuid eile ar&iacute;s ceapaim gur Polainnis &eacute;, mar daoine at&aacute; tar &eacute;is bogadh isteach iad.  T&aacute; measc&aacute;n aisteach sa scoil agus t&aacute; g&aacute; le teacht ar aghaidh le pr&oacute;iseas gur f&eacute;idir d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an dream at&aacute; ag teacht isteach gan Ghaeilge ach gan dochar a dh&eacute;anamh do na p&aacute;ist&iacute; at&aacute; ag teacht isteach sa ch&oacute;ras gur cainteoir&iacute; &oacute; dh&uacute;chas iad.  Beidh le feice&aacute;il &oacute; thaobh an pholasa&iacute; sin c&eacute;n toradh a bheidh ann.  Le bheith f&eacute;ar&aacute;ilte don Roinn, ceapaim go raibh gach duine an-t&oacute;gtha leis an gcaoi gur thugadh faoi.  Is ceist anois &eacute; an mbeidh an Roinn s&aacute;sta maoini&uacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il.<\/p><p> &Oacute; thaobh na exceptions agus na exemptions, agus ag dul leis an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; an Cathaoirleach ag r&aacute; ag an t&uacute;s, t&aacute; roinnt ruda&iacute; nach bhfuil m&eacute; in ann a r&aacute;.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh taighde foilsithe an bhliain seo chugainn a thabharfaidh toradh n&iacute;os fearr d&uacute;inn ar sin.  Is gr&uacute;pa eile at&aacute; ag pl&eacute; leis.  N&iacute; mhaith liom an t-ainm a lua.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh eolas ceart againn faoi c&eacute; at&aacute; ag cur isteach ar na exemptions seo.  Mar shampla, an bhfuil daoine ann a bhfuil ag cur isteach ar exemptions don Ghaeilge ach a bhfuil bre&aacute; s&aacute;sta dul ar aghaidh agus an Fraincis n&oacute; an Gearmainis a dh&eacute;anamh?  Tiocfaimid ar sin.<\/p><p> Tuigim an pointe at&aacute; ardaithe maidir le ceist na district electoral divisions, DEDs, agus rang&uacute; na ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Cinnte t&aacute; obair le d&eacute;anamh ansin i roinnt ceantair, i gceantar an Teachta Moynihan ach go h&aacute;irithe agus ceantar T&iacute;r Chonaill chomh maith.

Muna nd&eacute;anfar &eacute; sin, n&iacute; &eacute;iroidh leis an rud.  Ceapaim go gcaithfear &eacute; sin a chur san &aacute;ireamh in ullmh&uacute; an phlean teanga agus ansin ag feidhmi&uacute; an phlean teanga f&eacute;in.<\/p><p> Ar&iacute;s, chun a bheith f&eacute;ar&aacute;ilte, ceapaim go bhfuil obair mhaith &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh go dt&iacute; seo ag &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta mar chuid den ch&oacute;ras seo.  &Eacute; sin r&aacute;ite, caithfear a r&aacute; nach mb&iacute;onn an sainmh&iacute;ni&uacute; c&eacute;anna ag gach duine ar plean&aacute;il teanga.  Mar a luaigh m&eacute; n&iacute;os luaithe, leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute;imid ag &eacute;ileamh ar na pobail f&eacute;in a dh&eacute;anamh leis seo, caithfimid an taca&iacute;ocht cheart a chur ar f&aacute;il chun na pleananna seo a dh&eacute;anamh agus a fheidhmi&uacute;.
