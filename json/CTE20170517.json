They are to ensure that when restorative justice is provided, it will only take place in circumstances where safeguards are respected.<\/p><p>The reasons given for the absence of restorative justice in the Bill were that the services are not available nationwide and there is no statutory basis for the services.  I do not think either of these reasons is good enough to leave it out of this legislation.  Restorative justice is an incredibly valuable process for both the victim and for the perpetrator.  Obviously, the victim is given a chance to confront somebody who has committed a crime which many have found incredibly empowering.  For the perpetrator, it can be a first step in understanding the damage of what they have done.<\/p><p>Many of the NGOs, non-governmental organisations, in the area have commented on this and have actively argued for its inclusion in the legislation.  Article 4 of the victims' directive already states that victims must be informed on first contact with the Garda of the available restorative justice services.  Article 12 provides that member states shall take measures to safeguard the victim from secondary and repeat victimisation, from intimidation and from retaliation when providing any restorative justice services.<\/p><p>That is what is in the grouping of amendments.  I will not read it.  The Deputy and the Minister of State have read it.  There are a number of safeguards.  I gave an example on Second Stage where a judge recommended restorative justice in wholly inappropriate circumstances where a victim of child sex abuse was asked by a judge if she wanted to engage in restorative justice with the perpetrator.  The perpetrator had not accepted the facts of the case and had not accepted the guilty verdict, and was not in any place to engage.  Obviously, the person was put on the spot.<\/p><p> It is important to have the provision, but we need to have safeguards, which is the purpose of this grouping of amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017051700002#B01900","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495008000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I agree with what Deputy Daly has said.

I fully agree that such provision is necessary and I assure Deputies that I intend to make provision for the rights of victims who participate in restorative justice practices in the Bill.  I regret that I have not been able to bring forward these amendments today.  As I informed the House on Second Stage, there are legal issues regarding the most appropriate text for the provision, given the non-statutory nature of restorative justice practices available in the State.  I have just recently received preliminary advices from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to inform the committee that a provision, not dissimilar from those proposed in the amendments before us, will be possible.  Ensuring that the specific wording of the provision does not interfere with or prevent the operation of existing restorative justice services is very important, as is protecting the provisions from legal challenge.  I ask Deputies to give me the time to bring forward amendments that will meet these aims.<\/p> <p>  Legal advice has also suggested that specific provision should be made for the rights of victims engaging in restorative justice practices in the case of child offenders.  The Children Act 2001 provides for a role for victims in the administration of cautions and in family conferences under the juvenile diversion programme.  Deputies will appreciate that care needs to be taken to ensure an appropriate balance between the rights of victims and the rights of child offenders in these circumstances.  Amendments to provide the necessary changes to the Children Act are under consideration, in consultation with the Garda, the Irish Youth Justice Service and the Young Person's Probation Service.

I understand what the Deputies are seeking to achieve but I do not believe that the amendment is either necessary or represents an effective manner of achieving the desired end.  I will explain why.<\/p><p>In the first instance, it is necessary to state clearly the<i>de facto<\/i>position in the Bill.  There is nothing in the definition of &quot;victim&quot; to suggest in any way that an offender might have to be identified, apprehended, prosecuted or convicted for a person to be a victim for the purposes of the Bill.  In fact, it is clear that in many circumstances, for example, at first contact before a complaint has even been made, it would be impossible for an offender to have been apprehended or prosecuted.  Moreover, there is no suggestion that the relationship between the victim and the offender could have any bearing on whether a person is a victim.<\/p><p>Why put it in?  Is it to be sure?  There are two reasons.  The first is that a single definition of &quot;victim&quot; is used throughout the Bill for clarity and consistency.  As such, that definition must be appropriate to all the provisions where the word is used.  Many provisions in the Bill specifically require that certain conditions, which are excluded in the amendment, are met.  For a victim to receive information on the charging, remand or trial of an accused, it is necessary for an offender to be identified and prosecuted.  For a victim to receive information from the Prison Service, it is necessary for an offender to have been convicted of an offence.  For a garda to conduct an assessment and take into account the particular vulnerability of a victim of violence in a close relationship, he or she must have regard to the relationship between the victim and the offender.<\/p><p>The intention seems to be to amend the definition of &quot;victim&quot; to apply it regardless of all these factors.  In the case of many provisions throughout the Bill that would create contradictions in its application.<\/p><p>There is a benefit to maintaining the definition exactly as it is in the directive to ensure any future judgment of the European Court of Justice will directly apply to our national legislation.  The definition in the Bill has been drafted to ensure that any person who has suffered any harm as a result of a criminal offence is a victim and is, therefore, entitled to avail of rights under the Bill.<\/p><p>For the information of Deputy O'Callaghan, the Government amendment to section 4 will address to some extent the general concerns raised.  That amendment is broader in nature and will ensure that a victim need only assert that he or she has been a victim of an offence and suffered harm.  No proof is required.  It is all on the side of the victim in this case.  A victim need only say that he or she is a victim.  That is covered in section 4.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017051700002#D00100","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1495008000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I take the point the Minister of State is making but I remain unsure.

Amendment No. 14 is simple and was proposed on the advice of Rape Crisis Network Ireland to provide more detail of the kinds of support that victims should be informed of on first contact with the authorities for the avoidance of doubt.  The Minister of State will surely say that garda&iacute; would specify medical supports, appropriate specialist services, psychological supports and alternative accommodation, and maybe they would, but maybe they would not.  Some garda&iacute; might not consider alternative accommodation to be a necessary support.

The organisations at the coalface believe that it would be an addition.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 28 has been ruled out of order.  Amendment No. 30 concerns referrals to appropriate support services.  The rationale for this is that section 6(8) provides that a \"member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or an officer of the Ombudsman Commission... may, where a victim consents, arrange for the victim to be referred to a service\" whereas the victims directive refers to \"shall\".  The directive also refers to victims having access to confidential victim support services and so on in accordance with their needs.

As they stated, this group contains a number of objectives on the provision of victim support services.  I will go through each amendment in turn.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 elaborate on what support services are to be included in the term \"services\" by including some types of service but not others.  This might be ill advised.  The term \"services providing support for victims\" is well enough understood in practice in the criminal justice system and among garda&iacute; in particular not to require further elaboration.  It also has the benefit of being broad enough to encompass new types of service that may emerge in future.  To define in law what is envisaged by these services could also lead to one or more specialist services falling outside the definition, with potential challenges to their future funding as victim services.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality funds 58 services for victims of crime.  Among the services provided are information, emotional support, referral to other services, counselling, accompaniment to courts, Garda stations and sexual assault treatment units.<\/p><p>Tusla also provides funding to a wide range of domestic violence services, domestic violence refuges and sexual violence services.  Domestic violence victims can be referred on to housing authorities in appropriate circumstances.  Services are provided to victims of general crime, families of homicide victims, tourist victims, child victims, victims of domestic and sexual violence, adult victims of childhood sexual abuse and victims of abuse in medical settings.  Services are provided by phone and text, face to face, one to one and in groups.  It is also to be anticipated in the future that some services using online methods will be developed.<\/p><p> I am of the view that there is a real risk, in specifying a few particular services from among the wide range of victim supports available, that we are creating a hierarchy of services which may impact the services which are prioritised for inclusion in information material and advice and, indeed, in funding.<\/p><p> The EU directive requires member states to facilitate the referral of victims to victim support services.  This is implemented in the current legislation in section 6(1)(a), by requiring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Garda Ombudsman Commission, on first contact with a victim, to offer every victim information on services providing support for victims of crime.<\/p><p> The purpose of section 6(8) is to enable a victim, with their consent, to be referred to a victim support service.  This will happen regularly and at all times of the day or night, for example where a victim who has been recently raped is in contact with police.  In that case, the police will usually bring the victim to a sexual assault treatment unit.  In that unit, medical staff will care medically for the victim and may take forensic evidence, which will be given to the Garda.  The Garda will offer to phone a rape crisis centre on behalf of the victim, with the victim's consent, and to have a volunteer meet the victim at the medical unit to provide emotional and practical support.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 require referrals to appropriate or specialist services.  As I have already outlined, in circumstances where a victim is directly referred to a support service, that referral is to the specific specialist service, such as the sexual assault treatment unit or rape crisis services the victim requires. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017051700002#F03000","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495008000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I disagree with the Minister's analysis of the amendment.

It refers to \"services providing for victims, including where relevant\" so it does not exclude any other service.  It states that we need to include, where relevant, the medical support and appropriate specialist services, including psychological support.  The wording in Article 4.1(a) of the directive is, \"where relevant, basic information about access to medical support, any specialist support, including psychological support and alternative accommodation\".

Their experience suggests that this amendment should be included.  Our amendment to change \"may\" to \"shall\" has been ruled out of order.  Only the Minister can do that but the directive is very clear on the matter.  It states that member states shall ensure that victims, in accordance with their needs, have access to these types of support services.  The word \"shall\" has to be there, even if we cannot put it in.  The fact that we mention some supports does not mean others are excluded and appropriate specialist services are incredibly important, because this puts the onus back on garda&iacute;.  It would be inappropriate to refer a victim of domestic violence to a psychotherapist or to refuse to refer somebody but the Act, as currently constructed, could allow for both of these.

It was in the hope that the Minister of State would look at this amendment.  It is important that if one looks at section 6(4) which states: &quot;a victim may be accompanied by a person or persons of his or her choice, including his or her legal representative, when contacting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Ombudsman Commission for the first time in respect of an alleged offence&quot; one then goes forward to section 6(5) which states: &quot;Where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or an officer of the Ombudsman Commission, as the case may be, reasonably believes that the presence of a person referred to in subsection (4), including a legal representative, would be contrary to the best interests of the victim or would prejudice any investigation or criminal proceedings regarding the alleged offence, the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or officer of the Ombudsman Commission, as the case may be, may require that the person absent himself or herself prior to the member or officer concerned engaging further with the victim.&quot;  <\/p><p>We ask the Minister of State to include the additional section proposed by our amendment which states that where that does happen, and where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Ombudsman Commission makes a request as referred to in section 6(5), that a victim would be given reasonable opportunity to make alternative arrangements for somebody to accompany him or her, where the substitution of the individual by another suitable person would answer the concerns of the member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the commission.  That is important because if somebody goes to make a complaint and, for whatever reason, the garda or the officer of the commission decides that an accompanying person should absent himself or herself in the best interests of the victim, the victim should be given an opportunity to seek somebody else to accompany him or her in making that complaint.  <\/p><p>We wish to include this section to make it very clear that if that does happen the victim would be given reasonable opportunity to make such an alternative arrangement.

Perhaps we are doing so in slightly different ways and we may have to throw everything into the pot to come up with a compromise by Report Stage.  I am not sure.  In terms of amendment No. 24 and the alternative support person, Articles 3(3) and 20(c) of the directive provide that the victim may be accompanied by a person of their choice on first contact, including legal representation, but that the garda or the Ombudsman Commission can object if they believe it is not in the victim's best interest or if it would prejudice an investigation.  If we are talking about circumstances where a victim's support person can be asked to leave, that could potentially leave the victim in a very vulnerable situation.  I am trying to give the victim the opportunity to choose the alternative in those circumstances.  The guidelines produced by the Directorate-Generale Justice on this directive state on page 42:<\/p><blockquote>Only in exceptional circumstances should the possibility to be accompanied by a person of the victim&rsquo;s choice be limited, and then only in relation to a specific person. If this happens, the victim should be able to choose another person.<\/blockquote> <p>It would be really bizarre for us to make legislative provisions for a support person or a solicitor on point of first contact, but then to leave a hole for that right to be taken away without an appeal.  I know Deputies O'Brien and O'Callaghan are trying to do the same thing.  With regard to Deputy O'Brien's amendment I am a little bit concerned that, based on the wording, it might be left open to the garda&iacute; to refuse the second person.  Perhaps it is not.  If we are talking about the garda&iacute; substituting a second person that could then be refused, the garda&iacute; might then continue like that so that the victim never gets an appropriate alternative person.  I wonder about that.<\/p><p>Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment explicitly states that the victim shall be given &quot;reasonable opportunity&quot; to choose someone else if an investigator deems their first choice unsuitable.  Again, I am not sure.  I think our amendment is probably better on this issue.  We are all obviously trying to do the same thing.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 65 leaves no latitude in the legislation to allow the garda&iacute; to get someone to leave a room, or to leave a victim alone at any time, without the option of a replacement or an appeal.  That would be completely inappropriate as far as I am concerned.  Amendment No. 76 gives the victim the choice of an alternative person at the stage of interview and medical examination if the garda&iacute; rejected their first choice, which is not specified by the other amendments.

The victim is present in a voluntary capacity to get help and is not being charged with anything.  The victim is at all times free to come or go and make such arrangements as he or she wishes in respect of an alternative accompanying person.  If a victim wants someone else to come in, there is no difficulty with that.<\/p><p> The effect of the provisions allowing a victim to be accompanied is that they prevent the Garda from excluding an accompanying person without reasonable grounds.  The victim has, and continues to have, at all times a right to be accompanied at first contact when making a complaint or at interview.  These amendments have no actual effect other than by implication to suggest that the victim would somehow otherwise not be free to come or go or make such arrangements as he or she wished.<\/p><p> There is no difficulty whatsoever in a victim bringing in someone else to replace the person who has been excluded.  Obviously, garda&iacute; would have good reasons for excluding a person.  We can appreciate what those might be and they are for the good of the victim at all times.  The victim is free to come and go, is not under any charge or the like, can take a break at any time, etc.  There is no need for these amendments in that regard.  The Deputies might keep in mind that the victim is not under arrest or compelled to stay and can leave at any time that he or she wishes.  Victims can make any phone calls or bring in anyone else whom they want.  There is no difficulty in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017051700002#K01200","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495008000,"counter":188,"content":"<p>That may be the case when a victim decides to make first contact and make a complaint, but this follows through in the rest of the legislation, for example, the interview stages in sections 11 and 13.

The existing text of section 7 on the provision of information provides that a victim shall receive, on request, information on a decision not to institute criminal proceedings.  There are two difficulties with this.  First, the words &quot;criminal proceedings&quot; have a different meaning in the directive, where they apply to the investigation and the court proceedings, from that understood in this jurisdiction, which could give rise to confusion.  Second, section 7 does not provide for a victim to receive information where a decision is made to prosecute but that prosecution does not proceed or is withdrawn.  Section 8, rather confusingly, refers to a review of decision not to institute or proceed with criminal proceedings.<\/p><p>Amendment 39 replaces the term &quot;institute criminal proceedings&quot; with &quot;prosecute a person&quot;, which is much clearer.  Amendment 40 inserts a new paragraph into section 7(2) to ensure a victim receives information on a decision not to proceed with or to withdraw a prosecution.  It is giving the information to the person in those circumstances.<\/p><p>Amendment 54 again replaces the term &quot;institute criminal proceedings&quot; with &quot;prosecute a person&quot;.  It also deletes the reference relating to a review of a decision not &quot;to proceed&quot; with a prosecution.  This is because the decision to end a prosecution is not suitable for review, as the decision itself cannot be reversed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017051700002#P01800","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1495008000,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1495008000,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 40:<\/p><blockquote>In page 12, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:&quot;(e) information regarding a decision to discontinue the prosecution of a person for the alleged offence and a summary of the reasons for the decision;&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017051700002#P02000","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1495008000,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1495008000,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 41:<\/p><blockquote>In page 12, to delete lines 17 to 19 and substitute the following:&quot;(i) information regarding a final judgment in any trial of a person in respect of the alleged offence (and, as the case may be, any further judgment on appeal), including&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(i) where such trial is not a trial by jury, a summary of the reasons given for the judgment,<br \/><br \/>(ii) where the person is convicted of the offence, the sentence imposed on the person, if any,<br \/><br \/>(iii) any orders made by the court related to, or ancillary to, the judgment;&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017051700002#P02200","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1495008000,"counter":296,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1495008000,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 42:<\/p><blockquote>In page 12, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:&quot;(vi) any relevant conditions under which a sentence imposed on the convicted person, is suspended or part-suspended,<br \/><br \/>(vii) any relevant post-release supervision order conditions imposed on the convicted person.&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017051700002#P02400","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1495008000,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 42 was discussed with amendment No. 3.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017051700002#P02500","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1495008000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Apparently the amendment was not discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017051700002#P02600","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1495008000,"counter":300,"content":"<p>It was discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017051700002#P02700","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1495008000,"counter":301,"content":"<p>It was in the first grouping.

The Minister does not speak of habitual residence, rather it is legal residence, which would exclude many people who are in Ireland for relatively lengthy periods.

It would exclude people who are undocumented or people who are waiting for an asylum claim to be processed under section 12.  They would not be able to go the Garda about something that happened them in their own country and enable the Garda to refer it onwards.

The investigating authority, Director of Public Prosecutions, or the presiding judge, as the case may be, shall, when considering whether the victim would benefit from special measures during the course of any criminal proceedings relating to the alleged offence, have regard to the fact that specific protection needs have been identified under <i>section 14 <\/i>in relation to the victim concerned.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>This involves letting judges know about special protection needs.  Section 14 provides for an assessment of a victim's special protection needs to be carried out and for that report to be compiled.  The amendment is saying that report should be provided to the presiding judge in the victim's case and the judge, along with the investigators and the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, shall have regard to the special protection needs identified under section 14 during the course of the proceedings.  The reason for this is to assess whether the person has any special needs in the conduct of the court case.  The treatment of some victims of sexual violence in particular and how they have been dealt with in the courts has been a talking point because it has been incredibly problematic for people who have been re-traumatised by their treatment in court.  There should be no excuse for the judge not knowing how vulnerable a person is.  That should not in any way undermine the trial.  It does not invalidate the rights of the accused or anything like that.  It is just a matter of being aware of their vulnerability.  I feel quite strongly about this because judges' mishandling of cases of sexual violence have been well documented in the media and in some instances this has been arguably almost worse than the original offence.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 114 is similar to Deputy O'Callaghan's and Deputy O'Brien's amendments in this area.  It is pretty self-explanatory.  It proposes that victims of domestic or sexual crime can be accompanied by a support worker unless the court orders otherwise.  That is critical because they go through the legal process alone at a time when they are vulnerable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017051700002#R01000","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1495008000,"counter":354,"content":"<p>The details of my amendment No. 109 are similar to those outlined by Deputy Daly.

While I have sympathy with what Deputy Daly says about the needs of the victim and how important it is that everyone is aware of them, I want to point out some of the consequences of this amendment.  The concerns about it are fairly fundamental.  If the assessment report were to be given to the judge, there would also be an obligation to disclose it to the defence.  The Bill has been drafted very carefully to ensure these assessment reports do not become part of the criminal proceedings to prevent disclosure to the defence and any possible cross-examination of the victim regarding their contents.<\/p><p>Assessments will frequently contain sensitive and confidential personal information regarding the victim and his or her personal circumstances, including vulnerabilities to victimisation and intimidation.  It would be very inappropriate for such information to be disclosed to the defence.  These amendments provide that assessments would have to be provided to every District Court judge.  Assessments may contain information on previous offences or orders relating to other previous conduct by the accused which pose a risk to the victim.  If the case were a summary case, this could be prejudicial to the rights of the accused as the judge would have been provided detailed information on the victim, the offender and the offence from the victim's perspective.  The Deputy can see that basic issues arise here which I am sure are not intended by the amendment.  I do not think it would be right to go down that route for the obvious reasons of all that information being given in a way that could be damaging.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 108, 109 and 114 provide a right for a victim to be accompanied in court by a support worker.  They mirror new provisions in the Domestic Violence Bill 2017 which make a similar provision for a victim of domestic violence to be accompanied in court when applying for a safety or barring order.  However, the provision is not required in respect of criminal offences.  While domestic violence proceedings are heard <i>in camera<\/i>, criminal proceedings are heard in public.  As such, the victim has an existing right to be accompanied by any person or persons he or she wishes to accompany him or her during court proceedings.<\/p><p>There are a range of provisions on the Statute Book which provide a power for the court to exclude the public or members of the public from criminal proceedings, including section 19 of this Bill.  Such provisions generally allow for a parent, relative or friend of the victim to remain in court where other members of the public have been excluded.  I am not aware of any concerns relating to the ongoing court accompaniment of victims of sexual offences by support workers, which the Department funds.  However, I will examine these provisions to ensure they are sufficient to ensure a support worker would also be allowed to remain in court with a victim in such circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017051700002#R01400","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1495008000,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I am persuaded by what the T&aacute;naiste has had to say in respect of disclosure of reports by prosecuting authorities because if they go to a judge they necessarily go to the defence.

There was no way that we want this information being handed over to the defence or anything like that.  The aim of the amendment is to tackle the re-traumatisation of victims, as a result of some of their experiences in some of our courts, because of the way in which the Judiciary run the courts.  I know the matter strays into other issues such as judicial counsels and all the rest.  The desire was that if the judge was aware of the needs of a person and how vulnerable he or she was then the room for some of the most appalling things that have happened in our courts to recur would probably be lessened.  I will withdraw my amendment for now and will consider how it might be dealt with on Report Stage.  I would like this matter dealt with then.  All of these amendments relate to how isolating the court experience can be for a victim who is, legally, present on his or her own.  Nobody is there for him or her.  In particular, cases of sexual violence and rape are very much more intimate and personal crimes and leave people feeling very vulnerable.  In such cases the victim should be accompanied.

I am speaking of people with Down's syndrome or other such intellectual disabilities which affect their capacity to properly present.  It is all very well to refer to capacity legislation, but should there be reference to provision in respect of a situation where the victim is indeed someone of adult years but who nevertheless, because of their reduced ability, is unable or incapable of fully engaging on their own?

The issue is dealt with there in the sense that there is an obligation to take into account any capacity issues and respond to them appropriately when dealing with a person, in order that they understand it take into account any disability.  It comes under the section entitled \"Communication, interpretation and translation\".  That certainly deals with the issue of being sensitive to the personal characteristics of a person or any disability her or she may have.<\/p> <p>  The other point is that under the assessment of a victim, there is also a description of any requirements to be taken into account, which include the personal characteristics of the victim including his or her age, gender, health and so on.  I will not go through it all, but it deals with disability.  I can take the issue which the Chairman has raised and see whether there is a need for any further provision in respect of the obligation to communicate and whether we need to elaborate it any further in respect of the circumstances which he has described, or whether we feel that these two sections capture the Chairman's concerns.

Members will recall our discussion last week about the Coroners Bill 2015 and the failure of the Government to provide the money message for the Bill.  As Chairman, I undertook to take certain steps and I wish to update members now on the steps undertaken in the interim.<\/p> <p>  The first was to seek a meeting of the Working Group of Committee Chairmen through the offices of Deputy Jim Daly, who chairs the working group.  I made this request.  Deputy Daly and I did not have a meeting proper but we have since spoken.  This was superseded by the second course of action, namely, to arrange a meeting directly with the Ceann Comhairle.  This meeting took place last Wednesday.  It was also attended by the former clerk to our committee, Gina Long, representing the Bills Office; Elaine Gunn, representing the Business Committee, I understand; and the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l.  The upshot of this was that the Ceann Comhairle advised that he had corresponded on four Bills that had been presented for address by this committee - we knew he had done so because we were told after the event - and had sought an indication as to the money message being provided or not, as the case might be.  Despite this fact, almost a full month later - as of last Thursday, 11 May, the date of 12 April was long past - there was no reply to the Ceann Comhairle's letter.  I found this most extraordinary and the Ceann Comhairle concurs and intends taking up the matter.  The upshot of the meeting was that the Ceann Comhairle has sought a meeting with An Taoiseach for this week to be attended by the Ceann Comhairle; by me, as Chairman of the justice committee, which is the raising committee; and Deputy Jim Daly, as the chair of the Working Group of Committee Chairmen.  The letter was sent last Thursday.  It was drafted in my presence to be despatched shortly after the conclusion of our meeting.  I have no indication at present as to whether the meeting is being accommodated.  I will make further inquiries.<\/p> <p>  Those were the actions I undertook to take at the committee's request.  We have now brought the matter to a new plane.  Rather than addressing it as a stand-alone committee and in isolation, it will now be addressed in conjunction with Deputy Jim Daly, as the Chair of the Working Group of Committee Chairmen, and the Ceann Comhairle on behalf of the D&aacute;il and the system here.  That meeting is to take place with An Taoiseach.  As soon as we have that opportunity, we will be able to report back.  I spoke with Deputy Daly yesterday.  We have agreed that, whatever the outcome of the meeting, we will convene a meeting of the Working Group of Committee Chairmen to brief all committee Chairmen on the outworkings and upshot of our meeting with the Taoiseach.<\/p> <p>  The other actions to be taken concerned Deputy Clare Daly and the Minister and an exploration of the Minister's letter to me and the committee regarding her willingness to facilitate us in the period running up to the summer recess.  While my address was in broad brush strokes, Deputy Daly's was specific to her Bill, namely, the Coroners Bill, and I invite Deputy Daly to bring us up to date in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017051700002#W00600","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1495008000,"counter":542,"content":"<p>In fairness, the Minister convened a meeting with her officials last Thursday, which we attended.  They expressed their intention to deal with this issue and expedite it before the summer.  This is a big ask and a very tight schedule but we agreed to work together to try to deliver it and report back to the committee to seek its co-operation in that regard as well.  In essence, the Minister undertook to ring me then, having made some investigation with the Office of the Attorney General and her own staff.  Some work has been done on it but basically, what is being talked about is that the Department would draft a new stand-alone Bill dealing with the provisions surrounding maternal deaths, specifically mandatory inquests for maternal deaths.  The Minister will go to Cabinet next week with a resolution.  I do not understand what that means, but the drafting is under way and will continue.  They do not expect this to take that long.  It will be quite a short Bill with perhaps about eight provisions.  The aim is that it would come before Cabinet the first week back after the recess, would be published that week and would reach Second Stage in the week of 21 June, Committee Stage the following week and Report Stage the week after.  Then an attempt will be made to expedite it through the Seanad.  That is a very tight schedule but they say they intend to work on it.  There may be hiccups.  I would be a little suspicious, not of the Minister but perhaps of the Department trying to restrict the definition of \"maternal death\".  We might not be happy about that and it might throw a spanner in the works.<\/p><p>In fairness, the team has been made available to us.  A member of the team has been liaising with staff in my office.  The Minister undertook to ring me and she did so yesterday.
