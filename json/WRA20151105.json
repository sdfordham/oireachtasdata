The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050. Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the <i>Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015<\/i>.<\/p><p>In anticipation of enactment of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a low carbon plan, the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and to identify additional measures within the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050. The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020, but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that. In this context, key sectors in the low carbon transition process (electricity, transport, built environment and agriculture) are currently developing sectoral mitigation measures in tandem with Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Appropriate Assessment (AA) processes during which measures will be further developed and prioritised.<\/p><p>For each year between 2013 and 2020, Ireland has a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target under the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) No. 406\/2009\/EC. For the year 2020 itself  , the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20 per cent below their value in 2005. This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg. The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020.<\/p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published in May 2015 new annual emission limits and projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions in 2020 could be in the range of 9-14% below 2005 levels. However, even in the worst case scenario (i.e., a 9% reduction), Ireland could be very close to meeting its cumulative compliance obligations for the period 2013-2020 (ESD 2009), which on average require a 12% reduction relative to 2005, given over-compliance in the early years of the 8-year period.<\/p><p>With regard to energy security considerations, the overarching objective of the Government&rsquo;s energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers. The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power from renewable sources. Provisional figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland for 2014 show that 8.6% of Ireland's overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy. <\/p><p>Electricity generated from renewable sources is playing an increasingly important role as part of our energy mix. In 2014, 22.7% of gross electricity generation was from renewables including hydro, wind, biomass, landfill gas and biogas. While the progress to date is encouraging, significant challenges remain, particularly in the heat and transport sectors. <\/p><p>The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies, including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind. These schemes will be closed to new applications at the end of this year. In terms of renewable heat, in addition to existing measures such as Part L of the Building Regulations, the 2014 Draft Bioenergy Plan recommended the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. <\/p><p>On 31 July last, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources launched two separate consultations on new support schemes, one for renewable electricity and one for a proposed Renewable Heat Incentive. While the initial phase of both consultations closed on 18 September 2015, there will be two further opportunities to contribute at key stages in the design of any new scheme. Those consultations will be informative regarding the technologies that will assist in meeting our future renewable energy targets. Subject to Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission, the new schemes would become available in 2016. <\/p><p>As regards renewable transport, Ireland aims to meet its target mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels. Increasing usage of electric vehicles will also make a contribution. Further increases to the obligation rate in the Biofuels Obligation Scheme will be required in the context of achieving our 2020 target.

If the required improvement did not happen, it was made clear to the tyre industry that the system would be reviewed and replaced with a full Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) model.  As part of a wider review of producer responsibility arrangements completed in 2014, the structural and environmental effectiveness of all aspects of the current system for managing waste tyres was assessed.    The results of this examination were stark. The report, published for consultation in November 2013 and in final form in April 2014, found:<\/p>  <p>- a   non-compliance rate with the Tyre Regulations of 46%,<\/p>  <p>- a lack of consistent and accurate data,   <\/p>  <p>- that the current system was not tracking data flows well, and   <\/p>  <p>- between 25% and 50% of waste tyres were not accounted for with widespread illegal dumping.<\/p>  <p>  Following extensive discussions with the tyre industry, I announced my decision to establish a full PRI scheme for Tyres and Waste Tyres in Ireland on 30 January 2015. Since my decision, significant progress has been made in discussions with the tyre industry.<\/p>  <p>  The new scheme will be operated by Repak with a registration and reporting role for the WEEE Register Society. Both organisations have long and successful track records under existing producer responsibility arrangements in the packaging, battery and waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) areas and have been instrumental in making Ireland a top EU performer in these waste streams.<\/p>  <p>  Operators based in other jurisdictions but bringing tyres onto the Irish market or distance sellers will have exactly the same obligations as any operator based in Ireland, so the suggestion that operators based outside the jurisdiction will have a competitive advantage over their Irish counterparts is unfounded. The distance seller approach has been very successfully used under existing arrangements for distance sellers of electrical and electronic equipment.<\/p>  <p>  There will be no new tyre tax under the new system. Consumers already pay a disposal fee to their tyre retailer whenever they buy a new tyre. The model that I am proposing will formalise a charge that tyre retailers already apply but which does not currently go towards the cost of managing the waste in all cases, as it is supposed to. It is absolutely right and fair to provide a system that ensures it is properly directed in the future so that the consumer does not pay twice: once at the point of purchase and again when the taxpayer has to meet costs incurred by local authorities for the clean-up of illegally dumped tyres.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is proceeding with the introduction of a full PRI scheme for tyres which mirrors those arrangements which are in place in twenty other Member States and which from the outset will, I am confident, enjoy the full support of all members of the European Tyre and Rubber Manufacturers Association who make up approximately 50% of the Irish tyre market. The Tyre Working Group that I established last year continues to operate and will be tasked now with the detailed design of the scheme based around the overarching principles that have been announced. The scheme will respect the producer responsibility approach and be based on the polluter pays principle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500054#WRD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homelessness Strategy","counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500054#WRD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":120,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[38227\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500054#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the status of the short-term strategy that his Department and the local authorities have to deal with the 1,500 plus children that will be sleeping in emergency accommodation tonight, in conjunction with the 2020 plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":121,"content":"<p>The long-term solution to homelessness is to increase the supply of homes.

Rents for houses were 6.4% higher, while apartment rents were 7.6% higher than in the same quarter of 2014.<\/p>  <p>  These annual rates of increase were driven mainly by the Dublin market. Overall, in the 12 months to the end of Q2 2015, rents were higher by 9.2% in Dublin.  Annual growth in rents for the market outside Dublin was more subdued where, in the 12 months to the end of Q2 2015, rents were higher by 5.8%.<\/p>  <p>  A shortage of supply is at the heart of rising rents and the Government is addressing this on a number of fronts. Construction 2020: A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector, published last year, is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand are addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Social housing has been prioritised by this Government and over &euro;1.7 billion in Exchequer and self-funding was allocated to the Social Housing Strategy 2020 between the 2015 and 2016 budgets, to support the provision of over 33,000 units. The Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan goes beyond 2016 and commits &euro;2.9 billion in capital funding towards social housing out to 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, the key to addressing upward pressure on rents is through increasing the supply of housing. In 2014 the number of house completions was 11,016 units nationally, an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure. The latest figures for new house completions show that 8,914 units were completed to the end of September 2015, up 14% on the corresponding figure for 2014.  NAMA is aiming to deliver a target of 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020, with 90% of these units to be in the greater Dublin area.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, I am continuing to work on proposals to address the issue of rising rents. The level of rent increases, particularly in the greater Dublin area, presents a serious challenge. The regulation of rent, however, raises many complex economic and legal issues and I have to be satisfied that any measures proposed are balanced and have the desired effect on the rental market while being fair to landlords and tenants alike.

Class A employees with weekly earnings of &euro;352.01 or more make a 4% contribution charged on all of their earnings. This creates a &ldquo;step effect&rdquo; as net income reduces immediately by the full 4% PRSI charge applied to all earnings.  <\/p>  <p>  The new PRSI Credit I am now introducing will reduce the amount of PRSI paid for those with weekly gross earnings between &euro;352.01 and &euro;424. The maximum weekly PRSI Credit of &euro;12 applies at weekly earnings of &euro;352.01 - this will reduce the current weekly PRSI charge from &euro;14.08 to &euro;2.08.  Where weekly earnings exceed &euro;352.01 and are less than &euro;424.01 per week, the maximum weekly PRSI Credit applying is reduced on a tapered basis. The new arrangements will ensure that all employees earning between &euro;352 and &euro;424 per week will see their PRSI contribution reduce from January next and the employee will always be better off as earnings increase. <\/p>  <p>  Participants of community employment, gateway and T&uacute;s schemes receive a weekly payment which is equivalent to the social welfare payment appropriate to their family size, plus a top up of &euro;20, subject to a minimum payment of &euro;208 per week.  This payment is treated in the same manner as earnings from employment for PRSI purposes and accordingly is subject to Class A PRSI.  Accordingly, all participants in these schemes earning between &euro;352 and &euro;424 per week will benefit from the new measure. The payment of Class A PRSI entitles these participants to establish entitlement to the full range of long and short term social insurance benefits.<\/p>  <p>  I was also pleased in the recent Budget to announce an increase of &euro;2.50 per week from January in the top up payable to participants of the various employment schemes such as community employment operated by the Department.

As set out in\u00a0my Department's\u00a0Section 227 Review of NAMA in July 2014, the ability of NAMA to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State is heavily dependent on its retention of expertise.  That view has been strongly endorsed by the NAMA Board.  Given that, I agreed with the NAMA Board in the context of NAMA's accelerated senior debt redemption target and its ancillary residential and commercial development funding activities, that a redundancy programme reflecting public sector norms and also comprising a retention payment element would be introduced to enable NAMA retain key staff.  The retention payment for individual staff is dependent on NAMA achieving its targets and on satisfactory individual\u00a0performance ratings and will only be paid in the year the staff member leaves the organisation.  I should add that the retention payment is subject to normal employment taxes and levies.

At present the PSPR, which was introduced in 2011, reduces most public service pensions\u00a0whose value, on a\u00a0pre-PSPR basis, is above\u00a0&euro;12,000.  While not a part of the Lansdowne Road Agreement this proposed PSPR amelioration is incorporated into\u00a0the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest\u00a0Bill 2015, which is currently before the D&aacute;il, and as such forms part of the wider set of\u00a0proposed\u00a0public service pay and pension restoration measures in that Bill. <\/p>  <p>  The PSPR amelioration provisions\u00a0in the\u00a02015 Bill\u00a0give\u00a0priority to the lower-pensioned persons\u00a0impacted by PSPR, in line with my stated commitments. In specific terms, those provisions\u00a0will deliver\u00a0the part-restoration of the PSPR cuts in three stages effective from 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.  When fully rolled-out from 1 January 2018, this\u00a0means\u00a0that all public service pensions in payment with pre-PSPR values of up to &euro;34,132 will be fully exempt from PSPR, while those pensioners not fully removed from the reach of PSPR will, in general, benefit by &euro;1,680 per year.  The cost of these proposed changes is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018.  This represents\u00a0a major\u00a0amelioration of the PSPR burden over a multi-year time horizon, at the end of\u00a0which the great majority of public service pensioners, with the exception of those on the higher levels of pension income,\u00a0will no longer be affected by PSPR. <\/p>  <p>  Under section 12 of the FEMPI Act 2013, I am required to review the necessity of FEMPI legislation annually and cause a written report of my findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  In that context, economic progress and fiscal consolidation in the years ahead will determine the scope and timing of the possible further scale-back or elimination of the financial emergency measures, including the PSPR.<\/p>  <p>  I have no plans at this time to link the pensions of public service pensioners generally to the Consumer Price Index<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500060#WRK00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Decentralisation Programme Data","counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500060#WRK00550"},{"type":"question","counter":319,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[38839\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500060#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the departmental units and agencies that are decentralised to County Cork, in tabular form; their locations; the number of staff; if he has plans to transfer or change the existing staff numbers and locations for decentralised units; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":320,"content":"<p>There has been a number of decentralisation programmes.<\/p><p>The Commissioners of Public Works advise that there are two locations, as set out below, in County Cork where such accommodation has been provided.  <\/p><p>Information relating to staff numbers would be a matter for the building occupants.

Bearing this in mind, together with the particular types of offences with which the Special Criminal Court is concerned, I sought the necessary Government approval to appoint judges to the second Special Criminal Court, thereby bringing it into existence. <\/p>  <p>  There are certain practical and procedural tasks that need to be undertaken before the the second Courts can start hearing cases such as organising courtroom accommodation and chambers for judges as well as drafting of the necessary rules of court and it will also be necessary to appoint a Court Registrar. <\/p>  <p>  I anticipate that when the second Special Criminal Court commences hearing cases there will be a reduction in waiting times for cases awaiting trial.  The requirement for two Special Criminal Courts will be kept under review in this context; however I have no plans at present to abolish the Special Criminal Court.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500062#WRM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Relocation","counter":388,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500062#WRM01200"},{"type":"question","counter":389,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[38760\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500062#WRM01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of applicants awaiting transfer in her Department to locations other than their present location; the number of applications, by location; the rules that apply for such transfers; if an applicant has a defined position on the list for transfer; the grounds that apply to applicants being moved up or down on the list; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":390,"content":"<p>The Human Resources Division of my Department manage a very substantial number of requests for staff transfers both across my Department and other Civil Service Departments and Offices each year.

Such requests are forwarded to all Civil Service Departments with offices in the location;<\/p><p>- Staff can respond to requests from  Human Resources Division for expressions of interest for specific posts.<\/p><p>- Staff can seek to identify a head to head transfer with other staff of the same grade across the Civil Service.

These include measures under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  In particular, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 gave particular powers to Garda&iacute; to tackle misuse of alcohol, including the power to seize alcohol in the possession of persons under 18 years of age of to forestall public disorder or damage to property.  Garda&iacute; may also issue fixed charge notices for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place.  Where young offenders are involved Garda&iacute; may employ a range of options including the incremental system of warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour provided under the Criminal Justice Act 2006, as well as the diversionary measures provided under the Children Act 2001.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, Garda management employ relevant policing strategies to take account of the incidence of crime, including alcohol related crimes.  In this context Garda&iacute; also engage extensively with many community and business groups in relation to issues of local concern as well as participating in formal consultative structures such as Joint Policing Committees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500063#WRN01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Data","counter":429,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500063#WRN01600"},{"type":"question","counter":430,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[38892\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500063#WRN01700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of crimes committed by former prisoners; the reoffending rates of juveniles who have been detained; the most up-to-date figures on recidivism; the details of rehabilitation rates in prison; the funding provided for such; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":431,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that it has not been possible to provide the information requested in the time available.

The task of the ICLVR is to facilitate the location of the remains of a number of people who were killed and buried secretly by paramilitary organisations during the troubles.

While certain flexibilities had been built in to the Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability  the <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures<\/i>children and young people's policy framework contained a commitment to develop a plan to facilitate the full participation of such children in the ECCE Programme.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has lead responsibility for the implementation of this commitment and has concluded an intensive process of deliberation and consultation on the matter in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Education and Skills and has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.<\/p><p>As part of Budget 2016, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has announced the necessary funding to implement the new model of ECCE supports for children with a disability.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards.<\/p><p>Just to add, in relation to the specific information sought by the Deputy that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.<\/p><p>Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the information that he has sought insofar as it is available.

The figure is taken from the report, &quot;Costs to Society of Problem Alcohol Use in Ireland&quot;, 2011.  The estimate is based on the methods used in similar reports from other developed countries including the United Kingdom and used data from surveys and surveillance systems.

This is done by monitoring both individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe and Periodic Safety Update Reports submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder for the vaccine on a regular basis.<\/p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.<\/p><p>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has commenced a review of the HPV vaccine <i>&quot;to further clarify aspects of their safety profile,&quot;<\/i>although the agency points out that this review <i>&quot;does not question that the benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh their risks.&quot;<\/i>The Health Products Regulatory Authority is participating in the review which aims to clarify aspects of their safety profile and is specifically focusing on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.  Reports of these conditions in young women who have received a HPV vaccine have been previously considered during routine safety monitoring by the Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) but a causal link between them and the vaccines was not established.  Both conditions can occur in non vaccinated individuals and it is considered important to further review if the number of cases reported with HPV vaccine is greater than would be expected.  The outcome of the PRAC review is anticipated before the end of this year.<\/p><p>The HPRA is participating in the PRAC review of HPV vaccines to clarify aspects of their safety profile.  As for all licensed medicines, the safety of these vaccines is monitored by the PRAC (an EU level drug safety committee) where the HPRA is actively represented and contributes.  Data from all Member States, including Ireland, is being comprehensively analysed, in line with usual ongoing referrals.<\/p><p>While the review is ongoing the European Medicines Agency has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using them in accordance with the current product information.  Any changes to this advice will be made following the outcome of the review, by the EMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500067#WRR01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[38936\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500067#WRR01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is aware that the information leaflet provided by the Health Service Executive to parents and guardians of girls due to receive the Gardasil vaccine does not fully outline the potential side effects of this medication; his views on whether this is acceptable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":561,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.

Each school year, services, routes, pick-up points, vehicle size etc. are designed around the eligible children presenting for school transport.<\/p><p>The Company strives to accommodate as many children as possible, always within the guidelines of the schemes, and to provide a good standard of service that is consistent nationally.  To assist families with queries on aspects of the scheme, a series of frequently asked questions is available on the Bus &Eacute;ireann and my Department's websites. <\/p><p>  In advance of any given school year, a diverse rang e of specific queries are raised by Deputies and parents, including this year.  There is no discretion in the application of these guidelines nationally which can sometimes be taken as presenting a negative attitude to requests received.  I have asked Bus &Eacute;ireann to review the experience this year with a view to putting any appropriate further measures in place to assist with improving communication with families availing of the service.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the current procurement arrangements for the operation of the school bus services raised in the submission made to Oireachtas members by the Federation of Transport Operators Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised as follows:  <\/p><p>The Bus Eireann tender processes for school transport services are conducted in a transparent manner which is in accordance with applicable law, including public procurement requirements, and facilitates equality of treatment.  School transport contractors who are selected for re-tendering are notified that the contracts are being tendered in line with Government policy where expenditure of public funds is concerned.  They are subsequently provided with the full suite of tender documents clearly outlining the process, the procedure, and the selection and award criteria for contract award.  The tendering process facilitates openness, transparency and allows freedom of access for all interested parties.  <\/p><p>  All of the contractors procured are required to satisfy the statutory obligations that pertain to each licensed transport operator in the State.  This includes an obligation to keep and provide evidence that all statutory vehicle, driver and company certificates and licences are kept current and in order.  Nominated drivers are obliged to satisfy medical examination, must be licensed to drive the size of vehicle used, and are subject to vetting procedures arranged by Bus &Eacute;ireann and conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit.<\/p><p>Contractors who are successful in the competition for existing work that is opened to tender are awarded a five-year contract which provides security for the duration of the contract to the contractor, provided of course that obligations continue to be satisfied, as well as stability in terms of familiarity with transport arrangements for the families, schools, and children concerned.<\/p><p>  It is a matter for each tenderer to decide what price they wish to quote for the work concerned taking into consideration their operating costs over the course of the contract period, and in common with every citizen of the State a tenderer is entitled to seek redress through the Courts in the event that they wish to appeal a procurement decision.  The procurement of school transport services through competitive tendering procedures is aimed at maximising value for money for the exchequer in the delivery of school transport services.  Some 90% of current school transport routes have been procured through competitive tendering. In the four consecutive years between 2010 and 2013, the cost to the Department for the element of the School Transport Schemes administered by Bus &Eacute;ireann was reduced\/maintained each year, while over the same period more than 1,000 new school transport services and some 2,600 service enhancements were approved by the Department and introduced by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  <\/p><p>The value of savings achieved and other cost efficiency measures served to offset the otherwise significant additional  cost that would have been incurred to meet this level of new demand.  <\/p><p>  The cost of the element of the School Transport Schemes administered by Bus &Eacute;ireann to the Department in 2014 remained less than it was in 2010, as the following table indicates, and this will continue to be the case in 2015.<\/p><p>  Customer research was undertaken earlier this year by Ipsos MRBI on behalf of the Company in connection with how their new online school transport portal and service had improved over 2014\/15 and to identify further scope for improvements.  The helpful attitude of Bus &Eacute;ireann staff was noted in this research.  Four focus groups were established in different parts of Ireland from a cross section of school transport scheme customers.  The findings of this research were positive, indicating that the new system allows more parental control of the process, provides reassurance that information has been sent\/received, and provides a more convenient method to apply, to obtain an eligibility assessment, and to pay\/submit medical card details.<\/p><p>Details of the scheme are available at www.buseireann.ie and at www.education.ie.<\/p><p><i>Cost of the School Transport Scheme 2010-2014 - PQ<\/i><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Total net chargeable by BE to DES<\/th><th>Parental Charges Collected<\/th><th>Total combined net amount chargeable including parental charges<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>&euro;000m<\/td><td>&euro;000m<\/td><td>&euro;000m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>154,026<\/td><td>11,651<\/td><td>165,677<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>151,804<\/td><td>11,486<\/td><td>163,290<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>149,477<\/td><td>12,570<\/td><td>162,047<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>149,825<\/td><td>12,772<\/td><td>162,597<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>150,467<\/td><td>13,057<\/td><td>163,524<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500068#WRS02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1078"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":609,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500069#WRT00150"},{"type":"question","counter":610,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[38932\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500069#WRT00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding an application for a school extension consisting of four classrooms and a nurses' station (detail supplied) in County Kilkenny.","asker":"965","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":611,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers has submitted an application for capital funding for additional accommodation.

This exercise, The Residential Land Availability Study, determined the location and quantity of lands that may be regarded as being undeveloped and available for residential development purposes at 31st March 2014. The results of the survey indicated that there was 17,434 hectares of residential zoned lands nationally which could theoretically enable the construction of over 414,000 dwellings. Servicing of housing lands in terms of providing water services, energy and communications, transport, schools and community facilities and amenities involves a range of both public sector organisations and private sector companies. The Residential Land Availability Study operated at a national scale did not examine this level of detail.

This Task Force was convened by my Department and includes representatives of the four Dublin local authorities. The First Report of the Task Force undertook an analysis of planning applications for 20 housing units or more and concluded that across the four Dublin authorities there is land immediately available with planning permission for development of 12,785 houses and 7,925 apartments, equating to circa. 3 years supply. A further 25,507 units were deemed permissible in the immediate to short term.<\/p>  <p>  A further study of these zoned residential lands by the Task Force has examined infrastructural constraints and has identified specific infrastructural interventions possible to facilitate additional housing supply in the Dublin Region. These identified infrastructural requirements are intended to form the basis of future investments by Governmental and other infrastructure providers.<\/p>  <p>  I issued a draft Ministerial policy directive under section 29 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, to the four Dublin planning authorities on 29 October 2015 suggesting that they utilise all powers available to them under the provisions of section 179 of the Act, as appropriate, relating to local authority own development for the purpose of finding solutions to the urgent social housing situation presently faced and accelerating the delivery of social housing developments to address the urgent and increasing need for social housing accommodation in the region. This directive will come into effect following approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Thereafter, I will keep the operation of the Directive under review.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500069#WRT01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"question","counter":631,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[38806\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500069#WRT01600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the steps he has taken, or proposes to take, to address the immediate housing crisis, which was inherited from the previous administration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":632,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply to Question No. 3 on today's Order Paper, which sets out the position in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500069#WRT01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Bonds","counter":633,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500069#WRT01750"},{"type":"question","counter":634,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[38807\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500069#WRT01800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the extent to which he may be in a position to provide a framework to fund the provision of local authority housing by way of Government development bonds, or by other means, in order to address the current housing situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.]","asker":"957","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":635,"content":"<p>In November 2014 the Government approved the Social Housing Strategy 2020 which sets out a strategic framework for meeting the State&rsquo;s social housing needs to the end of the decade.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy includes a commitment to commence work on a financial vehicle, to be known as the Strategic Housing Fund, to raise funding for the social housing sector.

Under the ESD, EU-wide emissions in the year 2013 should be no more than the average of those same emissions in the years 2008 to 2010.  Emissions in those three years were on average 4.5% below emissions in 2005.  In the year 2020, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20 per cent below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020. <\/p><p>Taking account of methodological changes underpinning the GHG emissions inventories and projections (in line with evolutions in the accounting rules under the Kyoto Protocol second commitment period), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published in May 2015 new annual emission limits and projected emissions for 2020 compared to our target.  These calculations and projections indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions in 2020 could be in the range of 9-14% below 2005 levels by 2020.  However, even in the worst case scenario (i.e. a 9% reduction), Ireland could be very close to meeting its cumulative compliance obligations for the period 2013-2020 (ESD 2009), which on average required a 12% reduction relative to 2005, given over-compliance in the early years of the 8-year period.<\/p><p>The projections infer that the likely cumulative outcome for the period will range between a small deficit (4Mt) and a small surplus (6Mt) of units for the period. In the event of a deficit arising , then compliance with the targets would be demonstrated by the use of the flexible mechanisms allowed for under the Effort Sharing Decision.  Having already demonstrated compliance with the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, Ireland holds in excess of 5Mt of units which are allowable for such purposes.<\/p><p>Furthermore, in October 2014, the European Council agreed on the 2030 climate and energy policy framework for the European Union.  The European Council endorsed a binding EU target of an at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.  The target will be delivered collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible, with the reductions in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and non-ETS sectors amounting to 43% and 30%, respectively, by 2030 compared to 2005.<\/p><p>All Member States within the Union will participate in this effort, balancing considerations of fairness and solidarity.  While Member State targets for 2030 are yet to be agreed, it is known that targets will be in the range of a 0% to 40% reduction relative to 2005, and that targets for Member States whose GDP per capita isabove average should be adjusted to reflect cost effectiveness in a fair and balanced manner.  A Commission proposal on this matter is expected towards the end of the second quarter of 2016.<\/p><p>The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU commitments, is well understood by Government, as reflected in the <i>National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development<\/i>, published in April 2014, and in the <i>Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015,<\/i>recently passed by the D&aacute;il and currently at Committee Stage in the Seanad.

Moreover, the <i>National Waste Report 2012<\/i>, which sets out the latest annual data and which is available on the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s website, indicates that 40% of municipal waste was recycled in 2012: this compares with a 20.7% recycling rate ten years previously in 2002.\u00a0 The report further highlights the fact that municipal solid waste (MSW) generation has decreased in the period 2006 to 2012, while the recovery of MSW generated has increased over the same period.<\/p><p>Government waste policy is predicated on the waste hierarchy as set out in the Waste Framework Directive and seeks to minimise the generation of waste.  A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the volume of waste generated in the State in line with Government policy.  Recent examples include the further roll-out of food waste collection services, and the introduction of three Regional Waste Management Plans in May 2015 which have a clear focus on waste prevention and resource efficiency.<\/p><p><i>Towards a Resource Efficient Ireland<\/i><i>- A National Strategy to 2020<\/i>, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following web link, , incorporates Ireland&rsquo;s National Waste Prevention Programme and sets out prio rities for preventing waste generation and the unnecessary consumption of materials, energy and water.  The title of this document reflects the shift in emphasis at national and EU level towards resource efficiency, as opposed to focussing purely on waste prevention.  In this regard, I intend to publish a consultation paper shortly on how the State can best maximise the value we extract from the waste we cannot prevent, especially in terms of maximising the job creation and energy potential of waste, while minimising our impact on the environment.<\/p><p>In relation to supporting higher rates of household recycling of various waste streams t he introduction of pay-by- weight as a collection permit condition as of 1 July 2015 and the forthcoming introduction of mandatory pay-by- weight charging for household waste in July 2016 and for commercial waste later in 2016 will be of central importance.  Pay-by- weight charging will provide clear continuous pricing incentives to households and businesses to not only prevent, but also to segregate their waste to the greatest possible extent, which will further stimulate the collection and processing of recyclables materials.  The additional availability of such material, such as food waste and recyclable plastic, provides an opportunity to the business sector and investors to exploit the potential of these resources.  In addition, pay-by-weight charging will not be applied to the separate collection of glass, further encouraging this type of collection.<\/p><p>Considerable progress is being made towards the virtual phasing out of landfill for municipal waste. 28 landfills were accepting municipal waste for disposal in 2009 but only 7 landfills are now accepting such waste in 2015.  While Ireland remains significantly reliant on export of our waste for treatment elsewhere, other domestic treatment facilities are coming on stream.  The active and expected capacity for the thermal recovery of municipal solid waste is set out in the three recently launched Regional Waste Management Plans for the 2015-2021.  The Plans support the development of up to another 300,000 tonnes of additional thermal recovery capacity in the State, including through the use of Solid Recovered Fuel in cement kilns; waste to energy; and pyrolysis.  Currently, there is one waste-to-energy facility operating in the State at Carranstown Co. Meath, with an active capacity of 220,000 tonnes.  The Dublin Waste-to-Energy plant under construction in Poolbeg has a pending capacity of 600,000 tonnes and is due to be fully operational in the second half of 2017.  Information regarding the management of residues from waste to energy facilities is set out in each individual plant&rsquo;s EPA licence, available on the EPA &rsquo;s website, .<\/p><p>As I have previously stated, Government policy is geared towards preventing waste in the first instance and then managing waste which cannot be prevented as a resource.  In this regard, the above measures I have outlined are among the many actions being undertaken to ensure that Ireland will be well positioned to meet the requirements of the new European Commission proposal on the Circular Economy, which is expected to be published in December 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500070#WRU01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Guidelines","counter":655,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500070#WRU01250"},{"type":"question","counter":656,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[38815\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500070#WRU01300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when he expects to be in a position to publish revised guidelines in respect of the construction of wind farms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":657,"content":"<p>In December 2013, my Department published proposed &ldquo;draft&rdquo; revisions to the noise, setbacks and shadow flicker aspects of the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines.

The response of the Irish authorities to the case has two main elements - a general response addressing the structural or administrative deficiencies highlighted by the ECJ and, secondly, a response to the site-specific cases themselves.  In addition, certain other complaints or issues which had been taken against or raised with Ireland by the European Commission were subsumed under the case and were therefore part of a broader response which was required by Ireland to bring finality to the case.  This response has been delivered successfully leading to the recent closure of the case by the European Commission.  Remediation of the C-494\/01 case sites was a requirement for the recent closure of the infringement proceedings.  Accordingly, several legacy licensed and unlicensed landfill sites have required remediation since the judgment and some others that have arisen in the interim which must be remediated over the course of the next few years for environmental, economic and reputational reasons. <\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s total expenditure to end 2014 on landfill remediation is &euro;71 million with a further allocation of &euro;8.5 million in Exchequer funding for 2015.  A significant proportion of this amount will go towards the remediation of the illegal landfill at Kerdiffstown, County Kildare. <\/p>  <p>  To prevent future recurrence of illegal dumping activities, my Department has introduced a series of measures in recent years that have improved and modernised Ireland&rsquo;s waste infrastructure and services.  These include the centralisation of the waste collection permitting system and trans-frontier waste shipment into single local authorities, the establishment of the Office for Environmental Enforcement (OEE) within the EPA, and the provision of dedicated funding from the Environment Fund for enforcement staff within local authorities. <\/p>  <p>  These reforms have been key to strengthening the Government&rsquo;s efforts to combat illegal dumping activity.  In addition, Cork County Council, Dublin City Council and Leitrim and Donegal County Councils (jointly) were recently announced as the new Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities.  They will be tasked with driving further performance improvements by individual local authorities in carrying out their waste enforcement functions and with ensuring consistency between local authorities.

Such mechanism, when introduced, should assist in speeding up the resolution of civil disputes of this nature, reduce legal costs and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500071#WRV01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Quality","counter":693,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500071#WRV01950"},{"type":"question","counter":694,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[38898\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500071#WRV02000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the reason the Environmental Protection Agency believes it is not necessary to monitor for particulates at all 31 air monitoring stations, given the proven negative effects they pose to health; his views on this policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":695,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[38899\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500071#WRV02100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will update D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the progress of the Environmental Protection Agency draft national ambient air monitoring programme under section 65 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (as amended), detailing the scope of the exercise, the start date and the likely completion date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":696,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[38900\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500071#WRV02200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the reason Ireland is divided into four zones for the monitoring and assessment of ambient air quality; if this has always been the case; how often it is reviewed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":697,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 to 246, inclusive, together. <\/p><p>To protect our environment in regard to air quality, a number of EU Directives set out standards for a wide variety of pollutants.  The current standards are contained in the 2008 Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) Directive (Directive 2008\/50\/EC) and the Fourth Daughter Directive (Directive 2004\/107\/EC of 15 December 2004).  These Directives also include rules on how Member States should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality.<\/p><p>The EPA is tasked with co-ordinating and managing the monitoring programme.  Under the Directives, EU Member States must designate &quot;Zones&quot; for the purpose of managing air quality.  For Ireland, four zones were defined in the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2011.  The zones in place in Ireland in 2015 are Zone A: the Dublin conurbation, Zone B: the Cork conurbation, Zone C: comprising 23 large towns in Ireland with a population of more than 15,000 and Zone D: the remaining area of Ireland. Zones are amended primarily to take account of population trends emerging from census results.  The zones were last amended on 1 January 2013 to take account of results from the 2011 CSO Census and to align with the coal restricted areas set out in Regulations in 2012.<\/p><p>Ireland has a nationwide network of 31 monitoring stations which measure levels of air pollutants in the four zones.  This information is delivered to the public in near real-time at .<\/p><p>The numbers and locations of the monitoring equipment for each pollutant, including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), are determined by the requirements of the Directives for ambient air monitoring in each zone.  Particulate matter is harmful to health and it is accepted among health officials that exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 should be reduced.  In cities, traffic emissions are the main source of particulate matter while in smaller towns, emissions from domestic solid fuel combustion are often the primary source.  The air quality in cities benefits from the ban on smoky coal, as well as the increased use of gas for residential heating.  The monitoring of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) is carried out at a representative number of monitoring locations in each of the four zones and meets the requirements of the CAFE Directive - it is not considered necessary to monitor for particulates at all 31 stations.<\/p><p>In April 2013, the EPA launched Ireland&rsquo;s new <i>Air Quality Index for Health<\/i>(AQIH).  This web-based index, developed in conjunction with the Health Service Executive and my Department (including Met Eireann), displays the current air quality across Ireland, by means of a coloured scale of 1 &ndash; 10, divided into four bands (good, fair, poor and very poor) with health advice provided for each band.  The AQIH is calculated hourly and is represented on a colour-coded map of Ireland, from which the public can easily assess information about current air quality in their area.  The Air Quality Index for Health can be viewed at .  The pollutants included in the index are: ozone; nitrogen dioxide; sulphur dioxide; PM10; and PM2.5.  To coincide with the launch of the Air Quality Index for Health, the EPA also launched a Twitter channel @EPAAirQuality, through which the public can receive tweets on the status of air quality in their region every day.<\/p><p>The EPA has commenced preparation of a draft national ambient air monitoring programme under Section 65 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (as amended) which will provide the basis and options for the continued development and expansion of the national ambient air monitoring network.  The development of the national ambient air monitoring programme will include a review of the adequacy of the current network for both determining compliance with European and national standards for air quality and for the provision of information to the public about local air quality.  Stakeholder consultation on the draft national ambient air monitoring programme will commence in April 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500071#WRV02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Data","counter":699,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500072#WRW00200"},{"type":"question","counter":700,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[38913\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500072#WRW00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"in the context of affordable homes, if he will consider changing legislative provisions so that material improvements will include landscaping works and other improvements that add value to properties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":701,"content":"<p>I assume the Deputy is referring to a provision in section 99 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 relating to the proceeds of sale of affordable houses, which provides that in calculating the amount payable to the planning authority, due allowance will be made for any material improvements made by the person to whom the house was sold, and\u00a0defines &ldquo;material improvements&rdquo; as improvements made to the house.<\/p>  <p>  While Part V of the Planning Act is generally kept under review, and has recently been amended, I have currently no plans to amend the provision referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500072#WRW00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Accommodation Provision","counter":702,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500072#WRW00500"},{"type":"question","counter":703,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[38926\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500072#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he is satisfied that the 22 modular housing units proposed by Dublin City Council will be ready for occupation on or before 22 December 2015; if he will confirm that a minimum requirement for the 22 modular homes is that they comply and are certified as compliant with all relevant building, sound, fire, insulation and environmental regulations; the steps he has taken to ensure these standards; if he is satisfied that the change of use of the land designated for the modular housing to active residential land is compliant with all planning legislation; if he is satisfied that the construction and use of the proposed modular housing is compliant with all planning legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":704,"content":"<p>Government has approved the delivery of 500 units of modular housing for homeless families across Dublin.

In undertaking their review Wood Mackenzie sought to take account of the need to strike the necessary balance between attracting the high-risk exploration investment needed to prove the potential of the Irish Offshore and maximising the return to the State from Ireland&rsquo;s natural resources. Wood Mackenzie furnished their Final Report at end May 2014.<\/p><p>The principal recommendations made by Wood Mackenzie were as follows:<\/p><p>- For now Ireland should maintain a concession system, with industry rather than the State bearing the risk associated with investing in exploration;<\/p><p>- Going forward a form of production profit tax should continue to apply in Ireland, but for discoveries made under future licences the form of this tax should be revised;<\/p><p>- The tax should be charged on a field-by-field basis with the rate varying according to the profitability of the field and charged on each field&rsquo;s net profits;<\/p><p>- That the revised tax should include a minimum payment at a rate of 5% which would function like a royalty and would result in the State receiving a share of revenue in every year that a field is selling production;<\/p><p>- That the revised tax rates should be higher than the Profit Resource Rent Tax currently in place, thereby ensuring a higher share for the State from the most profitable fields. This would result in a maximum rate of 55% applying in the case of new licences, compared with a maximum rate of 40% under the current fiscal regime;<\/p><p>- That the corporation tax rate applying to petroleum production should remain at 25%; and<\/p><p>- there should be no retroactive change to the fiscal terms applying to existing authorisations.<\/p><p>Having received and considered Wood Mackenzie&rsquo;s comprehensive and detailed report the Government agreed that Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms should be revised along the lines recommended and implemented by way of the Finance Bill 2015. <\/p><p>The Bill introduces a new tax called the Petroleum Production Tax (PPT) which will apply in the case of petroleum authorisations first awarded after 18 June 2014 and replaces the Profit Resource Rent Tax introduced in the Finance Act 2008 in respect of such authorisations. <\/p><p>The PPT will apply on a field by field basis, calculated on a field&rsquo;s net income at a rate that is determined by reference to the profit ratio of the oil or gas field having regard to cumulative gross field revenues and field costs. <\/p><p>The legislation provides that:<\/p><p>- The PPT will be payable in addition to the existing 25% rate of corporation tax that applies to the profits from oil and gas production;<\/p><p>- The PPT payments will be deductible for the purposes of calculating the amount of corporation tax due;<\/p><p>- The operation of the PPT regime will result in a maximum marginal tax take on a producing field (combining the corporation tax and petroleum production tax) of 55%;<\/p><p>- Once a field starts producing oil or gas, a minimum PPT payment of 5% will be payable in each year of production on the gross revenue (net of transportation costs) of a field;<\/p><p>- The ultimate PPT amount due on each field will be determined on a sliding scale depending on the profitability of the field.<\/p><p>For future prospective licence holders a clear regime is being set out and the rationale for that regime has been explained.  This should further engender industry confidence in the stability and predictability of Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms and allow the industry to focus on effective and timely exploration effort.<\/p><p>Whilst we hope for more commercial discoveries, there is little point in speculating about potential revenues from commercial oil or gas fields that have yet to be discovered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500072#WRW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"997"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Relocation","counter":708,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500072#WRW01100"},{"type":"question","counter":709,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[38752\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500072#WRW01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of applicants awaiting transfer in his Department to locations other than their present locations; the number of applications, by location; the rules that apply for such transfers; if an applicant has a defined position on the list for transfer; the grounds that apply to applicants being moved up or down on the list; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":710,"content":"<p>My Department does not maintain transfer lists of staff who wish to transfer to other Departments or locations.
