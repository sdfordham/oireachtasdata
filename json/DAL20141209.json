At that time Ireland was three months from running out of money and the Government faced the prospect of no cash for public services or salaries.  The economy was in free-fall, the banks were bust, house prices were diving and mortgage arrears were soaring.  With a quarter of a million jobs lost in the previous three years, the dole queues heaved with our brightest and best.

This is possible because in following a specific plan, Ireland is now recognised as the fastest growing economy in Europe, a fact unthinkable three years ago.

First for the women of the Magdalen laundries, then by looking after mothers and their babies by way of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.  We took care of the families of Priory Hall and those living in pyrite homes.  We are now working to help the women who endured symphisiotomy procedures.  We are preparing for a referendum on same-sex marriage, something that will mean so much to so many couples, their friends and families the length and breadth of this country.

I was determined that Ireland would never again be such a cold house for its people.  I remain so determined.  We are on a path of economic and social recovery.  I understand that many listening to this debate still have not felt that in their lives.  I am as impatient as everyone else that the benefits of recovery are felt right across our country.  Today, much to the disappointment of the Opposition, we are out of the bailout programme and back in the economic markets.  The banks have been reconstructed and are stable.  There are over 80,000 new jobs.  In other words, 80,000 people in all four corners of Ireland get up every morning with a new sense of hope for the future as they go to work.

This will be the first occasion in a long time that people will get something back and that they will start to see the benefits of the recovery for which they have suffered so much.

New job creation and a growing economy for our ambitious reform plans will also help us to deliver better services designed to help people reach their full potential.  We have outlined such reform plans in respect of the areas of education, health care, social welfare and many others.  There will be changes in those areas not only next year but also in the following year.<\/p><p>  The Government and I, as Taoiseach, have succeeded, by working in partnership with the people, in bringing our country back from the brink of the economic abyss.  We remain fully focused on our plan for Ireland's recovery.  Nothing will distract us from the important work of improving the lives of our people.  We will finish the task we were given by the people and secure the recovery for the benefit of every single person.  I have no intention of creating any instability by calling a general election in 2015.  My preference for government after the election in 2016 is for a continuation of the coalition of Fine Gael and Labour that has restored our economic sovereignty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900011#K01100","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418136900,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900011#K01200","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1418136900,"counter":112,"content":"<p>That is not going to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900011#K01300","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1418136900,"counter":113,"content":"<p>On 9 March 2011, this Government and the people took a leap of faith: faith that we can better ourselves, faith that we can renew government, faith in a confident, shared future for ourselves, our children and our children's children, and faith in our ability to make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business, raise a family and grow old with a sense of dignity and respect.<\/p><p>I commend this motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900011#K01400","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418137500,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900012#L00200","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1418137500,"counter":116,"content":"<p>In evaluating how far one has travelled, it is necessary to remember the starting point.  In November 2010, the US financial journalist Michael Lewis visited this country to write about Ireland&rsquo;s economic meltdown under the previous Government.  His article was published in <i>Vanity Fair<\/i>in March 2011, the same month that Labour and Fine Gael came into office.  It is worth quoting a segment of that article to remind ourselves where this country found itself at that time:<blockquote><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  In recognition of the spectacular losses, the entire Irish economy has almost dutifully collapsed.  When you fly into Dublin you are traveling, for the first time in 15 years, against the traffic.  The Irish are once again leaving Ireland, along with hordes of migrant workers.  In late 2006, the unemployment rate stood at a bit more than 4 percent; now it&rsquo;s 14 percent and climbing toward rates not experienced since the mid-1980s.  Just a few years ago, Ireland was able to borrow money more cheaply than Germany; now, if it can borrow at all, it will be charged interest rates nearly 6 percent higher than Germany, another echo of a distant past.  The Irish budget deficit&mdash;which three years ago was a surplus&mdash;is now 32 percent of its G.D.P., the highest by far in the history of the Eurozone.  One credit-analysis firm has judged Ireland the third-most-likely country to default.  Not quite as risky for the global investor as Venezuela, but riskier than Iraq.  Distinctly Third World, in any case.<\/font><\/blockquote>This is what one of the best-known financial commentators in the United Stats wrote about Ireland.  That was then, however, and this is now.  Mr. Lewis wrote about Ireland being distinctly Third World.  This was the reality, as judged by neutrals, of the situation this Government inherited.  Now, less than four years later, Ireland is set to record the fastest growth in the eurozone, and we are creating thousands of new jobs every month. <br\/><br\/>Almost 125,000 people have left the live register so far this year to take up work, and unemployment is down to 10.7% and falling rapidly.  Our borrowing costs have fallen to record lows and we have slowly but surely reduced our debt and restored our financial sustainability as a state.  The deficit will fall below 3% of GDP next year, as the Government continues a prudent and sensible course in order to secure the economic recovery. <br\/><br\/>In the recent budget, we have begun the process of building the social recovery, by ensuring the benefits of a repaired economy are spread over time to every person, every family and every community.  That is why I have absolute confidence in the Government, including the Taoiseach.  Labour and Fine Gael, working together, have built an economic recovery and are now building the social recovery also.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s leadership <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">&mdash;<\/font>and that of my predecessor as both T&aacute;naiste and Labour Party leader, Deputy Eamon Gilmore <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">&mdash;<\/font>has been central to the process.  In 2011, under their stewardship, Labour and Fine Gael agreed a programme for Government.  In it, we acknowledged that Ireland faced one of its darkest hours as an independent state, and that an unprecedented level of political resolve would be required to deal with an unprecedented national economic emergency.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and Deputy Eamon Gilmore showed that resolve. <br\/><br\/>As a Government, we promised to get the economy moving, restore confidence, fix our banking system and support the protection and creation of jobs.  We said the success of our economic plans would lay the foundation for the rest of our agenda for change.<br\/><br\/>When I was elected Labour Party leader and nominated as T&aacute;naiste in July, there were plenty of naysayers who said our strategy could not possibly work and that the Taoiseach and I would clash pretty much incessantly and be incapable of building a professional working relationship for the betterment of our country.<\/p><p>I am happy to say we have demonstrated the opposite, quickly agreeing a statement of Government priorities which spelled out how we would work to secure and deepen the economic recovery in a manner felt in people's daily lives, in other words, that the ongoing programme of economic repair would be accompanied by an equal emphasis on social repair and progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900012#L00300","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418137800,"counter":118,"content":"<p>They are all happy-clappy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900013#M00200","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1418137800,"counter":119,"content":"<p>We set six key priorities: strengthening the economy and prioritising new jobs for the unemployed, delivering better living and working standards, improving housing availability and affordability, responsible and sustainable management of the public finances, rebuilding trust in politics and public institutions, and protecting and enhancing peace in Northern Ireland.  We then set about delivering those priorities.<\/p><p>  Coalition governments are not easy.  By definition, two parties with different political outlooks will disagree on issues from time to time.  That is as it should be &ndash; robust debate is to be welcomed, not feared.  The key is compromise &ndash; to find an agreed solution that works in the country's best interests.  To find compromise, there must be trust and professionalism &ndash; that is at the heart of any coalition government.  The late US President John F. Kennedy, once said, &quot;Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right answer.&quot;  That is the core of the agreement that the Taoiseach and I reached - at all times seeking the right answer that will best serve the people of Ireland.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach is a man of integrity who has nothing other than Ireland's best interests at heart.  The trust at the centre of the Government has created the room for vigorous debate on policy that need not be taken as a crisis every time there is disagreement.  We had plenty of vigorous debate in advance of the budget but in the end, agreed a package that met our mutual objectives as laid down in the statement of Government priorities.<\/p><p>  The recent budget marked a decisive shift, completing the first phase of the recovery and beginning the second - restoring living standards for families, older people, and low and middle-income workers.  It combined modest, but focused, increases in public expenditure to address clear and identifiable needs, with highly progressive adjustments in USC and taxation that give the greatest proportion of the gains to low and middle-income workers.  Those adjustments in taxation will be seen in workers' pay packets from January, and every worker will benefit.<\/p><p>  Having already taken 310,000 workers out of the USC net in 2011, we removed an additional 80,000 workers from the USC net in the recent budget.  We made a series of other tax reforms that ensured 33,000 workers have been taken out of the top tax rate, tax has been reduced for those earning between &euro;33,800 and &euro;70,000, and the gains are capped for anybody earning over &euro;70,000.<\/p><p>  Also from January, we are increasing child benefit by &euro;5 for all families to assist with the cost of raising children, and we will repeat that in the next budget.  We have restored a 25% Christmas bonus for social welfare recipients this year, including pensioners, persons living alone, those with disabilities and carers, and we are providing for additional spending and new initiatives &ndash; through the Pathways to Work strategy and the Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; to increase the momentum on the employment front and to help jobseekers return to work.<\/p><p> We are providing a record &euro;3.8 billion for social housing and have started to recruit more teachers in our schools &ndash; including special needs assistants - and more garda&iacute; on our streets.  That is the social dividend, the investment dividend into Irish society.  We are rolling out a national broadband plan to assist economic growth, job creation and social inclusion in every community.  However, we must do much more than that, and we will.  The Government is committed to getting more people back to work, helping small businesses to prosper, building social and affordable homes and new schools, investing in health and reducing inequality.  In other words, the Government is committed to ensuring that the recovery works for the many and not just the few.<\/p><p> Work and fair wages are front and centre to that aim.  Full employment must be our key priority, because the strongest protection against poverty is decent, secure and fairly paid work.  Labour is the party of work.  That has been my abiding conviction since I first entered politics and it is my abiding conviction as leader of the Labour Party.  Many in this House who identify as being on the left devalue people going to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900013#M00300","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418138100,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900014#N00200","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1418138100,"counter":122,"content":"<p>That is rubbish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900014#N00300","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1418138100,"counter":123,"content":"<p>They seem to want welfare only.

It is for this reason we have established a strategic bank to drive credit into small and medium enterprises.  It is why we are progressively reducing taxes for low and middle-income earners in this budget from January, and will continue to do so in the next budget, so that they share in the recovery, and it why we are delivering collective bargaining for workers and have established a low pay commission to address wage issues.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s Construction 2020 and social housing strategies will, between them, bring tens of thousands of new affordable and social homes every year, and provide jobs for the 80,000 construction workers currently out of work.

It has seen every problem in terms of how to spin it.  After an enormous defeat in May&rsquo;s local elections, after rising discontent on the doorsteps and in the streets, and after a forced reshuffle, following an uprising in the Labour Party and disquiet in Fine Gael, the Government still does not get it.  It still does not understand the anger, frustration and basic everyday struggle of families throughout the country.<\/p><p>  This debate has been framed as a new start, the moment when the Government gets its act together and starts communicating its message.  The Taoiseach set it off yesterday with his launch of Fine Gael&rsquo;s budget calculator, to be accompanied by leafleting in every constituency.  According to Fine Gael, the calculator is there to show everyone how much money it is putting &quot;back in your pocket&quot;.  The calculator shows that the average family will get dramatically less than a high-income family, but the real revelation is to be found buried in the section termed &ldquo;assumptions&rdquo;.  There one finds two incredible statements, that &quot;Local property tax liabilities (if any) are ignored&quot; and that water charges are not included and &quot;The tax credit in respect of water charges paid during 2015 will be given in 2016&quot;.  Once again, the Government just does not get it.  It is a Government that implements damaging and unfair policies but thinks it can spin its way out of trouble.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the Labour Party fully shares this commitment to selective and dishonest spin.  This week it too has launched a post-budget offensive, with a claim that nearly 1.2 million children will benefit from the child benefit increase it claims it has secured.  It takes a special level of cynicism to cut something one said one would never touch and then ask for credit when one gives a bit of it back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900016#P00500","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1418139000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>You cut everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900016#P00600","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1418139000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>It is true that fiscal consolidation has been important and unavoidable.

There has been a sustained withdrawal of State support for marginalised communities and drugs have been seen as only important as a public order issue.  The social devastation that drugs cause is nowhere on the Government's agenda and was missing from the complacent and self-satisfied speeches of the Government we have heard to date.  In the face of this, it shows something about the priorities of the Taoiseach and his party that his only specific commitment for the next budget and for the years ahead is to cut taxes for the highest earners.<\/p><p>  In health, yet again claims of adequate funding have fallen apart within days.  The damage done in three years of failed policies has not been reversed.  At best the rate of decline will be maintained.  The Government has not given the HSE the funds required to maintain adequate services.  The massive rises in waiting lists, still dismissed by the Taoiseach, will not be halted but will get worse.  While the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, implies he knows it is flawed, the Government remains committed to implementing a health funding model which would lead directly to a massive health tax.  It would create a monster which would make Irish Water look like value for money.<\/p><p>  In education, schools face a growing funding crisis, with those who serve poorer communities suffering disproportionately.  Protests are being made by communities throughout the country as they see the impact on local life and on their children.  This is the direct result of regressive and avoidable policies.  The abolition of postgraduate grants and the elimination of career guidance counsellors' ex quota positions are two examples.<\/p><p>The approach of trying to implement policy without discussion or review led directly to last week&rsquo;s second-level school strikes and is part of a wider problem of refusing to engage with public servants.

It has also led to the withdrawal of community policing as the defining characteristic of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> The pattern of neglecting problems and allowing them to become crises has also shown itself regarding Northern Ireland.  When Fianna F&aacute;il pointed out the collapsing public confidence in the behaviour of the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, and the danger this posed, we received sustained abuse in response, not just from those parties but from the Government.  The Taoiseach even gave a speech saying things had never been better.  With growing problems on the street, rising sectarian tensions and an Executive which is destroying public trust in the achievements of the Good Friday Agreement, this week the Taoiseach will for the first time attend a negotiation with the parties.  That is not a record to be proud of.<\/p><p> The failure of the Government to implement even one significant reform of politics and government confirms how it mainly cares about retaining power.

However, the Government was determined at all costs to stop that.  A Government that is so frightened at the mere prospect of debating an Opposition motion is not fit to lead this State through the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.<\/p><p>  The distance between the Taoiseach's election rhetoric and the reality of this Fine Gael-Labour Government did not begin this week or last.  It is over two years since the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste of the day termed as a &ldquo;seismic shift&rdquo; and a &ldquo;game changer&rdquo; the Eurogroup commitment in June 2012 to separate banking and sovereign debt.  What has the Government done about that since?  It has failed to convince any of our European partners that Ireland deserved retrospective recapitalisation.  The truth is the Government has not even made the effort.  It is all spin and no substance.<\/p><p>  We saw how Labour and Fine Gael mishandled the GSOC affair, and the whistleblower controversy around Garda corruption which culminated in the firing of the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, and the resignation of the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.<\/p><p>  The local and European elections last May sent a very clear message from the citizens to the Government to change direction.  However, in what has become the hallmark of Labour and Fine Gael, they refused to listen.  The former T&aacute;naiste and leader of the Labour Party was sacrificed but nothing else changed.  Since the summer, the Government has been plunged into yet another series of controversies.  We had the McNulty-gate affair, which showed a clear insight into the Government's shameful attitude to the arts and its offensive sleeveen attitude to State boards.  Then there was the complete rejection of Labour and Fine Gael by the electorates of Dublin South-West and Roscommon-Leitrim South.  The Government also lost its Seanad majority.<\/p><p>  The overriding theme has been the pursuit of a deeply unfair economic policy, which has imposed brutal and destructive austerity measures on struggling families and vulnerable citizens.  The Government&rsquo;s budgets have been among the most regressive the State has ever seen.  Budget 2015 is the fourth regressive budget in a row.  It widened the rich-poor gap and deepened inequality.  For God&rsquo;s sake, what is the point of Labour if it does not uphold equality?  Budget 2015 represented an opportunity to give citizens a break.  Instead they got water charges, property tax and a cut to the top rate of tax, rewarding a wealthy minority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900017#Q01400","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1418139600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>What tax would we get from Sinn F&eacute;in?

As I said earlier the Government still refuses to listen.  It refused to listen to the huge demand of citizens in 2011 when it elected Fine Gael and Labour to put an end to the failed politics of the past.  It refused to listen to those elements of civil society and organisations which repeatedly warned of the disastrous social consequences of its policies.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach has refused to listen to his own backbenchers and the growing list of critics within his party.  He refuses, all the time, to listen to the Opposition here in the D&aacute;il, no matter what propositions we put forward.  The Government has used its huge majority to force through policies which have increased poverty, inequality and social exclusion.  Hundreds of thousands of citizens have been forced to emigrate on the Government's watch.  In the past eight years almost 500,000 of our citizens - young people mostly - have been forced to leave this State with desperate communal, societal and other consequences for families in particular.<\/p><p>  In cut after cut, the Labour Party, in particular, has attacked the very people it has always claimed to protect.  Is it Fine Gael&rsquo;s way or Labour&rsquo;s way?  Deputies should check it out.  The Government cut the respite care grant by &euro;325 annually.  The Cabinet sat down and decided to cut respite care grant by &euro;325.  It cut the fuel allowance and household benefits package, which some of the poorest households including the elderly and people with disabilities depend on to heat their homes, by six weeks or &euro;120 in the case of the fuel allowance.  The Cabinet sat down and took that decision collectively.<\/p><p>  It abolished the bereavement grant.  The Cabinet sat down and took that decision collectively.  It abolished the telephone allowance, taking &euro;251 from the annual budgets of people over 70 years of age.  It cut State pensions by hiking the pension age from 65 to 68.  It shortened the payment period of jobseeker's benefit by three months which amounts to a cut of 33% in this core weekly payment.  Again this was a collective decision of the Cabinet.<\/p><p>  It first taxed maternity benefit and then cut it.  The majority of maternity benefit recipients will now see their weekly payment cut by &euro;32.  It cut the rate at which the invalidity pension would have been payable to 65 year olds by &euro;36.80 per week.  The Cabinet, sitting round the table, took that decision.<\/p><p>  Under this Government the State&rsquo;s shambolic health system continues to crumble.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach stood by his former Minister for Health, even when primary care centres were conveniently located on the Minister&rsquo;s doorstep.<\/p><p> Then there was the debacle about the removal of discretionary medical cards when citizens with acute medical conditions and disabilities had their medical cards taken from them.  For a long time, perhaps over a year, the Government refused even to accept what its own backbenchers were telling it about this huge injustice being inflicted upon those families.  First we were told that there was no such thing as a discretionary medical card.  Who told us that?  A Labour Party Minister.  The Government capitulated and decided to return cards to some 15,000 people.  It did not, however, decide to return the cards to all those from whom they had originally been removed.  Last month we saw so-called reform of the medical card scheme, but citizens on discretionary medical cards are still in danger of losing them.<\/p><p> The troika is now gone, but I have my own little theory.  When the troika was here and the Government just did what it was told, things were okay.  However, when the Government had to deal with issues as they arose, it completely lost its way.  According to the well known maxim, it is not what happens to you in your life but how you respond to it which is the important matter.  This Government has been unable to deal in a competent, thought-out, strategic way with any event or crisis that has arisen on its watch.  Its cutbacks to funding for health services, education and training, as well as the failure to deal with funding for drug and alcohol addiction services, are having dreadful social repercussions.  So too is its refusal to build sufficient social housing to address the housing crisis and its refusal to stand up to the banks in defence of families in mortgage distress.  That says it all.  The Government is deferential to the elites and the big people while being absolutely dismissive of the small people.  I have said that many times in this Chamber.<\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in does its best to voice the concerns of countless thousands of citizens.  That is our mandate, but the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste will not answer a straightforward question put to them across the floor of this Chamber.  People have seen through this because citizens are not stupid.  They have seen through the patronising responses and insulting remarks.  The actions of the Government in this Chamber in failing to be straight with the Opposition or with citizens is damaging faith in the political system.  Every time the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste evade questions and duck and dodge their responsibilities, they merely expose this Government's arrogance and incompetence.  It is the arrogance of power or what passes for power in this Oireachtas.<\/p><p> The Government has no progressive policy on the Irish language.  The Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge is a non-policy.  Gaeltacht areas are being subverted by the failure to look after what are essentially the wells of Gaeilge.  According to a recent report, only 1,000 children are cainteoir&iacute; d&uacute;chais - only 1,000 native speakers in the Gaeltacht areas.<\/p><p> In his remarks, the Taoiseach never even mentioned the North.  The last time he had to make a keynote speech here he did not mention the North either.  The Government&rsquo;s approach to the North and the peace process has been totally inadequate.  He sees Sinn F&eacute;in as electoral rivals, rather than partners in peace-making.  That is a profound mistake which fails all of the people in the North - Unionists and the rest of us - as well as citizens across this State.  The Government has failed in its obligations by refusing to stand up to the British Government as equals on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements of which the Government is a co-guarantor.<\/p><p> For many Irish citizens, and particularly for people in the Six Counties, the success of the current discussions will be judged on whether they deliver justice to the many families injured and bereaved during the conflict.  We have the Eames and Bradley reports, and most recently, the proposals put by Meghan O'Sullivan and Richard Haass.  However, in a current paper to these talks, the British Government has invoked a national security clause to block victims and survivors from accessing information, thus keeping the truth hidden.  This Government cannot be complicit in this.  The Taoiseach must seek to have that national security clause removed because the families of Dublin and Monaghan, of Pat Finucane, of Ballymurphy and others expect nothing less.<\/p><p> The Government has no intention of properly marking the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising.  It has no plan and no vision.  Under recent pressure from the relatives of the 1916 Leaders, the Government produced a glossy brochure which was, however, devoid of historical substance or details.  The video which launched &quot;Ireland 2016&quot; made no mention of the Easter Rising or of the signatories of the Proclamation.  The truth is that Government will not mark the Rising appropriately because it is opposed to the political, social and economic intent of the Proclamation.<\/p><p> The Government's imposition of domestic water charges in the face of such widespread opposition is proving to be the final straw for many families.  Irish Water is this Government's Frankenstein creation and is a child of Fianna F&aacute;il's.  It has been characterised by excessive spending on consultants, bonuses and cronyism.  In fact, it has become synonymous with everything that is wrong with this Government - political manipulation of State boards, threats to citizens, and escalating taxes on struggling families.  Irish Water is now a toxic brand.  The Government should reverse its unjust water policy and scrap water charges.<\/p><p> Tomorrow&rsquo;s demonstration outside the gates of Leinster House will leave the Taoiseach in no doubt where citizens stand on this issue.  I am sure he is in no doubt, anyhow.  He has underestimated the level of public anger at the Government's record.  The Taoiseach's attitude stands in stark contrast to the deferential way he deals with elites in the EU or the banking fraternity, as opposed to ordinary, decent citizens.<\/p><p> What is needed is a complete change of political direction and a realignment of politics in this State.  A fairer way forward is required, involving economic stimulus, investment in public services, progressive taxation, and the abolition of water charges and the property tax.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach has said he sees the next election as a choice between Fine Gael or Sinn F&eacute;in.  The fundamental ideological difference between Sinn F&eacute;in and this deeply unpopular Government is that we believe in a real republic - a citizen-centred, rights-based society.  This Government believes in austerity, not rights, and in elites, not citizens.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach should take courage in his own hands.  If he is really serious, he should resign, call a general election, have a real democratic revolution and let the citizens decide.  I urge Deputies from all sides to reject the Government's counter-motion.  They should reject the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Government generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900017#Q01600","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418140200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Deputy John Halligan is sharing with Deputies Finian McGrath, Richard Boyd Barrett, Joan Collins, Thomas Pringle, Shane Ross and Clare Daly.

People from all walks of life seek advice in my offices, including employers, employees, the unemployed and families.  In recent years, they have told me the same story of the pain and suffering that has been inflicted on many of them.  I believe that unnecessary pain and suffering has been inflicted on the people due to greed and avarice, as well as reckless investment, spending and borrowing.<\/p><p>  Those who have had to pay the most are not responsible for what has happened.  The public are all too aware of the consequences of repaying this debt over the past six years.  We do not have enough teachers in classrooms or beds in hospitals, and waiting lists for critical services are increasing.<\/p><p>Thousands of children with disabilities are waiting years for assessments and supports.  No matter how much Government officials attempt to massage the figures, these are the facts.  We have one of the most expensive child care systems in the world and more than 750,000 of our people, including 200,000 children, live in poverty.  Food poverty is experienced by 10% of the population and we have very stark income related health inequality.  Calls to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul have increased by 100% since 2009 and the organisation is spending almost &euro;80 million per annum helping individuals and families in need.

In the little time I have left, I will tell a story about a woman called Paula Bergin, who died at Waterford Regional Hospital a short time ago.  She had private health insurance but shared a ward with four men and while she was dying, there was a soccer match on television, so the men were shouting and jumping up and down.  The Taoiseach may have read about this in the newspapers or heard about it.  What a way to die and what an undignified death.  Her husband and child could not hear her last words.  In 2014, that would not happen in most other countries or in the Third World.  Does the Taoiseach believe that family in Waterford would have confidence in the health system or this Government?

The school completion programme had a budget to help the most disadvantaged children in this State, but it has been cut from &euro;32.9 million to &euro;24 million over recent years, which is a cut of 33%.

No matter what game or manipulation happens in this Parliament, the Taoiseach should remember that real power lies with the people and real change has always come from the people mobilising on the street.  Reforms have been won in recent weeks because people have gone on the streets and refused to accept water charges or expressed their outrage against the homelessness crisis.  That is more than anything achieved by the Government in the past four years and more reforms will be won as those protests continue.

That is not so.<br\/><br\/>Instead, this Government, led by the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, took tough decisions in order to save Ireland from the consequences of economic collapse.  The Taoiseach and the Government held back the threat of disorder and chaos &ndash; economic and social chaos as witnessed elsewhere.<br\/><br\/>Political parties and individuals who trade in Toytown economics shrug that off.  I cannot do that.  I am in politics because of what I want to do, which is to protect<b><\/b>families and children.  I am committed to policies that keep disorder at bay and that ensure our services are kept working so that in better times they can be further developed for our people.  Funding services and dealing with social issues require a functioning economy.<br\/><br\/>I notice Deputy Adams said very little about the economy and how well it is functioning.  I would say that of other more recent contributors to the debate also.  All of that was under threat and this Government fought that threat and won.  It made Ireland a case study in economic recovery because the people of Ireland chose to believe in the diligence, the decency and the honour of the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny.  They knew he was not a sound-bite and headline man because they knew we were not in a time when sound-bites and headlines mattered.  This was down to the wire, as has been clearly illustrated in the speeches today.  This was a time to look past show business politics.  It was a time for people to trust and to hope for better times ahead.  The people did that and we did what they empowered us to do under the firm leadership of a man not intimidated by the terror of the collapse &ndash; the Taoiseach.<br\/><br\/>We retrieved our financial sovereignty; we pulled our finances back from manifest disaster; and contrary to the narrative out there, we have been one of the most reforming Governments in the history of the State.  However, we went further and we delivered on our promise to create the conditions that would create jobs.<\/p><p>For 28 months in a row the unemployment rate has fallen.  The Government target of creating 100,000 jobs by 2016 will not only be met, but exceeded, based on current growth levels and job creation.  This is not happening by accident.  It is the result of a determined effort by, and the policies of, this Government.  We have rebuilt Ireland&rsquo;s international standing.  We have implemented our Action Plan for Jobs.  We have pursued sector-specific initiatives such as the 9% VAT rate.  In three separate deals, the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, working with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, secured a reduction in the high interest rates on EU loan repayments, cancelled the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes and secured agreement to pay back International Monetary Fund, IMF, loans early. <\/p><p> Fixing Ireland&rsquo;s finances was immeasurably difficult but we have done that.  Let us not forget why.  At the beginning, when we took over, the job situation was so bad that people queued for the prospect of even a temporary, basic-pay position.  It was so bad, couples in their 20s and 30s, looking at their children and their teenagers, had to assume the worst, that they would be forced to emigrate, as their peers had to emigrate in order to find work.  That was the position at the beginning but from the start, we promised we would find ways to create jobs, and create them we did.  The reality, now, and let us neither miss nor forget it, is that, thanks to the strong, realistic hand of this Government, the children who were four and five when disaster struck, the teenagers who were 13 and 14 have a radically improved chance of getting a job, developing a career and building a life for themselves in Ireland.  That is never recognised by the Opposition or commented on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900020#T00600","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418142000,"counter":227,"content":"<p>This motion has been tabled in response to yet another Sinn F&eacute;in political stunt, another cynical move for easy headlines, more sound bites with the usual aim in mind: to encourage discontent, stoke up anger and resentment, and divide communities, which is what Sinn F&eacute;in has thrived on in this State for the past few years.  That is the hypocrisy of those opposite who attempt to undermine the mandate and legitimacy of a Government elected with a larger democratic majority than any other in the history of the State to do the very difficult job of cleaning up a Fianna F&aacute;il created crisis that virtually broke Ireland and rebuild a new future that is fairer and more sustainable.  The proposed motion of no confidence was the latest Sinn F&eacute;in kangaroo court, setting itself up as judge and jury, this time of the Government and Taoiseach, as if Sinn F&eacute;in was the only representative of the people.  Sinn F&eacute;in talks about transparency, fairness, new politics and of course its Ireland of equals, yet it protects its own hard men, some of whom are rapists and child abusers.  As always, a different standard applies to Sinn F&eacute;in soldiers, when the spotlight is on them for openness and transparency and justice, even relating to incidents long after the Good Friday Agreement.  A man who claims such loyalty to his cause that he even denies his own involvement in it demands a new honesty and transparency in the politics of his Ireland of equals - what a hypocrite.  His deputy leader claims to lead the fight on sexual abuse and women&rsquo;s rights but at the same time turns her back when challenged to deal with the disgraceful failings of her own party exposed by a brave young woman who was the victim of her people, all to protect and maintain a loyalty to her leader.  We have had enough of that hypocrisy, these stunts, the sit-ins, the aggressive promotion of divisions within society that Sinn F&eacute;in promotes as its new way of politics.<\/p><p>  Meanwhile, the Taoiseach and this Government are focused on providing a better future here and in Northern Ireland, on reform, recovery, job creation, supporting families, and vulnerable people who have suffered through hard times.  Through some of the toughest times this country has ever faced our Taoiseach has provided leadership, optimism and an unfailing belief that our country can and will recover when many others opposite were giving up and despairing of the future.  We do not have a perfect track record, not by a long shot, but we have achieved, as a Government, under the stewardship of the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste, and our record stands for itself, if people are honest in their judgment, with 80,000 jobs created since 2012, unemployment at the lowest rate since 2009, an exit from the enforced bailout, a return to strong economic growth - the strongest now in the European Union - and a reduction in the tax burden for low and middle income earners for the first time in seven years.  On social issues, such as the Cloyne diocese, the Magdalen laundries, marriage equality, homelessness, the rights of children, gender balance and much more, the Taoiseach has demonstrated a humanity and openmindedness to bring about real change for people who have been wronged and ignored by successive Governments.<\/p><p>  This Government will learn from its mistakes.  We have made more than we should have, particularly this year.  We will try harder, motivated by what is right for Ireland and all our people, as opposed to trying to divide society.  While others will continue to try to undermine the progress and stability this Government has fought so hard and asked people to make sacrifices to build, Sinn F&eacute;in will try to replace it with something much more sinister, divisive and negative for the future of our country.  We will work to bring people together behind a new vision of a changed, not perfect, but much better Ireland.  We will finish the job that people elected us to do over the next 15 months or so.  The Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste are leading that effort and have my full support and the support of both parties in government in this motion. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900021#U00200","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1418142000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>The motion before us here today states: &ldquo;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann reaffirms its confidence in the Taoiseach and in the Government.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach should enjoy his victory today when he wins this vote but he should remember it is a pyrrhic victory.  It will not last long.  History shows that many who feel the need to have a vote of confidence in themselves and their leaders come to a sticky end not too long after.  This pyrrhic victory will give the Taoiseach a glow for this evening but the real test will be in the ballot box.  I believe the public has already decided it has no confidence in this Government.  The Taoiseach will win today.  He should enjoy his hour of glory.<\/p><p>  The people are cross because the Taoiseach promised a democratic revolution.  He had, as Minister after Minister has said, the biggest majority in the history of the State but he squandered it.  People expected more from him.  He promised them more.  He promised a democratic revolution but the public got nothing.  It was short-changed and let down.  This is why people are not happy with how politics is conducted in Ireland.  The public, as we have seen in election after election, is not happy with any of the established political parties.  That is in part because the two parties to which it gave the biggest mandate since the foundation of the State have let it down badly in promising reform and not delivering it.<\/p><p>  People expected honesty and openness as the hallmark of this Government but not even the Cabinet is in the loop for some major decisions of the Economic Management Council.  We have seen on some occasions, whether to do with banking or other EU issues, the Minister for Finance reading a script in the Chamber and members of the Government are so far excluded they do not know what will be on the next page.  Not only is there no honesty and openness, but that does not even apply within the Cabinet ranks.<\/p><p>  The Government has been in office for four years.  For the first three years of that time the troika held its hand.  It has been on its own for one year and what a year that has been.  It has been a political disaster in the way the Government has managed the country.  For the first three years its hands were tied.  It had very little to do but show up and read pre-ordained scripts in here.  It got along well for the first three years.  People will disagree about whose programme it was implementing but it implemented a programme.  Once it was left on its own the Government started to collapse almost immediately. <\/p><p>In the past year, the Taoiseach has been forced to sack the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Garda Commissioner, the confidential recipient and many other people.  He has been forced to sack the Minister for Health and to exile the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It is clear that the Government learned nothing during all of this.  I introduced legislation in this House last week, on foot of the McNulty affair and the sham appointments to State boards, to put such appointments on a statutory footing.  I do not want them to be made by way of guidelines, which is what the Government is determined to do so that it can avoid a statutory process.<\/p><p> The medical card fiasco has continued in the past year.  The probity review that was announced 14 months ago as part of the October 2013 budget has caused havoc in the health cards system.  We have not got over that yet.  The Minister is still talking about trying to provide for more discretion at local level, but that has not happened to date.  One of the problems with this Government is that it does not deliver on its promises.  One of the reasons for that is that all of its budgets have been regressive.  It has had options, but each year it has chosen to impose most of its adjustments on front-line services that affect people who are waiting to access accident and emergency services, to get outpatient appointments or to move up the fair deal waiting list.<\/p><p> The Government established the new Department of Children and Youth Affairs and held a referendum on children's rights.  It blew that referendum.  It has yet to be enacted because of the actions of the Taoiseach's office, the offices of certain Ministers or certain Government offices in seeking to use the people's money to influence how they should vote in the referendum.  That referendum has not yet been implemented.  I applauded the establishment of the new Department, which was outstanding.  However, approximately 800 children are sleeping out of home tonight.  They are in hotel rooms and bed and breakfasts.  They are carrying their bags up and down the stairs.  They do not know where they will be for Christmas.  What kind of stress is that putting on their mothers and fathers?  That is what this Department of Children and Youth Affairs is doing for children.  It is doing very little.  The impact on families is extraordinary.<\/p><p> I met a lady in Mountrath this morning before I came to the House for this debate.  She told me she will scream if she hears once more that Ireland is out of recession.  The Government has been screaming at the people that the country is out of recession, but the majority of people have not felt that in their own pockets.  I know there is more spending in the shops.  One third of the population is probably doing well.  They probably have more money, but two thirds of people do not.<\/p><p> The Government also established the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and gave it the simple job of drawing up accurate budgets and expenditure plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900021#U00300","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418142600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Simple, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900022#V00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1418142600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>In 2012, after the establishment of the new Department, we had the biggest overrun in Government expenditure since the foundation of the State.  That was exceeded last week when Supplementary Estimates of &euro;1.184 billion had to be introduced to make up for the flawed budget of 13 months ago.  We told the Minister the day that budget was introduced that the budget and Estimates process was flawed.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has failed and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has done nothing for children yet.  I know new agencies have been set up, but that does not help the children who are sleeping in bed and breakfasts tonight.<\/p><p>  Irish Water, which is a Fine Gael brainchild, was established during the course of this year.  The Government promised to abolish quangos, but it did the exact opposite.  We now have the biggest quango to be set up in living memory.  It must be remembered that people are already paying for water services.  The extra &euro;140 million that will come in from this, after the payments from the Department of Social Protection are taken into consideration, is no longer fundamental to the national finances.  That &euro;140 million is not necessary.  It is not worth the &euro;700 million that the Government is sinking into the ground on meters or the amount of money it is paying to consultants.  Why do we have this?  The Government has started to use a new phrase.  It says it is going to repair the water leaks off balance sheet and fix our water supply off balance sheet.<\/p><p>  The Government promised in its Budget Statement two months ago that it would provide &euro;2.6 billion for social housing over the next three years.  Much of that is to be off balance sheet.  We will no longer build social houses from our own resources as we have done since foundation of the State.  It now seems that a social house can be built only if it is off balance sheet.  The Government had announced that &euro;3.8 billion would be provided for these purposes over an extended period.  Two weeks ago, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, said that much of this will be off balance sheet.  The Government's answer to everything is off balance sheet.  The second half of its equation is tax cuts for the wealthy.  This Government is the only one that is off balance sheet.  People's water bills are not off their balance sheets.  They will come out of their bank accounts.  The homeless people and the difficulties on the street are not off balance sheet.  The Government tries to outsource the solutions to such problems because it does not want to handle them directly.<\/p><p>  Over the past two months, the Government has followed its mantra of tax cuts for the wealthy and off balance sheet solutions.  The people of Ireland will not buy that.  The Government made too many promises.  The Taoiseach is looking after his own.  Fine Gael people will probably thank him for that.  In the budget, the Government announced a 1% cut in the top rate of tax paid by the highest earners in the country.  It has promised a further 1% cut ten months out from the next budget.  I never before heard of a tax announcement being made ten months before a budget.  The Government's economic emphasis is on further tax cuts for the people at the highest income levels.  More off balance sheet solutions will probably be proposed to deal with problems like homelessness, housing and water services.<\/p><p>  This is a divisive and regressive Government.  Every budget it has introduced has been socially and economically regressive.  The burden of the adjustment in each of its budgets has been more heavily weighted in favour of expenditure cuts than taxation measures.  Each of the Government's budgets has been unfair.  They have lacked fairness.  I actually think that is what Fine Gael wants.  Fine Gael is happy with this divisive measure.  It has made a divided society.  I believe it suits some of the Members opposite to have a divided society.  We saw that in the political pong-pong here this afternoon.  They want a chasm in society.  They do not want a homogenous middle ground.  Most Irish people like to be in the centre.  The Government wants a battle of the right and left.  I believe it wants a divided society.  It has divided society.  However, the people of Ireland are very united in their determination to vote no confidence in Fine Gael and the Labour Party at the ballot box the next time they get an opportunity to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900022#V00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1418142600,"counter":232,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Howlin, is sharing time with the Minister, Deputy Bruton.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900022#V00400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1418142600,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have a brief opportunity to contribute to this debate, regardless of how ill-conceived the tabling of this motion of no confidence was.

There is a tendency in some quarters to talk down this country.  In time, we will look back on the collective effort of the people of Ireland to rescue this country and we will be very proud of it.

That was the case during the Celtic tiger years and it is surely the case now after six years of fiscal retraction.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, has led our national recovery alongside the former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, and the current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton.  The Taoiseach will go down in history as one of our finest taoisigh.  He will retire with a record of real and substantial achievement.  I am proud to have served in his Government.  We have turned around the State's economic fortunes.  We have been a real reforming Government.  I am proud to have placed legislation supporting whistleblowers on the Statute Book for the first time and to have restored the freedom of information regime in the way it was originally designed in the 1990s.  We have extended and strengthened the powers of the Ombudsman.  This House sits longer than at any stage previously in our history.  Contrary to popular belief, the guillotine is practically redundant.  For the first time in decades, councillors at local government level are sitting down to make real decisions on the deployment of resources.  That process, of itself, has been revealing.<\/p><p>  The no confidence motion was tabled by an unholy alliance of those who created the mess from which we are recovering and those who are determined to make it worse.  It is a limp affair, offered by parties that are going through the motions.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in, the party led by the \"Leader for Life\", the Enver Hoxha of Irish political life, voted for the bank guarantee, socialising banking debt on the backs of the Irish people.  Far from the radical party of the left, it proved to be the bankers' poodle on the one occasion when it really mattered.<\/p><p> It is joined by the real author of our financial collapse, Fianna F&aacute;il, which is led by a man who almost stuck it out to the end before deserting that particular sinking ship.  Having joined together to back this motion, are they offering an alternative Government?  Should this D&aacute;il vote itself into a general election today?  They are not.  Their policy alternatives are not real, but they know that.  Nor are they even prepared to ally themselves together to form a Government.  Hardly a day goes by when the leaders opposite rule out sharing power with each other.  It is bizarre that the only party that all of the parties opposite want to share power with is my own.  They are joined by the Independents, who seem to spend most of their time discussing how to lose their independence through some form of alliance.  I listened with interest to their new apparent leader, the reinvented cheerleader of Anglo Irish Bank, Deputy Ross.<\/p><p> The Opposition tabled not so much a motion of no confidence in the Government as a motion rejecting governance itself.  Government is a place where hard decisions are made.  Democracy is not some form of juvenile game where individuals pursue heightened forms of personal purity.  Democracy is the process by which people with competing interests and perspectives come together as adults to resolve real differences and take decisions, supported by the majority and protective of the minority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900022#V00700","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418143200,"counter":237,"content":"<p>And keep their mandate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900023#W00200","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1418143200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>The Deputies opposing this motion are asking the people to embrace anarchy and to take another chance with chaos.

I can say that with some justification, as I have previously been one of his critics.  He has been immensely strong at a time when we needed someone to step up, make hard decisions and understand people.  There is no one better than the Taoiseach at understanding people, be they the women of the Magdalen laundries or the homeless on our streets.  He is willing to go out and talk to them.  He does not hide away.  He is not out of touch.  He has that humanity, but he also has an understanding of the considerable task that we faced as a country three years ago.  It was an extraordinary time.  It is easy to forget that 300,000 jobs had been wiped out.  Some 20% of private sector jobs disappeared overnight.  We were on the hook for &euro;64 billion and were spending 50% more than we were taking in in revenue.<\/p><p>  Parties opposite state that they are anti-austerity.  Everyone is anti-austerity, but policies based on spending one's way out of trouble when one is already spending 50% more than one is accruing in revenue are madness.  Those were the strategies being offered by the benches opposite.  They continued in that vein.  Year after year, Sinn F&eacute;in has stated that it would make 80% of the adjustment on the tax side.  This would have meant the extraction of &euro;5 billion more in taxes from our people and businesses during the past four years.  We would not have had an economy in recovery.<\/p><p>  Instead, the Taoiseach understood that we could not build over the old fault lines of the property culture left by Fianna F&aacute;il.  We needed to create entirely new sectors.  He has driven the hunger to find those sectors and to build a strong economy on a sustainable basis.  Not only have we created 80,000 jobs, which the rhetoric of those opposite completely denies, but they are located in every region.  Some 94% of these are full-time jobs in sustainable sectors, not part-time, yellow pack jobs.  We will create more.  These jobs are fixing people's lives.  This is not just about statistics.  It is about people who can get up in the morning with a purpose and the ability to fulfil their potential.  They can provide incomes for themselves and their loved ones.  They can also provide money to help us as a Government to address some of the issues on our streets.  We see them all of the time.  Homelessness is the issue of today, but there are many others in the health sector that we need to be able to fix.<\/p><p>  Remarkably, the recent budget, which was slated by the troika for not taking a further &euro;2 billion out of our economy through taxes and spending cuts, saw us restoring &euro;1 billion thanks to our progress.  It is not a lot and people's patience is strained to breaking point at times, but it points to the direction in which the country is going.  We can realistically have confidence in the vision that the Taoiseach so often articulates about wanting a country in which people can live and grow old in dignity and our young people have a future.  We are creating that.  When we entered office, net emigration was 34,000 people.  That rate has decreased by 30%, but we are nowhere near where we need to be.  We want the elimination of net emigration.  We want any young person who wants to make his or her future in Ireland to have that opportunity.<\/p><p>  When I listen to the parties opposite, I never hear a word about the importance of enterprise.  The truth is that it is enterprise that will create employment.  There is no Sinn F&eacute;in policy on enterprise.  There is no Independent policy on enterprise.  They believe that it just grows on trees, that they can load more taxes on employers and workers and do not have to create an environment that is good for start-ups but that it will all still happen anyway.  They do not believe that they have to create an environment in which external investors, who once fled the country in their droves, are willing to invest money.  One must work at these factors day in, day out.  That is what the Taoiseach has driven in our economy.  His enthusiasm and commitment have rallied people to find the energy to drive change.  It is remarkable.<\/p><p>  I am a long time in politics and have seen many glossy statements of intent being published by Ministers in a blaze of glory, only to see them shrink away when things fail.  Under the Taoiseach's guidance, everyone is held to account for delivering on commitments.  That is at the heart of our Action Plan for Jobs, Pathways to Work and every one of our strategies.  Accountability represents a major change.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, is driving real change in our public service.  We can be confident that we will not only have more resources, but that we will have a public service that has the ability to be performance driven.  This is a fantastic achievement of the Government.  It is what we will need in the coming five years as we continue to grapple with high levels of unemployment and create enterprise in new areas that are as yet undreamt of.  We need the sort of Government that the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have been offering.

Who exactly does he think he is fooling?  The Government's demonstrable track record is one of deepening inequality.  This means children living in poverty and sleeping in bed and breakfasts, hotels and hostels.  It means people sleeping on the streets.<\/p><p>It means families living in poverty.  It means vast numbers of people struggling just to get by, worrying night after night about their basic household bills.  That is the collective achievement of Ministers opposite.  If this is what they call success, I only hope we never witness what they might regard as failure.  I note that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, in confessing to having made some mistakes, vows that the Government will go and make some more.  I have no doubt that will send a chill down many people's spines.<br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach harked back to 2011 in his opening remarks, recalling a time when people were &quot;dazed&quot; and &quot;horrified&quot;.  It might interest him to know that people remain dazed - dazed by his relentless austerity, dazed by his detachment from the real lives and struggles of ordinary people.  The public also remains horrified - horrified, above all, at the prospect of another year or more of this Government.  The people want the Taoiseach and his Ministers to go, and they would like them to do so quickly and with some grace.  However, the people are also prepared to face down the Taoiseach and his Government.  The people are defiant and they have had their fill of Ministers' soundbites, negativity and misinformation.  Tomorrow, Members opposite will see, at the gates of this building, the latest manifestation of that defiance.  In order to prevent panic among the ranks of Government, I assure the Taoiseach, on the people's behalf, that this is not a stunt designed to distract attention from other pressing matters.  Tomorrow will be a day of reckoning when the people's demand for the abolition of domestic water charges will ring across this city.  Tomorrow, the people's demand for water as a human right will echo across Dublin and beyond.  Will the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste listen to that message?  Will they hear the people's simple messages or will they consider their demand to be ill conceived, as ill conceived as this motion which proclaims this Administration's competence to govern?<br\/><br\/>The Minister, Deputy Howlin, always strikes a very lofty tone when he talks about reform.  However, what is notable in the response from the Government is the almost hysterical reaction when it is challenged and called to account.  The T&aacute;naiste congratulated herself and the Taoiseach earlier on their fight against unemployment.  Both she and the Taoiseach placed inflated figures regarding job creation on the record.  The fact is, as the Taoiseach knows, that for every job created by this Government, five people have emigrated.  The number of young people in employment is 15,500 lower than it was in 2011.  We have the highest rate of low-paid jobs in the OECD.  We have the third highest rate of underemployment across the EU 28.  How is that for Toytown economics, to use the phrase of the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald?  For people who live in the real world, these facts are the evidence of poor economic policy, poor economic planning and poor economic delivery.<br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach's soundbites regarding Ireland's &quot;cold and heartless past&quot; and his claim to have dealt with past injustices inflicted by the State on the watch of his party and others do not tally with the reality.  He mentioned the women of the Magdalen laundries.  The truth is that the McAleese initiative and report was a whitewash.  The United Nations has recognised that.  The truth is that the penny-pinching <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme the Government has offered to these women is utterly miserly.  The truth is that the similar <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme afforded to survivors of symphisiotomy demonstrates again a disregard in real terms for the experiences and trauma of the women affected.  Needless to say, this Government's treatment of Louise O'Keeffe and her pursuit of justice laid bare its attitude towards dealing with victims.<br\/><br\/>I have been and remain a champion for all those who have suffered these types of injustices, every single last one of them.  I have made that repeatedly clear on the record of the House, but the Government does not want to hear it.  It is more convenient for Ministers opposite to attack Sinn F&eacute;in and, in a very personal way, to attack me.  If that is the route they choose, it is of course their choice.  However, it will not deter me or my colleagues from doing the right thing.  When it comes to dealing with victims of mother and baby homes, county homes, orphanages and children's homes - Catholic, Protestant and State-run - we will be holding the Government to account to provide a fully inclusive scheme to bring truth and justice to those people.<br\/><br\/>The central catch-cry for this Government was a democratic revolution and the notion of political reform.  I have not seen any real evidence of that.  The instinct of the Government remains one of absolute conservatism.  When challenged, members of the Government close ranks.  In fact, it is nearly regarded by them as something of an insult or presumption should somebody on this side of the House challenge the Government on the way politics operates and who are the political insiders as against the political insiders.  That is very revealing and it has been revealed again in the course of this debate.  The Taoiseach's colleagues in government have been hysterical in their attempts to defend him and his Administration.  They demonstrate not just sensitivity but hyper-sensitivity to any form of criticism.  Above all, they utterly discount any notion that there is an alternative to this Government.  Indeed, that is really their problem with Sinn F&eacute;in and with people in the Independent ranks.  They do not like the fact that a coherent alternative to their failed Government is now emerging.<br\/><br\/>I have no doubt that in the run-in to the election, Ministers will move heaven and earth, do and say anything to convince the people that as bad as they are, they are as good as it gets.  Let me tell them that is not the case.  Let me tell them that the people, in increasing numbers, are on to them and their scare tactics.  They talk about &quot;sinister fringes&quot; when referring to decent citizens who come out and stand up for themselves and their families.  The Taoiseach should call it a day now.  He would be doing everybody a favour of he did.  If he shares the commitment to democracy about which the Minister, Deputy Howlin, waxed lyrical a few moments ago, let him test that democratic principle.  Let him go to the people and show he trusts their judgment and their capacity to make the right decisions for themselves, their families and their communities.  The Taoiseach and his colleagues referred to the instability a political alternative might represent.  The only instability that bothers any of them is the possibility that they might be removed from their cushy jobs.  That is another fact which is clear for people to see.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900023#W00700","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418143800,"counter":244,"content":"<p>The Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, are sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900024#X00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1418143800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I rise to support the motion of confidence in the Taoiseach and the Government.  When we assess the contribution and performance of any government, we must look back to what its members said they would do if they were trusted by the people with the reins of office.  We said we would repair the public finances and do so without increasing income tax.  That has been done and our public finances are now in good order.  Not only have we not increased income tax, we actually reduced it in the latest budget.  We said we would create 100,000 jobs.  We are now up to 80,000 and set to reach our target before the next election, with unemployment having fallen 24 months in a row.  We said we would bring about a smaller and more efficient public sector, and that has been done.  We said we would bring about fair care.<\/p><p>The first steps towards universal health care will be taken with the extension next year of GP care without fees to those over 70 and those under six, the oldest and youngest in society.<\/p><p> We stated that we would bring about a new politics.  We do not always tell the story in respect of this matter very well and, before she left, Deputy McDonald asked us to provide examples of what we have done.  I will provide three simple examples, namely: the ban on corporate donations, which has at long last ended the link between money and politics; the introduction of gender quotas for candidates, which will give people the choice to vote for women candidates in big numbers at the next election; and, very importantly, long overdue legislation to regulate lobbying and protect whistleblowers.  These are just three examples but I could provide more.<\/p><p> Getting here has been very tough and the Irish people have made enormous sacrifices to bring the country to the position in which it now finds itself.  That position is much better than the one the country occupied three and a half years ago.  Once again, the future for Ireland is bright.  We can look forward to a growing economy and increasing employment.  A growing economy is not just for the sake of it.  The reason we need the economy to grow is in order that we can put more money back into people's pockets and find the resources to invest in improving public services.  We are only getting started and neither the future nor the economy are secure.  We can fall backwards and there are risks.  I, for one, do not want to take those risks by handing over control of the country to the parties opposite.  A clear division is emerging in the House, with the Government parties on one side and a potential Opposition led by Sinn F&eacute;in, and including Fianna F&aacute;il and perhaps some Independents, on the other.  It is a division between those who saved Ireland from bankruptcy and those who either brought us to the brink of it or who would return us to that point.  It is a division between those who would cut taxes in order to create employment and support enterprise and those who would raise taxes, destroy jobs and drive investment, business and professionals overseas.  It is a division between those on this side of the House who respect the law, the Garda and stand up for law and order and those on the other side who engage in violent protest and intimidation and who traffic child abusers throughout the country.<\/p><p> Having outlined the position in respect of the Government, I now wish to turn to the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, in whom we are also being asked to vote confidence.  When the history of the 21st century is written, the Taoiseach will be recognised for his leadership and for steering this country through the perilous waters of financial disaster left behind after years of mismanagement on the part of successive Fianna F&aacute;il Governments.  He is the pilot who weathered the storm.  He did so by leading a coalition Government in making some of the most difficult decisions ever made in the history of the State.  What he has done has not always been popular but good leadership does not always bring easy popularity.  As the Taoiseach stated, our work is not yet done.  We will continue to do the job of bringing prosperity back to the Irish people.  Instead of trying to work with us for the good of the country, Sinn F&eacute;in and the parties opposite prefer to create ways to foment a storm of controversy.  By doing so, they sacrifice good leadership for cheap political gain.  If they were in charge, such an approach would wreck the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900024#X00300","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418144400,"counter":247,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900025#Y00200","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1418144400,"counter":248,"content":"<p>Instead, we are fortunate to have in charge of this country a Government and a Taoiseach who can rise above such petty rancour and provide real leadership.

It is worth recalling what things were like when we came to power.  I refer to an article published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in March 2011, which states:<blockquote>Ireland&rsquo;s appalling implosion still elicits a sense of astonishment.  By far the prime response is to wonder how things became so bad so quickly in a country which seemed not long ago to have been doing so well.  A small country held out as an exemplar for others is now quite the opposite.  Changing that perception won&rsquo;t be easy.<\/blockquote>The Government did not waste time wondering how matters became so bad so quickly.  Instead, it focused on solutions.  We all know that it has not been easy.  We have been obliged to take decisions that no government would want to take and the Irish people have had to make tremendous sacrifices.  However, those decisions and sacrifices are now paying dividends.  We have reclaimed our economic sovereignty and Ireland's international standing has been repaired.  The country is standing on its own two feet again and we are able to make choices for ourselves.<br\/><br\/>Ireland recently raised almost &euro;4 billion on its first bond sale since 2009.  This is testament to the international respect the country has regained.  This could not have been achieved without the leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny.  Few would have been strong enough to take on such an enormous task but this is a man who has dedicated his life to public service.  No one has worked harder to secure Ireland's recovery during the past 1,300 days.  I know that the Taoiseach remains as committed and determined as ever to ensuring that Ireland continues on the right track.  In the three and a half years since we came to office have we got everything right?  No.  Has every decision been absolutely correct?  No.  Let us consider what has been achieved, however.  Where once Ireland faced complete economic collapse, now there is growing confidence in our economic management.  Where once people feared losing their jobs, the Government's action plan has created more than 80,000 jobs.  Where once people feared constantly for the future, there is now an increasing sense of security and confidence.<br\/><br\/>As a GP, I have seen at first hand the devastating impact unemployment has on families and individuals.  Not only is there a financial crisis, there is also a crisis of confidence and what can often be a crippling loss of self-esteem.  That is why the Government makes no apologies for placing jobs at the heart of its mission.  There is no more important goal than to return people to work.  Restoring international confidence in Ireland's economic management is crucial in this regard because it is key to securing the inward investment that generates jobs.  During the past year over 140,000 people have left the live register in order to take up employment.  For each of these individuals and their families, this represents the beginning of a process of healing.  That process includes the restoration of workers' sense of self-worth, the return of families' confidence and the revitalisation of communities.  In decision after decision, the Government - led by An Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny - has made the right call in order to position this country for a new, more successful future built on wiser and fairer principles.<br\/><br\/>It is not just about economics but economic recovery is essential to rebuilding our society in order that each and every person will be respected and cared for.  I have the great privilege to serve as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I am proud to be a member of the Government which created the first ever Cabinet Minister with responsibility for children and young people; delivered the most comprehensive reform of child protection, early intervention and family support ever embarked upon with the creation of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency; committed an additional &euro;26 million in funding to that agency this year; and maintained its commitment to provide a free year of early childhood care and education for every child in the country, despite the economic pressures that exist.  The Government has not finished yet.  An Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, continues to lead us in the vital work of rebuilding our society.  Not only are he and the Government committed to making Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business, we will also make it the best small country in which to grow up and raise a family in order that we can all look forward to better outcomes and brighter futures.<br\/><br\/>I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900025#Y00400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1418144400,"counter":250,"content":"<p>As Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, I have met many groups from across the globe.

We will tell it constantly and unreservedly.  It is the only way because the people always have a right to know.<\/blockquote>Where has that thinking gone?  We cannot even get answers to questions on the floor of this House.  What we have seen is a political culture that is more, and not less, entrenched in the old ways.  There has been superficial box-ticking.  The radical reform the citizens expected and voted for has not materialised.  Instead of insisting and demanding that Europe share the enormous debt <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">&mdash;<\/font>43% of the entire European banking debt, for example, was shouldered by just one country, Ireland <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">&mdash;<\/font>the Government did not even ask for a write-down.

All year, the Opposition has been raising the Irish Water issue, but it was only when 100,000 people turned out on the streets that the Government paid attention.  For more than a year, the housing crisis has been turning into a homelessness crisis.  It was only when Jonathan Corrie died across the street, on Molesworth Street, that there was an outcry and the Government paid attention.  What is most amazing about that is that the Taoiseach tried today in his contribution to turn his action on that crisis, which he helped to create, into a virtue.

They are preparing to flood the streets and march to show that all the tricks and black propaganda about sinister elements, sinister fringe elements and dissident elements demonising the protests have not worked.  They are marching to show they have not bought or eaten the baby carrot of a tiny concession of a delay in uncapped charges until 2019.

I have absolute confidence that people will mobilise in massive numbers at 1 p.m. at the back of the D&aacute;il.  People should do whatever they can to be there.  If they cannot be there until after work, they should come in after work.  The judgment they will pass is clear: no confidence in the water charges and the Government.

It is felt that the Government is in its final days.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach keeps telling us he has made Ireland a great country to do business in once again and that the economy is booming.  It is very significant that the Government does not seem to have a problem with the fact that Ireland has the fastest-rising rate of child poverty in Europe.  That is very significant in terms of how things have been done.  The Taoiseach referred earlier to community.  Sadly, most communities do not feel the benefits of the past four years.<\/p><p>  The Government side referred to the Magdalen laundries and symphysiotomy.  Truth be told, however, the Government was dragged kicking and screaming to these issues, and they are still not resolved.  We all know individuals such as Fr.

When he sees reconstructed, stable banks, the rest of us see struggling mortgage holders who never got any help from this Government and who never got a write-down on inflated house prices.  When the Taoiseach says Ireland is the best small country in the world in which to do business, tens of thousands of people regard it as the best small country to leave.  I could not believe it when the Taoiseach said Ireland should never be a cold house for its people.  He said so in the midst of the biggest housing emergency this State has ever known and about which the Government is doing little or nothing.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach's claim to be making progress on women's rights is also delusional.

Members should cast their minds back to how bad things were.  This country was in a bailout situation and the people were left with a legacy of debt that will take decades to eradicate.  In January 2011, we were locked out of the international markets and our reputation in Europe was in tatters.  In January 2011, unemployment levels were literally spiralling out of control.  In the three years prior to 2011, 250,000 jobs had been lost, that is, approximately 7,000 jobs a month.  In January 2011, 7,000 people every month were having their lives thrown in turmoil and uncertainty due to unemployment.<br\/><br\/>Overcoming these incredible challenges not only required hard work and the support and sacrifice of the Irish people.  It required the strong leadership that has been delivered by Deputy Enda Kenny since 2011.  Since becoming Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny has worked tirelessly to restore this country's sovereignty, to bring back prosperity and to make Ireland once again a great place in which to raise a family.<br\/><br\/>The economy, which was in such a perilous state just three and a half years ago, is coming back.  Sometimes I think our international colleagues are much more willing to recognise this than we are ourselves.  According to the European Commission, Ireland will be the fastest growing economy in Europe this year, and <i>Forbes<\/i>magazine declared Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business.  We are well on track to exceed our target of creating 100,000 new jobs by 2016, a target that was originally scoffed at by the Opposition.  Unemployment is at its lowest level in five years.<br\/><br\/>In my Department, I am extremely glad to be in a position to be increasing funding for the arts for the first time in six years.  The Government is determined to continue with this progress.  Unfortunately, the Opposition is focused on negativity, determined to do down the achievements of the people of this country who have shown such resolve to succeed.  The Government fully recognises that the people have had an extremely difficult number of years.  That is why, from January, every household with somebody in full-time work will be a bit better off.<br\/><br\/>As for the great populist party, Sinn F&eacute;in want to hike up taxes and destroy our jobs recovery.  Farmers, the self-employed and those with savings should be wary of what a Sinn F&eacute;in Government would mean.  They want to tax the economy out of existence.  For example, a farmer with land worth &euro;1 million, which is approximately 100 acres, and who might only earn between &euro;15,000 and &euro;20,000 a year from that land, would be liable for a wealth tax under Sinn F&eacute;in.  Their high tax policies would drive foreign direct investment out of this country and unfairly penalise entrepreneurs, resulting in unemployment.<br\/><br\/>As has often been said, good leadership is humility with a strong resolve to succeed.  The Taoiseach has shown humility in the face of adversity and an absolute unwavering resolve to succeed for the betterment of this country and its people.  It is in the best interest of the economy and society that the Government stays the course and continues to deliver a better standard of living for all the people in the State.  We will continue with this job.  We will be undeterred by the stunts, the bogus policies and the empty rhetoric of those on the Opposition benches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900027#AA00400","speaker":"973"},{"type":"speech","time":1418145600,"counter":260,"content":"<p>This motion of confidence in the Taoiseach and the Government has been tabled in response to Sinn F&eacute;in's motion of no confidence.<\/p><p>  I take the opportunity to nail this idea that Sinn F&eacute;in is a left-wing party.  Sinn F&eacute;in is an extremist nationalist party.  What extremist nationalist parties across Europe do is attach their logo to everything that is popular and reject everything that is unpopular in order to get nationalist sentiment going.  When they think the bank guarantee is popular, they support that and then they pretend that they did not.  They say defaulting is a good idea even though we know the devastating effect that would have had on social protection, on public service jobs and on the country in general.  That is not a left-wing position.<\/p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in states it is in favour of a wealth tax.  The property tax is a wealth tax but, of course, Sinn F&eacute;in cannot see that.  Only two months ago, when Labour councillors and Green Party councillors on Dublin City Council suggested that rather than having a 15% reduction in the property tax in Dublin city they would have a 7.5% reduction and have &euro;4 million put into homeless services, Sinn F&eacute;in councillors voted against it.  When faced with either a populist decision on a real wealth tax and a populist decision of defending the homeless, they opted for the populist decision on a wealth tax.  They cannot get their head around the fact that the property tax is a wealth tax and they voted to reduce it by 15%, meaning that the average &euro;1 million home owner in Dublin city got &euro;375 back while the homeless of Dublin did not get the &euro;4 million that we hoped they would get.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900027#AA00500","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1418145600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>We will bring in a different tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900027#AA00600","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1418145600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>That is Sinn F&eacute;in populist politics.<\/p><p>If Sinn F&eacute;in members believe in justice, they should talk to the family of Robert McCartney and the family of Paul Quinn.

The left-wing credentials of my party is that we teach children to read.  We put literacy at the heart of everything we do.  What Sinn F&eacute;in does in the Republic and in Northern Ireland is teach children to be angry and to hate.  As soon as anyone suggests that the influence of the Catholic Church in education should be reduced in Northern Ireland, Sinn F&eacute;in goes right back to its sectarian mindset and ensures it will never stand over integrated education there.<\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in is not a left-wing party.  It is an extremist Nationalist party.  It has no interest in jobs, growth or the real interests of people in this country and it cannot abide the fact that the Labour Party in government with Fine Gael led by the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, is recovering people&rsquo;s pay and self-worth and is putting them back into employment in a country of which people can be proud compared with the country we inherited four years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900027#AA00700","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418146200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Call an election.

I accept that people got hurt but we are ensuring we can create the necessary jobs in order that people in this country can get back to work and to give them an opportunity.  One could ask whether Sinn F&eacute;in and the Independents want that.  No, they want to see poverty and protest, protest, protest.<\/p><p>  I heard Deputy Mary Lou McDonald talking about catchphrases.  The Sinn F&eacute;in catchphrase is protest, protest, protest and to have protest meetings.  Protest meetings do not resolve anything.  A strong Government resolves issues.  When we came into Government in 2011, the people of this country were frightened for their families, jobs and future.  They wondered what would happen in the country.  I compliment the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton, and the Labour Party on the part they played in the revival of this country, not for the first time and not for the second time.  This is about the fourth time Fine Gael and Labour had to save the country because of Fianna F&aacute;il.  If Sinn F&eacute;in gets into Government, I do not think I want to live in this country.  I love this country and I love the people in it.  I do not think the people of this country will make the mistake of putting Sinn F&eacute;in in government.<\/p><p>  Let us speak about tourism.  In 2011 when the Government came to power, tourism was in disarray.  More than 220,000 are employed in tourism in every corner of this country.  The Gathering was a success.  The Wild Atlantic Way was a success.  The greenways were a success.  As Minister of State with responsibility for sport I have rolled out two rounds of the sports capital programme and we will have another round.  Those in opposition do not want to see anything happen.  The media has a job and a role to play.  Many positive things are happening.  I cover every corner of this country and I see Irish men and women with hope, confidence and an investment in this country.  Many good things are happening in tourism, sport and volunteering.  People are prepared to put their shoulder to the wheel to help young people in this country.<\/p><p>  I say well done to the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton.

They are in a cocoon in this House.  I am not in favour of protest, protest, protest but one sees the reality when one meets people.  The Taoiseach cannot go to a constituency or turn a sod when there is good news &ndash; I welcome good news &ndash; because people are protesting.<\/p><p>  People gave the Taoiseach the finest mandate anyone ever got.  I voted for him as Taoiseach but I am bitterly disappointed.  One could ask how the people feel.  The Taoiseach has completely turned his back on them all.  I accept there was austerity but the Taoiseach looked after the fat cats.  He promised reform, openness and transparency but he has been an abysmal failure in all of those areas.  The Taoiseach packed boards with people and packed the courts with his cronies.  He tried to get rid of the Seanad.  When people rejected that, the Taoiseach said he got a wallop.  It is nothing to the wallop he is going to get.  The Taoiseach will get many wallops.  I could use stronger words but I will not do so.<\/p><p>  It is an awful pity that he did not live up to any part of his mandate.  Promises were made to the families affected by the Omagh bomb, and justice was promised to the family of the priest murdered in Offaly.  Promises were also made to many other groups.  The Taoiseach met Ms Cahill, whom I salute for her bravery, but he could not meet the families who wanted justice for their loved ones who were killed.  The Taoiseach has been an abject failure to those people.  All the Taoiseach had to do was to meet them.  He was able to meet homeless people last week.  Did he have to wait until the unfortunate individual died last week on the street 50 yards from Leinster House to know there was a homeless problem?<\/p><p>  Will the Taoiseach call in the banks?  Will he rein in NAMA, which is making people homeless?  It is terrorising a widow in my county whose late husband ended his own life.  Will the Taoiseach call off the hound dogs of NAMA and the officials and ask them to stop terrorising that decent family in County Tipperary, of whom he should be aware and should know?  The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, and others know the family.  It is a shame and disgrace.<\/p><p>  People have made sacrifices.  We all bailed out the banks.  I was one who voted for that.  It was one of the biggest mistakes I ever made in my life.  Now the banks are piddling down on top of us and walking on us, with sanction from the Taoiseach and the Minister.  The banks are being let off with aplomb and the Government is patting them on the back.  Up to 100,000 people are awaiting eviction.  The Government talks about solving the problem of homelessness.  The Government should try to sort out the problem by calling off the hound dogs of the banks, Revenue and NAMA &ndash; the biggest and most dangerous entity.  I could use a word beginning with C to refer to NAMA but I will not use it in the House.  It is a merry-go-round.  It identifies properties but will not sell them for the price offered by decent people as it is keeping them to sell them at a knock-down price to friends and contacts.  NAMA stinks and is rotten to the core.  What it is doing to ordinary families is disgusting.  I am very disappointed about that.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar spoke in the debate.  It goes to show how confused the Government is.  He said the Taoiseach is the captain that could steady the ship on the ocean.  Does he not know a captain flies an airplane and that a ship is navigated by somebody other than that?  Neither we nor the people have any confidence in the Taoiseach to navigate the ship of state anywhere anymore because he has lost all credibility and respect.  I heard the former Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, talk about what he did when he was in the Department of Health.  He destroyed the health service.  People are now waiting three months to access the fair deal scheme, an initiative into which we all bought and persuaded others to do, yet poor people are waiting for such a length of time.  I heard a woman interviewed on radio today speak about her father who is 103 years of age who had been turfed out of a long-stay home and told to go someplace else because they cannot keep him.  The Taoiseach taxed the hearse in the last budget and I said he would tax the shroud.  I do not know why he did not do it in this budget, but he is doing it every day of the week because he took away the bereavement grant.  He is also taxing medical card holders who spend more than 30 consecutive days in hospital after which they are charged so much a day, regardless of their income.<\/p><p>  How low can the Taoiseach go?  His party does not have a good record of looking after the ordinary, working class people of Ireland.  He did look after them.  He brought in honesty and openness and promoted his Ministers.  He promoted the former Minister, Phil Hogan, to Europe after he wrecked democracy, banished town councils and forced Irish Water through the House and laughed about it.  It took three hours with no proper debate.  Look at the monster that has been created.  Those on the Fine Gael backbenches were boasting that he was a great man, that he did all the heavy lifting.  They said he forced Tipperary together despite my efforts.  They said he was some man.  He brought in property tax.  Now he has gone to Brussels and will benefit from his pension scheme.  He brought the gravy train with him.  He did all the heavy lifting and now the sky is falling down around those in government and they do not know what is happening.  They are mesmerised.  As my good colleague, Deputy Healy-Rae would say - I sympathise with him on the death of his late father, Jackie - those in government have been in a coma for three and a half years.<\/p><p>They have woken up suddenly because the people are awake now.  They saw what was going on with EirGrid which was trying to destroy our country by putting up pylons for which there was no need, with no analysis or study, just to bail out the Government's friends by giving them the big business.<\/p><p> There is the case of Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  I said at the time that the only thing I liked about it was the name - I like the teanga and the c&uacute;pla focal Gaeilge but other than that it is a monstrosity that is hanging around the Government's neck and causing mess after mess.  The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, is a fellow Tipperary man.  He put out his chest and he hopes his legacy will be like John F. Kennedy.  I say that his legacy will be that he will be up to his oxter in water and something else before he knows it.<\/p><p> The former Minister, Phil Hogan, tried to say that the septic tanks were dirty and the cause of pollution.  Now the Government is admitting every day that it is Ringsend and the 42 towns and the municipal districts that are causing that pollution.  They try to blame the people when it suits.  Anyone who ever drew water from a well knows that it is hard got and those are the people who know the value of water.  I am not saying it should be free; I am saying that we do not need the fat cats of Irish Water nor do we need the people who sometimes failed in their senior positions in public service to be rewarded again by getting bigger jobs in Irish Water with no accountability whatsoever.  Accountable, my hat, along with transparency, openness and accountability.  <\/p><p> The Government reformed the courts and it gave us an extra layer of judges, a new layer, with no definition as to how many cases they would hear.  What about justice for the ordinary people?  The Government brought out the garda&iacute; in major numbers at Waterford court and other courts recently to stop advocates going in to help and to stand with families who could not afford barristers.  It is some fair justice.<\/p><p> I said the Minister for Social Protection was tinkering with the Social Welfare Bill to try to avoid the mess and the damage done by Irish Water.  Instead of dealing with people who are on the breadline and dealing with people who have been made homeless, she decided to pay people &euro;100 to register for water and &euro;100 if they have a septic tank and a well.  I heard on the news the following morning that the Department of Social Protection was planning to take on more officials to administer this scheme.  What, in God's name is going on?  The Ministers on the other side of the House would need to pinch themselves and wake up because the people are out there and the Government's epitaph has been written for some time.  The people will be ready.  They will go into the ballot box in ones, the first chance they get and the Taoiseach's epitaph will be written.  He will be banished to oblivion.  <\/p><p> I was there in the worst days of the previous Government.  We were not as headless and the people were not as frightened and as angry as they are now.  They voted for the Government in good faith with the stroke of the pen.  They were promised hospitals and they were promised there would not be abortion in this country.  They were promised dozens of things but these were all turned to rubbish and put down the drain.  I say shame on the Taoiseach and shame on the people who will vote confidence in him.  We should be debating many other aspects here this evening.<\/p><p> The Minister, Deputy Bruton, spoke about jobs and so did the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora.  The Government had to appoint a Minister of State for the diaspora because so many people have gone abroad there would need to be Ministers permanently overseas to try to look after them.  They are scrambling trying to come home to help their families for Christmas.  We should be dealing with joyous matters in the run-up to Christmas and not dealing with this Government motion which was tabled because they believe in their own rhetoric.  The Taoiseach got rid of Frank Flannery, the former Minister, Phil Hogan, went to Europe, his famous Minister for Justice and Equality - the great reforming Minister - refused to bring in the scrap and precious metal Bill and many others.  Since they have left him the Taoiseach is at sea and he cannot get his hand on the wheel to steady the ship.<\/p><p> Other Ministers and backbenchers might be talking confidence in the Taoiseach today but they are talking otherwise outside here and in the constituencies and they are saying they are voting against this and that.  I tell the Taoiseach that his days are numbered and he should stand up and smell the coffee and not be visiting homeless people but rather he should visit the people whom the banks are terrorising.  I asked him to visit a family in Tipperary who are being persecuted by NAMA, a State organisation paid for by the taxpayers and they are treating people like that - the Black and Tans did not do it as bad as what the Government is doing.  That is fact and the Taoiseach knows it.  He has closed down rural Ireland with diktats from Europe, added to the diktats from here and he has closed down rural towns.  I was in Castlebar recently, his own town.  We saw how his brother got into difficulties in the local elections.  Rural Ireland, rural towns, are stifled with bureaucracy and they are stifled with the banks who will not lend a shilling to anyone and are only concerned with getting their bank levels right.<\/p><p> I say to the Taoiseach that he has some neck to table a motion of confidence in himself because he cannot have confidence.  I ask him to look in the mirror to see the failure he has been, to see the Omagh bomb victims and see the other people to whom he promised justice and how he has failed them miserably and disgracefully. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900028#BB01100","speaker":"1090","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418146800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Deputy Noel Harrington is sharing time with Deputies Connaughton, O'Mahony, Mulherin and O'Donovan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900029#CC00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1418146800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I suppose it would be too much to have expected something positive in that ten minutes.

The economic fortunes of Ireland have been rescued and we are firmly on the right path.  Great credit must go to the fortitude, resourcefulness, pragmatism and wisdom of the Irish people.  However, in order to allow the people to face these challenges, leadership was and is still required to deal with the achievements made and the obstacles yet to come.

All Deputies will agree that his actions and plan have contributed to the positive news we see today.  Brian Lenihan showed great bravery and courage in his role and this should not be forgotten when discussing the level of economic resolution and correction that is taking place.<\/p><p>  We were all proud of the successful visit of Queen Elizabeth II, which changed forever the relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It showed Ireland in its best light and symbolised the significant improvement in relations between our country.  It also showed how the political leadership of Governments of all political hues had successfully led Ireland, North and South, to peace.  These were proud moments for the entire nation.<\/p><p>  The Government has also disappointed and sometimes even disgusted citizens, however, through the manner in which it has governed.  For a time, good will was shown towards the Government and all parties and citizens realised that the political system had to change.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party threw away this good will, however, by engaging in the same old tired politics that had been practised by all parties and none in the past.<\/p><p>  The first and most striking reason the Government lost the confidence of the people was the Taoiseach's action on Roscommon General Hospital.  On 8 February 2011, in front of hundreds of citizens gathered in Roscommon town, the then leader of the Fine Gael Party called on all voters in the constituency to vote for local Fine Gael candidates to secure and defend the accident and emergency unit in their town.  Speaking about the unit, the Taoiseach stated: &quot;We will protect and defend that...  We are committed to maintaining the services at Roscommon General Hospital.&quot;  This commitment could not have been clearer - it was to &quot;protect and defend&quot; the accident and emergency unit when in office.  The citizens of Roscommon had no reason to doubt such a simple promise and commitment, especially as it was so clear.  Despite this, in a betrayal that indicated the cynical approach to politics that was to become a characteristic of this Government, the then Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, closed the accident and emergency unit of Roscommon General Hospital in July 2011, less than five months after the Taoiseach's original pledge was made.  What made matters worse was the Taoiseach's initial denial that he made a commitment to keep the unit open during the election.  Only when a recording emerged did he finally accept that he had made such a promise. <\/p><p>The audacity of this approach of spinning until caught red-handed has continued through the life of the Government.<\/p><p> We saw a similar example of this approach during the medical card fiasco.  The Government began culling discretionary medical cards to reduce budget overruns in the Health Service Executive, HSE, but it was never announced as official policy.  When extreme cases of hardship were raised in the House by Deputy Martin and others outlining the outrageous swiping of medical cards from people most in need, the official Government line was to deny, deny and deny, day in and day out on Leaders&rsquo; Question.  We were told by the Taoiseach there was no problem and no change in policy.  He stated the number of medical cards was not being reduced.  Only when public anger grew at this increasingly perverse policy in the run-up to the local and European elections, and particularly after the drubbing it got in the results, did the Government finally acknowledge its inhumane policy and sought to address it.  Notwithstanding these changes, medical cards are still not being returned.  When my office contacted the HSE about this, it was informed the policies have not yet been implemented even though they were announced more than ten days ago.<\/p><p> We saw the same approach in justice where honourable members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na sought to highlight serious malpractice in the force, only for them to be told by the responsible Fine Gael Minister that they would be got if they raised concerns about accountability or malpractice.  The Government had no place for whistleblowers to go, until eventually an independent report sided with those whistleblowers and commended their bravery in speaking out when political pressure was pushing them to stay quiet and disappear.  Yet we are still in the dark as to why the former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, resigned and as to the Taoiseach's role in that event.  We are still waiting on the commission of investigation to be established to investigate the issues of serious concern arising from the Guerin report.<\/p><p> Even the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has not escaped the Government&rsquo;s cynical political approach.  Fine Gael and Labour showed their utter contempt for the arts and cultural sector by seeking to undermine the arm's length principle with regard to government interference in the arts.  It has reduced the arts budget year on year while our national cultural institutions are struggling to function on their ever decreasing budgets.  The boards of our national cultural institutions have been used by the Government for purely cynical and political ends.  The recent controversy surrounding the appointment of John McNulty to the board of the IMMA, Irish Museum of Modern Art, showed the promised democratic revolution was nothing more than an election gimmick.<\/p><p> Other commitments have led to further disappointment among our people.  Our health service waiting lists are soaring while there appears to be no clear policy on how best to reform our health service.  The Government sought to abolish the HSE but did not outline with what it would replace it.  It has watched over the past four years as a housing crisis on an unprecedented scale developed, leaving hundreds homeless, thousands in fear of being evicted and families giving up on their dream of owning a home of their own.  We have seen no action to address the drug problem witnessed across the country, the increasing waiting lists for nursing homes and the appalling abuse of so many families in their inability to get access to the fair deal scheme.  There is now a waiting list of up to 15 weeks for the scheme which is putting enormous hardship on families.  The scheme is worse than it ever was but the Government claims it is a backlog.  It is not.  It is about saving money.  There are times, if the Government confessed to the people that it finds itself in difficult circumstances, that the people would understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900030#DD02900","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418148000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Of course, the IMF was not here, was it Deputy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900031#EE00200","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1418148000,"counter":315,"content":"<p>The people have taken and given a lot and would work with the Government.

That work is now well under way.<\/p><p>  As a Government, we have not gotten everything right.  Mistakes have been made.  Our successes, however, have far outweighed our mistakes.  The country is in a better place than it was just three years ago.  The achievements of the Government under the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, include rebuilding our economy and exiting the bailout.  The number of people in employment is growing monthly and the impact of the Action Plan for Jobs under the leadership of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has started to take hold.  The minimum wage has been restored with the low-paid taken out of the universal social charge.  A process of tax reform for middle-income earners has been started.  The Government has allowed the tourism sector to be reborn through initiatives such as The Gathering and the reduction in the VAT rate to 9%.  The Government has carried out more reforms of the Oireachtas than any other Government in the past.  Steps have been taken to reform our political system at local and national level.  The Government has faced up to some of the most tragic episodes of our past, such as abuse in institutions and the Magdalen laundries, in an open and honest way.  These are just a few of the achievements under the leadership of our Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and this Government.<\/p><p>  The Opposition wants to vote no confidence in the Government and bring about a general election.

The collection of Independents offer only criticism and are unable to provide any policies that would offer the people of this country any hope for the future.

I recall being on a health board many years ago and the clapped-out ambulance vehicles in many cases were a source of constant engagement at the meetings.<\/p><p>  Since 2011, there has been a major programme of change to reconfigure how pre-hospital emergency care services are managed and delivered.  Last year, there were 280,776 calls, 14,000 more than in 2012, which is a significant number.  In 2011, there were no targets set for ambulance response times.  When the Minister, Deputy Reilly, was in charge he raised the bar for response times.  For 2014, a new target has been set for 80% of life-threatening calls to be responded to in under 19 minutes.  The 2013 target was for between 68% and 70%.  For the first time now hospital turnaround data are being collated on a national basis, which is important.  That will allow an assessment of performance in the handover of critically ill patients in the system as a whole, in the response times and in the collection times.  That will obviously allow for determination as to how the system can be improved.  I accept it is not perfect by any means.<\/p><p>  The HSE has acknowledged that at times of high demand with the emergency care system there is clearly a potential for delays in the transfer of patients from ambulance to emergency department and this results in delays in the release of ambulances from emergency departments and reduces the availability of ambulances elsewhere.  That is why a national collation system has now been put in place.<\/p><p>  There has also been a whole new further set of details on the ambulance emergency department framework.  That clarifies the process of clinical handover, establishing where are the lines of responsibility .  There is a &euro;5.4 million increase in the ambulance budget for next year, which I think everyone will welcome.  There will be 50 replacement ambulances next year, which I think everyone will also welcome.  The DELTA and ECHO response times are improving, but the HIQA report recognises that patient outcome is actually more important than response times.  The clinical audit will begin next year for the first time.<\/p><p>  It is an evolution to a point where national data are now being collated.  We have increased investment in the provision of new ambulances and in the collation of the data.

A litany of 19 issues have been raised by the RTE investigations unit.<\/p><p>  That home is geographically close to the Taoiseach, but the issues being raised are always close to me and my family, and to all families of loved ones with intellectual challenges in such placements.  It is imperative that these matters are addressed.  Accordingly, what real steps are the Taoiseach, his Government colleagues and the HSE going to take to ensure that this particular problem that presents time after time, in one incident after another is substantively addressed once and for all?<\/p><p>  Let us ensure that we are not looking at people starting to believe that we have a culture of abuse of our most vulnerable in such care settings.  As a sibling of one who is so placed, I do not accept that there is such a culture.  We run the risk of people believing that, however, if we fail to take appropriate action.  What action do the Taoiseach and his Government intend taking?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900035#JJ01500","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1418149800,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for his question.  I know that from his personal family circumstances he can empathise in a situation like this so much more deeply than others who may not have those particular family circumstances.<\/p><p>  I was called about this last week by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and I took her call with a sense of dread and anger.  I have since been briefed on it by the Minister for Health.  I believe I speak for the whole country when I say that the idea that men and women with intellectual disabilities would be slapped or sat on - as I understand is shown in the footage of this programme - is utterly intolerable and unacceptable to us as a Government and as a people.  Every person who uses our disability services is entitled to receive supports of the highest standards and to live in an atmosphere and environment of safety and care.  There is no excuse - none whatever - for abuse or conduct in the circumstances that I understand have been outlined.  I have not seen footage of the programme but I intend to watch it later on this evening or tomorrow morning.<\/p><p>  The HSE alerted the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and HIQA immediately.  In the interests of protecting residents and staff themselves, it put a number of staff off duty while the allegations are being investigated.  I support the HSE's immediate initiation of an expert investigation into these serious allegations, which is chaired by Mr. Christy Lynch who is the CEO of KARE, whom the Deputy may know.  He independently chaired the review of services provided at this facility, led by Dr. Kevin McCoy who is a former chief inspector of the Northern Ireland Social Services Inspectorate.<\/p><p>  The director general of the HSE wrote to all the staff emphasising the serious responsibilities on them personally to ensure that individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with respect and dignity.  He also reminded them of their absolute duty to report incidents of maltreatment or poor practice concerning any person.  As the Minister has said, the HSE is also planning to initiate its own undercover investigations into operations in HSE facilities to supplement the programme of inspections already in place.  We had this before with Deputy O'Dowd a number of years ago in the Leas Cross situation.<\/p><p>  The Minister has been fully briefed and has assured me that instructions have been given to the HSE to keep both himself and the Minister of State fully informed.  I have also been assured that the HSE's priority is to protect the valued services that people residing in &Aacute;ras Attracta receive as a critical support for them and their families.<\/p><p> I recall when this place was opened.  As the Deputy rightly points out, there are many people who work in the health service who do an excellent job and provide a first-class service.  This kind of activity does them down, ruins the reputation of health care workers and is an insult to the wider family of the persons involved.  Let me assure the Deputy, the House and the families of those in &Aacute;ras Attracta and elsewhere that the law will follow its course.  HIQA, the HSE and the relevant Minister are fully involved in following through this, as are the Garda.  It may well be that criminal charges may arise from this.  That is a matter for the authorities involved.<\/p><p> There were 59 recommendations made in respect of the HIQA investigation into the facility and they have all been implemented.  Two practice co-ordinators have been assigned to &Aacute;ras Attracta, effective from 2 December 2014, reporting directly to the director of services and liaising with the national head of operations and service.  I have provided the names of the investigators there and the assurance review team.<\/p><p> I know the facility, which is close to me.  Unfortunately, this is another incident in a long line of incidents over the years.  As the Minister indicated, the HSE will have its own undercover investigation team.  RTE should be commended for the service it has carried out in this regard and I hope the investigations, when complete, will be followed through.  There is no place in our society for this kind of conduct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900035#JJ01600","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418150400,"counter":361,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has made the point about &Aacute;ras Attracta and other settings.  It is important as that is at the core of the issue and this is not only about &Aacute;ras Attracta.  This is not an isolated incident and there has been a range of other settings exposed for malpractice over these years.  The critical matter is not just the address of the individual care home setting, there is a need for a root-and-branch re-examination of the level of training, management and oversight right across the board.  That is what is required.  As I have stated, I do not accept that everything is being done and steps must be taken.<\/p><p>  I noted the commentary of Mr. Tony O'Brien, the director general of the HSE, with regard to wider use of undercover surveillance but that is such a reactive step under the assumption that things are wrong.  We must take the required steps to ensure the highest standards are understood in the first instance and implemented by those we trust to look after those defenceless loved ones in our respective families.  My brother is non-verbal and I can understand what was said by the sibling of one of those who will be most particularly focused upon in tonight's programme.  These people are incapable of voicing or giving expression to whatever treatment they are being subjected to, and it is a terrible position and great fear for families, parents and siblings.  They must know the truth of each day of their lives.<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Brien's point is well taken but that is not the full answer.  We must examine care settings right across the board and instill through retraining and uptraining the highest standards in the first instance of management and oversight in every care setting in the land.

The HIQA inspectorate and the HSE complaints are clearly inadequate in the case that has arisen in &Aacute;ras Attracta.  The first response was to the families directly affected by those persons with intellectual disability in the particular unit.  All of the others were written to on 1 December and meetings were initiated with 56 other family groupings.  They have all been offered meetings but some did not require a meeting, having been assured by telephone that the relevant family member was not in this specific unit.<\/p><p>  I take the Deputy's point that there is no argument against this.  It can be trying in many of these circumstances.  The Deputy speaks from a fraternal perspective but I cannot speak in the same depth of understanding of what it means 24 hours a day.  I assure the Deputy that having raised the matter, this is not acceptable under any circumstances.  The analysis being carried out by the HSE, HIQA, the Minister and the Minister of State will have the support of the Government.  The authorities are involved and the Garda are investigating the matter.  It is one of a number of investigations which I expect to be carried through by the authorities.<\/p><p>  The point made by the Deputy is a central issue, as this is probably not an individual or isolated case.  We have seen similar cases in the past, and it is now a case of attempting to deal with the entirety of the issue in a way that stands up to the utmost scrutiny and standards.  These particular and very special people and their families should be guaranteed to live in an environment of comfort, care and consideration, with those who serve them living up to the highest standards set by the principles of the HSE.

This refers to targeted surveillance, meaning the person or persons whose information is intercepted would be the subject of a particular criminal investigation, that the request shall be detailed and make a reasonable case for the necessity of the interception of information.  The reality is very different.  As was exposed by Mr. Edward Snowden recently, billions of Irish communications are being actively recorded and stored by the British GCHQ and shared with other intelligence agencies.  They have tapped into a cable under the Irish Sea and it appears that Vodafone has been paid tens of millions of euro for facilitating the activity.  This is nothing short of mass surveillance and the indiscriminate targeting of all citizens of this country, regardless of whether people are innocent or guilty.  It seems people are now guilty until proven innocent.<\/p><p>  It seems that in a world where everything is collected and monitored, anyone who challenges unjust laws will be silenced.  This undermines democracy.  There is no system of judicial oversight instituted by this legislation signed into law by the Minister.  The Minister has given extraordinary powers that are not subject to scrutiny and there is a proposal to set up secret courts to deal with third party companies that do not comply with the Minister's orders, which is completely at odds with any notion of transparency and judicial oversight practices that would be regarded as essential for any country adhering to the UN convention on human rights.<\/p><p>  Why does the Government feel it necessary to violate all notions of transparency with regard to this legislation?

The Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 implements the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between member states of the European Union of 2000.  Part 3 of the 2008 Act deals with mutual assistance regarding requests to or from EU member states for assistance in the interception of telecommunications.  The recent decision by the Minister to commence Part 3 of the 2008 Act arises from an obligation under the Treaty of Lisbon whereby the State would be in breach of its obligations to fully implement the provisions of the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in criminal matters by 1 December this year.  An EU convention is at issue, and this mirrors arrangements in other EU countries.  Accordingly, it is open to the Garda in Ireland to request similar assistance from other EU member states if it is deemed appropriate.<\/p><p>The convention applies only to criminal matters.  It does not apply to intelligence gathering.  Essentially, where a lawful interception order is in place in one EU in relation to the investigation of serious crime, it can be given effect in another country upon request in accordance with the domestic law implementing the convention.  In Ireland, the arrangements in place will reflect the provision of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993.  That includes oversight by a designated High Court judge.  The provision relating to <i>in camera<\/i>hearings arises because it would not be appropriate in open court to disclose who might be the subject of an interception order in the investigation of serious crime.  <br\/><br\/>I cannot comment on the allegation of wholesale interception of Irish telephone calls by Britain.

I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that in April of this year, the European Court of Justice ruled in favour of Digital Rights Ireland and declared the European directive on data retention invalid owing to its serious interference with private life and freedom of expression, thus violating the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.  The Taoiseach said we are signing up to a commitment made under the Lisbon treaty but Part 3 is part of an Act introduced in 2008 and things have moved on since then.  The fact that Digital Rights Ireland won that case this year changes the goalposts a good bit.  It is now possible that we may be breaking different rules in Europe by signing up to this.  What assessment of the 2008 law was done following the judgment in Digital Rights Ireland's European Court of Justice case to ensure that the law is in compliance with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights?<\/p><p>  We have a serious problem with mass surveillance.  Recently, the US was found guilty of spying on Petrobras, the Brazilian oil company, an economic summit, the IMF, the World Bank and the international credit card system, all to gain economic advantage in international competitiveness.  <\/p><p>  I refer to the type of industries around information which have set up in Ireland.

The media reports actually suggest that if such surveillance is being carried out, it is being carried out within the UK's own jurisdiction.  Each country makes its own arrangements to have a capacity to intercept communications but I would expect that any such surveillance by any country would have to have a proper legal basis and that the interference is proportionate to the aim for which it is intended.  As the Deputy pointed out, there would be understandable concern if the general principle of the privacy of communications was not being respected.<\/p><p>  The need for the protection of people from terrorists and other criminal threats is acknowledged but the point must be made that it is necessary to ensure that the information is properly obtained and subject to appropriate safeguards, in particular in those cases.  I would expect that the UK would follow these principles as well.<\/p><p>  This matter is being investigated by the European Commission.  As I said, these matters are governed by legislation in this jurisdiction and there is no question of any form of mass surveillance here.  Furthermore, the relevant legislation is overseen by a designated judge of the High Court and the reports are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Ireland will reiterate its belief at international fora and elsewhere that the principles I just mentioned are adhered to.  <\/p><p>  The story was based primarily on the grounds that if there had been any tapping or interception of these undersea cables, it occurred outside our jurisdiction.  While the article did not specifically address that issue, any tapping or interception of these communications would likely have occurred within the jurisdiction of the UK and would presumably be covered by EU law.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy knows, these communications cables are owed by commercial companies.  Irish companies, such as Eircom, have an interest in some of the cables.  The report goes on to say that the Irish owned cables in question, including those which link Ireland with the US and Canada, are routed through the UK.  The matter is being investigated by the Commission.  There is no question of mass surveillance here and the collection of any such data would have to be in accordance with the legislation laid down, which, in our case, is overseen by a High Court judge.

Prior to becoming T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton was very critical of the Economic Management Council and the degree to which it kept other Cabinet members offside and out of the loop in terms of decision-making and budgetary issues.<br\/><br\/>A number of articles have been written about the constitutionality of the Economic Management Council in that many key decisions are now taken by that council.  By the time they get to Cabinet, they are <i>faits accompli<\/i>s.  It is a very dangerous situation where the majority of the Cabinet is essentially excluded from the detailed decision-making required on a range of issues. <br\/><br\/>I would like to illustrate one example,  the Irish Water debacle - the establishment of Irish Water, the decision to spend &euro;500 million on water meters and close to &euro;200 million on the establishment of the utility itself.  The Economic Management Council signed off on that and the result has been one of the worst examples of a lack of fundamental accountability to the Cabinet, the Oireachtas and to the people of Ireland.  It was a scandalous waste of money.  We now have meters in the ground that will never be used.  They are pointless in so far as we will have a flat charge for a number of years, which will probably continue.<\/p><p>The danger and incompetence of the Economic Management Council, EMC, were demonstrated by its railroading through and rubberstamping of the expenditure on water meters and Irish Water, without proper consultation with its Cabinet colleagues or this House.  As we remember this time last year, or close to it, the Bill was railroaded through the House in two to three hours with no adequate debate.  It was guillotined.  Since then the Government has made 12 or 13 U-turns on the water charges regime.  If the Taoiseach wants an illustration of how the EMC is ineffective and, worse, results in an appalling lack of accountability, the water debacle is one.<\/p><p> There are many more.  The dishonest budget last year on health, for example, was the child of the EMC.  It did the work on the budget and presented it to Cabinet.  That was presented in the House and we now know those figures were dishonest and false because we see the largest health supplementary estimate ever asked for in this House.  The books were cooked.  The EMC and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform must have known this because as soon as the budget was published, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, said they were not his figures and they belonged to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, who is a key member of the EMC.  It is the first budget I have seen that took me two months to work out whether the figures were right or wrong.  The figures presented to the Oireachtas proved to be hopelessly erroneous.  Under the freedom of information legislation, we then learned that the Health Service Executive, HSE, had written extensively to the then Minister, pointing out that patient safety would be compromised if the estimate went through.  The discretionary medical card debacle arose from that.  The length of and waiting time on waiting lists have gone dramatically wrong, all because of the budgetary work of the EMC.<\/p><p> There is a fundamental lack of constitutionality that Ministers are excluded from its work and four people make key decisions with officials who are not elected.  A Cabinet is elected and appointed by this House for a specific purpose under the Constitution, and each Minister receives a seal of office on that basis.  The Government has formalised an entity that has no constitutional basis or status, which has resulted in a lack of accountability in our democratic and parliamentary framework.  I have instanced two cases to illustrate that.  There are many more.  Will the Taoiseach comment on that?  Does he accept that the EMC got it particularly wrong in respect of Irish Water?  Does he now accept that the &euro;500 million to be spent on water meters represents a scandalous waste of money because there is no use to be made of them?  Most of them are in the ground and will not be used.<\/p><p> I am amazed this has got so little attention.  No one knows anything about the signing off of that &euro;500 million which was allegedly off balance sheet because it came from the strategic investment fund.  It did not seem to matter that it should go before the Oireachtas or be scrutinised in advance, or that a cost-benefit analysis be undertaken and shared with Members of this House.  That is a lot of money spent on meters which because of the Government's latest U-turn will not be used.  At some stage we need accountability from the Government on that.<\/p><p> The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy White, said he was unhappy with the Economic Management Council, that he understood it would be subject to review and that there would be changes to its status before the lifetime of this Government ended.  Could the Taoiseach confirm if that is the case and does he have plans to change the status of the Economic Management Council?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900037#LL01500","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418151600,"counter":381,"content":"<p>The Deputy started by saying he had asked me two questions that I did not answer and he finished up on meters and water, and all of that, through the EMC.  Question No. 3 asks the position regarding the Economic Management Council and Question No. 6 asks the position regarding the status of the Economic Management Council and if I would make a statement on the matter.  I answered the two questions and I made a statement on the matter but I will make it again.  The Economic Management Council continues <i>in situ<\/i>and the status of the EMC is that of a Cabinet committee, which has only four members.  The Deputy questions its constitutionality.  It has been set up in accordance with Cabinet procedures and is a very important entity.<br\/><br\/>I made a point last week in this general discussion which Deputy Martin should bear in mind.  The last Government comprised his party and the Green Party with the support of Ms Harney.  The problem was that for 12 months before it actually happened this country was on a slide into an economic abyss and the Department of Finance was not talking to the Department of the Taoiseach or anybody else.  The Deputy was present at Cabinet meetings where I do not know whether this was discussed or not.  The value of having an Economic Management Council was that the information relevant to the country's economic status was made available to the leaders of the parties and also the Ministers involved in this case.  When this Government was appointed, we were able to share the information exactly as it was in its rawness and not have a situation where the Governor of the Central Bank was required to go into a telephone kiosk in Frankfurt and ring Ireland to say that the International Monetary Fund, IMF, was already in the country, while two of the Deputy's colleagues were on national television, saying they never heard anything about that, that they did not know it was in Ireland at all and saying, &quot;Did you hear that?&quot; and &quot;I did not hear that either&quot;.  The value of having it was to have an information flow between the senior members of Government, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and in this case, the Ministers for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform so that we know the financial position of the country at all times.  That is why, in part, by following a plan, and given the knowledge we had, we have been able to work with the people to bring the country to a point where we have now emerged from that and are deemed to be making a strong recovery.  The next challenge is to build on that.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy has made the point about the Economic Management Council but not everything is discussed there, as he is aware.  We had a Cabinet meeting this morning and there were 18 or 19 items on the agenda, none of which was discussed at the Economic Management Council because they were discussed, as everything else is, at a full Cabinet meeting.  At a meeting before that there were 23 items and, as far as I can make out, one or two were discussed at part of an EMC meeting.  Binding decisions are not made at the Economic Management Council; they are for that flow of information on the major economic issues.  The Cabinet collectively discusses and debates those, if necessary, and comes to a decision.  It is not a case of saying people must accept this but of having all the Ministers around the table for collective Cabinet responsibility and to make those decisions.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy also asked about water.  I heard the comment of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy White, that the Economic Management Council served a purpose for a while when we were in an economic war.

I imagine that is broadly how it works.

It is very relevant to ask how the Economic Management Council got it so wrong.  Does it not prove that it is a dysfunctional entity?  It is not the way to go about framing policy and making decisions on the key economic issues facing the people of this country.  That is the lesson.

That is what is being said.  It will be said again in the most unequivocal terms.  Is it not time for the Taoiseach to step back?  I absolutely guarantee him that this is what will happen tomorrow.  I wonder what his reaction will be.  Will he have the humility to say \"we got it wrong and we are going to listen\"?<\/p><p>  I have to make a further comment on the whole issue of value for money and metering, etc.  I do not know who is writing this spin for the Taoiseach.  If he wants to talk to a plumber about metering, conservation and value for money, he will be told that district meters are a much cheaper and more effective way of ascertaining whether there are major leaks out of pipes in any particular area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900039#NN06500","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1418152200,"counter":450,"content":"<p>That is not true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900039#NN06600","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1418152200,"counter":451,"content":"<p>It is true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900039#NN06700","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1418152200,"counter":452,"content":"<p>It is rubbish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900039#NN06800","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1418152200,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I did not ask Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900039#NN06900","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1418152200,"counter":454,"content":"<p>It is true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900039#NN07000","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1418152200,"counter":455,"content":"<p>It is not true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900039#NN07100","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1418152200,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Other technicalities are associated with domestic meters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900039#NN07200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1418152200,"counter":457,"content":"<p>Has the Taoiseach discussed district meters?

Is it to be by the ESB being able to form a company or a relationship with a supply company and bring it in on the wires?  What is the duty of the State in terms of providing its contribution to this where commercial companies might not go?  If we are serious about providing broadband throughout the country, how is that connectivity to be provided: PPP, direct build, commercial entities or the State?  Is that, for instance, to be considered for some of the funding that may come from the Juncker investment scheme?<\/p><p>  The same applies in the case of social housing.  The Government has put up &euro;2.2 billion in this respect.  Is there an opportunity for further funding, for PPP investment, for social housing?

We put in &euro;4 billion; we have got back &euro;6 billion.  That is a profit for the taxpayer.  The Minister is very clear, in that he is not going to sell the shares in Bank of Ireland, yet we own the vast majority of AIB, as the Deputy is aware.  How does one value that?  What does one want to do with it?  Does one make a decision to test its value by putting up a portion of it for analysis and, if so, how?  These are the bigger matters that need to be considered in the interests of the country, and it is right and proper that things of that scale should be considered by the Economic Management Council.<\/p><p>  In regard to Irish Water, the Economic Management Council did not go through all of the details.

I do not know whether the Deputy was ever in a trench himself having to deal with one of those things but, believe me, it is an experience.<\/p><p>  For instance, we discussed the question of homelessness.  What does one do with an issue that has been around for a long time?  The point was that, in addition to the Cabinet sub-committees, which I chair myself, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey - this was reflected at some element of the EMC in the past - conducted the meetings with the NGOs on Thursday, the lord mayor on Friday, came to the Cabinet committee yesterday and brought their business before the Cabinet this morning, where it was endorsed and set out as a way of dealing with the principal priority of rough sleeping in Dublin and other cities - Cork, to a lesser extent Limerick, to a lesser extent Galway and so on - and then making arrangements as to how one is going to get the voided units renovated and fixed up so that they are suitable for individuals or for families, and the bigger build by providing proper housing through the expenditure of the &euro;2.2 billion.  That is what is involved there.<\/p><p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked me if I would be out listening.  There is a debate on homelessness in the Chamber tomorrow, obviously arising from the unfortunate tragedy across the road that needs to be dealt with.  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, are leading that.  I hope to contribute to that debate at some stage, but I have listened to the people who came to my office.  I have listened to the many people who protested and who rang up, some in not very polite language, I might say, or some who sent messages of a particular kind.  In any event, what they did say was that they wanted clarity, they wanted certainty, they wanted to know about affordability, they wanted to know about the entity of Irish Water and it being retained in public ownership, and they wanted to know what was going to happen after 2019.  All of those issues have been dealt with as fairly and as clearly and as definitively as can be by the Government.  The cost, as the Deputy knows, for somebody who registers and gets &euro;100 back is &euro;1.15 per week for a single person or for a single person with children under 18 and &euro;3 where it is two or more adults in the house, with children being free.  There is no cut-off.  There is no reduced pressure.  The first leak is fixed.  It is possible to beat the meter, unlike what Deputy Martin says, by being able to conserve water and understand it.  Obviously, Irish Water will be retained in public ownership.  Legislation will be drafted so that if some future Government were to say &quot;We want to privatise it&quot;, it would have to go and have a referendum.  Nobody is going to do that anyway.  The last public entity that was sold was Eircom, and we saw what happened there with asset stripping over a period, which turned out to be a complete disaster.  The Deputy knows who did that.<\/p><p>  There is a situation that Deputy Boyd Barrett will understand.  Across rural Ireland, water has been paid for for very many years.  Some people have had to put in private wells.  It might be &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 to bore a well - the pipes, the pumps, the chemicals, the salt and all of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900040#OO00800","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1418152800,"counter":481,"content":"<p>The State should have paid for that, too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900040#OO00900","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1418152800,"counter":482,"content":"<p>It is a contribution every year of a pretty significant amount.

In the first year, those 1,200 houses saved 500 million litres of water.  Those people are very happy in the knowledge that they know exactly what they are using and they are paying a hell of a lot less than they used to before.  It is about the conservation of water.  The more leaks that are fixed, the less treated water is lost and, therefore, the less the cost of producing water.  Therefore, one is going to have a much more efficient system.<\/p><p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett is a vociferous Deputy who lives in the greater Dublin area.  This is a conurbation that needs attention in terms of water.  All of these kilometres of pipes that are ruptured and are leaking 40% of the water in them at the moment need to be fixed.  In the next 20 years, long after I am gone out of this House, the situation in so far as this, an expanding city, is concerned is that it will need a new major supply of water.  It is not going to get it just coming out of the heavens.  One has to be able to invest for the future.<\/p><p>  I made the point - I think to Deputy Martin - the other day that 1,000 boil water notices went out to Williamstown in east Galway, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will know, and right over into west Roscommon.  There are small schemes with turloughs and poor surface supplies.  That needs to be dealt with properly and in a coherent fashion.  The solution identified in the longer term is to supply that from Lough Mask, which currently supplies most of south Mayo and off into that region.<\/p><p>  That is where we need to be.  That is the story that Irish Water will be for the next 50 years - to invest and supply and provide a proper scale of clean water.  When major pharma companies decide to site in Ireland, they require huge volumes of water, as do software companies.  It is very important for consumers, for business and for industry alike that we have this.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked me about humility and getting it wrong.  I would say that we certainly did not get it right, but we did listen to the concerns of the people.  In respect of clarity, definition, affordability, fairness, the future, public ownership, first leak, no cut-off and no reduced pressure, all of these things have been answered and dealt with.  They are now clarified.  The Bill is going through the House.  I might add that there has been no guillotine this year, and there will not be any guillotine this year.

Are there any written formulations in regard to what powers the Cabinet has given the council and whether the latter can work independently of the Cabinet in some circumstances?  For example, if there is no Cabinet meeting after a serious decision is taken at the council, is that decision deemed to be Government policy and does it go ahead?<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach referred to the two hapless Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers who apparently did not know that secret discussions were going on behind the scenes in 2010 to bring the troika - the representatives of European and world capitalism - to this country to ensure the financial system it represented was not in any way threatened by the Irish people refusing to pay off debts that were not theirs to bankers and bondholders.  I remember all of that well.  However, did the Taoiseach not leave his Cabinet colleagues in the dark on a related issue not too long after he came into Government?  Will he tell us about the infamous day that Monsieur Trichet, the then President of the European Central Bank, telephoned him and the Minister for Finance when he got wind that they were talking about burning some bondholders and that the Minister for Finance was going to come into the D&aacute;il - as I recall, it was to be at 4.30 in the afternoon - to make an announcement along those lines?  The Taoiseach and Minister were threatened by the President of the European Central Bank that a financial bomb would go off, not in Frankfurt but in Dublin, if that was done.  They ran into this Chamber like scalded cats, having crossed out the part of the Minister's speech that would have relayed the burning of bondholders, with that action dropped completely.  Will the Taoiseach confirm this happened with no consultation with the full Cabinet and, in fact, that a previous decision of Cabinet was overturned by the Economic Management Council?<\/p><p>  Since she was appointed to that role, has the T&aacute;naiste confided in the Taoiseach whether she is still experiencing the angst she previously referred to with regard to the working of the Economic Management Council?  Her view before her elevation was that the council was too powerful and too centralised, did not fit with the idea of open government and excluded what she considered important members of the Cabinet like herself?  Does she still suffer these misgivings about the exclusion of her Cabinet colleagues now that she is inside the tent or has she accommodated herself happily to this power structure?<\/p><p>  I am a little reluctant to start talking about water charges, but I will say that the Taoiseach should have listened to the people on this issue.  He should have gone the whole hog, because his concessions will not be accepted.  People are not fools; they know that as soon as the pressure is off, the initial plan for massive charges and &euro;1 billion to &euro;1.3 billion being taken from the pockets of the people, moneys they have already paid through their general taxes, will proceed.  If the Taoiseach still does not listen, he will be faced with a huge boycott next April that will dog him right up to the general election and have a huge impact in that election.  I advise him, in the quietness of the Chamber, to cut his losses and abolish the water tax, full stop.  He should, for once, do what the people want.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach and his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues have a neck to portray themselves as water conservationists.  Since Fine Gael went into Government in 1994, some 500,000 new homes have been built.  In that period, neither Fine Gael in Government nor any of the Governments led by Fianna F&aacute;il made the changes we called for during our anti-water charges campaign in the 1990s.  We called at that time for conservation measures to be included in the building regulations and factored into the construction of homes by developers, and outlined how it should be done.  Nobody in Government lifted a figure over that period, with the result that billions of litres of pristine drinking water, purified at the expense of the people, are going into the sewers.  That would not be happening if people in government had listened and brought about the types of conservation measures that other countries - even capitalist countries, like Denmark - have implemented in order to reduce consumption.  This Government has no credentials when it comes to conservation.  As it happens, conservation has disappeared from the narrative in any case.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will tell us where it went.  It has been disappeared as effectively as any Stalinist politburo could disappear an issue when the line changes, with no discussion of why it changed or whether it was a mistake that it was initially put forward.<\/p><p>  I hope the Taoiseach has taken note of these points and will come back to me on them one by one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900041#PP00100","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1418153400,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I take the Deputy's point regarding conservation, and he is right about it.  This matter has been a source of discussion at local authority meetings and Department meetings over the years.  We have seen on the Continent, going back a number of years, a far sharper and more effective method of collecting rainwater for use in gardens, for car washing and all of that.  I see water conservation being part of the reconstruction and renovation of houses scheme in respect of which a &euro;200 million investment is being made.  Energy refits are part of all that.  I note that a number of firms are designing water collection tanks to suit the particular contours of houses and garages.  I have heard several people on different radio stations outlining various tips and methods householders can use to conserve water.  I am sure people will follow that advice because it is very informative.<\/p><p>  I always say to Deputy Higgins that he knows well, as a man from southern Ciarra&iacute;, that somebody must pay for the clean water that comes out when one turns the tap.  Perhaps it is when the Deputy crosses the border of the Pale and into Dublin that his attitude changes and he decides this resource should be free.  Yes, people pay their taxes generally, but when these taxes are all put on the table and divided up between hospitals, schools and other bits and pieces, there never has been enough for water or sewerage infrastructure.  That is why it is important to set up Uisce &Eacute;ireann and have it be able to invest independently of Government.  On the occasions when I am in that beloved part of our country that the Deputy calls home, I see that the people of Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is know very well that when one invests in taking water from a reservoir or wherever, somebody has to pay for it.  It is the same in this city and everywhere else.  The water that falls from the sky and the water in our lakes and rivers must be treated at a cost before being distributed through inferior mains in this city for the use of the people.  What we are doing is asking them for a contribution to that.<\/p><p>I am not going to inform the Deputy about the issues discussed at meetings of the EMC.  As the latter is a Cabinet committee, the matters its discusses and deals with are protected under the Constitution.  However, the EMC does not replace the Cabinet, to which collective responsibility applies, in the context of making decisions.  As I pointed out to Deputy Martin, what is involved is having an understanding of the scale of particular economic or budgetary issues and that this be reflected in the discussion between the Ministers and leaders involved with the EMC.  When the council refers a matter to Cabinet, it is not a case of it being a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.  Rather, the council's members will outline the situation and the options involved and then the Cabinet will make a decision.<br\/><br\/>The T&aacute;naiste is a very thorough and fulsome contributor to the EMC.

Personally, I do not believe it to be true.  When the Government first entered office, it was obliged to deal with the economic crisis and the troika and the Taoiseach obviously felt that the best, most cohesive and most coherent way to proceed was by establishing the EMC.  As the Taoiseach stated, this probably had much to do with ensuring the flow of information in order that everyone would be aware of the exact nature of the challenges involved and decide how best to try to deal with them.  If that was the case, that was the Taoiseach's prerogative.  However, accusations have been made with regard to the nature of the EMC and the role it plays.  Those accusations need to be answered.<br\/><br\/>If it is the case that the discussions which take place at Economic Management Council level involve putting a number of options on the table and then bringing them to Cabinet for decision, that is fine.  However, an accusation has been made to the effect that a number of key decisions have been made by the EMC and then brought to the Cabinet to be rubber-stamped.  As I am sure the Taoiseach is aware, I am one of the new cohort of Deputies and I have never been in government.  I am not familiar, therefore, with the complexities relating to how the Cabinet works.  I understand, however, that only two individuals who are not members of the Cabinet are permitted to attend its meetings, namely, the Attorney General and - I may be wrong in this regard - a secretary to the Taoiseach, whereas a number of senior civil servants and political advisers attend meetings of the EMC.  If that is the position, is there not a risk that such civil servants and advisers are having an influence on the matters which can be decided upon by the council and passed on to the Cabinet for final decision?<br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach indicated that the EMC does not replace the Cabinet in the context of its decision-making powers.  However, a former journalist who worked as a special adviser to Deputy Quinn when he served as Minister for Education and Skills recently authored a book, <i>An Education - How An Outsider Became an Insider and Learned What Really Goes on in Irish Government<\/i>, in which he stated that one of the decisions made at EMC level and brought to the Cabinet to be rubber-stamped was that relating to changes to the pupil-teacher ratio announced in budget 2012.  The individual in question stated that the matter was presented to Cabinet as a <i>fait accompli<\/i>and that the EMC had decided that to meet the particular challenges facing the Department of Education and Skills, changing the PTR was the way to proceed.  The Taoiseach may be able to confirm whether that was the case or whether the EMC gives individual Ministers a particular pot of money and grants them complete discretion regarding how it is spent.  Is it the case that decisions relating to changing the PTR are the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Skills or are these signed off at Economic Management Council level?  It is critical that an answer be provided in this regard because we need to know whether decisions are being made at EMC level or by the Cabinet.<br\/><br\/>I do not really want to go into great detail in respect of water services.  However, there is also an issue in this regard in the context of where the responsibility for making decisions lies.  Deputy Martin referred to an amount of &euro;500 million and other Deputies mentioned the water metering programme.  I am of the view that what is happening is a fiasco.  The Taoiseach states that water meters are required outside every individual home and that such meters serve a purpose in the context of conservation.  I represent the same constituency as the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, with whom the Taoiseach is having a conversation at present.  The Minister of State may be aware that water meters were recently installed in a particular estate in the constituency.  There are no footpaths in the estate - which encompasses Roches Buildings - and when people exit through their front doors, they come straight out onto the road.  The meters which were installed have been rendered useless because they were destroyed when bin trucks drove over them.  That is the type of planning which marks the process to install water meters.  There is an argument to be made regarding the value of this process.<br\/><br\/>Will the Taoiseach indicate whether it is the case that decisions on policies relating to Departments are made at EMC level or are a number of options presented to the various Ministers, who then have autonomy to make their own decisions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900042#QQ00500","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1418154000,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Will the Taoiseach also investigate the possibility of installing the district meters to which I refer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900042#QQ00600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1418154000,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I put three questions to the Taoiseach in respect of the Economic Management Council.  He dismissed any concerns relating to the EMC.  However, it was the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, who first articulated major concerns about the council.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy White, have done likewise.  As Deputy O'Brien indicated, a former special adviser to the previous Minister for Education and Skills has confirmed that the Cabinet simply rubber-stamps decisions such as that relating to the cut in the pupil-teacher ratio and that those decisions are actually taken by the EMC.  The bottom line is that there are some serious constitutional implications regarding the EMC as an entity.  The council makes the major decisions in respect of the budget.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach might say that there are 19 or 20 items on the agenda at any Cabinet meeting.  Many of these might relate to appointments to State boards or the adoption of the reports of semi-State bodies for publication.  However, there is no doubt that the core decisions relating to budgetary matters have been taken by the EMC.  The remaining members of the Cabinet have been made to look like puppets on a string.  For them, it is a case of &quot;do what you are told&quot;.  The Taoiseach stated that the reason for establishing the EMC was to facilitate the flow of information.  That is not the reason.  He also engaged in his usual cheap political commentary regarding the previous Government, etc.  Two thirds of decisions relating to the fiscal correction this country has endured were taken by the previous Cabinet in its entirety.  We did not need to establish an entity such as the Economic Management Council to do what was necessary or to identify where cuts should be made.  The cuts and decisions which, unfortunately, had to be made and were discussed by all Ministers collectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900042#QQ00700","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1418154000,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Did the members of that Cabinet discuss the fact that the economy was spiralling out of control and that jobs were being lost?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900042#QQ00800","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1418154000,"counter":495,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and many of the other Deputies opposite voted against the measures introduced by the previous Government but they are now claiming credit for them.  They are also claiming credit for the work the late Brian Lenihan did as Minister for Finance.  However, that is politics.<\/p><p>  The rationale put forward by the Taoiseach in respect of the establishment of the Economic Management Council does not hold water.  Deputy Higgins made an extremely important point to which the Taoiseach, quite deliberately, failed to respond.  Almost all of those in Cabinet were sitting over there on the fateful day to which the Deputy referred and we were all sitting here.  There was a delay of over half an hour because the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was not present.  Why was that?  It took a long time for us to learn - the Government was not forthcoming with the relevant information - that the Governor of the Central Bank had contacted the Minister for Finance by telephone.<\/p><p>I do not believe he rang from a telephone kiosk, but he rang and said a bomb would go off.  He said it would not go off in Frankfurt, but in Dublin, if any attempt was made to burn bondholders.  That was not shared with the Oireachtas that day when the Minister came in late.  The feedback to the journalists afterwards by the Cabinet Ministers was that they were taken aback and surprised.  They were led to believe at the Cabinet meeting that there would be burning of bondholders and that the Minister for Finance would announce that.  They were very shaken and surprised when he did not.  There was a complete lack of transparency in the Oireachtas.  This gives the lie to the rationale that the Taoiseach put forward for the establishment of the EMC, but it is Ministers themselves who have articulated that.<\/p><p> With regard to the bank guarantee, the Taoiseach keeps making charges.  He voted for the bank guarantee and told the then Minister for Finance to do whatever it takes.  He carries on as if he did not vote for it at all.<\/p><p>  My view is that a guarantee was required at the time in question.  It has been renewed by the present Government.  The Taoiseach is on public record as accepting the position on bondholders was imposed by the European Central Bank on the then Irish Government.  The Taoiseach said it publicly on the record, and repeated it in this House.  Despite this, he comes in here and says different things when it suits him for cheap political point-scoring.  He should be a little more honourable in regard to the bondholder question.  The edict Mr. Trichet gave to the Minister for Finance demonstrates a similar position, by the ECB, on the burning of the bondholders and the failing banks.  There was no bank resolution mechanism at the time in question and it did not want banks to collapse after the Lehman affair.  That is the bottom line.  In any event, those are the realities.<\/p><p> With regard to Irish Water, Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett is correct in so far as the Government now has to invent reasons to justify the expenditure of &euro;500 million on water meters.  The Taoiseach is now going around the place pretending the whole thing was about conservation in the first instance.  However, if one looks at the original proposals, one realises the whole point of water meters was to deal with the allowances, thresholds of use and so on.  The bottom line is now that the EMC agreed all this.  It agreed with the off-balance-sheet method of funding and with spending the &euro;500 million.  The other Cabinet members just nodded this through without scrutiny or accountability.  There was not even accountability in this House.  Does the Taoiseach accept that?  It was rammed through here in two hours.  There was a walkout by all the Opposition parties on the day in protest over the Government's dismissal of democracy and the House itself in regard to the water charges regime to be introduced and the establishment of Irish Water, in particular.  I do not believe there was any cost&ndash;benefit analysis undertaken by the EMC or the Government on water metering.  I have not seen it.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach mentioned plans.  There were lots of plans and more than &euro;500 million was spent on water infrastructure.  In my city, the main drainage project was built and this involved massive investment by the local authority.  It was overseen by the then Government.   There were similar infrastructural projects in other locations.  Of course, much more remains to be done but there has been no plan presented in this House of which I am aware yet.  There has been no plan regarding what is intended to happen and the priorities.  Deputy Barry Cowen has been asking about this for 12 to 15 months.<\/p><p> To suggest, as the Taoiseach has done in his reply, that the EMC is just a mere Cabinet committee is to give a dishonest portrayal of what the EMC really is.  The EMC calls the shots in this Government.  Essentially, it represents a tier of decision-making that was never envisaged by the Constitution.  I have one slight disagreement with Deputy O'Brien in that it is not the prerogative of the Taoiseach to do something like this.  The Constitution lays down the framework for how Cabinet decisions should be taken.  Essentially, a new tier has been established that is taking the real decisions, including fiscal and budgetary decisions, decisions on bodies such as Irish Water and decisions that affect every Department.  One is required to accept them irrespective of whether one likes them.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach did not respond to my point on the health service.  The former Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, was told to accept the medical card probity figure.  That is what caused the disaster of discretionary medical cards being taken from children with life-limiting conditions.  An arrogant edict from the EMC dictated the budget and that the Minister must stick with it.  That is what happened in this regard.<\/p><p> Unprecedentedly and incredibly, the former Minister for Health came into the House on budget day and announced the figure was not accurate or real and that he did not come up with it.  He said he was told to live with the figure.  That is how undemocratic circumstances became within the Cabinet.  The former Minister should have resigned on that day because he could not stand over his own Estimate.  If he was given an Estimate that was inaccurate, dishonest and untrue, he should have resigned there and then as Minister for Health.  We now know the figure was untrue, that the presentation by the Minister for Finance on the day was dishonest and that the Cabinet signed off like a puppet to edicts of the EMC on how individual departmental budgets were to be allocated.  Now the largest Supplementary Estimate on record is to be allocated in the area of health because of the dishonest Estimate in question.<\/p><p> I remind the Taoiseach that his Cabinet colleagues were the first to raise the undemocratic nature of the EMC, and they were protesting loudly behind his back to anybody who would listen over the regime that had been introduced.  Deputy Joan Burton, before she became T&aacute;naiste, was very negative about the EMC.  The Taoiseach now seems to have confirmed that such negativity is gone and that she is now a very positive contributor and has lost any reservations she might have had.  They seem to have been passed on seamlessly to her rival in the leadership battle, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, who will now drum them up, perhaps for the next leadership battle in the Labour Party; I do not know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900042#QQ00900","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1418154600,"counter":497,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900043#RR00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1418154600,"counter":498,"content":"<p>It is proposed to take No. 15, Supplementary Estimates for Public Services [Votes 35 and 36], back from committee; No. 16, motion re membership of committee; No. 31, Water Services Bill 2014 - Committee and Remaining Stages, to adjourn after one hour if not previously concluded.

I wish to invoke Standing Order 59.  In essence, as a House we need clarification on this because names were mentioned in the House and those who were mentioned have categorically denied any assertions or allegations that were contained in that material.  It was wrong and out of order for Deputy Mary Lou McDonald to name names in the context in which she did.  In particular, the individuals concerned need to know how they can get redress or, in essence, get their names cleared on the record and their reputations cleared as well.<\/p><p>  I ask the Taoiseach as well the status of the documentation and material that the authorised officer has disclosed to 13 members of the Committee of Public Accounts in terms of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  My understanding is that the parliamentary legal adviser to the Oireachtas is concerned that names could not be mentioned and that the Committee of Public Accounts did not have jurisdiction over the issue and could not inquire into it, and yet it seems that some sort of shadow inquiry is under way.  The Revenue Commissioners were before that committee last week and there may be more discussions around it.  We are either holding an inquiry or we are not.  There is an issue around the legal advice pertaining to the Protected Disclosures Act  2014.  These are important issues for all of us in the Oireachtas, but particularly for those who were named because they have had no chance to have their names cleared and no mechanism has been provided to them to enable them to have the allegations and assertions withdrawn.<\/p><p>  There is comprehensive and extensive documentation on this issue within the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p><p>Comprehensive material going back a number of years is available and the members of the Committee of Public Accounts have not had access to it.  All of the material was sent to the Garda fraud squad, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Revenue Commissioners, the Mahon tribunal and the Moriarty tribunal.  All of those had extensive powers to investigate the issues raised.  Their powers were even far more extensive than those of the authorised officer as section 19 investigations are by definition preliminary.  This is a legal matter.  It has been laid down in law, and in the courts, that due to the very preliminary nature of a section 19 investigation, the material must be sent on to prosecuting authorities and bodies that can investigate.  That has happened, but it seems to me that pending any deliberations by the committee or this House, it was wrong to name the names in that manner.  Under Standing Order 59, I ask that either you, a Cheann Comhairle, would make a decision on the matter or that it would be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, in terms of the decision by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald to put the names on the record of the House, notwithstanding the categoric denials by the people concerned that they never had such accounts or were never involved in any way.  They have said that publicly.  There is a need for what was said to be withdrawn from the public record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900044#SS10500","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418155800,"counter":597,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900045#TT00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1418155800,"counter":598,"content":"<p>An official written complaint has been made to me by a former Member, Mary Harney, and the matter has been referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.

It is considered that this arts strand will continue to provide opportunities for those interested in careers in the arts, allowing them to gain hands-on experience and enhance their skills.  The extension of the scheme will foster emerging talent in the arts and also support local arts groups in theatre, film, visual arts, dance, music, literature and more.  This as an important development because it will help people take the first step towards a career in the arts.  In this sector, there is a long tradition of new entrants working alongside established artists, performers, practitioners and arts administrators.<\/p><p>  On the wider issue, there is a long history of internships, formal and informal, paid and unpaid, in the arts, as well as a culture of volunteerism, especially for seasonal programmes.  For example, a local festival might use interns in its busiest period, typically in the run-up to and during the festival.  Done the right way, this can make the festival better, increase community support and give the intern valuable experience.

They are not licensed for use by the Irish Aviation Authority.  The landing of aircraft on the airstrips is prohibited.  The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht decided in 2013 to dispose of both airstrips.

The relevant officials are liaising with officials in the Department of Defence on matters regarding relatives, including the compilation of lists for events that will be organised to commemorate the centenary of 1916.The project office can be contacted at <i>2016projectoffice@ahg.gov.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>I look forward to working with the Oireachtas all-party consultation group on commemorations, the expert advisory group and a wide range of stakeholders over the coming 18 months to make the events of Easter 2016 a very special and poignant tribute to all those involved.

I express an interest at the outset by acknowledging that civil engineering is my profession.  In fact, I understand I am the only civil engineer in the House.  The contact I have had with Engineers Ireland regarding the idea of allowing civil engineers to sign section 7 of passport applications comes in the wake of that body's previous contacts with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Passport Office on this issue.  Having spoken to a number of chartered engineers, both in Ireland and the United Kingdom, I have noted the differences that exist between the two jurisdictions.  In the UK, engineers can sign passport applications on behalf of other citizens, a right that is shared with other professions such as Members of Parliament, dentists, fire service officers and even chiropodists.  In Ireland, on the other hand, only a garda can sign section 5 of a passport application.  Given that more than 600,000 people apply for a passport each year and it takes a garda, on average, five minutes to complete the relevant paperwork, that is the equivalent of approximately 30 garda&iacute; being tied up with this task.  Those 30 garda&iacute; might be better placed fighting crime in communities.  It is time to review our arrangements for approving passport applications.<\/p><p>  I will focus this evening on section 7 of the passport application form, which deals with minors.  Everybody under the age of 18 must have the consent of his or her parent or guardian to obtain a passport, and this consent must be witnessed.  Witnesses can come from a number of sectors of society, including members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, members of the clergy, medical doctors, lawyers, bank managers, elected public representatives, commissioners for oaths, peace commissioners, school principals and vice principals, and accountants.  Thus far, the Department has rejected repeated requests from Engineers Ireland for the inclusion of chartered engineers in this category of persons.  As Engineers Ireland has pointed out, engineers have an ethical and legal status that is well established in law.  It is entirely reasonable to suggest that a profession whose integrity is perhaps more intact in the public mind at this time than that of bank managers, lawyers or even some members of the clergy should be allowed to perform this particular function.  Their doing so would reduce the paperwork burden on other professions and, as such, I do not expect that members of those professions would object to chartered engineers being afforded the same status as them in this regard.<\/p><p>  I understand the Department keeps this matter under review.  Will the Minister of State give an update on the status of the most recent request by Engineers Ireland for the inclusion of chartered engineers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900055#DDD00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1418161500,"counter":751,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  The Passports Act 2008 requires that before issuing a passport to a child, the passport service should be satisfied that each person who is a guardian of the child consents to the issue of a passport to that child.  Section 7 of the passport application form addresses this issue by requiring all guardians to confirm their consent in writing in the presence of a witness.  The witness, who may not be a relative, must come from a wide range of accepted signatories, including elected public representatives, notaries public or commissioners for oaths, peace commissioners, lawyers, school principals, police officers, accountants, bank managers, medical doctors and members of the clergy.  Applicants are also advised that the passport service may undertake checks to validate the signatory for the purpose of ensuring that no attempts were made to apply falsely for a passport for a child.<\/p><p>  The list of approved witnesses was prepared to provide generic categories which could be found not only in this State but also in other countries around the world.  Whereas it might be possible within the State to identify those who are members of the profession of chartered engineers, as they are additionally members of Engineers Ireland, this would not be possible outside the State, where representative bodies vary from country to country.  The passport service is of the view that the categories of approved witnesses who may sign section 7 of the passport application form are sufficiently broad.  Accordingly, it is not intended to extend the list of witnesses further to include chartered engineers at this time.  However, as the categories are kept under regular review, the question of extending further is something that can be considered again at a future date.  For now, in the light of the sufficiently broad range of categories already covered, the Department is in agreement that there should not be an extension on this occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900055#DDD00300","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1418161500,"counter":752,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his clarification, which is something we did not receive in the past.<\/p><p>The reasoning as to why recognition is not being provided could be extended to other professions, which also have different representative bodies in various countries.

I also thank the Minister, Deputy Kelly, for coming to the House to take it.  I know he is aware of some of the issues which are affecting funding for the non-Gaeltacht islands.  There has been a differentiation with regard to the funding for Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht islands.  The former are primarily funded by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, while there is a patchwork of funding streams for the non-Gaeltacht islands which dates back to the time of the rainbow coalition which held power from 1994 to 1997.  The latter was the first Administration to commit to provide funding for non-Gaeltacht islands.  Funding was originally provided by the then Department of Social Welfare and was very modest in nature.  From 2001 to 2009, funding was provided by the then Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht affairs.  Since 2009, funding for non-Gaeltacht islands has been delivered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government via the local community development programme.  Each of the islands in question would have service level agreements with Comhar na nOile&aacute;n and Comhd&aacute;il Oile&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, the Irish Islands Federation.<\/p><p>  Much of the funding in question would have related to community development officers on a few of the islands.  Some of those officers would have overseen multiple islands in the context of the provision of after-school services, play groups, services for the elderly, youth services, employment support, advocacy services, rural social schemes, rural transport and tourism projects.  Such services are provided by a range of agencies on the mainland and tend to be taken for granted by citizens.  The community development officers to whom I refer built up quite a track record in the context of delivery.  In Civil Service speak, it might be stated that they had developed a competency or capacity in this regard.  Essentially, this means that they were trusted by the relevant agencies and Government Departments to provide a one-stop-shops facility in the context of the delivery of State services.  This has been the position on the non-Gaeltacht islands for some years.  I recall stories to the effect that decades ago, before the funding to which I refer was put in place, the local national school teacher or parish priest would have been the go-to person in terms of getting what was required for a particular island.  Those days are gone.  The challenge for the islands is to obtain funding through the community development officers, who have done a fantastic job.<\/p><p>  The Minister is aware of the difficulties being encountered by island residents, whether in terms of putting their children through national school, fighting for access to services and trying to obtain acknowledgement to the effect that life on offshore islands can be quite difficult and challenging.  The maintenance of development funding, to be disbursed by community development officers, is critical not only in terms of the day-to-day running of the islands but also in the context of maintaining population levels and fighting to obtain additional services.  Successive Governments have for too long seen the islands as being a burden on the State.  That is not the case; they are a resource which should be funded.<\/p><p>  I look forward to the Minister's reply.  I am aware he has done a great deal of work on this matter.  I thank him for facilitating dialogue in respect of it between his Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

Along with Deputy McCarthy and a number of others, he has raised this matter on previous occasions.<\/p><p>  My Department's local community development programme, LCDP, is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State.  The most recent programme officially ended at the end of 2013, having operated for four years and provided funding of &euro;281 million during that period.  It is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014, with a budget of &euro;47 million, pending the roll-out of the new social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, in April 2015.  I believe it was the appropriate and necessary decision to make that intervention.<\/p><p>  My Department currently provides LCDP funding to Comhar na nOile&aacute;n Teoranta, the company with responsibility for delivering the programme to the offshore islands.  In 2014 the Department allocated &euro;527,272 to the company for the delivery of the LCDP to the offshore islands of Bere, Sherkin, Inishturk, Inishbofin and Clare.  I am quite familiar with some of these islands and passed through the Deputy's constituency on my way to visit them.  In terms of the successor programme, SICAP, the intention is that island areas will be eligible for inclusion in the tendering process, which is currently underway and is due to be completed in February 2015.  The SICAP funding allocations are informed by a specific resource allocation model, RAM, which focuses on relative disadvantage of individual areas.  Using this model brings logic and consistency to funding allocations and means each funded group receives a fair share of resources.  The procurement process for SICAP was open to local development companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new programme.

I assure the Deputy that both Departments fully understand the importance of the community development infrastructure on these islands.  I and my colleagues, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, who has a particular responsibility in this area, will be ensuring that both our Departments continue to collaborate to agree a workable solution into the future.

The work the federation does is invaluable and it is under pressure.  The population on each of the islands, bar none, is under severe pressure.  Various censuses over the years show a very worrying trend.  The loss of services results in a vicious downward spiral.  Since this country is an island at the periphery of the European continent, we should look after our inhabited offshore islands and go a bit further to support them and recognise that they comprise a resource.  They have tremendous tourism appeal.  The Government has recognised the difficulties island farmers have in terms of access, and they are to get an extra payment owing to islands being areas of natural constraint.  The islanders get increases in capital funding, also for access.  The funding for the development offices and officers will provide continuing comfort for island inhabitants and ensure their health, welfare and education.  It will enhance tourism and employment prospects.<\/p><p> As I stated, the advocacy group is a one-stop shop for liaising with the State agencies and Departments and highlights the difficulties island people have.

This has made life harder for struggling people on low and middle incomes.  Some of the lowest paid and most vulnerable in society are tenants of local authorities.  This is because of the very narrow parameters one has to fit between in order to be able to apply for social housing and the even more narrow parameters required for a person to actually be housed.  People who fit into the first set of parameters almost always end up in private accommodation, receiving rent supplement that costs the State nearly &euro;350 million annually.  Recent rent increases in the private sector have pushed rent supplement to the limit and have done massive harm to many families.  Far too many people have been made homeless due to these rent increases, so much so that there are record numbers in need of emergency accommodation.  This kind of accommodation is bursting at the seams due to the failure of the Government to protect tenants from rent increases by implementing rent controls.<\/p><p>  In the case of local authority homes, rent is controlled and it is much less likely that a tenant will lose his home.  This is welcome, but the Government needs to strike a balance by having rent that is both fair and affordable.  This balance has been struck in many ways, but we are dealing with people who live on extremely tight budgets and who have been the victims of many cuts over the past three years.  The cut to the dole for young people was particularly hard.  Increases in utility costs and the cuts to the household benefit, in addition to all the supplementary payments that must be made, took their toll on people living in council housing.  The impending water charges loom large in the minds of these people.  They will not pay, simply because they cannot pay.<\/p><p>  Next summer a new rent scheme will come into place that will set base levels and thresholds for rent, in addition to bands.  These may not change much, but there are some projections indicating that rents could increase for some people who really cannot afford to pay anything more.  It may be an indictment of our economy and many other factors, but it is a reality that must be considered when setting the basic criteria for how local authority rent is charged.  <\/p><p>  I wish to ask the Minister about voluntary housing bodies and their rent levels.  We recently saw the obscene set of circumstances in which a property that the State helped to develop was left idle because a Catholic housing association in Dublin was refusing to accept rents in line with the reality of what people could pay.  Instead, it wanted market prices.  Of course, most approved housing bodies charge a fair level of rent, give good service and are always eager to have their homes occupied, but a lesson must be learned from that.  Common sense eventually did prevail.<\/p><p>  Councils and approved bodies must continue to allow people to rent at a fair and affordable price.  Will the Minister commit to not changing the rent scheme in any way that would result in higher rents?  Senior citizens and such people who pay a certain rent could be affected if the proposals are implemented.  I have examined some of the rent levels and am extremely worried that the new rent scheme will be much more disadvantageous.  I ask the Minister to consider it very carefully.  I realise we will be debating it thoroughly in 2015, but I just believe we need to examine it carefully now.  I am worried about the bands that are being proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900057#FFF00400","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1418162700,"counter":763,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  With regard to the issue he raised about the housing body, I know what he was referring to.  As he is aware, discussions took place last night in order to solve the problem.  I am happy that it is certainly moving in the right direction.  Having said that, I share some of the Deputy's concerns and attitudes in respect of ensuring common sense prevails.<\/p><p>  Consistency and fairness are at the heart of the new differential rent framework.  Responsibility for setting local authority rents has been devolved as an executive function to individual local authorities since 1986.  Under the new scheme, this will become a reserved function.  While all housing authorities charge rents known as differential rents, related to the income of tenant households, the amount of rent varies from local authority to local authority across the country.  This has led to a situation whereby similar households in comparable accommodation are charged varying amounts of differential rent depending on where they live and the local authority letting the accommodation.  The rent regimes in individual local authority areas also differ on issues such as the types and amounts of income that are reckonable for differential rent purposes.  There is no justification for this disparate and inconsistent approach to rent setting for accommodation that is funded wholly by the Exchequer.  There are many cases that cause great concern, so this needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>  Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 facilitates significant harmonisation of local authority rent levels while retaining the principle of having rents related to household income and leaving some discretion to individual authorities to determine rent policies in their areas.  The new system, however, will be more equitable, transparent and consistent, with regulations providing for a base charge for each household member, amounting to &euro;30 per week in the case of single-person households, which is identical to the rent contribution paid by single persons in receipt of rent supplement, and &euro;45 per week for couples.  Households with incomes in excess of thresholds to be set in regulation, which will be related to household composition, will also be required to pay a differential charge of a proportion of their income above the threshold.<\/p><p>Individual housing authorities are already empowered under the Housing Acts to include charges in the rent relating to the costs of works and services provided to dwellings.<\/p><p> The Government's Social Housing Strategy 2020, published a few weeks ago, indicated that the necessary statutory instruments will be made in the first quarter of next year to commence the process of introducing the new rents framework.  The elected members of each local authority will then have a number of months to make their first rent scheme under the 2009 Act within the parameters laid down in the regulations.<\/p><p> A further commencement order will be made later in 2015 introducing rent charging under section 31.  On the introduction of section 31 rents, housing authorities will have a two-year transitional period during which they will continue to set rents at their own discretion thus affording them the opportunity to move in incremental steps towards the rent levels that will apply on expiry of the transitional period.<\/p><p> Under an amendment of section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, the new rent framework will apply also to rent contributions payable by beneficiaries under the new scheme of housing assistance currently being piloted by seven housing authorities.  In the new year, I will prescribe the rent contributions payable in respect of housing assistance during the two-year transitional period for the introduction of the new rent framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900057#FFF00500","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418163300,"counter":765,"content":"<p>I agree that the practice in local authorities varies.  That needs to be sorted out because it has been a hindrance and certainly has not been fair.  I am totally in agreement with the Minister on that.<\/p><p>  I am worried that in some ways this may cost a bit more.  I mentioned the senior citizens and those who made financial contributions.  Many of them made considerable contributions and ended up paying rent on top of that.  In some cases in the past, I found tenants passed away within a short period and were still paying rent.  Often they also pay, on top of their rent, for a boiler service and other matters.<\/p><p>  There has also been a situation where differential rents, which has been used by Dublin City Council, have put the rents up so high.  If a tenant's income increases, his or her rent goes as high, in some cases, as &euro;200 or &euro;300 per week.  That does not make sense.  Some voluntary housing bodies place caps on the maximum rent payable.  We should be looking at providing for such a maximum and what that should be.  It is ridiculous.  I hold a local authority tenancy and I was paying &euro;80 per week.  Since I became a TD, I am paying nearly &euro;300 per week.  It is wrong.  We should be encouraging social housing, not discouraging it.<\/p><p>  I note the Minister plans to re-introduce the tenant-purchase scheme.  We should also include in it that the proceeds of the scheme should be ringfenced for social housing.  In the past, it ended up in a pile and did not go where it should have gone.<\/p><p>  I have reservations about this scheme.

In fairness, we are not a million miles apart on it.  We agree.  The two-year interim period is the period that we will use to sort out any issues that may arise.  That is why I wanted it to be a two-year period.  We need something consistent and fair and that shows tenants in the same bands are treated in the same way.  Over the local authorities, if one analyses some of the rents that are being paid in various different local authorities, they do not stack up side by side as regards being fair and equitable.<\/p><p>  We outlined the process by which we will do this.  The two-year interim period will iron out any issues.  I do not expect there to be many issues but that period can be used in that regard.  I also point out that this is something that local authorities and many local authority members have requested.  Of course, there will be a change in rents as a result of this.  These changes will not be significant.  I might also add that in some cases the rents will reduce.  There will be an equilibrium.<\/p><p>  In my time, which predates my time in this role, many local authority members across all political parties and none, and many local authority housing representatives, officials and CEOs, have requested that this be looked at.

The tenant-purchase scheme is something I am initiating as part of the social housing strategy.

That is why a lot of energy will go in to ensure that happens.  It is necessary because tenants should aspire to be able to purchase their own homes.  I hope the scheme will operate in various different ways in order to facilitate tenants of different circumstances to be able to purchase their own home which is something we all desire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900058#GGG00300","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Car Test","time":1418163300,"counter":767,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900058#GGG00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1418163300,"counter":768,"content":"<p>At the outset, I am disappointed by the way Topical Issues has been put to the end of the day's business.

Topical Issues was about identifying issues of real concern to people that would be tabled at a time of the day that would allow it fit in to the regular news cycle, and be used as a methodology of communicating with the people.  I am disappointed with the way the business has been ordered today, but that is as an aside.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, for being here.  I appreciate his presence for what I believe to be an important issue.<br\/><br\/>The Minister is correctly dealing with the issues around death and injury on the road.  He correctly decided, in conjunction with the Road Safety Authority, to introduce increased penalty points and the introduction of penalty points for the first time for a number of offences that heretofore were dealt with differently.  It is part of a progressive and multilayered approach in this House to dealing with death and injury on the road.<br\/><br\/>There is some difficulty with the choreography.  It is putting the cart before the horse.  In my experience, across quite a number of NCT test centres, a delay exists in scheduling such tests.  It can vary.  In some instances, the delay can be up to four months.  In others, it can be three months.  Of course, there are areas where it is not quite so difficult to schedule a test.<br\/><br\/>The fact is, though, that there are drivers today who find themselves not having an NCT.  They attempted to book a test a number of weeks ago and, because of the backlog of delays, now find themselves not only outside the law as they always would have been, but in a position where there is a potential to gain penalty points.  That is particularly worrying and disturbing.  I accept that discretion can be exercised by garda&iacute; but the introduction of these penalty points offences should not have taken place until such time as there was a relatively quick turnaround in providing citizens with access to an appropriate test.  That is the first point.<br\/><br\/>In addition, the Minister will be aware of an issue that has arisen in relation to penalty points.  We read with concern about it today on the front page of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, where the journalist, Mr. Niall O'Connor, has a story which seems to emanate from within the Department.  It is irrelevant where it emanated from.  It seems to be a serious issue.

How many drivers potentially have issues, either positive or negative from their perspective?<\/p><p>How many drivers are affected?  What is the Minister's perception of the impact of such a problem, if it exists?

He is correct that the entire objective of the session is to raise topical issues.  The original issue raised related to the national car test, NCT, but I will also respond to the questions he has asked regarding the events of today.<\/p><p>  First, I wish to refer to changes to the penalty points regime which came into effect yesterday, and the particular change to which Deputy Dooley referred with regard to the NCT system and the need for a certificate.  The Deputy referred accurately to the history of the matter, but I wish to highlight one point for the record.  Deputy Dooley correctly stated that it has for some years been an offence to use a vehicle on public roads without a valid NCT certificate.  The only point I would add is that in the past this offence always involved a direct summons to court and the assignment of five penalty points on conviction.  What has now changed is the introduction of a fixed charge notice system.  If someone is charged with an offence, he or she will now be issued with a fixed charge notice and, on payment of the &euro;60 charge, will have three penalty points assigned to his or her licence.  The driver will continue to have the option of going to court, where five points will still apply on conviction.  The key change is the option of compliance with a fixed charge notice and the assignment of three penalty points instead of going directly to court.<\/p><p>  In response to the Deputy's point about current waiting times for NCT tests, I have been in constant contact with the Road Safety Authority, RSA, on the matter, and it has informed me that the best way for people to get their appointment is to call the NCTS call centre directly on 01 4135992 rather than booking a test on the website.  I am currently examining regional waiting times.  I have been in contact with the RSA and it is already aware of the issue.  It has put extra staff in place for the period during which most of the tests are likely to be carried out.  An additional 50 staff will be in place across the centres.  I will continue to monitor the issue to ensure that as many people as possible get the NCT test as required.<\/p><p>  The most up-to-date statistics indicate that for the week commencing 24 November, a total of approximately 25,000 NCT tests were carried out.  Of those, 9,000 were late or very late - meaning their due test date was in the past; a further 1,450 related to tests that should have been carried out in 2013; and 13,200 were early compliant requests - that is, taking advantage of the facility that was instituted in September to avail of early tests up to 90 days prior to the test due date.  Additional staff are now in place.  It is my information that 200,000 cars in the State currently do not have a valid NCT certificate.  The change has been advertised since the start of September and additional staff are in place.  I will continue to closely examine regional waiting times.  I responded to the issue raised by the Deputy, but if he has further questions he wishes to raise with me on the other matter, I will respond to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900059#HHH00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1418163900,"counter":771,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's approach to dealing with the matter on a regional basis and I welcome his announcement of additional testing staff.

I hope common sense will prevail, particularly in cases in which a test has already been scheduled.  Perhaps some direction could be given to the Garda or a statutory instrument might be required to ensure that pending the alleviation of the backlog, having a test scheduled would ensure the certificate is valid until such time as a test has taken place and at such time the car would either pass or fail.

It was my fourth visit in eight years.  Five years ago I spent two days in Gaza, as well as visiting Ramallah and Jerusalem.  I saw for myself the devastating impact of the Israeli war of 2008 and 2009 on the people and infrastructure of Gaza.  This time the Israeli Government refused me leave to visit and gave no explanation.  The Israeli assault during the summer was even more shocking than that of five years ago.  Some 2,200 Palestinians were killed, including 500 children, while over 90 entire families were wiped out.  The physical damage to the infrastructure of Gaza was enormous.  Thousands of families whose homes were destroyed now face a cold winter.<br\/><br\/>In Ramallah and Jerusalem I met President Abbas and others in the Palestinian Authority, with NGOs and representatives of Palestinian organisations.  In Jerusalem I met Israeli activists and NGOs.  Many Israeli citizens understand the deeply corrosive effect of the occupation of Palestinian land, the apartheid system which Israel has created and the brutality and dehumanising impact of the actions of the Israeli Defence Forces, IDF.<br\/><br\/>Over 5 million Palestinian refugees are scattered in camps in the occupied West Bank, Lebanon, the Gaza Strip and Jordan.  Children, parents and grandparents have known nothing but refugee camps, some of which came into existence in 1948.  Last week I spoke to Yehuda Shaul, a former sergeant and commander in the Israeli army.  He is a co-director of Breaking the Silence, an organisation made up of former Israeli soldiers who speak out against the actions of the IDF.  Both he and his colleagues are deeply concerned about the moral price Israel and its citizens are paying to maintain the occupation, as well as the terrible impact on Palestinians.  These former soldiers are Israeli patriots who believe speaking out against injustice is necessary to defend Israel, as well as to advance the rights of Palestinians.  He dismisses Israeli Government claims that its military operations are defensive and to oppose terrorism.  He believes this is only a small part of the strategy.  The reality on the ground is that Israeli actions have led to the <i>de facto <\/i>annexation of large sections of the West Bank.  He also believes claims by successive Israeli Governments that the occupation is temporary and will end with a peace deal are not true.  He believes the current Israeli policy of occupation, separation and settlements is not designed as a temporary measure but is intended to be permanent.  In his view, &quot;It's all about maintaining Israeli military control over Palestinians.&quot;<br\/><br\/>During my visit last week the separation wall was a constant oppressive presence.  It is a scar on the land and the conscience of Israel and the international community.  It stretches for 700 km; it is multi-layered, often with a 60 m wide exclusion zone and a concrete wall 8 m high.  It snakes up and down hills, alongside motorways, down the middle of streets and through Palestinian communities.  It prevents Palestinian farmers from getting to their farmland and captures within its boundary Palestinian land that is then annexed by the Israeli Government.  It is all about control.  The wall and the hundreds of IDF military checkpoints and road blocks drive a wedge between Israelis and Palestinians but also between Palestinians.  For Palestinians to move around even within the West Bank, there is a monitoring system involving Israeli Government permits and permissions which significantly limit their freedom of movement and severely inhibit economic growth.  In addition, the Israeli settlements which are illegal under international law also act as barriers to movement.  Palestinians are forbidden to enter these territories.  On a daily basis the Israeli authorities decide what goods are transferred from city to city and village to village.  They decide what businesses can open, who can pass through the checkpoints and gets to school.  Houses, motor vehicles, electronic goods and farm animals can all be taken at the discretion of a soldier.  Sometimes they even confiscate people for use during training exercises to practise making arrests.<br\/><br\/>The fabric of life for Palestinians is rooted in fear; it is arbitrary and constantly changing at the whim of the Israeli authorities.  This is no way for families, children and millions of Palestinian citizens to live, nor is it acceptable that the Palestinian Authority has sole jurisdiction over only 17% of the West Bank.  That is the equivalent of the Irish Government being told by a foreign government that it has jurisdiction over just two thirds of Leinster.  Almost two thirds of the occupied West Bank - known as Area C - is under total Israeli control.  The separation wall and the sterile roads and streets - the term used by the Israeli authorities -  from which Palestinians are banned are symptomatic of an institutionalised structured system of economic, cultural and social apartheid that brings shame to Israel and the international community because of its failure to take a stand against it.<br\/><br\/>Yehuda Shaul said:<blockquote>Occupation takes place every day; it is an offensive act every day.  [It is] a national security concept dependent on absolute control - a <i>status quo<\/i>that is not a frozen reality and is being entrenched every day ... The International community is failing Israelis and Palestinians.  There is a lot of talk but no action.  Nowhere in history did people wake up one morning and give up their privileges ... the international community has to raise the price for Israel of the current <i>status quo<\/i>... No one will live in dignity or freedom here.  Neither the Palestinians nor Israelis until there is a sovereign Palestinian state.  This is the right patriotic position.<\/blockquote>As the Irish people suffered centuries of colonisation and occupation, we understand all of these matters.  We understand also the role of struggle in the achievement of freedom and independence.  Consequently, Irish people identify with the circumstances confronting the Palestinian people, but that does not mean that we are anti-Israel.  On the contrary, our desire is to see two sovereign states established.  The first step on this path must be a recognition that Palestine is a sovereign state.  There are many others, including Alon Liel and Nan Baruch, whom I met and who are former professional diplomats who have written to all Members.  They support the campaign to secure official government recognition by EU member states and others and have lobbied us to bring this about.  They ask why the right of the Palestinian people, their sovereignty and statehood, should be dependent on Israel which is a state with an embassy in Dublin and other cities throughout the world.  The Palestinians are represented here by a mission.  That is wrong and I have raised the matter regularly with the Taoiseach.<br\/><br\/>We must stand with the Palestinian and Israeli citizens who want peace and are taking risks for it.  The passing of the motion would be an important contribution.  On the back of it being accepted, the Government should take a leadership role in pushing for greater action by the international community.  It should also follow the logic of the motion and upgrade the Palestinian mission to a full embassy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900059#HHH00700","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418164500,"counter":777,"content":"<p>I was just beginning to feel good about the Government accepting the motion when I began to hear rumours that Ireland had been classified in a UN report as a country that facilitated torture by the CIA.  If these reports are confirmed, it will bring great shame on the people of this nation.<\/p><p>In particular, it will bring great shame on the Governments which permitted the facilitation of this torture.  I am not saying these reports are true, but if they are true we will have done so much damage to the credibility of this nation.  I would like the Minister of State to check into this as a matter of some urgency.<\/p><p> This nation has always prided itself on being a defender of human rights and anti-imperialism worldwide.  We have a proud history of sending peacekeeping troops into some very hostile territories and they have served with distinction.  The men and women of our Defence Forces have served in areas such as the Congo and Lebanon.  We have also played a role at the UN table throughout the history of the State.  Notable occasions when the State made its voice heard include during the Algerian war of independence, when Ireland rightly condemned French atrocities on the international stage.<\/p><p> Today we have been given and have taken the opportunity to make our stamp as legislators on the world stage.  We may come from towns and villages like Manorhamilton, Tralee and Youghal, but this moment allows us to send a message to the world that Ireland stands with the people of Palestine.  The oppression of the Palestinian people for decades has been a dark stain on world leaders, particularly the many Western countries that have allowed it to occur.  It is past time for the House to make this gesture and right this wrong.<\/p><p> When a vote was taken at the UN Human Rights Council on condemning war crimes committed during Israel's most recent onslaught on Gaza, the Irish Government abstained.  We had a long debate earlier on whether the Government was in touch with the Irish people.  The abstention on this vote was miles from where the vast majority of Irish people stand on this issue.  The Government was not feeling the pulse of the Irish nation when this abstention was agreed. It was a terrible blight on the good name and reputation Ireland has in the international community.  On 30 October Sweden voted to recognise the state of Palestine and became the 135th country to do so.  The UN has 193 member countries, so by not recognising Palestine Ireland is indeed in the minority.<\/p><p> We should not fool ourselves into believing a vote in the Chamber will be a solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.  It will not.  A serious peace process must be embarked upon to bring a true and lasting settlement to the region.  However, recognising the state of Palestine will aid in this process.  The Palestinians should be viewed as equal partners in negotiations.  It is also important to note that pre-1967 borders, which the PLO and the Palestinian national assembly recognise, are already mapped out.  Ireland has had its own history of occupation and suffering.  This institution was founded following a physical struggle for independence and self-determination from Britain.  The walls of this institution bear the portraits of those who fought for that independence.  If we have learned anything from our own history, it is that the oppressed need justice and liberation no matter where in the world they are.  By accepting this motion we will send a clear message to the world that Ireland and the Irish people stand on the side of the oppressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900060#JJJ00200","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418165100,"counter":779,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion.  I also welcome the signals from the Government that it will accept it.  It will be truly historic if the House unanimously passes this motion, not just to support the ideal of a Palestinian state but to recognise the existing state of Palestine.<\/p><p>  The people of Palestine have suffered many injustices, including war crimes by Israel and the denial of the most basic human rights of water, land and dignity.  We all stood by and watched in shock the recent bombardment of Gaza, the damage caused to its infrastructure and the killing of more than 2,000 innocent civilians.  The Palestinians have had obscenity heaped on top of obscenity over the years and a solution must be put in place.<\/p><p>  Since the 1948 UN resolution which denied the Palestinians their state and the right to exist as a people, they have suffered humiliation, poverty and terror the hands of Israel.  Much of the so-called civilised world has stood by while Israel did what it wished.  The construction and expansion of the illegal settlements on the West Bank and East Jerusalem is nothing less than a land grab.  The demolition of Palestinian property and the destruction of its infrastructure, which has driven Palestinians into poverty and fear, must end.  Ordinary citizens throughout the world, including here in Ireland, have been horrified by the actions of Israel and are angry about a lack of action or, it seems, concern by much of the international community and powerful nations.<\/p><p>  In 2012 the State upgraded the status of Palestine, and has given it some diplomatic status and a mission here.  On foot of tonight's motion, if passed, we urge that this be moved to full diplomatic status immediately.  In 2012 Ireland voted in favour of a UN motion to give Palestine non-member observer status, which can now change to full membership.<\/p><p>  Successive Irish Governments have long supported the concept of a sovereign Palestinian state, based on the two nations solution.  The next logical step is to give full recognition to the state of Palestine.  Eight EU member states recognise the state of Palestine, and Sweden is the latest to join them.  I hope we will do so tomorrow.  A total of 135 countries in the United Nations have already given full recognition to Palestine.  Israel, in its arrogance, buoyed up by the fact it has been allowed to act with impunity, has acted in such an outrageous manner that it has exposed itself before the world as a state guilty of nothing short of war crimes, bombing hospitals, schools and even UN centres.  In the face of public outcry throughout the world, it ploughed on during the recent conflict.  It continues to deny observer status to visiting parliamentarians and observers and those concerned about what has been happening.<\/p><p>  Recently, the Seanad passed a motion to recognise the state of Palestine, which was a very progressive move.  We can do the same.  At present we are clearly out of step by not giving full recognition to the state of Palestine.  The fact that 135 countries do so shows we are out of step with international opinion.  Unfortunately, earlier this year the Government abstained on a UN Human Rights Council decision condemning the war crimes committed by Israel during the recent bombardment of Gaza.  Supposedly, Ireland was waiting for EU consensus.  When my constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, was questioned about this, he stated that he wanted to try to obtain EU consensus.  We should not wait for EU consensus.  We should be able to stand on our own two feet as an independent State.  We have our own foreign policy; we should lead by example and stand shoulder to shoulder with countries such as Sweden.  We should not wait for the say-so or the nod from the EU or anybody else to do so.  We also failed to support a motion brought before a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency calling on Israel to sign up to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, despite the fact that we were its architects.<\/p><p>  I welcome the signals from the Government that it will support the motion.  It is historic.  We must move to the next step quickly, and actively lobby for a two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders.  We must do all we can to develop full self-determination for the Palestinian people, work with them in doing this internationally, and give them every aid we can at international level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900061#KKK00200","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1418165700,"counter":780,"content":"<p>It is a great honour to speak on this important motion.  As an Irish republican I am always mindful that we as a nation once stood before the world and demanded the recognition that had up until then been denied to us.  The 1916 Proclamation called for our exaltation among the nations.  In the Declaration of Independence we claimed for ourselves the recognition of the world that we were an independent and sovereign nation.  We sought and in more and more cases were granted the support and recognition of the world for our people, our place and our sovereignty.<\/p><p>  That is what the Palestinians want and is what the motion is about.  The news that the Government will not stand in its way is exciting.  We are returning the favour of that recognition granted by our earliest allies and supporting the right of a small nation to be free.<\/p><p>  Some would paint support for the cause of the Palestinian people to have a homeland as an attack on the people of Israel, but it is not black and white.  The absence of a Palestinian state is in reality only in the interest of warmongers and zealots.  The President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, once described the efforts of his people as not a campaign aimed at isolating Israel or delegitimising it, but one that sought simply to gain legitimacy for the cause of the people of Palestine.  We only aim to delegitimise the settlement activities and the occupation, the apartheid and the logic of ruthless force.  We believe that all the countries of the world stand with us in this regard.<\/p><p>  The state of Palestine is legitimate.  The cause of the Palestinian people and the Israeli people to live in their homeland as equals, free from violence and bigotry, is legitimate.  However, as President Abbas rightly states, the actions of the Israeli state in oppressing his people and state is not legitimate.  The settlements which are still being built illegally on Palestinian land while an apartheid wall carves up the West Bank are not legitimate.  Suggesting this is a conflict of equals is absurd and it is not legitimate to claim the shelling of children playing football on a beach is justified for defence.<\/p><p>  Supporting the motion will not change all these things, but it is an important sign to the people of the Middle East that there is hope that Palestine will one day soon be free and the conflict will end because the rest of the world might soon stop making excuses for slaughter and oppression.  Tomorrow by passing the motion, we will join the majority of UN members by supporting the state of Palestine and recognising its right as a nation.  It would be an almost imperceptible change for Ireland, but would mean a great deal for the Palestinian people and weaken further all those who wish to see the status quo continue and nothing to change in the Middle East.<\/p><p>  It is also a very important step in reclaiming our dignity on the issue.  Up to now the Government had seemed increasingly unwilling to be a voice for peace and justice in Palestine and Gaza in particular.  Ireland recently abstained from a UN vote to condemn the war crimes committed in the shelling of Gaza during the summer.  We shamed ourselves that day, refusing to stand on our feet and making excuses by referring the decision to the EU as a whole.<\/p><p>  We then failed to support the call for Israel to sign up to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty that Ireland had championed.  This was pure weakness.  We utterly failed to be the strong voice for justice.  We like to believe we are on the international stage.  This week we are turning the tide on that shameful episode.  We should see it as a new dawn for our State as an ally of all those who are oppressed and denied peace and freedom - otherwise we will have learned nothing from our own struggles and the generosity of those who stood with us.  We must take this step and must work to promote the state of Palestine across the world and especially in those countries that continue to fail to stand up to the injustices of Israel's brutal apartheid and demand a free and sovereign Palestinian state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900062#LLL00100","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1418165700,"counter":781,"content":"<p>Before I came to the Chamber I was watching CNN and other news stations.  Deputy Colreavy referred to the rendition flights through Shannon Airport.  It was heartening to see elected American representatives, including Senator John McCain, publicly confirming that torture took place and that people were taken away from various countries in the Middle East and elsewhere and obviously flown through Shannon Airport before some of them were taken to Guantanamo Bay.  Again nobody on the Government side spoke out here.  The usual people spoke out - the people who are concerned about the rights and entitlements of people, and about injustice and wrongs throughout the world.  The Government just sat on its arse and did nothing about it.<\/p><p>  Last year, Deputy Keating and I travelled to Jordan along with other European parliamentarians.  We had the occasion to visit a 1948 refugee camp, a 1967 refugee camp and a current refugee camp on the Syrian border.  We witnessed the plight of Palestinian refugees.  They have been abused by many states.  They cannot even avail of third level education because they are refugees in Jordan.  It was enlightening for me to see what some human beings do to other human beings.  There were tens of thousands of people living in the biggest concentration camps in the world.<\/p><p>  There are many things on which to fight the Government and yet the Irish people in the cause of international solidarity came out in their thousands over the summer, on the last occasion that the Israelis assaulted Gaza.  For the record, 2,200 Palestinian people were killed in Gaza and 64 Israeli soldiers were killed.  Those are the figures currently available.  The Irish people, who came out at that time, came out in solidarity with the Palestinian people over injustices perpetrated by big powers.  I was really struck by the decency of the Irish people.  They hate injustice and repression whether it is at home or abroad.  There were demonstrations in solidarity with Gaza all over the country and we know from Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s strong links with the Palestinian people how much they appreciate our solidarity and moral support.<\/p><p>  Moral support means supporting someone psychologically or with solidarity but the Irish people also stepped up when it came to material support to the people of Gaza to help relieve the immeasurable suffering of the people there and to help them rebuild after the devastation of Israeli bombardment and destruction by ground troops.<\/p><p>  Any government which would call itself progressive has a role in leading its people.  However, in solidarity with the people of Palestine as with all kinds of other issues, it was the Irish people who gave leadership, not the Government.  The Irish people were ahead of the Government in their solidarity with the Palestinian people and finally the Government is listening.  It is very encouraging that it is prepared to accept the motion before the House.<\/p><p>  Instead of standing up against Israeli violations of international law and human rights abuses during the Gaza invasion, the Government along with many other governments stood back.  Instead of taking an independent and morally correct position, the Government remained silent in the face of the suffering of the people of Gaza.  For too long the Government hid behind the EU pretence that Ireland is too small to have an impact as if it had no independent foreign policy.  The Irish people were embarrassed and ashamed, in the middle of the last onslaught on Gaza, when the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, on behalf of the State, abstained on the United Nations Human Rights Council vote to condemn Israeli war crimes against the Palestinians in Gaza.<\/p><p>  Yesterday's newspapers reported that 28 people in an extended family were killed in a bombing of a house.  Eighteen of them were children.  The Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, did not even have the decency to support that as a war crime.<\/p><p>  This State should have been leading the way within the EU.  Seven EU member states already recognise Palestine, although they did so before they ever joined the European Union.  Sweden became the first EU member state to recognise Palestine when it joined 134 other members of the United Nations to do so.<\/p><p>By the Government's words today, Ireland is now part of that majority of full members of the United Nations that recognises the Palestinian state.  The step to recognition is not a giant one and it is one the people support.\u00a0 As we have already upgraded the mission of Palestine, it is nearly\u00a0an embassy already.  In November 2012 Ireland supported the motion at the United Nations to upgrade Palestine&rsquo;s status as a non-member observer state.  It is welcome that the Government has taken the next step to reflect the views of the people and openly and proudly declared its support for the achievement of a sovereign state of Palestine.  This is our chance to do so and support the Palestinians' right to self-determination.  Israel has no right to be building illegal settlements on the West Bank and in east Jerusalem.  It has no right of veto over the Palestinian right to self-determination, yet Palestine has been blockaded and occupied.<\/p><p> I commend every Deputy who is supporting the motion and especially commend my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in Party for taking the initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900062#LLL00200","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418166300,"counter":783,"content":"<p>Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan, Thomas Pringle, Finian McGrath and Richard Boyd Barrett are sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900063#MMM00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1418166300,"counter":784,"content":"<p>First, I acknowledge Sinn F&eacute;in's role in having this issue debated tonight.  The motion is opportune because, as of now, we have 135 countries that have formally recognised the state of Palestine.  I accept the right of the people of Palestine to a state, as well as the right of the people of Israel to a state, but each of them has to recognise the other's rights.<\/p><p>  From my own visits to the area, I must ask whether this debate is taking place too late.  I say this because of the increasing encroachment of settlements in Jerusalem and on the West Bank especially.  Can there be a state of Palestine?  Will there be sufficient land left for the people of Palestine to have a viable state?  We can see this most graphically on maps of the area.  We can see the shrinkage of areas for the Palestinian people.  How can a state be created out of pieces of land here and there?  They are areas which, as the crow flies, would take five minutes to traverse, but between walls and settlements, it can take from an hour and a half to two hours to get from one place to another.  As for trying to navigate between the guidelines and rules for areas A, B and C, Palestinian people spend hours every day queuing.  I stood at these checkpoints in Bethlehem and Jerusalem and felt for the Palestinian people who were unable to move freely within their country.  That was an excessive burden of humiliation and indignity for them to carry.  I also felt for the young Israeli soldiers.  They were only teenagers in volatile circumstances, heavily armed and doing military service.  As we know, it is a recipe for disaster.<\/p><p>  The settlements are the biggest stumbling block to a just and lasting peace and they continue.  Settlement building continues.  We are in the throes of discussing homelessness in this country and right now Palestinian people are being forcibly evicted from their land.  The settlements are illegal under international humanitarian law.  There are massive environmental issues and no accountability for settler violence.  <\/p><p>  The Palestinian Authority has to step up to the mark for its people.  There is massive funding from the European Union and I would like to see some of it going to the wonderful Palestinian cultural, artistic, disability and youth groups I met that do fantastic work in the arts, music, theatre, dance and education.  These groups use drama and art to empower young people to promote non-violent resistance and peace.  <\/p><p>  I also acknowledge the Israeli groups, including Breaking the Silence, the Refuseniks, the Rabbis for Justice, and other Israelis who agree with what we are debating.  I have met Palestinians who are not sure a two-state solution is the practical answer or that it is not a one-state solution with power sharing.  It is important to support the motion which is an expression of support for the Palestinian people, especially in the hope it will bring an end to settlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900063#MMM00300","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1418166300,"counter":785,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for sharing some of its time with the Technical Group in debating this joint motion.  I recognise that the Government appears to be accepting it, which is important and progressive.<br\/><br\/>Over the summer I had the honour of hosting the Palestinian ambassador when he visited County Donegal.  I was joined by my colleagues, Miche&aacute;l Cholm Mac Giolla Easbuig and the cathaoirleach of Donegal County Council, Mr. John Campbell.  We participated in a public meeting and it was heartening to see the support from the ordinary people of County Donegal for the Palestinian cause at a difficult time for them when their people were being slaughtered by the Israelis in Gaza.  <br\/><br\/>The motion reflects the mood of all Irish people in seeking to recognise Palestine as a state.  It is an important step for us to take as a nation, particularly when we abstained in a vote at the United Nations during the crisis over the summer.  We stated it had something to do with the European Union, but that abstention did damage to us as a nation.  It undermined the independence of our foreign policy during the years and the progressive steps we had taken towards supporting the Palestinian people in their struggle. <br\/><br\/>Like other Deputies, I have received the email from a group of Israelis with a petition asking that we support the recognition of Palestine.  It may be useful to read it.  They state<blockquote>We the undersigned citizens of Israel who wish for it to be a safe and thriving country are worried by the continued political stalemate, the occupation and settlement activities that lead to further confrontations with Palestinians and quash any chance for compromise.  It is clear that the prospects for Israel's security and existence depend on the existence of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.  Israel should recognise a state of Palestine and Palestine should recognise a state of Israel, based on the 4 June 1967 borders.  Your initiative for recognition of the state of Palestine will advance the prospects for peace and will encourage Israelis and Palestinians alike to bring an end to their conflict.<\/blockquote>The petition is signed by 900 prominent Israelis, including former high ranking soldiers.  It is in stark contrast to the email received from the Israeli ambassador this evening to all Members wherein he states &quot;Pressure from outside, on one side or the other of the parties, will achieve nothing and can only further entrench hardened attitudes.&quot;  The only hardened attitudes that will be entrenched will be those of the Israelis.  When one considers that 900 Israeli citizens sent this petition to us, it is important to support them, as well as the Palestinian people.  We must try to bring some sense to the Israeli Government and have a real and lasting peace based on the 1967 borders.  While, ultimately, a single state solution is the best, perhaps by recognising each other's 1967 borders we might achieve a single state at some stage in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900063#MMM00400","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1418166300,"counter":786,"content":"<p>As Deputy Finian McGrath is not present, I call Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900063#MMM00500","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1418166300,"counter":787,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in Members for sharing their time with us and raising this issue.

It is a sign of the advancement of the Palestinian struggle that recognition is growing across the world.<\/p><p>  I would not have become involved in politics were it not for this very issue.  As an 18 year old, I travelled to Palestine and happened to walk into the middle of the first Palestinian intifada, although not deliberately - just as I arrived it was happening around me and I was shocked at what was happening.  There has since been an extraordinary advance in the awareness of the terrible crime committed against the Palestinians and the need for them to find justice, freedom and self-determination.<\/p><p>  One of the great ironies in this whole tragedy is that of the two greatest crimes committed against people in the past 100 years, one has been committed against the Palestinian people since 1948, while the other was committed against the Jewish people up to 1944 and 1945.  The great irony is that a people who suffered so horribly in the Holocaust and who claim to represent that tradition are now responsible for the terrible oppression of the Palestinian people.<\/p><p>  I would not vote against the motion, but it is always important to inject a critical note into any discussion such as this.  I do not believe a two-state solution can work because it is predicated on the divisions between Arabs and Jews.  It is predicated on the belief there could be something legitimate as a Jewish state, but I do not accept this.  I do not believe there should be racially or religiously pure states.  The partition of Palestine in 1948 was the source of the conflict.<\/p><p>The United Nations approved a partition and it legitimised the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians; it could not have happened without the partition of Palestine and as long as we fail to challenge the notion that there must be an ethnically or religiously pure state called \"Israel\" and something else which is an Arab state, there will never be peace in this region.  It will always be at the expense of one or the other.  The only concept we would accept anywhere else in the world is the idea that all human beings are equal under law, regardless of race, religion or creed.  Accepting in any way that there should be a state giving priority to one religious group over another is a recipe for the oppression of one group over another.  It will incite and encourage sectarianism, ethnic cleansing and violent conflict.  We should know that from our own history.<\/p><p> It is a difficult issue.  On the one hand, recognising the right of Palestine to statehood is vital in establishing the legitimacy of that people's struggle against the brutal oppression they face at the hands of Israel.  In truth, when we consider what is left of the Palestinian territories, there is no viability in a two-state solution and there is no moral legitimacy in accepting the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people.  All Palestinians dispossessed in 1948 deserve the right to return and to be equal citizens, whether they are Jew, Arab, Christian, secular or atheist.  That is regardless of whether that one state is called Israel or Palestine.  That is the only viable solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900063#MMM00600","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418166900,"counter":789,"content":"<p>The Ministers of State, Deputies Dara Murphy, Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Gerald Nash, will be sharing time.

The terms of the motion are carefully worded, and there is a great deal in it that reflects consistent Irish Government policies, under different parties, and that will command support across the House.  This is supported by the initial comments from the Opposition.  For that reason, and in that spirit, the Government has not sought to oppose or amend the motion before us.<\/p><p>  It has been the objective of this Government since it took office to work to bring about the achievement - in reality and not just in theory or in symbolism - of a fully sovereign state of Palestine.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and his predecessor, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, have consistently stated here and elsewhere that we looked forward to being able to recognise that state and to do so as early as possible.  We have stated very clearly that it is long overdue for the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory to end and for Palestinians to enjoy the same rights of freedom and self-determination as others, and as we enjoy ourselves.  All of the Government's actions and policies on the Middle East have been designed to achieve that end.  As the motion sets out, Ireland has already taken a number of deliberate steps to advance the Palestinian cause along the path towards statehood.  The previous Government in January 2011 upgraded the status and titles used by the Palestinian mission in Ireland to a point just short of the full diplomatic status of an embassy.  In October 2011, Ireland voted with a majority in agreeing to admit Palestine as a member of UNESCO and a critical stage was reached in November 2012 when Ireland voted in favour of seating Palestine as a &quot;non-member observer state&quot; at the UN General Assembly in New York.  We have thus made clear our openness to the full achievement of a Palestinian state and our willingness to take steps to help this come about.  We have therefore been clear all along about where we wanted to go and the only issue has been about timing and about how we can best achieve our objective.<\/p><p>  Broadly, there have been three main strands to our engagement.  We have encouraged a reappraisal of the European Union's approach and how it can best contribute to creating the conditions for a resumption of purposeful negotiations aimed at the achievement of a two-state solution, as well as wider engagement with other key players.  We have sought to help build Palestinian institutions capable of assuming the responsibilities of government and we have facilitated humanitarian support as well.<\/p><p>  It has been the general position in Europe - held by successive Irish Governments and by the great majority of EU partners, including Sweden until now - that the establishment of a Palestinian state and recognition of it should come about as a result of a comprehensive peace agreement between the two sides in the conflict.  The primary reason for this is that in practical terms a Palestinian state cannot exist without the ending of the Israeli occupation.  Sweden's change of mind in October in deciding to take a different view and immediately recognising Palestine has revived interest in the question of recognition.  I will return to that central question shortly but, first, I will address some other points arising from the motion before us this evening.<\/p><p>  Successive Irish Governments have seen the promotion of a just and equitable peace in the Middle East as a key element of Irish foreign policy to be pursued both in our bilateral relations and in particular through our influence on the Middle East policy of the European Union.  Ireland led the adoption by the EU of the central objective of a two-state solution to the conflict to bring about a fully sovereign state of Palestine coexisting alongside Israel.  This remains the only vision of the future which can satisfy the aspirations, and ensure the security and prosperity, of both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.  I acknowledge that a number of Deputies had a different view on that this evening.<\/p><p>  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains a major priority in Ireland's international diplomacy.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has actively used all appropriate opportunities, bilaterally and in the context of the United Nations General Assembly and the recent Cairo conference on reconstruction in Gaza, to seek to advance consideration of the issue.  He has led efforts to ensure it is given due attention on the EU agenda and he has sought to frame a rethinking of the Union's approach on how best to create the conditions for progress and incentivise the parties to engage in meaningful negotiations.<\/p><p>  As one of the member states with the strongest commitment to the Palestinian cause, it is sometimes frustrating for us that it can be so difficult to persuade the EU as a whole to move in the direction we might want.  It is precisely our influence within the EU that gives us weight on this issue, and that was the principal reason for the abstention in the vote at the UN which has been referred to this evening.  Retaining and maximising that influence is an important objective for us that we must consider carefully.  Some have argued that we should recognise Palestine tomorrow but it would do the Palestinian people and their cause no service if, in doing so, we were to marginalise or weaken our own voice in the EU on this issue.  We can only push the envelope if we are inside it.  That judgment - when to lead by example and when to seek to build support - is one that we must make for ourselves, and the Government must do so.<\/p><p>  The motion also calls on the Government to assist in developing the institutions of the future Palestinian state.  This is a critical task, which goes beyond just readying Palestine for statehood, and one we have been engaged with for many years.  This issue and the other element of our engagement on the humanitarian side will be addressed by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, who is speaking next and is particularly concerned with these areas.<\/p><p>  We are all conscious of the worsening of the Israel-Palestine issue.  Direct negotiations have ended and an early resumption is hard to envisage.  The relentless construction of settlements continues to eat away both the physical and political space where a state of Palestine can be constructed.  The recent dreadful conflict in Gaza and the worsening position now in east Jerusalem reminds us of the violent possibilities just under the surface and the regional background to the problem has greatly darkened.<\/p><p>Against this background, there is much soul-searching going on in the international community about what can we do to break the stalemate in the Middle East.  Ireland has concentrated on pressing within the EU for a serious reappraisal of overall Middle East strategy and, in particular, for stronger action against the policies on the ground which are making a two-state solution harder to achieve, principally those related to settlements.  This is a difficult discussion and one on which member states by no means agree but we are working to push it forward.  This frustration has led some, including now the Government of Sweden, to see recognition as a possible way of breaking the stalemate and I think this is the sense in which this evening's motion has been constructed.<\/p><p> Recognition has potential symbolic value but it will not increase at all the degree of control which Palestinians have or do not have over their own lives.  It is not a magic bullet.  If international recognition of Palestine was going to break the stalemate, then it would have happened long ago.  As the motion notes and as Members have said, more than 130 countries around the world have recognised Palestine, many of them for many years, without this bringing nearer an end to the conflict.  It is important that we remain focused on our efforts to centre attention on negative Israeli policies on the ground.<\/p><p> We want to do whatever will help and that means we also need to think about any negative aspects to what we might be contemplating.  Recognition, like many policies, may answer some questions but open others.  There is an obvious problem in that the Palestinian Authority, which is the body that has changed its name to the State of Palestine, was set up under the Oslo Accords in co-operation with Israel and it controls only a part of what should be the Palestinian state - less than half of the West Bank and none of Gaza at present.  It is an issue that the Fatah-Hamas split has prevented presidential or legislative elections from being held in Palestine for many years since they were due.  It could be an issue if Hamas, a designated terrorist movement which does not yet accept the existence of Israel, again becomes the government of a state of Palestine, which we recognise and whose representatives would have diplomatic status here.<\/p><p> None of these issues, however, need preclude a decision by Ireland to recognise but they deserve careful consideration by ourselves and in concert with partners.  We also recognise the powerful longing of Palestinians for their own state and the value of symbols and gestures.  These have a weight of their own to be considered.<\/p><p> The support of the Seanad in October and I expect of the D&aacute;il tomorrow are important considerations.  As in most countries, however, recognition of foreign states is, ultimately, a decision for the Government to take.  The key question for us and for the EU is whether recognition will help or hinder the search for a comprehensive peace.  Until now, the general view has been that it would not help.  That view may now be changing but, at present, it remains the view of the great majority of EU member states.<\/p><p> For Ireland there is a separate consideration, which I have already mentioned.  Will recognition at this moment, in advance of other partners, increase our influence on the issue in the EU, that is, our ability to achieve our goal, or will it leave us marginalised and less influential?  Sweden, which long held the same position as most other partners, has recently taken the opposite view.  However, even other Nordic states, with which Sweden forms a close knit group, have not yet followed its lead on recognition.  There is now, however, a period of reflection going on in the EU on this issue, prompted by Sweden's decision and by frustration at overall events.  Ireland is playing an active part in that reflection.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has made it clear that the Government has an open mind on the role which early recognition of Palestine might play in that regard.  He has stated that against the backdrop of a worsening situation on the ground, he is open to any option which he believes would move things forward.<\/p><p> Speaking on behalf of the Government, I acknowledge that the terms of the motion before us are for the most part consistent with the Government's view of the situation.  We have always looked forward to recognising Palestine as early as possible and that moment is now clearly a lot closer than it was even in 2011.  We will take very careful note of the opinions clearly expressed in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad but we will also continue to take part in the EU discussion on recognition which we were instrumental in opening only last month.  We will seek to create the conditions for a resumption of meaningful negotiations on a two-state solution and we will pursue our efforts with our partners to support economic development and build the necessary institutional capacity on the Palestinian side.  The Government will decide on national recognition by Ireland at the point where we believe it will make a positive contribution to the objectives clearly expressed in this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900064#NNN00300","speaker":"985","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418167500,"counter":792,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an r&uacute;n at&aacute; os &aacute;r gcomhair um thr&aacute;thn&oacute;na.  For more than two decades, successive Irish Governments have provided financial support to build the institutions of a Palestinian state, to promote peace building and to meet the immediate needs of the Palestinian people.  The motion before the House calls on the Government to do all it can to assist in the development of the democratic and state institutions of the Palestinian state.  I believe we are already doing this.<\/p><p>  Ireland, like other EU members states, is committed to supporting the Palestinian Authority as part of our overall programme of support for the Palestinian people.  This support, which enables Palestinians to build institutions and provide essential public services, is critical to laying the foundations for a future State.  We now provide more than &euro;10 million annually in support to Palestinians to help them deliver on their development priorities, to support the promotion of human rights and to meet immediate humanitarian needs.<\/p><p>  Ireland is one of five partners working directly with the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Higher Education to support it in delivering its education development strategic plan.  This year we have provided &euro;1.5 million in funding, bringing our total support to &euro;7.5 million, but Ireland also provides technical support to the education sector.<\/p><p>  There is clear evidence that our contribution is helping the ministry to provide better quality education services to more Palestinian children.  I am aware from our contacts with officials across a number of Palestinian ministries that our work with others in improving education is seen as making a real difference to Palestinian institutions and is held up as an example. Other EU partners have engaged in parallel work with other ministries, such as finance, and the EU has for a number of years operated a significant police training mission, known as EUPOL COPPS, assisting the Palestinian police in developing and improving professional and human rights standards.  Seconded Irish staff have played a valuable role in that continuing mission.<\/p><p>  In our work to build up the capacities of the Palestinian institutions and prepare them to assume the responsibilities of a sovereign state, we know that merely reaching that goal of statehood is not enough.  After decades of occupation, we want Palestinians to achieve a state that can be a model for a troubled region and can deliver real improvements in the lives of its citizens.<\/p><p>A Palestine based on the rule of law and respect for human rights is the best guarantor of the longevity of any peace agreement, and the future security and prosperity of Palestinians and Israelis alike.<\/p><p> While we work to strengthen the institutions on which a Palestinian state will be built, we must ensure that the Palestinian Authority can meet the immediate needs of the people living in the West Bank and Gaza.  Their capacity to deliver essential public services such as health and education is not only essential for the immediate welfare of the Palestinian people but also critical to the creation of a Palestinian state.  In the current difficult context, delivery of public services is simply impossible without significant external support.  Since 2008, working through a European Commission mechanism known as M&eacute;canisme Palestino-Europ&eacute;en de Gestion de l'Aide Socio-Economique, PEGASE, we have provided &euro;12 million to the Palestinian Authority to deliver public services.  Our support has been focused on services in the areas of health, education and social protection.  I know, however, that strong institutions alone will not guarantee the viability of a Palestinian state.  We are funding a number of Palestinian and Israeli organisations that are working to address human rights issues.  They focus on addressing freedom of movement, absence of rule of law, rights of prisoners and detainees, women's rights, and democratic development.  These organisations play an important role not only in reporting human rights abuses but in holding their own authorities to account, a key element of all democracies.<\/p><p> Regrettably, while we work to ensure that Palestinian institutions are ready for statehood, we continue to have to address the immediate humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people.  The humanitarian situation continues to be precarious, as the key drivers of vulnerability remain in place.  The protracted crisis is compounded by recurrent escalations in hostilities, such as the appalling tragedy in Gaza this year, which increase humanitarian needs.<\/p><p> The conflict in Gaza this year had devastating humanitarian consequences.  At present, approximately 100,000 people remain displaced and are in need of food, water, health services and shelter solutions.  According to the United Nations Works and Relief Agency, UNRWA, some 20,000 people are still living in schools in Gaza.  It is estimated that 18,000 homes were destroyed or severely damaged, leaving approximately 108,000 people homeless.  Damage to public infrastructure was extensive, and despite repairs to the water and sanitation network in Gaza, significant constraints still impair the delivery of these services.  Electricity outages for 12 hours a day continue in most areas across Gaza.  Critical infrastructure was severely damaged or destroyed: 50% of all medical facilities sustained severe damage, 22 schools were completely destroyed and 118 damaged, and more than 70 hospitals and clinics were damaged.<\/p><p> This latest conflict has compounded an already serious humanitarian situation with widespread poverty, an extremely fragile economy and aid dependency.  Approximately two thirds of the population of Gaza were receiving food assistance prior to the crisis and after seven weeks of conflict, most Palestinians in Gaza can no longer meet their most basic needs.  Earning a livelihood is simply impossible.  We provide &euro;4 million annually to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA; this year we responded to the crisis in Gaza by providing an additional &euro;1 million to UNRWA.  This support is helping to provide urgently needed food, shelter and medical aid to thousands of families, many of whom had to flee their homes.  Over the next two years we will provide a further &euro;2 million to the Palestinian Authority and UN partners for long-term recovery assistance in Gaza.<\/p><p> Ultimately, of course, we see the end of the occupation as the essential step in addressing the problems of Palestine, including Gaza.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade with special responsibility for European affairs and data protection, Deputy Dara Murphy, has set out the ways in which the Government is working to achieve that end.  Within that context, the Government will continue to reflect, both nationally and along with our EU colleagues, on the role that the specific step of recognition of Palestine could play.  We have made clear that the Government has an open mind about any action, including early recognition of Palestine, which can positively contribute to the goal we all share of an end to the conflict and a secure future for Palestinians and Israelis.  This Government will continue to do all we can to ensure that a future Palestinian state will be built on strong institutions capable of meeting the needs of the people of that state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900065#OOO00200","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418168100,"counter":794,"content":"<p>I agree with the proposers of this motion - and, I think, with all balanced and informed opinion - that the <i>status quo<\/i>is untenable and dangerous.  We are also agreed that what is needed is an early resumption of negotiations, with clear parameters and with a specific timetable.  I believe in a free, sovereign, independent and democratic Palestine living peacefully side by side with Israel.  Much like our own peace settlement, we can already describe what the essential outlines of that settlement will be: it will allow for a democratic and sovereign state of Palestine, living in peace and security alongside Israel on the basis of the 1967 lines, with special provision for the status of Jerusalem in both states.  There will ultimately be agreement on issues to do with borders, security, water rights, the status of Jerusalem and freedom of access to religious sites and outstanding legalities concerning Palestinian refugees, including resolving the problem of the right to return.  Ireland and the European Union are committed to a two-state solution, which of course involves recognition of Palestine alongside Israel.<br\/><br\/>I should be clear, if any clarity is needed, that our ongoing commitment to a secure and peaceful state of Israel is not in any doubt.  All our actions and policies should be designed to advance the goal of peace and to secure a comprehensive peace agreement.  I repeat my belief that there cannot be a comprehensive peace without the two-state solution.  So long as there is no real prospect of political talks resuming any time soon, there will be continuing loss of faith in political action as a way forward.  The relentless announcements of settlement expansion continue, entailing continued evictions of Palestinians to expropriate land and resources for settlers.  The result has been a rise in demonstrations, in the use of lethal force by Israeli authorities against demonstrators, and in random and deadly attacks on Israelis.<br\/><br\/>There is much soul-searching going on in the international community about what we can do to break the stalemate in the Middle East.  Where there is no agreement at EU level, there is scope for member states to take national initiatives.  Sweden's decision to recognise Palestine has focused attention on a possible new direction.<br\/><br\/>It is important to be realistic too.  Recognition of Palestine before full statehood is actually achieved is not a magic formula that ends the occupation, advances the talks or even predetermines the outcome.  Already, 135 countries have recognised the state of Palestine.  Unfortunately, simply saying it is so does not make it so.  State recognition is a serious business and should not become an exercise in collective make-believe, because this favours nobody.  We in this country should know better than most that a sovereign territorial claim that exists only on paper is no solution.  In fact it can become a substitute for policy and a barrier to engagement on the real issues.  It helped some people here to escape into an imaginary world of their own construction, where reality was never confronted.  I would not support recognising a state of Palestine that exists only in the same fanciful world as our own thirty-two county, rebel song republic.  This would do a gross disservice to the people of Palestine and all those around the world who want to see a just and lasting settlement to this most intractable of problems.  That is just one of the reasons it is important to stress that recognition of a state, both in terms of whether and when, remains constitutionally a matter for Government in the ongoing conduct of international relations.  This motion, and the motion in the Seanad last October, are recognised as non-binding on the Government on those two points.  None the less, this is an important articulation of the views of this Parliament on where we stand on the question of Palestine.<\/p><p>In summary, we must continue to do all we can to bring the parties to the table.  The key focus must remain on getting substantive negotiations going, bringing the occupation of the Palestinian territories to an end and bringing about a Palestinian state that exists in reality as well as on paper.  In the interim, we should not rule out any option, including an early formal recognition of Palestine, if a united international and multilateral position on that point will help to bring the parties to the table and to get real and meaningful talks under way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900066#PPP00200","speaker":"1067","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418168700,"counter":796,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputy Keaveney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900067#QQQ00200","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1418168700,"counter":797,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

We will be supporting this motion.  I am glad that Deputies on all sides of the House are supportive of this proposal.  We believe this House must send out a strong message in one voice on behalf of the Irish people that we stand with the people of Palestine and their right to self-determination.  We acknowledge that this motion largely reflects what happened in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 22 October last.  When a motion supporting the recognition of the state of Palestine - it called \"on the Government to formally recognise the State of Palestine and do everything it can at an international level to help to secure a viable two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\" - was carried unanimously on that historic occasion, it was an indication of the strong democratic support in Ireland for such recognition.  It reflected the strong desire in this country for a sustainable and secure settlement of the conflict in the Middle East, for peace for Israelis and Palestinians in their own states, and for equality, fairness and justice in the settlement between the Israeli and Palestinian people.<\/p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has been at the vanguard in supporting a two-state solution in the Middle East for a number of decades.  Fianna F&aacute;il in government led Ireland to become the first EU member state to declare that a solution to the conflict in the Middle East had to be based on a fully sovereign state of Palestine, independent of and coexisting with Israel.  That policy position was launched in 1980 by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, the late Brian Lenihan senior, who said that the Palestinian people &quot;had a right to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State in Palestine&quot;.  The motion passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann shows that we are moving further in this regard.  We now believe the time is right for the Government to fully recognise Palestine as a sovereign, independent state.  We have called on the Government to follow the lead of the French Republic's Parliament, Sweden and the UK House of Commons by recognising the state of Palestine.  Our rationale in this regard stems from a frustration with the lack of progress in advancing the two-state solution in recent years.  That is a message that has come from all speakers here tonight.<\/p><p>  The recent war in Gaza and the unwillingness of the Israeli Government to engage in meaningful and constructive negotiations with the Palestinians have resulted in a mind shift across the world regarding how best to approach the conflict in the Middle East.  We acknowledge that recognition by itself cannot end the occupation.  Only Israel can do this.  If Ireland and other EU states recognise Palestine, it could represent an important step towards unlocking negotiations.  The recognition of Palestine would be anti-occupation, rather than anti-Israel.  Given that Ireland already recognises the state of Israel, the recognition of Palestine would help to create a parity of status.  Some 20 years after the Oslo Accords, the prospect of achieving a two-state solution appear to be more remote than ever.  That fact should concern all Members of this House.  It appears to any objective observer that Israel has done everything it can to undermine the chances of achieving such an outcome.  We acknowledge that there have been many initiatives allowing for talks on peace, but they have continuously failed with the result that Israel has intensified its illegal occupation of Palestine.  The illegal settlements on the West Bank have trebled in size as Israel has seized more Palestinian land and planted Israeli settlers on it.  Israel has erected a huge separation barrier and implemented what must called an apartheid regime on the West Bank that denies Palestinians the basic human rights their Israeli counterparts take for granted.  Such actions are not those of an Israeli state that is preparing for a two-state solution.  Such actions will not inspire and consolidate peace.<\/p><p>  This summer, we witnessed Israel's third devastating assault in six years on the people of Gaza.  Any hope the Gaza ceasefire might lead to meaningful peace negotiations was quickly dashed when, within one week of agreeing to it, Israel announced more settlements on the West Bank.  This deeply provocative move fundamentally undermined any prospect of peace.  As my colleague, Senator Power, outlined in the Seanad, these actions represented a deeply cynical, long-term game aimed at destroying any prospect of a viable Palestinian state.  Unfortunately, these actions have been facilitated by a largely passive international community, including the EU, which has stood by as Israel has wilfully violated international law and ignored countless UN resolutions.  As things stand, Israel has no incentive to engage in meaningful negotiations.  It has successfully used its military might time and again to ensure it holds all the cards.  Without wider recognition of the Palestinian state, representatives of Palestine have been in a weaker position at the negotiating table.  It is time to redress this balance by joining Sweden and other EU member states in recognising Palestine and thereby making it clear that statehood is a right of the Palestinian people, rather than an Israeli bargaining chip to be played in further negotiations which are doomed to fail.  The recognition of the state of Palestine would increase pressure on Israel to pursue a genuine peace process that has a real prospect of delivering peace and justice for Israelis and Palestinians.<\/p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has always respected and celebrated the establishment and progress of the state of Israel.  We have never questioned the right of the Israeli people to exercise their right to self-determination and self-defence.  Our support of this motion and our tabling of the motion in the Seanad in October should not be seen as a slight against Israel or its people.  Like any other nation, Israel has a duty to abide by internationally accepted standards of human rights, proportionality and responsibility.  The Palestinian authorities must act in a responsible fashion in their interactions with Israel.  They should condemn the recent lone wolf attacks carried out in Jerusalem and take action to prevent such attacks in the future.  Ireland has traditionally and rightly been vocal in its support for the Palestinian people and proactive in lobbying on their behalf internationally.  We do this because we understand what it is like to be a nation without a voice.  We understand the difficulties of bargaining with a stronger power.  We understand conflict between peoples.  The lessons of our experience should inform our efforts to secure full recognition for the Palestinian state and deliver a viable two-state solution to settle the conflict.<\/p><p>We have the opportunity to outline our position now instead of seeking to hide behind the EU's lack of consensus on this matter.  Sweden is not hiding behind the lack of an EU Common Position or accepting the Israeli line that the recognition of Palestine is something in Israel's gift in future negotiations.  Nor should we.  In supporting this motion and taking this step to help build a lasting and just peace in the region based on human rights and respect for international law, we are sending a clear message on behalf of all Irish people.  We should take this step and join the many others in the international community who want a lasting peace in the Middle East.  Now is the time to act.  Now is the time to support the recognition of the state of Palestine.  We should also use all other international fora available to us to encourage other states to make the same moves.<\/p><p> The Acting Chairman will recall how the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, stated his belief at the last meeting of our foreign affairs committee that the EU had to take a more proactive approach in seeking a peace settlement.  I hope that the Minister strongly puts to the European Council the message that, along with other members of the international community, the EU has a binding and moral duty to ensure basic justice and equality for a people who have been downtrodden for many decades.<\/p><p> I recall reading some essays on the work and political life of one of Deputy O'Dowd's predecessors in Louth, Frank Aiken, who served for many years as Minister for External Affairs and was one of Fianna F&aacute;il's founding members.  During his time at the UN in the 1940s and 1950s, he often spoke at length about the need for justice and equality for everyone in the Middle East.  Many years later, we are speaking about the same subject.  Unfortunately, there has been no progress for the Palestinian people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900067#QQQ00400","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418169300,"counter":800,"content":"<p>On 22 October, Fianna F&aacute;il proposed a motion calling on the Government to recognise Palestine formally as an independent and sovereign state.

It is unfortunate that Sinn F&eacute;in has tried to engage in a political trick by tabling this motion while failing to build on the momentum of the consensus in the Seanad.  It has endangered that opportunity.  The Government could have opposed it, meaning we could have been the first country in the EU to reject a proposal of this sort.  It was dangerous not to pursue a cross-party approach to get this across the line in the interests of the people of Palestine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900068#RRR00200","speaker":"1188"},{"type":"speech","time":1418169300,"counter":801,"content":"<p>We did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900068#RRR00300","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1418169300,"counter":802,"content":"<p>I welcome the Government's acceptance of the motion.

I fully accept the right of Israel to exist as a sovereign state.  I fully accept its people's right to defend themselves, but only within the confines of internationally accepted norms, particularly in the conduct in war.  As a sovereign state, Israel has a solemn duty to respect and honour international law as well as the human rights and, in particular, civilian rights of populations in the region.  We should take this opportunity to condemn out of hand the attacks on civilian targets - hospitals, ambulances, schools and homes.  These must stop, as we cannot have the horrific practice of imposing pain in what can be best described as the collective punishment of the most vulnerable people in the region as a consequence of the evils done by a small minority.<\/p><p>  In line with this philosophy, I condemn terrorist attacks on Israeli citizens and call on Hamas to take whatever action is necessary to reflect on the efforts being made by the international community, including Ireland, and to step up to the mark where the lives of innocents in Israel are concerned.  The Palestinian leadership must condemn this violence and rise above the brute force approach taken by its opponents.  It must also respect sovereign responsibility and conform to the human rights standards to which sovereign states are bound.<\/p><p>  The Palestinian people are a proud people with a long history, a rich culture and a strong sense of identity.  Undoubtedly, they are a stronger people as a consequence of the suffering and misery they have had to endure.  In the 1980s under a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government, Ireland became the first EU member state to declare that an essential feature of any resolution to the conflict in the Middle East had to be a two-state strategy.  In the past decade, however, and especially this summer, Israel has sought to establish a new set of facts through a new type of engagement of violence on the ground.  The future of any Palestinian state is only sustainable if the population has a chance to establish itself and develop a society, but that would not be in Israel's strategic interests.<\/p><p>  We cannot deny the dignity of Palestinian individuals or their families and children who are being slaughtered by a military regime in pursuit of an unclear and unhealthy cause.  Even now, the Israeli Government is attempting to colonise east Jerusalem.  The Minister of State should take whatever action is necessary to outline to Israel's Dublin-based diplomatic unit our protest over Palestine's right to recognise that area of Jerusalem as its future capital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900068#RRR00400","speaker":"1188"},{"type":"speech","time":1418169300,"counter":803,"content":"<p>Deputies Catherine Murphy and Healy are sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900068#RRR00500","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1418169300,"counter":804,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling this motion.

This is because there is no peace process, and that is the real tragedy.  The barbarity and severity of the bombardment the citizens of Gaza had to endure for 50 days this summer - known to the Israeli defence forces as Operation Protective Edge - has smashed the hopes of even the most naive that this Israeli Government is interested in pursuing a peace settlement.  The UN figures are absolutely appalling, showing the death of 1,523 Palestinian civilians and six Israeli civilians, 519 of them children.<br\/><br\/>The reason we are debating this motion today is that the international community has grown exasperated waiting for the peace to come and watching these horrors unfold.  Members have received correspondence in recent days from a large number of Israeli people from all walks of life.  It is very important that these 650 civilians, prominent figures all, have shown leadership where their government failed so to do.  Yesterday, a former Israeli ambassador to Ireland told the <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>that recognition of Palestine was an essential part of a two-state solution.

Statehood is the right of the Palestinian people, as is increasingly accepted and supported internationally.  Some 135 countries have now formally recognised the state of Palestine, including eight EU member states, namely, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Malta, Cyprus and Sweden.  In addition, the British, Spanish and French parliaments and, in this country, the Seanad have called on their respective governments to recognise Palestine.  It is particularly instructive that 900 prominent Israeli citizens have called on D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to pass this motion and give recognition to the state of Palestine.  In their letter they say:<blockquote>We, the undersigned citizens of Israel, who wish for it to be a thriving country, are worried by the continued political stalemate, the occupation and settlement activities that lead to further confrontations with Palestinians and squash any chances for compromise.  Your initiative for recognition of the state of Palestine will advance prospects for peace.<\/blockquote>There is no doubt that we have an opportunity here to help to build a lasting and just peace in the region based on human rights and respect for international law.  In fact, the adoption of this motion and the recognition of the state of Palestine would be an important expression of support for Palestinian statehood and for freedom and peace in the region.  International recognition of the state of Palestine is an important action that will increase diplomatic pressure on Israel to end its occupation and ongoing colonisation of Palestinian land and the apartheid system it operates against the Palestinian people.<br\/><br\/>Of course, recognition itself cannot end the occupation; only Israel can do that.  In that context, I urge the Government to impose political and economic sanctions on the state of Israel until such time as it ends its occupation of Palestine and abides fully by its international obligations under international law, thereby allowing a truly independent and free Palestine to exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900069#SSS00200","speaker":"960"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418169900,"counter":807,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2014: Messages from Select Committees","time":1418169900,"counter":808,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900069#SSS00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1418169900,"counter":809,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimate for Public Services for the service of the year ending 31 December 2014 - Vote 32.<br\/><br\/>The Select Sub-Committee on Health has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimate for Public Services for the service of the year ending 31 December 2014 - Vote 39.<br\/><br\/>The Select Sub-Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimate for Public Services for the service of the year ending 31 December 2014 - Vote 31.<br\/><br\/>The Select Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimate for Public Services for the service of the year ending 31 December 2014 - Vote 30.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900069#SSS00500","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Water Services Bill 2014: Committee Stage","time":1418169900,"counter":810,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900069#SSS00600"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418169900,"counter":811,"content":"<p>SECTION 1<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1418169900,"counter":812,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote>In page 3, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:&quot;&quot;customer&quot;, &quot;local authority&quot;, &quot;occupier&quot;, &quot;premises&quot; and &quot;property&quot; have the meanings assigned to each of them, respectively, in section 2 of the No. 2 Act of 2013;&quot;.<\/blockquote>This is a technical amendment which provides that the definitions of terms used in the Bill are the same as those used in the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013.  &quot;Customer&quot; is defined as the occupier of the premises in respect of which the water services are provided; &quot;local authority&quot; means a city or county council; and &quot;occupier&quot; means the person for the time being entitled to the occupation of a premises.

There was cause for further concern in the data protection statements that were included on the Irish Water website.  The first of these, for example, referred to the sale not only of Irish Water but of the PPS numbers and personal information of its customers.  Of course, the Government kept on assuring us this could not possibly happen.<\/p><p> As a result of the most recent changes, a section containing a number of safeguards and designed to prevent a sale or to reduce the prospect of such a sale was included in the Bill.  The greatest safeguard of all would be if Irish Water did not exist.  The billing system being put in place is expensive and Irish Water is a very expensive quango.  While I accept that there is a need to invest in water services, the last thing we need to do is put money into a massive quango.  When Mr. John Tierney of Irish Water appeared before the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, it emerged that it is estimated that the assets being transferred to the company - the intention was to work this matter through with each local authority - are valued at &euro;11 billion.  In recent days it has become clear that the relevant liabilities will not transfer in their entirety, which means that Irish Water is a much more attractive proposition in the context of its being sold.<\/p><p> The intention of the amendment in my name is to include some further safeguards in the legislation.  The amendments under discussion have obviously been grouped together because of the variety of different ways of preventing any sale.  My amendment suggests that a two thirds majority of each House would be required to allow shares to be disposed of.  I would prefer it if we were not in the position of seeking ways to amend the legislation.

Any Government, including that currently in office, with a majority of one in each House will actually be in a position to dispose of the assets of Irish Water without referring the matter to anyone else.  There is absolutely no security whatsoever provided within the legislation on this matter.  I tabled a very simple amendment which would have led to the inclusion in the Bill of the promise the Minister made on 19 November to the effect that the matter should be put by plebiscite to the people.  However, that amendment was ruled out of order on the basis that giving the people of this country their say with regard to the disposal of this particular asset would involve a potential cost on the Exchequer.  The legislation before the House is not worth the paper on which it is written.  The Minister is serious in terms of the commitment he gave on 19 November but what he said on that date is not reflected in the legislation.<br\/><br\/>Those of us who were involved in passing the legislation which facilitated the sale of the assets of Eircom are of the view that we made a genuine mistake.  When we debated legislation relating to Aer Lingus a number of years ago, the then Minister, the late Seamus Brennan, gave a commitment that a formal motion would have to be approved by a majority of either House before any shareholding in the company could be disposed of.  More recently, the assets of Bord G&aacute;is were not contemplated in the legislation relating to that company's disposal.  There is genuine concern regarding the assets of Irish Water because these are believed to be of such intrinsic value.  As the Minister is aware, these assets are being used as a mechanism to leverage equity.  The fear is that they may be forcibly sold at some future date.<br\/><br\/>As a result of the fact that I cannot table an amendment to the effect that the sale of those assets should be put to the people by plebiscite - which is what the Minister announced on 19 November - without it being ruled out of order, I drafted amendment No. 5 in order to guarantee that the assets of Irish Water will not be disposed of at any future date.  Now that local government is clearly written into our Constitution, my amendment would require that every municipal district in the State would be obliged to approve any motion relating to the disposal of the assets of Irish Water.  What I propose will provide a belt-and-braces approach in terms of ensuring that a sale cannot happen at the whim of any future Government or at that of the troika, should that entity ever return.  Amendment No. 5 would ensure that the assets of Irish Water could not be sold without the approval of every municipal authority in Ireland.  In my opinion, such approval would not be forthcoming.  My amendment will provide the security people are seeking on this matter.<br\/><br\/>As already stated, the commitment given by the Minister on 19 November to the effect that there should be a plebiscite if any assets of Irish Water are to be disposed of is not reflected in the legislation.  On that occasion, he also indicated that one of his other priorities is the removal of boil water notices and stated, &quot;In the very near future, for the first time in many years, people in Roscommon will be able to drink water from their tap&quot;.  I received correspondence from Irish Water in recent days which indicates that it will be March 2017 - at least 12 months after the next general election - before the people in north-east Roscommon will actually be able to drink the water from their taps.  That eventuality is a long way down the road.  In the interim and if they live in urban areas, these people will be obliged to pay &euro;130 per year for the pleasure of receiving water which is below the proper standard.<br\/><br\/>Some 12 months ago, the former Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, provided the following commitment:<blockquote>Irish Water should not be allowed to charge for water supplies that are subject to restrictions on health grounds.  This is why the Act gives the Minister power to make directions in this regard.  I have no doubt that people who do not have access to a safe and healthy supply of water should not and will not be charged for it.<\/blockquote>I wanted this to be reflected in the legislation at that time but I was informed that there was no need because people would not be charged for water supplies that are subject to restrictions on health grounds.  Under the Bill before the House, those who live in urban areas will be charged &euro;130 per year for water that is unfit for human consumption.  The Minister can say what he likes and provide all the assurances he wants.  However, the reality is that it must be written into the legislation that the approval of the Irish people will be required.  We have been given commitments in the past 12 months but these are not reflected in the Bill and, as I have just outlined, they have not been honoured by the Government.<\/p><p>The Minister's commitment that he gave here just less than a month ago, that is, that there will be a plebiscite if there is any disposal of assets, is not written into the legislation.  It states there \"may\" be a plebiscite, so it is at the whim of the Government in power.  If that Government has the troika or IMF breathing down its neck because of the dire situation the country is in, a financial motion or emergency motion will be introduced ramming this through.  That is why I am asking the Minister to accept the amendment I have tabled, which would at least ensure all county councillors, who are directly elected by every legal resident over 18, would have a direct say in any disposal of assets.<\/p><p> While my proposal does not provide the constitutional amendment many of us would like to have seen included in the legislation, or provide for the plebiscite the Minister promised but which he did write into the legislation, it at least ensures the public will be consulted by their local public representatives, who have a constitutional role now because of the provisions in our Constitution in regard to local government.  Each municipal district would, in its own right, make a decision as to whether any of the assets owned by Irish Water could be disposed of in the future.   In light of the severe shortcomings in section 2 of the legislation, I hope the Minister will accept my amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900070#TTT00600","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418171100,"counter":830,"content":"<p>The fact that the D&aacute;il is sitting after midnight, in the early morning of 10 December, to debate for one hour amendments to the Water Services Bill that could easily be debated in time allocated on Thursday and Friday is a tribute to the overweening arrogance of the newly arrived Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  He is newly arrived but already delusional about leaving a so-called legacy.  Make no mistake: this is the Minister's two-fingered gesture to the tens of thousands of ordinary, decent people - the taxpayers of this country - who will gather tomorrow outside D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to say they do not want his noxious legislation or odious water charges, which they understand to be another bondholders' and bankers' tax.  It is a Minister of the Labour Party who is giving the people the finger.<\/p><p>  The Minister is a young and mightily ambitious man in a mighty hurry, but young men in a hurry should make haste slowly.  I can tell him now what his legacy will be if he persists along this road with his water tax.  He will be known for having started off by attempting to defy a mass movement of people demanding the abolition of this austerity tax called the water charge.  He will be known for having been met by ongoing resistance.  If he persists in spite of the mass boycott of the odious tax next April, when the first bills are issued, that movement will continue until the next general election if the charges are not gone before then.  He will be defeated by that mass movement, be it in the next few weeks, April or in the general election.  To the extent that the Minister, with his colleagues in the Labour Party and Fine Gael, arrogantly defies the wishes of a huge majority of the people, there will be a reduction in the number of Deputies, particularly from the Labour Party, coming back to this D&aacute;il.  That will be the legacy of this Minister.<\/p><p>  It is quite incredible that the Deputies in the Labour Party and Fine Gael, who obviously wanted no debate at this ludicrous hour of the night and having heard the very rational proposal on how this debate should be ordered, had not the guts to vote down the Government's proposal and say the discussion should be made in daylight in full view of the people tomorrow, Thursday and Friday.<\/p><p>  I support the amendments before us while wholly opposing the legislation.  The idea that a buffer or blocks to the privatisation of Irish Water is included in the legislation is nothing short of the most incredible mendacity, as has been pointed out.  If resolutions going in the direction of privatisation are passed, proposals may, if the Government decides to proceed, be submitted by plebiscite.  There is no compulsion.  In any case, as I pointed out before, this is cynicism from start to finish.  No Government can tie the Government that will succeed it to the legislation it passes.  The D&aacute;il that succeeds can overturn this legislation depending on the combination of parties, if a majority of that D&aacute;il wishes.  Therefore, the desperate Labour Party, panicked by a movement of people power while arrogantly trying to defy it, is pretending it is taking account of the overwhelming view of the people that our water services should be in public hands and not in the hands of Irish Water, which they want to see the back of.  The hapless Greens and a few other hapless individuals, including some trade union leaders who are, incredibly, supporting water charges, are putting forward the idea of a referendum as an alibi for their betrayals in regard to being responsible for the introduction of water charges in the first place.  It is cynicism from start to finish.<\/p><p>  With regard to the privatisation issue, Deputy Naughten should note that not all of us made a mistake in regard to Telecom &Eacute;ireann and Eircom.

According to the proposal of the Minister, it would require a resolution of the D&aacute;il to hold a plebiscite, but all the Bill states is that the Government or a future Government &quot;may&quot; do so, and that raises considerable concerns.  The intention of my amendment was to put this in the hands of the people and not to trust the Government or any future Government on this matter.  The intention was to put a clause in the Constitution.<\/p><p>  I am also disappointed that we simply get a message of six or seven words stating &quot;The following amendments have been ruled out of order&quot;.  We do not get any explanation as to why that happens.  I find that difficult.  We put the work into submitting amendments to shape legislation and have an input, and that is the level of response.  The Government, in its weak-kneed and weak-willed response of trying to placate the public - or satisfy half of the public and dampen down the Opposition - then comes along with a weak Bill stating that a future Government may, if it so decides, hold a plebiscite.  I fully support Deputy Naughten's amendment in that regard.<\/p><p>  I also support Deputy Catherine Murphy's amendment.  While it is not the one that I would favour as my first choice, as I stated, I would favour a constitutional amendment to put the decision into the hands of the people.  Recognising that we are where we are, it is a step in the right direction to insert the phrase &quot;of not fewer than two thirds of the Members&quot; to ensure that Irish Water cannot not be sold off without the agreement of two thirds of the Members of the D&aacute;il, and it certainly makes it that bit more difficult for a future Government.<\/p><p>  In reading the Bill and studying how these amendments are being handled, my worst fears are being deepened.  I am very concerned about the Bill that has been introduced.  There will be a number of problems with it.  It adds further to the mess around Irish Water-Uisce &Eacute;ireann and water services.  We have been going down the wrong road since 1 January this year, when we transferred this out of the hands of the 31 local authorities.  I heard both the Minister and the Minister of State say that we could not continue with a situation in which water services began and stopped at county boundaries.  That was never the case.  I live in a county that is surrounded by other counties, and there has been co-operation with all of those counties in the provision of water services.  It is uncomplicated.  The way it is done is simple.  There is co-operation with Carlow, Offaly and the other counties.<\/p><p>  I am disappointed about the way this has been handled.  I support the amendments to which I referred, which try to make the best of a bad situation, but I am extremely disappointed that the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to put a provision into the Constitution - effectively, to put the decision into the hands of the people now and forever - has been disallowed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900072#VVV00300","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1418171700,"counter":836,"content":"<p>Rather than the plebiscite that the Minister proposes, I tabled a Bill looking to alter Article 10 of the Constitution - a simple line stating that the water supply could not be sold into private ownership - but it was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle using a new Standing Order that was never meant to be used in that way.  I wanted, in the D&aacute;il, to criticise the Ceann Comhairle for his actions, which, I believed, were repugnant to good parliamentary work, but I was told by the Ceann Comhairle's office that there is another Standing Order that means I am not allow criticise the Ceann Comhairle for anything he does.  Obviously, because I am not allowed criticise the Ceann Comhairle, I will not suggest that he is acting contrary to the good working of the Parliament, but we could have an interesting conversation if he was not protected by that interesting Standing Order.<\/p><p>  I resubmitted the provision as amendment No. 3 to this Bill, and it was ruled out of order.  Because the previous Standing Order could not be used, a new Standing Order was used to rule it out this time.  It was ruled that my amendment, which seeks to delete a provision of the Bill, does not speak to the provisions of the Bill.  There was also a technical reason - that a Bill that changes the Constitution can only concern itself with changing the Constitution.  Whilst some of these rulings may be technically correct, as a Member of the Oireachtas, I feel that when I am trying to do the work of Parliament and table legislation that I and those I represent believe in, we are dealing with an apparatus and a set of rules that seems dedicated to stopping us from having sensible parliamentary conversation.  There seems to be a body of work that needs to be done to change the Standing Orders of this House.  Deputy Kelly is a member of Cabinet.  I had four amendments tabled for this evening, all of which were very sensible, but three of them have been ruled out of order.  One amendment that was ruled out of order sought a reduction in charges for those who have no wastewater treatment, such as in Arklow, which would have reduced revenues to Irish Water.<\/p><p>I had that ruled out of order on the basis that it would result in a charge on the Exchequer.  How Irish Water not getting extra money from Arklow is a charge on the Exchequer is beyond me.  I did a count and discovered that more than half of the 31 amendments tabled by Members of the House, other than the Minister, were ruled out of order.  Deputy Naughten's amendment, which dared to suggest that a \"may\" should be turned into a \"shall\" also cannot be discussed by Parliament because that would incur a charge on the Exchequer.  I am aware the Minister has nothing to do with the amendments being ruled out of order but he is sitting at the Cabinet table and it is impossible for us as Members of the Oireachtas to conduct proper parliamentary business when faced with a set of rules which seem dedicated to stopping us conducting parliamentary business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900072#VVV00400","speaker":"1107","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418172300,"counter":838,"content":"<p>That is why they are there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900073#WWW00200","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1418172300,"counter":839,"content":"<p>Perhaps the Minister could raise at the Cabinet table that these Standing Orders need to be changed to allow us to do the job of Parliament.<\/p><p>  In terms of the substance of the change, I have no doubt the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, as a Labour Minister, would act against any privatisation.  The question is why I and others want to move beyond a plebiscite to constitutional protection.  The reason is as follows.  First, the public do not trust the plebiscite because legislation can be changed and, second, we do not know what is going to come from Europe.  We saw the letter from Jean-Claude Trichet to the late Brian Lenihan.  He demanded structural reforms.  The ECB acted completely beyond its mandate in demanding structural reforms.  Four weeks later the first memorandum of understanding, MOU, was signed and it contained two structural reforms.  One of them was that Irish people must be charged for their water.  One can be absolutely sure there is a view in Europe that the Irish water system should be privatised.<\/p><p>  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides.  I accept he would not vote for the privatisation of water but I do not believe for a second that a future Irish Government is not going to come under very serious pressure from Europe, potentially legally binding pressure, that says the plebiscite is all well and good but a new EU directive states we have to privatise the water supply.  My question to the Minister is as follows.  If he is dedicated to the Irish water supply never being privatised and if the plebiscite does not provide the guarantee that is required, will he explain to the House what the downside to a referendum is if it achieves what he claims and what I believe he wants to see?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900073#WWW00300","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1418172300,"counter":840,"content":"<p>This is a very important debate.  I do not have any issue with when it is discussed because this is a democratic Chamber but I would much prefer that it was in the committee rooms or during normal sitting times because the public is very interested in the points being made.<\/p><p>  I wish to respond to the point made by Deputy Naughten.  He is absolutely right; as Minister of State at the time, that was the commitment I discussed with the Department and that had gone through the apparatus of the Department.  I said it because it was agreed and it was in my speech.  That has all been changed but that is what happened.  Deputy Naughten is correct; people who cannot drink their water should not be charged for it.  Part of the building up of a relationship between the Irish people and Irish Water, Uisce &Eacute;ireann, is fairness and equity and going out of our way to make sure people who do not have a proper supply of water or who do not have a safe, drinkable or potable supply of water do not pay for it.  I wholeheartedly agree with that.<\/p><p>  When I previously acted in the House as Minister of State I gave a commitment on the Water Services (No. 1) Bill that the Water Services (No. 2) Bill would contain a commitment that Irish Water could never be privatised, and that the company would always and forever be a public company.  That was agreed, but when the No. 2 Bill was handed to me as I went into the Seanad on the day of the debate, the provision was excluded from the legislation.  That concerned me greatly.  The Department was fully aware of my very strong and forceful views at that time.  I discussed the issue with the then Minister, Mr. Hogan, and with others.  Eventually, the provision was brought in as an amendment to the Bill.  I remain deeply concerned at other agendas &ndash; they may be European as Deputy Donnelly suggested &ndash; but I do not know where they are coming from.  It was never articulated to me why we should not and could not have a referendum on Irish Water never going into private ownership.  Enshrining the provision in legislation and copper-fastening it in the Constitution would ensure there never would be such a possibility.  We have reason to be concerned.<\/p><p>  When the Minister comes to discuss the section, which I know will not happen tonight, I ask him to explain why the Government has decided that will not happen.  In terms of the acceptability of Irish Water and of the charges and issues concerning it, there would be a vote of between 80% and 90% in favour of a constitutional referendum to ensure Irish Water could never be privatised.  I am convinced there are other forces at work.  They may not necessarily be political forces.  I do not know where they are coming from but they exist, they are active and they have an influence.  I accept that people might not like what I say but it must be said.  I am aware of other issues which I will bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention privately when the debate is over, which might inform him of other areas to which he could look in the Department for confirmation of some of the things to which I refer.<\/p><p>  At the end of the day the debate is about people having confidence in Irish Water.  We should have a referendum.  That is what the people I represent want.  It is what people of all political parties want &ndash; Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Labour, Sinn F&eacute;in and those who do not subscribe to a political party.

The measure is in the Bill due to the serious and understandable concern among the public generally that Irish Water, if it ever gets up and running, and if water charges are introduced, will eventually be privatised and sold on for private profit to super rich Irish or international organisations and companies, people who are already very wealthy and who are already involved in the Irish Water scene.  That is very understandable because once water becomes a commodity then it is inevitable that full cost recovery will arise.  The charge, though initially capped as an introductory offer by the Government, will sky-rocket and the company will eventually be privatised and sold on to private interests.<\/p><p>  That is a reasonable and understandable situation for ordinary people because they have seen it happen before, in particular in the case of refuse charges, which were introduced at a very low cost but after a number of years we now have a situation where there is a very significant charge for refuse of approximately &euro;300 per year per household.  The waiver scheme has been abolished and the refuse service has been privatised.  People are very much aware of that.<\/p><p>  The notion of a plebiscite or referendum was initially introduced by Government supporters and the Green Party, in effect, as a diversionary tactic to try to get people&rsquo;s mind off charges.<\/p><p>We heard it first from Mr. Jack O'Connor of SIPTU; we heard it from the Green Party that was the initiator of the idea of water charges and we heard it from Deputy Joe Costello of the Labour Party.  As has been said by other speakers, the formulation in the Bill reminds me of the fraud perpetrated on the people in the last general election, in particular, by the Labour Party which produced its Tesco ad with the warning not to vote for Fine Gael.  It stated, \"Vote for us and we will stop Fine Gael bringing in water charges\".  This is something very similar.  The Minister came into the House a fortnight ago and gave the impression that water services would be given protection by being inserted into the Constitution in order that they could not be privatised.  This is not provided for in the Bill and its provisions are worse than useless.  It is sleight of hand and trickery.  As other speakers said, the Bill does not provide for any specific or exact circumstance.  It states the Government may do - not that it has to - if it so decides.  This section is worse than useless and more trickery by the Government, the Minister and the Labour Party.  It is worthless.  Amendments Nos. 4 to 8, inclusive, are worthwhile, but if the Bill is to be useful, what is needed is an amendment to the Constitution to prevent the privatisation of water forever - full stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900073#WWW00500","speaker":"960","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418172900,"counter":843,"content":"<p>The Minister has said he is listening to the people, but he has not listened to them on this issue.

The people are very angry about this.  Every now and again the Government faces a crisis and people get really angry and then apparently we have ardent words from the Taoiseach and the Minister about how they are listening to the people.  On the face of it, they seem to display a little humility and appear to be listening, but actually the spin, the dishonesty, the manoeuvring, the game playing and the attempt to play people for fools continue.  We have seen it again tonight with this carry-on in respect of the late sitting.  It is a peculiar, absurd little game that I do not fully understand and, frankly, I do not even care too much, as it is part of the continuous game playing.  The Bill represents the same.<\/p><p>  There is a commitment not to privatise when they know that the people have stated clearly that they do not want to see their water services privatised and they want cast iron guarantees that they will not be privatised.  For the past week or two, after the Bill was published, the Government has been saying, &quot;We have it now.  They will not be privatised.  It is included in the Bill that they will not be privatised and we have taken measures to make sure they will not be privatised.&quot;  However, of course, the devil is in the detail, as usual.  There is no guarantee.  It is utterly meaningless and a pretence.  It is another attempt to deceive and the Government keeps doing it.  I wonder if the Minister thinks he will not be found out.  Part of the reason people are on the streets is the way in which the Labour Party, having been humiliated on the issue of bin charges for its complicity in the privatisation of refuse services, continued to spin a line, &quot;It was all those people who were boycotting bin charges who caused the privatisation of refuse services&quot;.  Was this really the case?  How is it that refuse services were privatised in rural areas first where there had been no boycott campaigns and no opposition to paying?  The last places to have refuse services privatised were the places in which people resisted.  They lasted ten years longer than anyone else precisely because they had resisted.  Does the Minister think they have not worked this out?  Does he think they have not worked out that if they have to pay five cent in user charges, that it will only move in one direction and that the services will be privatised?  Does he think they have not worked out that when the contracts to install the meters go to the richest man in the country, that, in fact, they have already been privatised and that all of his assurances mean nothing?  Does he think they have not figured this out?  Does he think they are stupid?  He obviously does because he would not be saying what he is if he did not think he could play the people for fools.  However, they are not fools.  I cannot believe he believes what he is saying because he knows that once user charges are introduced, privatisation is inevitable, as everybody knows.<\/p><p>  As for the off balance sheet stuff, we listened to the people from Detroit who described it as &quot;financialisation&quot;, another word for bonds.  They said the issuing of bonds in Detroit had led directly to charges sky rocketing to the point where people were being charged nearly $1,000 a year and where three quarters of the charge was for water going out.  They were being charged three times more for the water coming off the roof than the clean water going in.  That is where financialisation led because the bondholders placed demands on the water company to jack up the charges to get their pound of flesh.  The Minister should stop playing the people for fools because they are not, as he will discover tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120900074#XXX00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1418172900,"counter":845,"content":"<p>I wish to make a couple of quick points.

Here is a suggestion: if the Government showed a bit of courage and capability it would say to Draghi and the EU Commission that &euro;25 billion of misplaced losses on the Irish people would be corrected and that &euro;10 billion of it would be allocated in the first instance to the water supply and &euro;15 billion to other capital projects in education, the health system, which is buckling, to support people who do not even have homes and to build homes.

These decisions were made beyond me.  Section 2 is a very important part of the Bill as everyone is aware.  The provision safeguards the public ownership of Irish water and it provides for the holding of a plebiscite if any future Government proposes to change the ownership of Irish Water.  Personally I do not think this will ever happen.  I do not believe a future Government will in any way try to change the ownership of Irish Water.  The section provides that where a Government proposes to initiate legislation to change the ownership, or would potentially do so, it must obtain a resolution from both Houses that they are in favour of the legislation.  Subject to such resolutions being obtained, the Government would then hold a plebiscite of the people.  The legislation could not proceed without the support of the people and this is quite clear.  The section includes the provision that the details of the plebiscite would be set out in regulations.<\/p><p>  The amendment tabled by Deputy Catherine Murphy refers to requiring the resolution from both Houses of the Oireachtas to be approved by two thirds of the Members.  I cannot accept the amendment as it would place more stringent conditions on a future Government than applies at present.  Amendment No. 5, tabled by Deputy Naughten, proposes that the holding of a plebiscite would require a resolution from each municipal district in addition to the resolution from both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This condition is onerous and would be administratively quite cumbersome.  Moreover I believe it is absolutely unnecessary and obviously I will not accept it.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 7 proposes amending the eligibility criteria for voting in the plebiscite.  The Government believes the appropriate eligibility criteria to vote on ownership of such a vital national resource are the same as those for eligibility to vote in a referendum.  Therefore I cannot accept the amendment tabled by Deputies Coppinger, Higgins and Murphy.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 8 proposes that a provision be inserted to state the Government shall not extend public moneys for the purposes of promoting a particular outcome of the plebiscite.  Section 2(7) requires the Minister to publish details of the proposal and the reasons for it to be submitted to the people in the plebiscite.  This amendment is unnecessary and I cannot accept it.  Limits on the use of public moneys are detailed in electoral legislation so there is no need to repeat such provisions in this legislation.<\/p><p>  Several other issues were raised by Deputies.  Deputy O'Dowd raised some issues he feels need to be brought to my attention or the attention of the House.  By all means he should please raise them here if he feels it appropriate to do so, or raise them with me in a private capacity, if that is appropriate for whatever reason.<\/p><p>  Some of Deputy Donnelly's amendments were ruled out of order.  The European Commission is obliged to protect national sovereignty in respect of the ownership of water services and has issued such communication to the Government in the recent past.
