I am also aware of the serious problem of youth suicide and of the role that schools can play in the area of prevention and ensuring the education system is more responsive to those with emotional or mental health difficulties.  I can inform the Deputy that last January I launched the Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention, which were developed by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health. They are informed by consultation with key education partners and by the findings of recent research. The guidelines provide practical guidance to post-primary schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. <\/p><p>  The Guidelines have been developed to bring coherence to and build upon the multitude of practices that are already in place in schools to promote well-being. They emphasise the need to integrate all elements by using a coordinated whole-school approach in the promotion of positive mental health. This involves building and integrating school self-evaluation processes, implementing the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, developing the whole-school guidance plan, adopting the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support, and building effective inter-agency relationships. Support for schools will be integrated into existing CPD work plans for the SPHE support service and will be coordinated nationally in collaboration with NEPS and HSE to ensure a streamlined approach. Copies of the Guidelines have been circulated to schools authorities.<\/p><p>  In addition in the same period I had published, along with my colleague, Minister Fitzgerald, an Action Plan on Bullying which sets out twelve actions to help prevent and tackle bullying in primary and second level schools. I have ring-fenced &euro;500,000 to support implementation of these actions this year.  Officials from my Department have already commenced work on the implementation of the actions. In particular, an awareness raising initiative on cyber bullying targeted at young people is already underway and my Department is supporting the Stand Up! Awareness Week Against Homophobic &amp;amp; Transphobic Bullying in second level schools which took place in March.<\/p><p>  Work has also commenced on developing new anti-bullying procedures for schools in consultation with the school management bodies, teacher unions and national parents councils. These new procedures are due to issue to schools for the start of the next school year. Preliminary work has commenced on other aspects of the Action Plan on Bullying. Implementation will continue in the coming months.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Framework for Junior Cycle, published in October 2012, is underpinned by 8 principles one of which is &quot;Wellbeing&quot;, Through Wellbeing &quot;the student experience will contribute directly to their physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing and resilience. Learning takes place in a climate focused on collective wellbeing of school, community and society&quot;. The Framework contains 24 Statements of Learning which students should experience. One of these statements aims to ensure that the student &quot;takes action to safeguard and promote his\/her wellbeing and that of others&quot;. <\/p><p>  In addition, there are six key skills required for successful learning by students across the curriculum and for learning beyond school. One of the six key skills of Junior Cycle is &quot;Staying Well&quot;.  As part of the revised Junior Cycle, short courses are being prepared by the NCCA not only in PE but also in SPHE and will be available for schools from September 2014. These courses may be assessed as a part of the School Certificate in the new Junior Cycle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800059#WRB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Education","counter":54,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800059#WRB02250"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[25482\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800059#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of personnel in WTE terms that have been appointed to assist with implementing Aistear and Siolta at preschool level and at primary level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":56,"content":"<p>S&iacute;olta and Aistear represent a comprehensive set of national practice guidelines which support the development of quality early childhood care and education in Ireland.

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.<\/p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability\/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02\/05.  Pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability.<\/p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools.<\/p><p>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down syndrome pupils who are in the Mild General Learning Difficulty (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD.  It has not been recommended that an exception should be made for children with Down syndrome who are in the mild general learning difficulty range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.<\/p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800059#WRB03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":77,"content":"<p>Question No. 76 answered with Question No. 48.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teachers' Remuneration","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800059#WRB03950"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[25399\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800059#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the numbers of teachers working casual hours or as substitutes who are being paid a rate given to unqualified people, meaning they are paid a daily rate of &euro;115 instead of &euro;159 and where others are being paid the old salary scale instead of the revised scale approved in Autumn 2012.","asker":"984","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p>There are currently 284 substitute and casual teachers in receipt of the daily unqualified rate of &euro;115.

In light of the difficult economic situation and the significant costs involved, the previous Government deferred the full implementation of EPSEN.  The National Council for Special Education had suggested that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235 million per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.  My Department's view is that the level of investment required would now be greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report.  Given the costs involved and current fiscal constraints, addressing this issue will be very challenging.  I will consider how we can develop a plan to implement the objectives of the EPSEN Act to deliver improved educational outcomes for students with special needs.  Last year, my Department asked the NCSE to provide policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs.  This advice will guide the preparation of a plan on how aspects of EPSEN can be implemented, including the prioritising of access to children with special needs to an individual education plan.<\/p><p><br \/>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published.

While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has made a number of recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.

In the Restricted procedure, there is an intermediary qualification stage during which the numbers of applicants is reduced (or restricted) to a specified amount (normally 10). The criteria for suitability assessment, which are taken from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Capital Management Works Framework, include company turnover, insurances, capacity to obtain a bond, personnel for the project, previous experience, and Health and Safety competence.

Job destruction figures peaked at 512,000 when 2009 was compared with 2008 before dropping back sharply in 2010.<\/p><p><b>Table 1 Job creation and job destruction figures for the business economy, manufacturing and the services sectors 2006 -2010<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th> -<\/th><th>2006<\/th><th>2007<\/th><th>2008<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Business economy excluding activities of holding companies (NACE Rev. 2 Sectors B to N, excluding code 642)<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobs as measured by employment records (Number)<\/td><td>1,971,797<\/td><td>2,118,610<\/td><td>1,986,684<\/td><td>1,645,874<\/td><td>1,539,894<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Job creation (Number)<\/td><td>353,614<\/td><td>375,167<\/td><td>217,819<\/td><td>168,725<\/td><td>184,176<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Job destruction (Number)<\/td><td>198,209<\/td><td>228,356<\/td><td>349,745<\/td><td>511,855<\/td><td>290,785<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Industry (NACE Rev. 2 Sector B-E)<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobs as measured by employment records (Number)<\/td><td>309,351<\/td><td>317,276<\/td><td>300,694<\/td><td>255,709<\/td><td>230,430<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Job creation (Number)<\/td><td>34,591<\/td><td>35,355<\/td><td>20,861<\/td><td>19,173<\/td><td>18,619<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Job destruction (Number)<\/td><td>22,508<\/td><td>27,430<\/td><td>37,443<\/td><td>59,151<\/td><td>33,869<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Manufacturing (NACE Rev. 2 Sector C)<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobs as measured by employment records (Number)<\/td><td>279,919<\/td><td>285,944<\/td><td>269,392<\/td><td>226,714<\/td><td>203,879<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Job creation (Number)<\/td><td>31,375<\/td><td>31,976<\/td><td>18,136<\/td><td>17,020<\/td><td>16,977<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Job destruction (Number)<\/td><td>20,496<\/td><td>25,951<\/td><td>34,688<\/td><td>54,998<\/td><td>29,992<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Business economy services excluding activities of holding companies (NACE Rev. 2 Sectors G to N, excluding code 642)<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobs as measured by employment records (Number)<\/td><td>1,385,776<\/td><td>1,517,830<\/td><td>1,457,442<\/td><td>1,242,994<\/td><td>1,198,526<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Job creation (Number)<\/td><td>248,919<\/td><td>280,460<\/td><td>167,094<\/td><td>135,706<\/td><td>149,023<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Job destruction (Number)<\/td><td>139,528<\/td><td>148,406<\/td><td>227,482<\/td><td>358,296<\/td><td>206,309<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Source: Job Churn statistics, Central Statistics Office<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>Detailed breakdowns are available at: <i>http:\/\/cso.ie\/shorturl.aspx\/102<\/i><\/p><p>Methodological notes are available at: <i>http:\/\/cso.ie\/shorturl.aspx\/101<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800062#WRE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Policy","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800062#WRE02050"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[25282\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800062#WRE02100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of submissions received by his Department in relation to the recent call for submissions concerning the policy statement on economic regulation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[25283\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800062#WRE02200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the submissions received by his Department in relation to the recent call for submissions concerning the Government policy statement on economic regulation will be published on his Department&rsquo;s website; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[25284\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800062#WRE02300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if the Annual Regulatory Forum has met since June 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 to 123, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  My Department recently conducted a public consultation on the proposed Government Statement on Economic Regulation.

Indeed, I think it would be fair to say that Ireland, for many years, has been a leader on hunger and nutrition even before the issue gained more recent interest.  Irish Aid is committed to building further on the 2008 Hunger Task Force Report, the framework which continues to guide Ireland&rsquo;s response to addressing global hunger and under-nutrition, and its priority areas of focus, in particular targeting under-nutrition in mothers and children.     <\/p><p>  With under-nutrition causing the deaths of an estimated 3 million children every year, and 165 million children under five years of age suffering from stunting and lacking the nutrients they need to develop their full potential, Irish Aid has strengthened its nutrition response in recent years.  Since its inception in 2010, Ireland has been a strong supporter of the Scaling Up Nutrition movement, a global movement which brings together different development partners to tackle under-nutrition, especially maternal, infant and child under-nutrition.  <\/p><p>  We are supporting a wide range of specific nutrition interventions and programmes in Irish Aid partner countries with a particular focus on preventing stunting in early childhood by targeting the 1,000 day window of opportunity (from pregnancy to the age of two).  We work with partners to improve infant and young child feeding practices in Tanzania and Sierra Leone and promote exclusive breastfeeding for infants up to six months of age.  We are supporting a number of micronutrient supplementation programmes which deliver essential vitamins and minerals to poor households with young children through providing capsules, micronutrient powders and food sprinkles.  We are also supporting national programmes in Mozambique, Malawi and Ethiopia to fortify food staples such as flour, sugar and salt with essential vitamins and minerals.  <\/p><p>  Vitamin A deficiency is the number one cause of childhood blindness and also greatly compromises the immune system.  In Malawi, Mozambique and Ethiopia we are working with partners to address high Vitamin A deficiency rates through the growing of nutritious, and vitamin A enriched, orange fleshed varieties of sweet potato.  In Tanzania we are working with partners to improve nutrition through enhancing homestead production of nutrient rich foods.  We are working with partners in Lesotho on a keyhole gardens programme in which poor households can grow micro-nutrient rich vegetables all year-round. <\/p><p>  We have delivered on our target of directing twenty per cent of the Irish Aid budget on hunger reduction.

In 2011 a mandate for a UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran was created by the Human Rights Council.  According to the Special Rapporteur&rsquo;s report of February 2013 there continue to be widespread and systematic violations of human rights in Iran.  His report presents in detail a situation in which civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are undermined and violated both in law and practice.  Moreover, a lack of Government investigation and redress generally fosters a culture of impunity, further weakening the impact of the international human rights instruments which Iran has ratified.<\/p><p>  The Special Rapporteur has sought to visit Iran in order to engage in dialogue and further investigate allegations of human rights violations.  However, the Iranian government has not yet granted him access.  Representatives of my Department met with the Special Rapporteur in March of this year and discussed his concerns.  Ireland and the EU strongly supported the extension of his mandate at the Human Rights Council and will continue to push for his being allowed access to Iran.<\/p><p>  The EU is also very concerned by the deterioration of Iran's human rights situation, even more so since the crackdown which followed the 2009 presidential elections.  In response to the worsening human rights situation, the EU in 2011 agreed sanctions &ndash; including a travel ban and asset freeze &ndash; against certain named people complicit in or responsible for grave human rights violations in Iran.  EU High Representative Ashton has made a number of statements regarding specific human rights cases in Iran, most recently in January and February of this year.

We are emphasising the need to comprehensively address the root causes of food and nutrition insecurity and the underlying vulnerabilities affecting poor people.  We are stressing the need for the EU and its Member States to increase support for longer-term programmes which assist partner countries to anticipate, prevent, prepare for and manage food and other crises.  We are asking the EU to recognise the importance of addressing vulnerability in a joined up, multi-sectoral way by linking relief and development through a strong partnership approach and to manage risk rather than simply react to it.  <\/p><p>  Ultimately, better development and risk reduction can reduce the need for emergency relief and better relief can contribute to sustainable development.  Investing in resilience today through humanitarian and development assistance is also much more cost effective than responding to a crisis tomorrow.

The dimensions of the crisis are truly daunting.  An estimated 80,000 people have lost their lives; one-third of Syrians have either fled the country, are internally displaced or are otherwise in need of assistance; and there is an ever increasing threat to regional stability as mirrored by escalating tensions and violence in northern Lebanon and the recent horrific bombing in Reyhanli, southern Turkey in which fifty one people died.  Since his appointment in August 2012 and in extremely challenging circumstances, the UN\/League of Arab States Special Envoy Ladkhar Brahimi has shown great resolve in working to achieve these objectives.  Ireland and its EU partners have expressed full support for his efforts, notably his search for a formula for transition based on last year&rsquo;s Geneva Communiqu&eacute; and providing for a transitional Government leading to free elections in Syria.<\/p><p>  Special Envoy Brahimi has also long insisted on the crucial role of the international community in seeking a political settlement to the crisis, in particular through the UN Security Council. It is a source of great regret that the UN Security Council up to now has been unable to demonstrate leadership to the international community and adopt a strong Resolution on the crisis. Despite a number of unsuccessful efforts to agree a Resolution, it remains clear that only a united Council acting in concert can provide the necessary strong political backing to underpin any current peace efforts.<\/p><p>  For this reason, I warmly welcome the agreement reached by the US and Russia, following bilateral discussions in Moscow earlier this month involving Secretary of State Kerry, President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov, to work together on an International Conference on Syria which would be held in Geneva in the next few weeks.  Both UN Secretary General Ban and Special Envoy Brahimi have welcomed this development. The EU has also pledged its full political support for the US\/Russian initiative. Conclusions adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council on 27 May which I attended made clear that the EU would spare no effort in helping to create the appropriate conditions for a successful convening of this conference.<\/p><p>  There is an onus on all sides involved with this crisis to do all possible to support the planned Geneva II conference and endure a successful outcome. I understand the Syrian Government has now agreed in principle to attend the talks and it is to be hoped that the Syrian democratic opposition, led by the Syrian National Coalition, will seize the opportunity offered by the US-Russia proposal and engage fully in a process of dialogue aimed at ending the violence and starting the much needed transition towards democratic rule in Syria.<\/p><p>  Ireland and the EU will remain fully occupied at all levels of our international engagement in securing the earliest cessation of violence in Syria and in providing the Syrian population with the aid and care they need and the hope that their nightmare will soon end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800063#WRF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":256,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[25917\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800063#WRF01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has raised with the United Nations or in other international fora the urgent need for the international community to meet its commitments regarding humanitarian aid for Syria and that particular region; the level of humanitarian aid that has been provided to that region in relation to commitments made by the international community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":257,"content":"<p>At present, a total of 6.8 million people require immediate humanitarian assistance inside Syria. There are over 4 million Syrians who have been internally displaced, while a further 1.5 million people have been forced to abandon their country altogether. Countries hosting refugees, such as Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon, are under great pressure as the influx continues. There are also grave concerns that the spread of disease could have catastrophic consequences as temperatures rise in the coming months.  Ireland has already provided over &euro;8.15 million in assistance to Syria and the wider region, making us one of the most generous donors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis. This support from the Irish people has been provided through credible partners such as WFP, UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). <\/p><p>  As one of the founding members of the Good Humanitarian Donorship (GHD) initiative, Ireland is committed to acting as a responsible and accountable donor. We are also committed to the implementation of the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid, which articulates the EU and its Member States&rsquo; commitment to ensuring that humanitarian aid pledges are met in a timely manner and are clearly linked to the needs of those most affected.  <\/p><p>  As part of our overall total support to the Syria crisis response, I pledged &euro;4.7 million at the High-Level International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria in January 2013. Since I made that commitment, Ireland has already surpassed it, with funding of &euro;5.7 million having been provided to date this year.  The UN plans for the humanitarian situation in Syria and its neighbouring countries requested a total of &euro;1.5 billion. The pledges at the International Pledging Conference reached this amount but regrettably the international community has only provided funding valued at just over 70% of the pledged commitments to date. We are doing all we can to ensure that other States follow our example in meeting their promises in full and without delay. <\/p><p>  During my visit to al-Zaatari refugee camp in northern Jordan in 2012 and the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s visit to Nizip refugee camp in southern Turkey in April this year, we both drew attention to the plight of Syrians and the urgency for global action to address their needs. As Presidency of the Council of European Union during the first half of 2013, we have also underlined the gravity of the humanitarian situation, including at the informal meeting of the Working Party on Humanitarian Aid and Food Aid (COHAFA) held in Dublin last month. We have also highlighted the dire humanitarian situation and the need for further donor support at the &lsquo;Friends of Syria&rsquo; conferences in Paris, Tunis, Istanbul and Marrakesh and the &lsquo;Syria Humanitarian Forum&rsquo; discussions in Geneva. When I meet Valerie Amos (Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator) in New York next week, I will raise this very serious humanitarian situation and discuss with her how we can all work together to achieve an effective humanitarian response.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, humanitarian needs are continuing to escalate, both within Syria and in neighbouring countries. Ireland will therefore continue to use every opportunity to put a spotlight on this deteriorating situation and emphasise the imperative for all of us to fulfil promises made to assist those worse affected by this conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800063#WRF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":258,"content":"<p>Question No.139 answered with Question No.131.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800063#WRF02000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":259,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800063#WRF01950"},{"type":"question","counter":260,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[25218\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800063#WRF02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to maintain the 9% VAT rate for tourism services such as restaurant meals and hotel accommodation, beyond the end of 2013, to build on the momentum of the Gathering Ireland festival;

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they view tobacco smuggling as a very serious matter, and that combating the illegal tobacco trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for them. Their &ldquo;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco trade (2011-2013) includes a wide range of measures that are designed to identify and target those engaged in the supply or sale of illicit tobacco products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, the development of analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and within the country.<\/p><p>  There is extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.<\/p><p>  Considerable success is being achieved against both the importation of illicit tobacco products and their sale within the country. Over 95 million cigarettes and more than 5 tonnes of tobacco were seized during 2012.  In addition, there were 57 convictions for cigarette smuggling, resulting in the imposition of 26 custodial sentences, some suspended, and fines amounting to &euro;93,550.  Action against the illegal selling of cigarettes led to 75 convictions during the year, with 21 custodial sentences, some suspended, and total fines of &euro;153,050.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners assure me that they are committed to maintaining their extensive programme of action against all stages of the supply chain for illicit tobacco products, and that they will continue to make every effort to ensure that those involved in the illicit trade are brought to account before the Courts for their criminal activities.  The penalties for smuggling tobacco products are laid down in section 119 of the Finance Act 2001, and penalties for the illegal sale of unstamped tobacco products are contained in section 78 of the Finance Act 2005.<\/p><p>  Fines for tobacco offences under these acts were increased substantially in the Finance Act, 2010. On conviction following summary prosecution, under section 119 of the 2001 Act, a court may impose a fine of  &euro;5,000 and the court may also impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, instead of, or in addition to, the fine. For convictions following prosecution on indictment, the fine is an amount not exceeding &euro;126,970 or, where the value of the tobacco products involved in the offence is greater than &euro;250,000, not exceeding three times the value of the products. The Court may also impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, as an alternative to, or in addition to the fine.<\/p><p>  In the case of a conviction under section 78 of the 2005 Act following a summary prosecution, a court may impose a fine of &euro;5,000, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both. The penalty following conviction on indictment is a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or both a fine and a prison term.  The specific penalty to be imposed in any particular case is a matter for the courts. Section 130(2) of the 2001 Act permits a trial judge, in his or her discretion, to mitigate a fine incurred for an offence under excise law, provided that the amount mitigated is not greater than 50 per cent of the amount of the fine.

The grouping of properties into bands for property taxation purposes was also recommended by the 1982 and 2009 Commissions on Taxation.  Grouping properties into valuation bands, with the rate applying at the mid-point of the bands - in effect creating fixed sum and certain charges for each band - can ease the valuation challenges.  In devising the bands, a balance should be struck between the width of the bands and avoiding substantial liability differences between adjacent bands.  The bands used for the LPT are much narrower than those suggested by the 2009 Commission on Taxation.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is unavoidable that some individuals will benefit or lose no matter what bands are chosen, and narrower bands would make it more difficult for taxpayers to decide the correct band for their property.  As the Deputy states, if the current first band of &euro;0 to &euro;100,000 was replaced by two &euro;50,000 bands, this would lead to lower LPT payments for owners of properties valued below &euro;50,000, which would pay tax at &euro;45 in a full year (0.18% of &euro;25,000, the mid point between &euro;0 and &euro;50,000).  However, it would lead to higher LPT payments for properties valued between &euro;50,001 and &euro;100,000, which would pay tax of &euro;135 in full year (0.18% of &euro;75,000), rather than the current charge for all properties valued between &euro;0 and &euro;100,000 of &euro;90 in a full year (0.18% of &euro;50,000).

As the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, numerous other Ministers, and I have explained already, there is no special tax rate deal done with any company. The Irish tax system is statute-based and therefore there is no possibility of special tax rate deals being done with companies. All companies in Ireland pay the standard 12.5% rate on their trading profits arising in Ireland.  All companies here pay a corporation tax rate of 25% on their non trading income, and chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%. These rates are set down in statute law and are not open to negotiation with taxpayers.<\/p><p>  I am advised that Revenue, as a matter of course, engages with taxpayers, including multi-national companies, in order to provide clarity as to the application of Irish tax law. The objective is to ensure that the correct Irish tax is paid by these companies at the correct time and in accordance with Irish law.<\/p><p>  In relation specifically to the question of any approaches or representations to me by any parties to request the &ldquo;special tax treatment&rdquo;, I would emphasise again that there is no possibility of &ldquo;special tax treatment&rdquo; for any taxpayer outside of what is provided for in legislation.  Having said that, of course the Deputies are aware that during the budgetary process each year the Department engages with all stakeholders as part of the consultation process and the Department receives a wide variety of submissions from interested parties.<\/p><p>  In relation to the issue of tax incentives that were generally available to all companies in the 1980s, I would refer the Deputy to the scheme of relief from corporation tax provided for in Part IV of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976 (Export Sales Relief) which expired on 5 April 1990. That relief provided for a reduction to nil of the corporation tax on profits from the export of goods manufactured in the State.<\/p><p>  Export Sales Relief was withdrawn on a phased basis from 1980 to 1991 and was effectively replaced with a relief provided for in Chapter VI of the 1980 Finance Act (Manufacturing Relief), which provided for a reduction of the corporation tax to a rate of 10% on profits from the sale of goods manufactured in the State.  Manufacturing Relief expired on 31st December 2010.  The manufacturing scheme of relief was extended to activities carried out in the IFSC and ancillary services located in the Customs House Docks Area and to activities carried on in the Shannon Airport Area. Relief for these activities expired on 31 December 2005.<\/p><p>  I would reiterate that all companies resident in Ireland are now chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities in Ireland.  A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits. Chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800063#WRF03800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":291,"content":"<p>Question No. 151 answered with Question No. 140.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Laundering","counter":293,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800064#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":294,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[25233\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800064#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons who have received a custodial sentence in the past ten years for illegal fuel smuggling activity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":295,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there were 12 convictions in the last 10 years, for offences related to the illicit trade in mineral oils, including smuggling, in respect of which custodial sentences were imposed by the Courts.

For example, if a double taxation treaty provided that the rate of withholding tax on royalties was 0% - and this is the case in some 30 (out of 69) of Ireland&rsquo;s signed treaties - then that zero rate would apply, because treaties have precedence over domestic law.<\/p><p>  Similarly, some 22 of Ireland&rsquo;s double taxation treaties provide for nil withholding taxes on dividends, and approximately 30 more provide for a rate of 5% for companies (subject to an ownership criterion being met) - these are the maximum rates that would apply, regardless of the rate inserted in domestic law. <\/p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the available data on royalties is not sufficiently detailed or precise to ascertain the revenue that could arise to the Exchequer if the changes mentioned in the question were made  In relation to the revenue that could be raised for the Exchequer if withholding tax were applied to dividends paid to treaty countries, it is not possible to separately identify from tax records the amount of dividends that are paid to treaty countries and therefore the information requested by the Deputy cannot be ascertained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800064#WRG01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Loan Offers","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800064#WRG01250"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[25296\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800064#WRG01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will set out by region\/country the percentage amount and individual monetary amounts of finance forwarded by National Assets Management Agency to developers to complete projects in 2012 and to date in 2013.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>I am advised by NAMA that the information referenced by the Deputy is available in the following format only &ndash; from inception to end-April 2013, NAMA advises that it had approved &euro;1.8 billion in new loan advances to debtors, &euro;1.1 billion of which had been completed or drawn down.

Revenue regards it as a strategic priority to make it easier and less costly for taxpayers to comply with their obligations.  Along with other public service organisations, Revenue is obliged to regularly review the manner in which service is delivered to ensure the best mix of effectiveness and economy.  As part of that process, procedures in the Limerick, Cork and Tralee offices have changed since the beginning of 2013.  Up to that point, taxpayers could have certain tax matters fully dealt with, and have their forms processed instantly at the public counter.  While this was an excellent service, it had a number of problems, including the difficulty of ensuring proper management of workflow.  Processing at the counter ceased from January 2013.  Taxpayers now receive a full service in terms of information and guidance, including detailed guidance on use of our on-line services.  The public areas also have facilities for completion of forms and for self-service on computers provided for the purpose, with assistance if needed.  Any forms or other documents are received for later processing and responses sent out by post or on-line as appropriate.<\/p><p>  The number of callers per day has not fallen as a result of the changes implemented.

The Central Bank first published the CCMA in February 2009.  It set out rules for lenders when dealing with borrowers in arrears with their mortgage payments.  The current CCMA, which came into effect on 1 January 2011, took account of the recommendations of the Government Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and further strengthened protections for borrowers in mortgage repayment difficulty by setting out the mortgage arrears resolution process (MARP). <\/p><p><br \/>  The MARP is a five-step process which requires lenders to: 1) communicate with borrowers; 2) obtain financial information using a standard financial statement (SFS); 3) complete an assessment of the borrowers case; 4) consider options to resolve the arrears; 5) consider appeals.

Since 1999, section 23A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 added rules which provide that certain companies incorporated in the State are to be regarded as being resident in the State for tax purposes.  These provisions were introduced into the Taxes Consolidation Act, by section 82 of the Finance Act 1999 which was enacted on 25 March 1999.  They were part of a package of measures considered necessary to deal with the issue of Irish registered companies which, while registered in Ireland, had no contact or association with the State following their registration.  There was concern that some of these companies were engaged in fraud, money laundering, drug trafficking and other illegal activities.  As these companies were managed and controlled outside the State, they were not resident in Ireland for tax purposes under the long-standing management and control rule.<\/p><p>  Consistent with the purpose of the provisions - to address companies that were not managed and controlled in the State and had no real connection with the State apart from having been incorporated here - the 1999 additions to the residence rules provided that only Irish-incorporated companies with no other connection with the State were to be regarded as resident in the State by virtue of their incorporation here.  A company incorporated in the State is not regarded as tax-resident here where:<\/p><p>- either the company or a related company is carrying on a trade in the State and either<\/p><p>- the company is ultimately controlled in a tax treaty country or in an EU Member State or<\/p><p>- the company or a related company is quoted on a recognised stock exchange in the EU or in a tax treaty country, or <\/p><p>- the company is treated under a tax treaty as not resident in the State. <\/p><p>  While tax law is reviewed from time to time from a policy perspective, I have not commissioned the Revenue Commissioners to conduct a report on companies that are incorporated as Irish but non-resident for tax purposes.  I am informed by the Commissioners that they have considered such companies in the course of monitoring the arrangements of large cases.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of companies and the names of same that are incorporated here but non-resident for tax purposes - and numbers of any related jobs - are not available as they are not separately compiled.

The tax rates being quoted publicly this week are emphatically not the rate of tax paid by such companies - or by any company on its Irish activities.   Having examined the document produced by the US Senate Subcommittee, it appears that the rate that is being quoted is got as follows: the tax charged in Ireland on the branch activities in Ireland of companies that are not resident here is divided by the entire profit of the companies concerned as if they were resident here, which they are not.  <\/p><p>  It is clearly wrong and misleading to attribute this rate of tax to Ireland.

While conscious of the need to control expenditure, I have been generally supportive of the cases made by Revenue and recognise the need to ensure that Revenue is adequately resourced to ensure the effective operation of the Revenue administration for the benefit of the Exchequer.<\/p><p><br \/>  As part of the engagement between my Department and Revenue relating to the introduction of the Local Property Tax, I supported Revenue's resource requirements, and these are set out in the Expenditure Report for 2013 and in the Revised Estimates for Public Services, 2013, for the Finance Group of Votes, which I discussed with the relevant Committee last week.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Regarding legislation, since 2009 there have been no less than eight Finance Acts, including two Finance (Local Property Tax) Acts.  Given the nature of the engagement between Revenue and my Department in preparing these Bills, it would be impossible to disaggregate with any precision all the legislative changes arose as a result of requests from the Revenue Commissioners.  However, many legislative changes have been implemented to improve the administration of the tax system and to improve compliance.  Examples include, the reform to the Relevant Contract Tax System, the introduction of a new excise licencing system for mineral oils and the modernisation of direct taxes assessing rules for self-assessment.  For completeness, I should also add that the Revenue Commissioners will, from time to time, comment through my Department on legislative proposals presented by other Ministers.  If the Deputy has something specific in mind, it may be possible to be more helpful.  <\/p><p><br \/>  I will continue to carefully consider any new legislative proposals received from the Revenue Commissioners that make it easier and less costly for taxpayers to comply and that help reduce non-compliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800065#WRH01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":374,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800065#WRH01825"},{"type":"question","counter":375,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[25549\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800065#WRH01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if persons (details supplied) completed an application form for the Central Bank of Ireland to become regulated as a retails credit firm; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":376,"content":"<p>The Central Bank has informed me that the company referred to by the Deputy holds an authorisation since 4 November 2009.

It provides for relief to be given for any tax year by way of a deduction equal to 40% of the sportsperson&rsquo;s gross earnings, before expenses, from direct participation in their sport.  The relief is given in the tax year in which the sportsperson permanently retires provided he or she is tax resident in the State for that year.  The relief can be claimed for up to any 10 years in which the sportsperson was resident in the State between the tax year 1990\/91 and the tax year in which he or she retires.  They do not have to be consecutive years.  A claim results in a sportsperson&rsquo;s tax liability for the years in question being recalculated, based on the 40% deduction and relief is given by way of a refund of tax paid.<\/p><p>  The relief was introduced for sportspersons when they permanently retire to acknowledge what they sacrificed in terms of career development and family commitments in order to train and compete at national and international level. It recognised that the majority of professional sportspersons in the State were not wealthy, and tended to have a very short earnings career that could often be cut shorter by injury.  It provides recognition of the particular challenges and difficulties they have in earning their income, the contribution that they make to the image of Ireland at home and abroad, and the enjoyment and interest for the general public that they generate by their participation and success.<\/p><p>  The relief is given when a sportsperson ceases to be permanently engaged in their sport and is withdrawn where a person recommences the sport on a professional level (although it can be maintained if the sportsperson continues to participate at amateur level).  Withdrawal is by means of an assessment for the total amount of the relief under Case IV of Schedule D in the year of assessment in which the relief was given.  There is no minimum amount that a sportsperson can earn per annum post retirement before facing a claw back of the relief and the reason for the first retirement is not a consideration in granting the relief in the first instance, nor in clawing it back if the individual returns to the sport.  The relief is given on the basis that the individual has permanently retired.<\/p><p>  Where an assessment is raised, any person who has difficulty in paying the amount due can contact the Office of the Collector-General in relation to payment options.  When the sportsperson subsequently permanently retires he or she can again avail of the relief in that year and in respect of any ten of the years from 1990\/91 in which he or she had earnings arising from participation in the sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800066#WRJ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IFSC Clearing House Group","counter":416,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800066#WRJ01150"},{"type":"question","counter":417,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[25671\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800066#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of officials who have been present at each IFSC Clearing House Group meeting since March 2011 including each working group.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":418,"content":"<p>The IFSC Clearing House Group and its four working groups operate under the aegis of the Department of an Taoiseach rather than my Department.

Through a student's experience in Junior Cycle, I want the student to be able to take actions to safeguard and promote his\/ her well - being and that of others.<\/p><p>  The Bring Me Back Alive Play is one of a range of external resources and initiatives that are available to assist schools in implementing various aspects of the curriculum. Unfortunately my Department is not in a position to endorse individual initiatives, and it is a matter for individual schools to determine which of these resources they  choose to access. My Department's advice is that schools in the first instance should implement the Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools document effectively and when considering collaborating with external agencies in doing work in the area of mental health promotion, schools should  be cognisant of Appendix 3a (DES, Circular 0023\/2010) and 3b which provide advice on best practice for Social Personal and Health Education.

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.<\/p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability\/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02\/05.  Pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability. <\/p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools.<\/p><p>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down syndrome pupils who are in the Mild General Learning Difficulty (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD.  It has not been recommended that an exception should be made for children with Down syndrome who are in the mild general learning difficulty range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.<\/p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800067#WRK03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Expenditure","counter":500,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800067#WRK03050"},{"type":"question","counter":501,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[25115\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800067#WRK03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 306 of 29 January 2013 the way his Department has justified a situation in which &euro;207,854.02 is approved in funding for a special educational unit at a school built as part of the same bundle of PPP schools while another school in that same bundle received approval for only &euro;13,500.00 for its special educational unit; if he will explain the reason the school receiving the lesser amount was directed by his Department to provide a special educational unit as part of its construction; the way the special education provision differs between each school where the second school is expected to equip its unit with one fifteenth of the money approved by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":502,"content":"<p>It is my Department's general practice to include a special needs unit (SNU) in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required.The level of funding referred to by the Deputy is in accordance with the Department's current guidelines for funding SNUs.

The minimum service requirement for probation purposes in order to secure registration with the Teaching Council was decreased from 170 days to 100 days in the 2011\/2012 school year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800067#WRK04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":518,"content":"<p>Question No. 236 answered with Question No. 215.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Appeals","counter":519,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800068#WRL00250"},{"type":"question","counter":520,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[25192\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800068#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Clare who applied for a third level education grant to Student Universal Support Ireland in 2012 will receive a decision on their grant application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"976","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":521,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department have confirmed with Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) that the student referred to by the Deputy appealed their decision.

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.<\/p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability\/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02\/05.<\/p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability. <\/p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools. <\/p><p>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down syndrome pupils who are in the Mild General Learning Difficulty (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD. <\/p><p>  It has not been recommended that an exception should be made for children with Down syndrome who are in the mild general learning difficulty range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs. <\/p><p>  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report. In making any changes to our supports for children with special needs consultation will be a key aspect in the implementation of any recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800068#WRL02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bullying in Schools","counter":559,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800068#WRL02950"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[25414\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800068#WRL03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will consider incorporating literature (details supplied) related to bullying in the revised junior certificate syllabus; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"997","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":561,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, I published an Action Plan on Bullying in January last.

The school in question was established to become a fully vertical school that would grow incrementally each year and develop naturally over time to become a 16 mainstream teacher school. The school was recognised to be one of a number of primary schools that would meet the current and future needs in the area. The granting of recognition by my Department was on that understanding and this position has not changed.  On this basis, the school would be expected to enrol a maximum of two Junior Infant classes annually and to fill its 16-classrooms on an incremental basis each year, culminating ultimately in two classes of each stream up to sixth standard.<\/p><p>  My Department has previously communicated its views to this effect to both the Board of Management and Patron.

With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is provided by my Department to the Secondary Education Committee (SEC), an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools. The SEC then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos.

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing process for the 2013\/14 school year at individual school level is currently underway. The allocation processes at both primary and post primary level also include an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The appeal procedures are set out in the annual staffing arrangements. The final staffing position for all schools will not be known until later in the year when the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800070#WRN02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Patronage","counter":674,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800070#WRN02750"},{"type":"question","counter":675,"qnumday":292,"qnumall":"[25767\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800070#WRN02800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the concerns of the authorities of a number of smaller, mostly rural denominational schools regarding their future; if he will ensure that all such schools needs and traditions are carefully examined and assessed with a view to addressing issues of their concern; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":676,"content":"<p>My attention has been drawn to the concerns of the authorities of the smaller, rural denominational schools regarding their future.

My Department funds the provision of over 430,000 part-time and full-time places across the further and higher education and training sectors, all of which are open to young people under 25 years of age. This provision includes the recently developed and flexible re-skilling opportunities specifically for unemployed people in areas of emerging skills needs under Momentum initiatives. The introduction of the MOMENTUM programme will have a specific impact on young unemployed people. It is to provide a range of quality, relevant education and training interventions for up to 6,500 individuals who are long-term unemployed. Training will be provided within the context of four themes all of which are open to under 25 year olds. One of these themes will focus on the specific needs of people under 25 and 800 places are being made available specifically for this.<\/p><p>  For early school leavers, my Department funds 6,000 places under the Youthreach programme. The programme provides participants with two years integrated education, training and work experience which facilitates early school leavers with opportunities to acquire certification and progress to further education, training or employment.

Learners who are under 25 will be paid an allowance of &euro;160 per week, which is higher than the Jobseekers Allowance rates of &euro;100 for those aged 18 to 21 and &euro;144 for those aged 22 to 24.

There is a very serious disturbance in the economy and a serious crisis in revenue.  Ireland is availing of financial assistance programmes provided by the IMF and the EU and has undertaken to meet spending targets in that regard.  <\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy will be aware, the then Government decided in 2010, in light of the  national budgetary position, that retired public service pensioners should make a contribution to the overall required fiscal adjustment, by way of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR).  This decision was taken having regard to the gap between the burden being borne by those currently in public service employment (where the pension related deduction (PRD) and pay reduction have impacted) and their retired counterparts.  <font color=\"#104160\">This<\/font> Government's intention to require a further contribution to the fiscal consolidation effort from Public Service pensioners with pensions in excess of &euro;32,500, is one element in the wider plan to restore stability to the public finances. The scale of consolidation required can only be achieved with a contribution from all of the main components of public expenditure.  None of the measures were or are being done lightly but are considered necessary in view of the wide gap between our revenues and our expenditure, and in view also of our commitment to restore order to the public finances by reducing the general Government deficit to less than 3%  by 2015.<\/p><p><br \/>  Any reduction in pension payments is, of course, a serious step. However, the grave condition of the public finances and the threat to Ireland's economic wellbeing provide the context for such exceptional measures.  I would note, for the Deputy's information  that the first &euro;12,000 of pension is exempt from the PSPR, and that the bands and rates of the PSPR are progressively structured so that persons on lower pensions are proportionately less affected than those on higher pensions. The additional reductions planned for 1 July 2013  will be confined to pensions in payment greater than &euro;32,500 only.  As I indicated to the Alliance of Retired Public Servants when I met with them yesterday, I hope to move towards reducing the burden of the public service pension reduction when economic progress permits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800071#WRO01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works Properties","counter":712,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800071#WRO01350"},{"type":"question","counter":713,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[25230\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800071#WRO01400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if there is a ban on making Office of Public Works sites available for commercial use where it would bring revenue into a local area and promote the local region; if he will re-consider this in the context of a site (details supplied) in County Donegal","asker":"996","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":714,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) has given permission for the use of Grianan of Aileach, the site in question, for many events including filming by BBC Northern Ireland in 2006.

To date, rationalisation and amalgamation measures involving 25 bodies have been fully implemented, and measures involving a further 83 bodies are at advanced legislative or administrative stages.  Further measures, involving 107 bodies, were identified under a critical review process undertaken in 2012 as part of the Public Service Reform Plan.  The majority of these measures will be implemented in 2013.<\/p><p>On the issue of savings, the Public Service Reform Plan aimed to secure &euro;20 million in enhanced service efficiencies and value-for-money from the rationalisation programme, a target which will be achieved.  The bulk of the savings are derived from a reduction in the number of public servants working in the merged entities.<\/p><p>From the outset we have maintained that the lasting and most important benefit from the rationalisation of State Bodies will be a less crowded administrative landscape resulting in greater democratic accountability, less duplication of effort and clearer lines of responsibility for the citizen.  Moreover, the rationalisation programme needs to be understood as just one of a package of reform measures that will allow for the continued delivery of critical services against the backdrop of public service numbers. There will of course be other cash savings realised over time as organisations, financial systems, office accommodation etc. are rationalised into leaner, more coherent structures.  These savings, some of which will be once-off, will be factored into the overall budgetary framework as they arise.<\/p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding the number of State Bodies that still exist, as I have stated before in previous PQs, there are three broad categories of State Bodies.  Firstly, there are a number of Offices of State which typically are staffed by Civil Servants and have their own Vote for the allocation of public monies and which are within a Vote Group. A list of these bodies is set out in Appendix 1.<\/p><p>Secondly there are non-commercial State Bodies who are usually staffed by Public Servants and funded (or part funded) through a grant-in-aid from their parent Department. Details of such bodies are set out in the Detailed Expenditure Information on Non-Commercial State Agencies included in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2013, which can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at: <i>http:\/\/per.gov.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/REVISED-ESTIMATES-VOLUME-2013-final.pdf<\/i>.<\/p><p>Beyond that within each Department there are many other executive offices, divisions and directorates, operational or consultative groupings, task groups or forums that exist for various purposes that might or might not meet the definition of &lsquo;entity&rsquo;.  Many of these groups are transient in nature in response to the needs and business pressures of particular Departments and sectors and details of which would not be held centrally.

My Department has received that advice.  The matter at issue was whether early application of the Directive&rsquo;s provisions was permissible having regard to the wording of the Directive&rsquo;s transposition provision and the constitutional and legislative provisions governing the implementation of European Union legislation in Ireland.  Article 28 (Transposition) of the Consumer Rights Directive requires Member States to adopt the laws or regulations necessary to comply with the Directive by 13 December 2013, and to apply those laws or regulations from 13 June 2014. <\/p><p>  The legal advice available to me states largely that early application and enforcement of the directive by way of secondary legislation could be successfully challenged under domestic constitutional law.  It noted among other things that Article 29.4.10 of the Constitution provides blanket constitutional immunity for all measures &lsquo;necessitated&rsquo; by our membership of the European Union. In view of the wording of the transposition provision at Article 28 of the Directive, however, it was open to question whether the application of the Directive&rsquo;s provisions prior to the date specified in the Directive could be said to be &lsquo;necessitated&rsquo; by the obligations of European Union membership.  While there was no obstacle to early adoption of the Directive&rsquo;s provisions by means of statutory instrument, the application and enforcement of those provisions before June 2014 by secondary legislation could be successfully challenged in the courts. <\/p><p>  Accordingly I have reluctantly decided not to proceed with the early implementation of these Articles.  It would not be in the interest of consumer protection to have court proceedings arising from the enforcement of these Articles fail on a matter relating to the timing of that enforcement rather than on the substance of the case.  Articles 19 and 22 will accordingly be given effect in Regulations to be enacted by December 2013 and to be applied from June 2014.  These Regulations will also give effect to the other provisions of the Directive.  My Department has drawn the European Commission&rsquo;s attention to the difficulties caused by the particular form of wording used for the transposition provision at Article 28 of the Directive with a view to ensuring that a similar difficulty will not arise with future European Union consumer protection legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800072#WRP01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Aid Guidelines","counter":766,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800072#WRP01150"},{"type":"question","counter":767,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[25601\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800072#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"when he expects the EU Commission Directorate-General for Competition to publish the new Regional Aid Guidelines 2014-2020; and the extent to which he has participated in the recent public consultation process.","asker":"1091","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":768,"content":"<p>As part of a State Aid Modernisation initiative currently being undertaken by the EU Commission a number of instruments are being reviewed in parallel, including, in particular, Guidelines on Regional Aid, Environmental Aid, Risk Capital, Research Development and Innovation, Broadband Guidelines and Aviation Guidelines.

The major elements of the Government's response to targeting activation places and opportunities as set out in the Pathways to Work policy is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created are filled by people from the Live Register, with a particular focus on those who are long term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government will spend more than &euro;1 billion this year on supporting over 85,000 job placements, work experience and Back to Education beneficiaries, including through the &#8220;<i>JobBridge&#8221;<\/i>   internship programme.

There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance\/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies and include:<\/p><p>  - The Youthreach programme providing 6,000 integrated education, training and work experience for early school leavers without any qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age;<\/p><p>  - The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme scheme, which provides a range of courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people over 21 years of age, particularly focusing upon early school leavers;<\/p><p>  - The Back to Education Allowance scheme run by the Department of Social Protection provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated on this scheme in the last academic year;<\/p><p>  - Approximately 12,000 persons aged under 25 completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2012. This excludes apprenticeships and evening courses;<\/p><p>  - This year MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions, which is part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs initiative, is currently being rolled out by the Department of Education.  MOMENTUM will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 long term jobseekers to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors.  Over 1,250 of these places are assigned specifically for under 25s;<\/p><p>  - The JobBridge National Internship Scheme is focused on providing work experience to young people with the total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 at 2,700;<\/p><p>  - Long-term unemployed youth will also benefit from the JobsPlus initiative which is designed to encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. Under this scheme the State will pay circa &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the employer to recruit a person from the Live Register;<\/p><p>  - In the December Budget, funding was secured for an additional 10,000 places this year across a range of programmes -- including JobBridge, T&Uacute;S and Community Employment. About a quarter of these places are expected to be taken up by unemployed young people. <\/p><p>  With regard to targets, the original Action Plan for Jobs sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people. In this context, the Department of Finance anticipates that the overall unemployment rate will fall from 14.7% in 2012 to 12.3% in 2016.  This could be expected to see youth unemployment fall from over 30% in 2012 to 24% or less in 2016. <\/p><p>  In addition, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 includes the Pathways to Work initiative&rsquo;s targets for increasing the number of people who are long-term unemployed moving into employment and reducing the average length of time spent on the Live Register.  Specifically, these targets are that:<\/p><p>  (i) at least 75,000 of long-term unemployed people will move into employment by 2015 (starting 2012). <\/p><p>  (ii) Increase the exit rate of people on the  live register  for two years or more by 50%  (to 40%)  by the end of 2015 <\/p><p>  (iii) Reduce the persistence rate (the rate at which short term unemployed people become long term unemployed)  to 25%. <\/p><p>As two out of five young unemployed are long-term unemployed, these targets are pertinent to young people. <\/p><p>  A new recruitment incentive &ndash; JobsPlus &ndash; has also been developed by my Department and was approved by the Government as part of the Action Plan for Jobs.  This incentive will cover the cost of c. &euro;1 in every &euro;4 of an employer&rsquo;s wage costs and will be launched for availability by July 2013.  Young people are likely to be major beneficiaries of this initiative as employers tend to hire young people when there is a recovery in employment.<\/p><p>  Following from the formal adoption of the EU Recommendation on Implementing a Youth Guarantee, the Government will review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.<\/p><p>  The scale and nature of the measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012 was at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  <\/p><p>  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will almost certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education, training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment. It is to be hoped that any measures taken by government in relation to the implementation of the youth guarantee will see youth unemployment fall even further than is already anticipated on the basis of existing policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800073#WRQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Eligibility","counter":814,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800073#WRQ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":815,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[26280\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800073#WRQ00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason, in view of the work the Government is carrying out on suicide prevention, genuine cases of suicidal ideation combined with severe depression, certified by healthcare professionals - are not accepted by her Department as grounds for disability\/invalidity payments when such refusals may exacerbate the situation; her plans to address this situation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":816,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[25063\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800073#WRQ00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason, in view of the work the Government is carrying out on suicide prevention, genuine cases of suicidal ideation combined with severe depression, certified by health care professionals, are not accepted by her Department as grounds for disability\/invalidity payments when such refusals may exacerbate the situation; the plans she has to address this situation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":817,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 345 and 347 together.<\/p><p>  Applications for Disability\/Invalidity schemes are medically assessed by Medical Assessors in my Department who are fully qualified and experienced practitioners.

These medical assessments involve comprehensive examination of the person&rsquo;s medical history and clinical evaluation from the client&rsquo;s own primary healthcare provider (GP) and all available current medical evidence. They also involve a review of any investigation results and specialist\/consultant reports.  Cases which relate to conditions of mental disability, including suicidal ideation and depression, are accepted as medical evidence and considered in arriving at decisions for these schemes. The assessment is made in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s evidence-based medical guidelines and protocols which include as key indicators suicidal ideation and depression. All medical evidence is taken into consideration and no medical evidence is ever discounted. <\/p><p>  There are currently twenty two Medical Assessors, including the Chief Medical Advisor and Deputy Chief Medical Advisor, who conduct medical assessments across a wide range of the Department's schemes.  Of these, six have post-graduate qualifications in the area of mental health, such as MRCPsych and Dip. Clinical Psychiatry.  They also have extensive clinical training and experience in psychiatry together with membership of recognised professional bodies such as the Royal College of Psychiatrists London and the College of Psychiatry Ireland. The Medical Assessors have an on-going commitment to continuing medical education to ensure that standards are maintained and enhanced. This includes working in a collegiate way to ensure that best practice and professional expertise is shared and applied across all of the cases that are reviewed by them.  Daily case conference meetings are held and a medical research unit has been established to actively engage in the update of the body of medical knowledge and evidence based practice.  Furthermore, as a result of a recent recruitment campaign for Medical Assessors, seven were recruited of whom two have mental health qualifications - MRCPsych.  Further recruitment of Medical Assessors is underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800073#WRQ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Benefit Appeals","counter":818,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800073#WRQ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":819,"qnumday":346,"qnumall":"[25038\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800073#WRQ01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an application for jobseeker's benefit in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":820,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned, was registered in that office on 14 March 2013.

The &euro;100 rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance was introduced for claimants aged under 20 in April 2009, and this rate was applied to claimants aged up to 21 from December 2009.  A rate of &euro;144 applies to claimants aged 22-24.  <\/p><p>  The measures encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis.  Where a person is in receipt of a rate of jobseeker's allowance described above and he or she participates in a course of education, training a higher rate of &euro;160 applies.  <\/p><p>  I met with Focus Ireland on 15 May, 2013 to discuss a number of issues in relation to homelessness, including the situation of young persons in receipt of reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, and officials are in on-going contact with them in relation to their concerns.  While the primary issue in this regard is a housing issue rather than one of income support, the Department of Social Protection has an important role in the delivery of solutions to homelessness. Generally, this role relates to income maintenance where homeless people have entitlements to the full range of social welfare schemes subject to the normal qualifying conditions, but the Department also engages in inter-agency responses to homelessness.  In this context, the Department will continue to engage with Focus Ireland, and other actors, in relation to issues relating to rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for persons under the age of 25.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800073#WRQ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Applications","counter":853,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800073#WRQ03450"},{"type":"question","counter":854,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[25159\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800073#WRQ03500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an application for domiciliary care allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1056","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":855,"content":"<p>An application for Domiciliary Care Allowance was received from the person concerned on the 9th May 2013.

In December 2012, there were approximately 14,400 customers in receipt of SPT.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided for changes to State pension age. From 1 January 2014,  the abolition of SPT will standardise the age for payment of a State pension to 66 years.  In addition, the age at which State pension (contributory) (SPC) will be payable will increase to 67 years from 2021 and to 68 years from 2028.<\/p><p>  The existence of the SPT is historical and relates to the qualifying age for SPC which, up until the early 1970s, was 70 years of age.  SPT (known then as the Retirement Pension) was introduced at that time to bridge the gap for employees who had to retire at 65.  The qualifying age for SPC was subsequently reduced over time to 66 years, which left SPT effective for just one year.  The abolition of SPT removes the retirement condition which acts as an incentive for people to leave the workforce and has been widely criticised as a barrier to older people remaining in employment. There is no retirement condition attached to the SPC. <\/p><p>  The sustainability of pensions in the future requires longer working.  The OECD report states in its recent Review of the Irish Pensions System states that the immediate concern for Ireland is to increase effective retirement age by encouraging longer working. This applies to those who wish to work past pension age but also, (as evidenced by the figures produced below) to those who exit the workforce early prior to reaching pension age.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the impact of the abolition of SPT in 2014, the award figures for SPT over a number of years have been analysed.  The numbers impacted demonstrate that many people leave the workforce some years before pension age, more so than might have been perceived. In addition, low numbers of people in employment are impacted by the abolition of SPT.  A person who retires from work on reaching age 65 may apply for another social welfare payment, depending on their individual circumstances.  In relation to job seekers, there are already a number of special transitioning provisions applying in the case of people who are aged between 65 and 66.  Existing legislation provides that, subject to the person having paid 156 or more qualifying contributions and satisfying the general scheme conditions, a person whose job seekers benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66. On this basis, workers who suffer a substantial loss of employment at age 65 will not be subject to the reductions in duration. <\/p><p>  In February 2012, my Department held meetings with the representative groups for older people to outline the changes to SPT and SPC. Feedback was sought from these groups and included in an information pack that was prepared to further publicise the changes to the scheme.  The finalised information pack was published in early March 2012 on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.welfare.ie and the link sent on twitter. It was also made available through the Citizens Information Board website www.citizensinformation.ie.  It was widely circulated to customer representative groups including those representing older people, working age groups, farming groups, trade unions, employer groups, accountancy bodies etc.  It was also forwarded to all members of the Oireachtas. <\/p><p>  Presentations on the introduction of these changes were also made at the Department&rsquo;s regular briefings with customer representative groups and to members of the public over the course of the year.  A further information campaign is planned to take place shortly to continue to raise awareness of the changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800074#WRR02900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Eligibility","counter":904,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800074#WRR02950"},{"type":"question","counter":905,"qnumday":376,"qnumall":"[25344\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800074#WRR03000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if graduate nurses who have not applied for the two year contract jobs offered by the Health Service Executive will continue to qualify for jobseeker's allowance in view of the requirement that qualification requires that they be genuinely seeking work; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1026","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":906,"content":"<p>Social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.

The EU target population is defined by the combination of three indicators: at-risk-of-poverty, severe material deprivation and jobless households.  As part of this process member states set national poverty targets, using appropriate national indicators, in support of the EU target. Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the Europe 2020 poverty target is to reduce by a minimum of 200,000 (4.4 per cent) the combined population in consistent poverty, at-risk-of-poverty or in basic deprivation, from the 2010 baseline of 31 per cent. Progress towards reaching the national target is set out in the national reform programme 2013 update within the broader context of reaching the national social target for poverty reduction to reduce consistent poverty to 4 per cent by 2016 and to 2 per cent or less by 2020, from the 2010 baseline rate of 6.3 per cent.  This progress is then reviewed annually as part of the EU&rsquo;s semester process.<\/p><p>  According to the 2011 results from the Survey on Income and Living Conditions, published by the Central Statistics Office, 6.9 per cent of the population are in consistent poverty, which in the words of the CSO &lsquo;is not a statistically significant change on the 2010 figure of 6.3 per cent&rsquo;.  Nonetheless, meeting the national social target and by extension the Europe 2020 targets will of course be a challenge over the remaining years of the decade.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the most vulnerable are enabled to benefit from economic recovery through activation programmes and services. Targeting policies and resources at the groups which carry the greatest burden of poverty, notably jobless households and children, will continue to be a policy priority as is reflected in the commitment to set sub-targets for these groups. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRS01100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":941,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRS01150"},{"type":"question","counter":942,"qnumday":388,"qnumall":"[25561\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRS01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the grounds on which workers, on an individual basis, can be moved from a defined benefit pension system to another system without their agreement","asker":"959","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":943,"content":"<p>Occupational pension schemes in Ireland are normally set up on a voluntary basis by a sponsoring employer.

Through the rollout of Intreo offices nationwide, the aim is to engage with every unemployed individual to make sure that their first day out of work is also their first step on the pathway back to work. <\/p><p>  Activation is defined as the engagement with customers of the Department of Social Protection, of working age, who are in receipt of specified social welfare payments\/ benefits in order to support them and their families in progressing into employment and \/ or other appropriate progression. Such engagement shall be on the basis of the articulation of the supports to be offered to the customer to assist him \/ her to return to the workforce or otherwise progress.  In accepting payment of benefit, assistance and \/ or support, the customer shall agree to avail him or herself of the appropriate support measures offered during the course of the activation process, including employment, education, training and \/ or placement in employment schemes.<\/p><p>  Under the new Intreo approach, the process of engagement starts immediately when a client registers for a Jobseeker's Allowance payment, and is informed by a personal profile captured in respect of each individual.  In the past no such profiles were captured and clients had to wait at least three months before being invited to a Group Engagement under the National Action Plan (NAP process).  <\/p><p>  As part of the registration process the client completes a profile questionnaire to enable the case worker assess the client&rsquo;s Probability of Exit (PEX) from unemployment. Depending on the outcome of this assessment the elements of further engagement with the client will vary. While all clients are referred for a group engagement session, the content of the session varies depending on the client's PEX score.  Clients with a low to mid-point PEX rating participate in Group Engagement sessions where they are provided with guidance on how to improve their job search activities and also on the training and development opportunities available to them to improve their employment prospects.  Clients with a high-PEX are invited to a Group Engagement Session tailored to their needs, including a networking component, where they are encouraged and helped to search for and secure employment.   <\/p><p>  Following the group engagement, clients with a low PEX rating are immediately referred for a one-to-one session with an Employment Services Officer, where they agree a personal progression plan.  These clients receive intensive one-to-one support from an experienced employment services advisor and may be directed to particular work experience and training programmes.  Clients with high PEX scores also receive one to one guidance if they remain on the live register.<\/p><p>  The first twelve Intreo offices are now live and it is intended to convert 40 offices to full Intreo working by the end of this year and to complete the full roll-out to all 63 offices of the Department in 2014.  It is to be noted that key elements of the Intreo model are being rolled-out in advance of the physical modification of offices. Personal profiling is already in place in all offices while individual progression planning and the accelerated integrated decision process will be operational in all offices by the end of this year.  Where the Intreo model has yet to be rolled out, the existing National Employment Action Plan (NEAP)  process continues, whereby referral to employment services takes place after 3 months on the live register.<\/p><p>  Taking both the Intreo offices and those still operating the older NEAP approach together, there were just over 41,100 initial referrals either to group engagement or one-to-one interviews in the period January-April of this year. Some 28,900 people attended these appointments; of those who did not attend, almost 4,000 had already closed their job-seekers&rsquo; claims by the date of their appointment. Over the same period, almost 9,300 people who had failed to attend an initial appointment were re-referred for interview or group engagement. Some 5,700 attended on re-referral, and 1,100 of those who failed to do so had already closed their job-seekers&rsquo; claims by the date of their appointment.<\/p><p>  Reduced payment rates (penalty rates) for jobseekers were introduced in April 2011 as a means of achieving the engagement of jobseekers with activation measures. A penalty of up to &euro;44 per week applies to an individual&rsquo;s jobseeker payment where there is a failure to engage with this process.<\/p><p>  The total number of penalty rates applied up to the end of 2012 was just over 1,800. A further 800 penalty rates were applied in the period from the beginning of January up to the end of April 2013.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRS02500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":962,"content":"<p>Question No. 395 answered with Question No. 370.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":963,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRS02750"},{"type":"question","counter":964,"qnumday":396,"qnumall":"[25630\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRS02800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if funding will be restored for a project (details supplied); if this request will be given urgent consideration in view of the fact that this project has assisted many homeless persons to gain work experience and the many benefits that follow from such work placements; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":965,"content":"<p>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that funding for the Ready for Work Programme operated by Business in the Community has been approved for the current year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRS02900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":966,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRS02950"},{"type":"question","counter":967,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[25644\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRS03000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an invalidity pension appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork.","asker":"993","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":968,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 21 February 2013.

These reforms will create a transitional arrangement specifically for former OFP recipients with children under 14 years of age who are awarded a JA payment.  This arrangement will operate for a transitional period and give these individuals an exemption from the JA conditionality that requires them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  This transitional period is required as lone parents with young children have caring responsibilities which may have prevented them from being available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  This arrangement will enable lone parents to work part time, provided they satisfy the JA means test, and will therefore offer them the continued security of income support from my Department.  Lone parents on JA under this arrangement will also be able to access the new afterschool child care scheme, which provides subsidised afterschool childcare if they secure employment or engage on a CE scheme. <\/p><p>  The aim of introducing these OFP reforms and for creating this arrangement is to improve outcomes for lone parents.

This personal development plan will identify suitable education, training, and employment programmes that will enable them to improve their skills set and increase their prospects of securing employment.  The exemptions from the full JA conditionality will remain in place until the lone parent's youngest child reaches the age of 14 years.

It is delivering on the Programme for Government commitment to set up a National Employment and Entitlements Service and involves a multi-annual programme of complex legislative, organisation, process, people, and work change running to the end of 2014.  There are five strands to the Pathways approach relating to:<\/p><p>- Engagement with people who are unemployed;<\/p><p>- The provision of  activation places and opportunities;<\/p><p>- Incentivising the take-up of opportunities;<\/p><p>- Working with  employers; and <\/p><p>- Reforming institutions <\/p><p><br \/>  We have made good progress on all strands.  The Deputy will be aware of the institutional changes arising from the merger of the Community Welfare Service and F&Aacute;S employment services with my Department - both of which were transferred on time and within budget at the start of last year.  Progress has been made on working with employers with the establishment of an Employer Engagement Unit within my Department.  With regard to activation places and opportunities 2012 saw the very successful roll-out of JobBridge and T&Uacute;S while Budget 2013 provided for an additional 13,000 places on various employment schemes representing a 30% increase on existing provision.  Jobseekers have a stronger incentive to take up these and other employment opportunities by virtue of changes to referral processes, payment arrangements in respect of casual work and the introduction of penalty rates of payment  for non-engagement with activation initiatives.<\/p><p><br \/>  The impact of the Pathways approach is most evident in the more frequent and more intensive manner of our engagement with jobseekers.  For example 68,600 clients participated in a group engagement process last year, while over 40,000 clients have benefitted from such engagements already this year.  Similarly the Department conducted 158,000 initial one-to-one guidance interviews with jobseekers last year.  The target is to complete 185,000 initial interviews in 2013.  Significantly under the Intreo model being rolled out across the country, the process of engagement starts immediately when a client registers for a Jobseekers payment and is informed by a personal profile captured in respect of each individual.  In the past no such profiles were captured and clients had to wait at least three months before being invited to a Group Engagement.  In addition decision times in respect of jobseeker claims are significantly reduced from an average of four weeks under the old method of operation to under a week, and in most cases to no more than 2\/3 days, in Intreo offices.<\/p><p><br \/>  The 12 twelve Intreo offices are now live and it is intended to convert 40 offices to full Intreo working by the end of this year and to complete the full roll-out to all 63 offices of the Department in 2014.  It is to be noted that key elements of the Intreo model are being rolled-out in advance of the physical modification of offices.  Personal profiling is already in place in all offices while individual progression planning and the accelerated integrated decision process will be operational in all offices by the end of this year. <\/p><p><br \/>  With respect to plans for 2013 I have published a comprehensive set of performance targets, set out on a on a quarter by quarter basis, on the Department's website  and will publish performance against these targets starting in July of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRT02700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1025,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 422 and 423 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":1026,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRT02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1027,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[25954\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRT02900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will outline the details of the claim for carer's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Carlow; if the appeal which was lodged by this Deputy and acknowledged on the 6 of December 2010 was fully processed; if the outcome of this appeal will be outlined; if she will confirm if the applicant was contacted during the appeal process and is they were notified of the outcome; if she will confirm the way the overpayment occurred as the applicant claims to have been caring for a person since 1990; if any action will be postponed regarding the suggested overpayment until the applicant has time to respond and they are now in poor health","asker":"965","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1028,"content":"<p>I can confirm that Carer's Allowance was awarded from 7th July 2005 to the person concerned.

The Recommendation is that Member States should: \"Ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.\"<\/p><p>  While it is recommended that the guarantee should be implemented as soon as possible, it is recognised that implementation will be more gradual in the Member States experiencing the most severe budgetary difficulties and higher rates of youth unemployment. The government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee.<\/p><p>  With regard to job creation for youth in support of the guarantee, the Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery. The government&rsquo;s job-creation policies are outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs, which sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people. Under the updated Action Plan for 2013, a new recruitment incentive &ndash; JobsPlus &ndash; has also been developed by my Department and was approved by the Government.  This incentive will cover the cost of c. &euro;1 in every &euro;4 of an employer&rsquo;s wage costs and will be launched for availability by July 2013.  Young people are likely to be major beneficiaries of this initiative as employers tend to hire young people when there is a recovery in employment. This incentive will be launched for availability by July 2013.<\/p><p>  The scale and nature of any additional measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.  In this regard the State already provides a significant number of initiatives which are of relevance to young people and the Department of Social Protection took steps in Budget 2013 to increase funding and places for schemes such as JobBridge, Community Employment, T&Uacute;S and a new state employment scheme in the local Government sector.  In total an additional 10,000 places will be provided.<\/p><p>  The size and the timescale for any additional provision, over and above that outlined above that is both desirable and feasible will be established over the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRU00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Unemployment Measures","counter":1036,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRU00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1037,"qnumday":427,"qnumall":"[18615\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRU00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the actions her Department is taking to tackle youth unemployment; if she will give an assessment of the effectiveness of these actions; and the targets for increased youth employment.","asker":"1080","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1038,"content":"<p>In the first instance, the Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.

These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies and include:-<\/p><p>- The Youthreach programme providing 6,000 integrated education, training and work experience for early school leavers without any qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age;<\/p><p>- The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme scheme, which provides a range of courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people over 21 years of age, particularly focusing upon early school leavers;<\/p><p>- The Back to Education Allowance scheme run by the Department of Social Protection provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated on this scheme in the last academic year;<\/p><p>- Approximately 12,000 persons aged under 25 completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2012. This excludes apprenticeships and evening courses;<\/p><p>- This year MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions, which is part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs initiative, is currently being rolled out by the Department of Education.  MOMENTUM will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 long term jobseekers to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors.  Over 1,250 of these places are assigned specifically for under 25s;<\/p><p>- The JobBridge National Internship Scheme is focused on providing work experience to young people with the total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 at 2,700. The recent interim independent evaluation of the Scheme conducted by Indecon Independent Economic Consultants found that 61% of individuals who have participated in JobBridge progressed into employment within five months of completing their internship placements. This high level of progression suggests JobBridge is an appropriate labour market intervention which has achieved very significant progress in a short period of time.<\/p><p>- Long-term unemployed youth will also benefit from the JobsPlus initiative which is designed to encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. Under this scheme the State will pay circa &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the employer to recruit a person from the Live Register;<\/p><p>- In the December Budget, funding was secured for an additional 10,000 places this year across a range of programmes -- including JobBridge, T&Uacute;S and Community Employment. About a quarter of these places are expected to be taken up by unemployed young people.<\/p><p>  With regard to targets, the original Action Plan for Jobs sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people. In addition, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 includes the Pathways to Work initiative&rsquo;s targets for increasing the number of people who are long-term unemployed moving into employment and reducing the average length of time spent on the Live Register.  Specifically, these targets are that:<\/p><p>(i) at least 75,000 of those currently long-term unemployed will move into employment by 2015.<\/p><p>(ii) Increase the exit rate of people on the  live register  for two years or more by 50%  (to 40%)  by the end of 2015<\/p><p>(iii) Reduce the persistence rate (the rate at which short term unemployed people become long term unemployed)  to 25%.<\/p><p>  As two out of five young unemployed are long-term unemployed, these targets are pertinent to young people.  A new recruitment incentive &ndash; JobsPlus &ndash; has also been developed by my Department and was approved by the Government as part of the Action Plan for Jobs.  This incentive will cover the cost of c. &euro;1 in every &euro;4 of an employer&rsquo;s wage costs and will be launched for availability by July 2013.  Young people are likely to be major beneficiaries of this initiative as employers tend to hire young people when there is a recovery in employment.<\/p><p>  Following from the formal adoption of the EU Recommendation on Implementing a Youth Guarantee, the government will review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.  The scale and nature of the measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is welcome that the official labour market figures published by the CSO indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, showed a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will almost certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education, training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Funding","counter":1039,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRU00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1040,"qnumday":428,"qnumall":"[26445\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRU00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will list the cost of each Ombudsman under her remit in the years from 2000 to 2012, within the on-going economic difficulties which challenge us all to work differently.","asker":"1015","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1041,"content":"<p>The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman, established in April 2003, is a State agency which comes under the aegis of the Department of Social Protection.

The approach of the national plan may unlock some flexibility, within the terms of the Habitats Directive, in regard to the most difficult of sites, where relocation options are limited.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has now engaged a team of specialists who are undertaking the necessary scientific work to underpin the national plan and to inform the future restoration and management of each of the SACs. This work is being overseen by an independent steering group with input from the Peatlands Council.<\/p><p><br \/>  In collaboration with the Peatlands Council and with the assistance of Bord na M&oacute;na, my Department is also working with local communities to arrange for relocation to nearby bogs of those who wish to continue turf-cutting. Arrangements have been made for the relocation of turf-cutters from Clara Bog in County Offaly, who have now commenced turf-cutting on their relocation bog, and from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog in County Galway who will be cutting in their bog next year.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the remaining 49 raised bog special areas of conservation, the Department has identified potential relocation sites for a further 32 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites. Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation.  The provision of financial payments or deliveries of turf is available to those awaiting relocation and to those awaiting the finalisation of the National Plan.<\/p><p><br \/>  Relocation is a complex process requiring the investigation of suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, assessment of infrastructure\/drainage works required, establishment of the number of turf-cutters who can be accommodated on the site, assessment of the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and in certain cases securing required planning and environmental consents. Accordingly, it will take a number of years to bring this process to a conclusion in respect of all the relocation sites.<\/p><p><br \/>  If it becomes apparent, following detailed analysis, that no relocation possibilities exist for a particular SAC, then a case can be made to the EU Commission for a more flexible approach, as provided for in the Habitats Directive. I hope that the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan can be completed by November, in time to submit an application to the European Commission under Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, if required, prior to the 2014 cutting season.<\/p><p><br \/>  The <i>Turbary Rights Transfer Programme for Irish Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation <\/i>was submitted by the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association (TCCA) to me and to the European Commission in March 2012, some weeks after the passing of the Private Member's Motion. This document represents an honest and genuine attempt to find an acceptable resolution to this difficult issue. In fact, many of the suggestions made in this document, and in previous documents submitted by the TCCA and by other groups were subsequently incorporated into my own document, the <i>National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan - Proposed Approach<\/i>  , which was published in September last.<\/p><p><br \/>  However, there is one crucial element contained in the TCCA proposal that is clearly not within the terms of the Habitats Directive. The proposed continuation of turf-cutting on many of the SACs for several years while a national plan is put in place is clearly at variance with EU law, and in particular Article 6 of the Habitats Directive. The European Commission and the Government have concluded that we simply do not have the legal discretion to follow that path. In face of our current infringement proceedings, to do so would be to invite certain litigation against the State, including potential injunctive action and substantial fines.<\/p><p><br \/>  The clear majority of domestic turf-cutters on the raised bog SACs are now engaging with my Department in finding acceptable solutions within the law. The door is still open for the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association to engage in this process with me, my Department and with other stakeholders to address the needs of turf-cutters and other interested parties. Such engagement would, I am sure, help to address the needs of turf-cutters more speedily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRU02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Presidency Engagements","counter":1065,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRU02650"},{"type":"question","counter":1066,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[25853\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRU02700","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will give details of Ireland's contribution to the European Maritime Day Conference recently held in Valletta, Malta; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":1067,"content":"<p>While I do not have statutory functions in relation to maritime issues I had the pleasure to represent the Irish Presidency of the EU at the annual European Maritime Day Conference held in Malta on 21-22 May.

The Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and the Green Economy, chaired by An Taoiseach, oversees delivery of the various actions contained in the policy statement.  In relation to Energy Efficiency a number of actions enhancing the public, private and household sectors are identified in the report for implementation by my Department and include the following:<\/p><p>Publish a second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan<\/p><p><br \/>  I published the second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) in February which reaffirms Ireland's commitment to a 20% energy savings target in 2020 in pursuit of our EU obligations.  This is equivalent to 31,925 Gigawatt hours (GWh) or a reduction in annual CO<sub>2 <\/sub>  emissions of around 7.7 Mega tonnes (Mt).  Recognising that Government must lead by example, we are committed to achieving a 33% reduction in public sector energy use by 2020.  The Plan contains 97 actions, each of which will play a part in securing a more sustainable energy future for Ireland and will play an integral role in the delivery of the national target.<\/p><p>Introduce an Energy Framework for the Public Service which will further improve the level of energy consumption by the sector.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2010-2011 the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and my Department developed and launched a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system to record each individual public body's progress towards the 33% target.  A database of over 30,000 meters has been established to enable the accurate gathering of public sector data.  This database is being developed with linkages to the National Procurement Service and will lead to better procurement of energy supplies for the public sector.  A report on public sector consumption will be published later this year.  This report will set out progress towards achieving the 33% public sector reduction target.  Work on the National Energy Services Framework, which will standardise energy performance contracting in Ireland and provide a robust process for establishing investment-ready projects, is well advanced and the first draft of the Framework will be published shortly.  The Framework will be underpinned by an Energy Efficiency Fund, to which Government has already committed &euro;35 million in the 2013 Budget as seed capital. <\/p><p>Continue to support energy efficiency improvements in homes through the Better Energy scheme up to the end of 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  The SEAI administers the Better Energy Programme that consistently delivers energy efficiency improvements across a number of sectors including energy saving targets for energy suppliers.  Since the start of the programme over &euro;250 million in Exchequer funding has been disbursed.  The Government has committed to spending &euro;44.519 million on the Better Energy Homes Programme during 2013 allowing substantial economic activity supporting jobs and generating anticipated energy savings of 418GWh (99.6 kt CO2) at a time of severe budgetary constraint.   <\/p><p>Introduce a Pay As You Save (PAYS) scheme to replace the Better Energy Homes scheme from 2014, and a strand of the PAYS scheme to improve energy efficiency in the public and commercial sectors in 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  The NEEAP and the Programme for Government include a commitment to roll out a Better Energy Financing (formerly known as Pay-As-You-Save) energy retrofit scheme for domestic buildings after 2013.  The Better Energy Financing (BEF) model proposes that the current suite of Exchequer funded grants for energy efficiency measures, excluding the low-income housing retrofit programme, will be replaced by a new financing scheme open to households and commercial operators.  My Department has put in place a project team to design a replacement retrofit financing scheme under the direction of a Project Board representing key State and industry stakeholders.  Project resources have been drawn from industry experts and elsewhere in the public sector.  It is planned that the design of the scheme will continue to be developed over the coming months and that a public consultation process will be undertaken in quarter three of this year.<\/p><p>Continue to provide supports to business to improve their energy and resource efficiency and manage their costs through the SEAI, EPA and Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Large Industry Energy Network (LIEN) and the Energy Agreements Programme is a well-established networking and information programme for large industrial energy users.  Now in operation for over 16 years, it engages 160 of the largest energy users in ongoing relationships, including site visits, workshops and annual performance reporting.  Energy spend across the LIEN is approximately &euro;800 million and accounts for approximately 60% of all industrial energy usage.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Energy Agreements Programme supports large industry to implement an energy-management system through the EN 16001 standard. Consistent annual saving across the Network averages between 2% and 3% accounting for annual energy saving of &euro;16 million and above.<\/p><p><br \/>  Competitiveness is high on the Government's and the business community's agendas and SEAI's focus continues to be on promoting energy efficiency and associated cost reduction programmes throughout small and large business sectors.  Over 200 SMEs participated in a wide range of activities including energy assessments, small business training, EnergyMap training and a number of networking events. 140 registrations to the Advice Mentoring and Assessments (AMA) programme in 2012 were recorded and the projected savings were 42 GWh.  Annual savings of over 10% are being generated by the participating businesses year on year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRU03800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Better Energy Homes Scheme Applications","counter":1082,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRU03850"},{"type":"question","counter":1083,"qnumday":444,"qnumall":"[25325\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRU03900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will expedite a warmer homes scheme application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1084,"content":"<p>The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) under the Better Energy Programme.

binding EU Directives.  The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Kildare, can be found on ComReg's website at .<\/p><p><br \/>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme.  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU's target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p><br \/>  During the preparation of Ireland's National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department has recently appointed experts to assist in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be on-going throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.<\/p><p><br \/>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland, including all of County KIldare, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity, through public or private sector investment, as outlined in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRV00900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Schemes","counter":1101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRV00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1102,"qnumday":450,"qnumall":"[25751\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRV01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when he will approve the proposal of energy efficient infra red heating panels to be eligible for triple E listing on the ACA scheme.","asker":"1099","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1103,"content":"<p>The Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA) Scheme was introduced under Section 46 of the Finance Act 2008 as an incentive to encourage companies to procure highly energy efficient equipment and in turn assist Ireland in meeting its EU targets for the reduction of carbon emissions.  The scheme, which is overseen by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department and was due to run for a trial period of three years, was extended in the Finance Act 2011 for a further 3 years to end 2014. <\/p><p><br \/>  The ACA offers an incentive whereby it allows companies to write off 100% of the purchase value of qualifying energy efficient equipment against their profit in the year of purchase rather than over the normal eight year depreciation period. By encouraging companies to purchase energy efficient equipment, the ACA aims to improve the overall energy efficiency of Irish companies Additionally it benefits companies, especially Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs), by reducing tax liabilities, increasing cash flows and reducing future energy costs.<\/p><p><br \/>  SEAI continuously review the eligible technology categories and criteria with a view to amending the Triple E (Energy Efficient Equipment)\/ACA list of qualifying products as appropriate.  Currently the ACA, which has been incorporated into the wider Triple E register, covers 10 different equipment categories and 52 associated technologies, and only energy efficient equipment that meets the relevant eligibility criteria are listed.  Twice a year (April and November) Statutory Instruments (S.I.) are published with the latest updates of eligibility criteria and eligible products.  With the publication of the latest Order (SI 123 of 2013), there are now over 10,000 products on the ACA list. <\/p><p><br \/>  Regarding the specific product, namely radiant heaters, the advice to me from the SEAI is that the dedicated testing standard for radiant panels (EN 14037) describes a procedure for measuring the rated thermal output and the mean surface temperature of the panel but does not describe a procedure for testing the radiant efficiency of the panel.  In the absence of such a standardised test procedure for this critical parameter it is not possible to objectively define efficiency criteria for their inclusion in the Triple E\/ACA database.

The detailed administration of these schemes, including the assessment, approval and payment of grants to applicants under the various grant measures, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority, in this instance Dublin City Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRV02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Tax Yield","counter":1123,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRV02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1124,"qnumday":457,"qnumall":"[25903\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRV02500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the amount of motor tax collected for each of the past 10 years; and if he will list each of the different categories of motor taxation.","asker":"1091","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1125,"content":"<p>Total gross motor tax receipts for each year from 2003 through to the end of 2012 are set out in the following table.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>YEAR<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>TOTAL GROSS MOTOR TAX RECEIPTS &euro;m<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>2003<\/div><\/td><td><div>681<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2004<\/div><\/td><td><div>747<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2005<\/div><\/td><td><div>802<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2006<\/div><\/td><td><div>879<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2007<\/div><\/td><td><div>956<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2008<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,058<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2009<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,057<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2010<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,023<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2011<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,010<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2012 <\/div><\/td><td><div>1,054<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>Categories of motor taxation are as follows:<\/p><p>- Private vehicles registered before 1 July 2008 (based on engine capacity)<\/p><p>- Private vehicles registered on or after 1 July 2008 (based on carbon emissions)<\/p><p>- Goods vehicles<\/p><p>- Large public service vehicles and youth\/community buses<\/p><p>- Off-road dumpers<\/p><p>- General haulage tractors<\/p><p>- Machine\/workshop\/contrivance vehicles<\/p><p>- Island vehicles<\/p><p>- Agricultural tractors, trench diggers, excavators<\/p><p>- Motor caravans<\/p><p>- Hearses<\/p><p>- Dumpers and forklift trucks<\/p><p>- Taxis and hackneys<\/p><p>- Schoolbuses<\/p><p>- Cycles and Tricycles<\/p><p>- Pedestrian controlled vehicles<\/p><p>- Veteran and vintage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRV02600","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Septic Tank Remediation Scheme","counter":1126,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRV02650"},{"type":"question","counter":1127,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[25062\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRV02700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will consider introducing a grant scheme for persons with existing septic tanks who wish to connect into main public sewerage schemes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"968","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1128,"content":"<p>On 17 December 2012 I announced my intention to introduce a grant scheme to provide financial assistance to households whose septic tanks and other domestic wastewater treatment systems are deemed to require remediation following an inspection under the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012.

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. <\/p><p>  In terms of addressing the demand for social housing, the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. I am monitoring expenditure under my Department&rsquo;s housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014.<\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure delivery of housing units for social purposes.<\/p><p>  The housing policy statement identifies approved housing bodies (AHBs) as key partners in the delivery of social housing.  This recognises both the constrained funding levels available for local authority construction programmes and the capacity and track-record of the voluntary and cooperative housing sector. <\/p><p>  The move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by approved housing bodies to more revenue funded options presents challenges for AHBs and will take some time to be fully agreed and implemented.  As such, I intend to develop a regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it in the policy statement and to underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions. <\/p><p>  This framework is being developed in consultation with the sector and it will:<\/p><p>- assist approved housing bodies to develop key governance and management structures to facilitate an expanded remit;<\/p><p>- provide independent scrutiny and validation of such bodies' competences; and<\/p><p>- place sustainable housing management policies and practices at the heart of a coordinated approach to the development of the sector.<\/p><p>  An important step in this regard will be the publication in the coming weeks of a voluntary code for the regulation of AHBs. This code will be a first step towards a statutory regulatory framework that will protect the very significant State investment in the sector over the last two decades and will provide assistance to those working in the sector to meet the challenges ahead.  It will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop this longer-term statutory framework to best support the enhanced role of AHBs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRV03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electoral Divisions Report","counter":1138,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRV03450"},{"type":"question","counter":1139,"qnumday":462,"qnumall":"[25182\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRV03500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the procedures that are in place if a boundary commission does not fulfil its remit as outlined in its terms of reference as set down by him; if he has the power to ask the commission to redo boundaries to comply with the terms of reference; the steps a private citizen can take to set aside a decision of a boundary committee that has been made outside its terms of reference; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1140,"content":"<p>I established a Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee on 15 November 2012, in accordance with sections 28, 32 and 33 of the Local Government Act 1991, to review and make recommendations on the division of each council area, other than Cork City, into local electoral areas, and to make recommendations on the number of members of each council to be assigned to each local electoral area.

The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income equals capital expenditure in the year. Balance is only required at an overall level and this allows considerable scope for authorities to draw on their existing capital reserves as an element of their overall investment programme.

Following a review of submissions received under this process, I gave effect to new consolidating solid fuel regulations, the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 326 of 2012).  These Regulations introduced a number of improved and updated provisions to ensure that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of residential fuels.<\/p><p>  The Regulations extended the smoky coal ban to seven new towns with effect from 1 May 2013. The ban now applies in all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people.  Greystones is among the towns added to the ban and the Greystones ban area includes the adjoining village of Delgany. Maps of all smoky coal ban areas are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.environ.ie\/en\/Environment\/Atmosphere\/AirQuality\/SmokyCoalBan\/.<\/p><p>  Air quality monitoring by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has shown that air quality is poorer in towns where the smoky coal ban does not apply. However, smaller smoky coal ban areas tend to be less effective, with residents living inside smaller ban areas more easily able to source smoky coal being sold outside the ban area. As such, the further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the best approach.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the regulatory improvements brought about by the new Regulations, I recognise that having different standards applying to coal between larger urban and smaller urban\/rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for people across these different locations. While I have set the challenging target of introducing a ban on smoky coal across the State within the next three years, I fully recognise the cross-border enforcement difficulties arising, if a national ban is introduced unilaterally in the South rather than on an all-island basis.<\/p><p>  With this in mind, I announced on 6 May that a joint North-South study is being commissioned, in collaboration with the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment, to examine emissions from residential heating, and in particular, air pollution from residential smoky coal in both jurisdictions and the potential policy options to reduce such emissions.  A more effective alignment of solid fuel policy and legislation on an all-island basis would support the introduction of a nationwide smoky coal ban. In addition to the clean air benefits, a nationwide ban would facilitate more effective enforcement, promote broader regulatory compliance and help to eliminate black market activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRX00800","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Union Citizens' Initiative","counter":1223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRX00850"},{"type":"question","counter":1224,"qnumday":493,"qnumall":"[25855\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRX00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of dealings with various groups, Irish or otherwise, his Department has had regarding the Citizens Initiative; if he will detail the process his Department has in the verification of signatures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1225,"content":"<p>The European Union (Citizens&rsquo; Initiative) Regulations 2012 put in place the arrangements necessary for the implementation in Ireland of the European Union Citizens Initiative.

The regulation of such online content is complicated by the fact that streamed content may often be provided from servers which are not located in the jurisdiction and therefore are not subject to Irish legislation.

In relation to the trends which may be observed from the official crime figures published by the Central Statistics Office, as I have previously observed in responding to the Deputy, it is important to note in interpreting figures for detection and conviction rates that the investigation, detection and prosecution of any offence may take a number of years and the circumstances and complexity of any given case may vary considerably.

The main area of complaint with regards to investments is the alleged mis-selling of these policies. This complaint type accounted for over 37% of investment complaints for the period 2007-2010. The majority of complaints relate to the consumers' contention that they were sold unsuitable products.&quot;<\/p><p><br \/>  More recently, in its bi-annual review for July to December 2012, the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman has again highlighted the mis-selling of financial products in noting that, &quot;Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) complaints, representing 32% of all insurance complaints in 2012, have increased by 216% on 2011 figures&quot; (from 405 in 2011 to 1280 in 2012), and that, &quot;in general, the main feature of the complaints concern the suitability of PPI for the consumer and the consumer's knowledge or lack thereof that they agreed to and paid for the product in the first instance.&quot; I am also aware that the Central Bank has sought a review by banks of the sale of PPI and the refund of customers who could never claim under that insurance as purchased.<\/p><p><br \/>  While not under the aegis of my Department, the Financial Services Ombudsman was established under the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004 and became operational on 1 April 2005. It is a statutory body funded by levies from the financial service providers. The Financial Services Ombudsman can investigate, in an impartial and independent manner, complaints from individual customers and small businesses who have unresolved disputes with Financial Service Providers who are either regulated by the Financial Regulator or are subject to the terms of the Consumer Credit Act 1995. <\/p><p><br \/>  Under current law, the Financial Services Ombudsman may not investigate a matter which occurred more than six years before the complaint is made. This is in line with the limitation period for most civil claims in the courts, including contract. This limitation period is provided for under section 57BX of the Central Bank Act of 1942, as amended by section 16 of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004. The relevant provision states:<\/p><p><br \/>  &quot;(3) A consumer is not entitled to make a complaint if the conduct complained of--<\/p><p><br \/>  (<i>a<\/i> ) is or has been the subject of legal proceedings before a court or tribunal, or<\/p><p><br \/>  (<i>b<\/i> ) occurred more than 6 years before the complaint is made, or<\/p><p><br \/>  (<i>c<\/i> ) relates to a matter that is within the jurisdiction of the Pensions Ombudsman, or<\/p><p><br \/>  (<i>d<\/i> ) is of a class prescribed by Council.&quot;<\/p><p><br \/>  I would also point out that the statutory functions of the Financial Services Ombudsman Council include the keeping under review of the efficiency and effectiveness of the Office of the Ombudsman and advising &quot;the Minister for Finance, either at the Minister's request or at its own initiative, on any matter relevant to the Ombudsman's operation&quot;. It would seem, therefore, open to the Council to make any relevant recommendations concerning the current limitation period that it considers appropriate to the Minister for Finance - who will be best placed to consider the appropriateness of such a change in relation to overall Government policy as it applies to financial services. I am also aware that a different approach has been taken to this issue in the United Kingdom. While consumers in that jurisdiction must bring complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service within six months of the final response letter from the business concerned, no limitation period applies to the matters on which the complaints are based. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Law Reform Commission has made recommendations in relation to enhancing the coherence of the broader limitation of actions regime in its Report on the Limitation of Actions of December 2011 and in relation to the limitation period applicable to contract law which could have a bearing on the matters raised. I will be happy to take account of these recommendations in any proposals for legislation that I may develop on periods of limitation in the future. In relation to directly addressing the issue of mis-selling raised by the Deputies, this will, in the first instance, have to take account of any relevant developments in core sectoral policy between the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman, its Council, and the Minister for Finance. To date, I have not been made aware of any developments or proposals in this regard. However, I will take the opportunity to raise the Deputies' concerns with my colleague in Cabinet, the Minister for Finance, as regards the policy position of his Department in relation to a change in the limitation period applicable to the mis-selling of financial products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRY02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Investigations","counter":1287,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRY02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1288,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[25158\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRY02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress made on the various reports requested by his office in relation to a case (details supplied); when they will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1289,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the investigation into the matter referred to by the Deputy is ongoing.

Equally, a person who is 18 or over cannot bring a claim of discrimination on the age ground  which is based on a comparison with a person aged less than 18. For example, an adult cannot seek children's fare on a bus.  I would emphasise, however, that the Acts do apply to discrimination against under 18s based on the other eight grounds. It is, therefore, possible for a young person to bring a claim of discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, membership of the Traveller community etc. Such complaints have in fact been dealt with by the Equality Tribunal. It is not correct to say that the Acts exclude young people.<\/p><p>  The Equal Status Act has been amended twice to make changes in the way it impacts on young people. The law was clarified in relation to the regulation of access to licensed premises by persons under 18 years of age and the conditions under which it is permissible to set an age limit for the purchase of liquor higher than 18 years. The Equal Status Act was also amended to apply it to discrimination on the age ground in the provision of motor vehicle insurance to drivers under 18 years of age.<\/p><p>  The reason for excluding under 18s from claiming discrimination on the age ground is that 18 is a standard cut-off for access to many services. For example, it is the age of majority, the age at which contractual commitments are fully enforceable, the age for sale of drink, etc.  It would be impractical to extend the age ground to under 18s as this would necessitate the provision of an extraordinary number of exemptions within the legislation and would entail a revisiting of virtually every area of the Equal Status Act. It would also mean that, in principle, it would no longer be permissible to give any preference (such as a reduced price) to young people.  There are clearly important issues of protection for children involved here.  A general application of the age ground to persons under 18 would not be practical or appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRY03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Services Regulation","counter":1299,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRY03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1300,"qnumday":520,"qnumall":"[25291\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRY03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his proposals to amend the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 with regard to the appointment of lay persons to the board of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority announced at the recent annual conference of the Law Society; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":1301,"qnumday":521,"qnumall":"[25292\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRY03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the reported amendments to the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 will set out the process, means and criteria by which the Law Society of Ireland and Bar Council of Ireland will select lay members for nomination to the Board of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1302,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 520 and 521 together.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 gives legislative expression to the commitment in the Programme for Government to <i>&quot;establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints&quot;.<\/i>  Furthermore, as a sectoral objective under the EU\/IMF\/ECB Troika Memorandum of Understanding, it supports the objectives of structural reform, national competitiveness and early economic recovery, building on the relevant recommendations of the Legal Costs Working Group and the Competition Authority.

It should be noted that this figure is provisional, operational and liable to change.  All incidents where persons have been reported missing remain under investigation until such time as the person is located.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reviews missing persons cases on a regular basis.  The district officer (superintendent) in the area where a person has gone missing takes direct responsibility for all investigations and searches carried out.  Local investigation teams are appointed by the district officer, and all means necessary, including the services of specialist units, are deployed to assist in these investigations, as considered appropriate.  The services of Interpol and Europol can also be availed of during such investigations, if necessary.<\/p><p>  The Garda missing persons bureau, which is responsible for all data relating to missing persons, provides expert assistance and advice to district officers in all high risk missing person cases.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that adequate resources, including staff and technology, are in place to deal with this issue and investigations are carried out in line with international best practice.<\/p><p>  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that a joint protocol is in place with the Health Service Executive, HSE, providing a strategic and uniform approach to the issue of children who are reported  as missing from care, with the overall objective of reducing such incidents, preventing such children from suffering harm and returning them to safety as soon as possible.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide the cost for each case as this would necessitate a manual search of each record and would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort which could not be justified where there are other significant demands on resources.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that the number of persons imprisoned at any time for non-payment of fines constitutes an extremely small part of the prisoner population.  To illustrate this point, there were 16 persons in custody on 27 May, 2013 for non-payment of a fine out of a total prison population of 4,245.  I am committed to pursuing alternatives to custody.  I am strongly of the view that we need to keep the numbers of people committed to prison for the non-payment of fines to the absolute minimum.<\/p><p>  I have already legislated to require judges to take a person&rsquo;s financial circumstances into account when setting a fine.  Work is now well under way on further major reforms to the fine payment and recovery system in Ireland.  The Fines (Amendment) Bill, which I expect to publish this term will, when enacted, make it easier for people to pay a fine and where they fail to do so, there will be sufficient options available to the courts in the form of, for example, attachment of earnings, community service, or recovery orders.

It has also called for its implementation in regard to the long standing dispute on mackerel and most recently on Atlanto Scandian Herring.  The European Commission&rsquo;s recent notification to the Faroe Islands pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 1026\/2012 is in relation to their recent actions in the Atlanto Scandian Herring fishery. <\/p><p>  Since 1996 the stock of Atlanto Scandian Herring has been jointly managed in a Coastal States Framework with, the Russian Federation, Norway, the Faroe Islands, Iceland and the EU.<\/p><p>  In 2007, following consultations with the five Coastal States a long term management plan based on scientific advice was agreed by the parties. The intention of the plan was to deliver a sustainable fishery which kept catches within safe biological limits. <\/p><p>  In January this year the Faroe Islands withdrew from the Coastal States consultations, indicating their intention to declare an autonomous TAC for 2013. Prior to this withdrawal they had not made any specific demand, nor provided any substantive case for a revised share of the fishing resource.  On 23 January this year, the remaining four coastal states set their 2013 quotas in accordance with scientific advice and on the basis of the long term management plan and existing sharing arrangements. The four parties set aside 31,940t for the Faroe Islands equivalent to their traditional share of 5.16% of the overall TAC.<\/p><p>  The Faroe Islands subsequently set their own unilateral TAC at 105,230t for 2013; this decision ignores the agreed management plan, the scientifically recommended TAC for the stock and the legitimate rights of the other four coastal states.  The notification issued by the Commission to the Faroe Islands pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 1026\/2012 is the first step in a process that could lead to the introduction of trade sanctions. However, it is designed to allow the country notified time to consider their position and take whatever remedial action necessary.  I support the decision by the Commission to issue this notification, and I am hopeful that a resolution can be found that does not necessitate a further escalation of the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRAA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Applications","counter":1417,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRAA02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1418,"qnumday":561,"qnumall":"[25310\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRAA02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when an application for payment under the agri-environment options scheme 2012 will be finalised in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway; when payment will issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1419,"content":"<p>The person named was approved for participation in the 2011 Agri-Environment Options Scheme with effect from 1 September 2011 and full payment totalling &euro;1,333.32 issued in respect of 2011.

Following consultation with Met Eireann, Co Ops, the farming organisations, Teagasc<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>  and the advice of officials working on the ground, the decision was taken to allow a further two weeks for fodder to be imported into the country with a doubling of the transport subsidy fund to &euro;2 million.  Fodder, eligible under the scheme and delivered into the country was covered up to Friday 24 May. I also decided, as an exceptional measure, that any definite purchases that were placed by that date, but which will not be delivered until this week, will be included under the scheme.  By the end of this week some 2,300 loads of imported fodder, amounting to about 34,000 tonnes, will have benefited from my Department's contribution to these transport costs. My Department is monitoring the situation on a very regular basis.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is also important that while continuing to focus on the emergency fodder position in the short term, farmers should also focus on growing and conserving fodder for next winter's needs. We should be maximising production in the coming period and I have asked Teagasc to prioritise this policy in their advisory campaigns over the summer months.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is clear that the main cut of silage will be delayed this year and as a consequence we need to look at the potential for the growing of additional fodder later into the season.  In this regard myself and my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr Phil Hogan, T.D., have announced a temporary and targeted adjustment of two provisions of the Nitrates Regulations to support additional fodder production on Irish farms in the coming months.  The adjustments involve: a discounting of some concentrate feeding when calculating the overall level of phosphorus allowed on grassland farms in 2013 and 2014; and an extension of two weeks to the period during with chemical fertiliser can be applied to grassland.<\/p><p><br \/>  Phosphorous is essential for grass growth. In order to ensure sufficient allowance of phosphorus for grassland application this year and 2014, some meal feeding in 2012 and 2013 will be discounted.  The period during which chemical fertiliser can be applied to land this year has been extended by two weeks up to and including 30 September 2013.  These measures will provide every opportunity to farmers to maximise grass growth and conservation into next Autumn.  <\/p><p><br \/>  For many farmers concerns regarding access to credit and flexibility around loan repayments have been a significant issue. I have been in contact with banks, co-ops and feed merchants to urge flexibility and co-operation at this challenging time.

Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities. This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of job opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and demonstrates how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.<\/p><p>  The initiative is expected to receive full year funding of &euro;14 million to provide over 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school in order to support parents to take up employment.  This funding has been made possible through savings from the Vote of the Department of Social Protection. <\/p><p>  Eligibility for the new After-school Childcare programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Officials from the Department of Social Protection and my Department are continuing in close collaboration on the operation of the programme.   The first pilot phase has commenced.  Up to 500 childcare places are available with  Department of Social Protection local offices in Tralee, Mullingar, Dundalk, Cork City, Finglas, Kings Inn and Limerick City participating.  The second phase of the pilot will be rolled out in July, with the full roll-out of the programme in September 2013, to coincide with the new school year.   <\/p><p>  As you know the emphasis now in relation to all childcare support programmes is the delivery of easily accessible, affordable and quality childcare provision.  The pilot programme will assist both Departments in determining the procedural, quality and practical issues that require attention prior to the finalisation of the programme.  The programme will provide &euro;35 per week per child enrolled in a participating service for after school services and this payment will rise to &euro;100 per week during holiday periods when parents will be availing of full day care.  A further &euro;20 per week will be paid by the parent to the provider in both instances.<\/p><p>  Service providers seeking to join the programme can apply to participate, with effect from September 2013, in the normal manner.

We are lucky that in Ireland we have generally positive parental&ndash;child relationships. For example, the &lsquo;State of Nation&rsquo;s Children&rsquo; Report which I published earlier this year indicates that 82% of children aged 10-17 reported that they find it easy to talk to their mother when something is really bothering them.<\/p><p>  A further report from last year by Dr. Elizabeth Nixon, based on Growing Up in Ireland data and focusing on &lsquo;How Families Matter for Children&rsquo;s Social and Emotional Well-Being&rsquo;, highlighted just how instrumental parents and families are for child well-being and this cannot be emphasised enough.  It also highlighted how parenting can have just as great an impact on a child&rsquo;s life chances as family structure, income or social class.  Put simply, good parenting is crucial for children&rsquo;s outcomes.  That is why this Government and I have committed to supporting children, parents and families.<\/p><p>  The HSE Child &amp;amp; Family Services, along with the existing Family Support Agency, fund a variety of programmes to support families and parenting. The National Educational Welfare Board, which comes under my Department&rsquo;s remit, provides funding to the Teen Parents Support Programme.  These various bodies will shortly be incorporated into the new Child and Family Agency. At the heart of the Agency will be an enhanced focus on early intervention and family support; and this will be greatly supported by the inclusion of the nationwide network of 106 Family Resource Centres.  I believe that establishing this new Agency presents us with a very exciting opportunity to consolidate and develop effective, evidence-based parenting and family supports.  <\/p><p>  In addition, a range of parenting programmes, including home visitation services, have been introduced under the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme which has been funded by my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies.  Evaluations to date of the three sites in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale have shown that parenting programmes can have a positive impact in tackling the early onset of behavioural and emotional problems among children as well as reducing parental stress and improving parental well-being.  Building on the critical learning emerging from the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme I hope to see effective, evidence-based parenting supports being included in the new Area Based Approach to Child Poverty which is currently being established on foot of funding announced in Budget 2013,<\/p><p>  The work of the new Child &amp;amp; Family Agency and the Area Based Approach to Child Poverty, as well as broader policy and programme delivery across Government, will be advised by ongoing work on the Government&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s &amp;amp; Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework and Ireland&rsquo;s first-ever National Early Years Strategy, work on both of which is at an advanced stage.  The Early Years Strategy has been a specific priority for me and I see the Strategy as providing an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s Early Years sector aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to age six.  Policy considerations relating to supports for families and parenting will be considered in the context of the ongoing preparation of these strategies.<\/p><p>  In the case of the Early Years Strategy, I have established an Expert Advisory Group and this group has had specific and focused meetings on the issue of parental support including presentations by the Centre of Effective Services who have shared the learning from their evaluations of early intervention and prevention programmes and the work of the Special Interest Group on Parenting which they have established and facilitated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRCC04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Preschool Services","counter":1552,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRCC04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1553,"qnumday":608,"qnumall":"[25894\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800075#WRCC04600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the inspection regime for the preschool sector; the number of such facilities per county; the number of same that have been inspected in each of the past three years per county; the result of these inspections; and her plans to ensure that all children attending such facilities can be assured of a quality service.","asker":"1178","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1554,"content":"<p>Under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006, the inspection of pre-schools is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE), and I have referred the Deputy&rsquo;s specific queries to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p><p>  I understand that, in 2011, 2,789 childcare providers were subject to inspections by the HSE Pre-School Inspectorate.

However, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, driving the early childhood care and education quality agenda is one of my key objectives.  I believe we can achieve this objective by taking a number of steps in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, including the adaptation of the existing pre-school inspection system to provide a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for pre-schools, moving to a greater focus on outcomes for children.

This Forum has been established with a view to generating ideas which would help address health insurance costs. Its core focus has been on identifying ways of addressing costs throughout the industry, while always respecting the requirements of competition law. The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model (UHI). The future delivery of health services under UHI will require competing insurance companies driving efficient, cost effective delivery of high quality health care.<\/p><p>  The Forum met five times during 2012. In addition, bilateral meetings took  place with each insurer  (i.e. Quinn Healthcare (now known as Laya), Aviva and VHI) in March 2012 where they brought forward their own ideas for cost savings in the market. Following its entry on to the Irish market, GloHealth accepted an invitation to join the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance in August 2012. The Forum has met twice so far in 2013, on 31st January and 28th March, and it is intended that a number of issues will be considered during the course of this year, including:<\/p><p> - costs and affordability in the context of a sustainable market<\/p><p> - data-sharing<\/p><p> - the establishment of a Subgroup to consider regulatory issues relevant to the health insurance market, and<\/p><p> - measures to encourage greater participation of younger, healthier people in the market.<\/p><p>  In addition to the ongoing work of the Forum, a Subgroup of the Consultative Forum was established earlier this year to consider regulatory issues relevant to the health insurance market. The third meeting of this Subgroup, with membership comprising two representatives from each insurer and representation from the HIA and my Department, took place earlier this month. The Subgroup provides a valuable opportunity for insurers to contribute views and proposals on initiatives which could assist the sustainability of the private health insurance market, such as lifetime community rating and the possible introduction of a standard plan or core set of benefits to the health insurance market.

The Group's overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the terms of reference.  The Group commenced its work programme by prioritising the area of family and child income supports and its report on this first module of work was published on 20 February 2013.<\/p><p>  The Advisory Group's second report was on the issue of the Budget 2012 proposals relating to Disability Allowance and Domiciliary Care Allowance.

These reforms will create a transitional arrangement specifically for former OFP recipients with children under 14 years of age who are awarded a JA payment.  This arrangement will operate for a transitional period and give these individuals an exemption from the JA conditionality that requires them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  This transitional period is required as lone parents with young children have caring responsibilities which may have prevented them from being available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  This arrangement will enable lone parents to work part time, provided they satisfy the JA means test, and will therefore offer them the continued security of income support from my Department.  Lone parents on JA under this arrangement will also be able to access the new afterschool child care scheme, which provides subsidised afterschool childcare if they secure employment or engage on a CE scheme. <\/p><p>  The aim of introducing these OFP reforms and for creating this arrangement is to improve outcomes for lone parents.  As a result of these measures lone parents will now be able to access the Department's activation supports and services.

This personal development plan will identify suitable education, training, and employment programmes that will enable them to improve their skills set and increase their prospects of securing employment.  The exemptions from the full JA conditionality will remain in place until the lone parent's youngest child reaches the age of 14 years.  At this point, should the customer continue to claim the JA payment, he\/she will be subjected to the full JA conditionality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800076#WRT02400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1936,"content":"<p>Question No. 420 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pathways to Work Strategy","counter":1937,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800076#WRT02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1938,"qnumday":421,"qnumall":"[25921\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800076#WRT02600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the progress to date on delivering on the targets outlined in the pathways to work strategy, namely to ensure that 75,000 of those long term unemployed in 2012 will move into employment by 2015, to reduce the average time spent on the live register from 21 months to less than 12 months; if he will ensure that employers have access to and are offered suitable candidates to fill full time vacancies and that the proportion of vacancies filled by her Department's employment services from the live register is at least to 40% by 2015; and if she will report on the current position\u00a0on each of these targets","asker":"1007","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1939,"content":"<p>Pathways to Work represents the single biggest ever change to how the State engages with, and provides services to, people who are unemployed.  It is delivering on the Programme for Government commitment to set up a National Employment and Entitlements Service and involves a multi-annual programme of complex legislative, organisation, process, people, and work change running to the end of 2014.  There are five strands to the Pathways approach relating to:<\/p><p>- Engagement with people who are unemployed;<\/p><p>- The provision of  activation places and opportunities;<\/p><p>- Incentivising the take-up of opportunities;<\/p><p>- Working with  employers; and <\/p><p>- Reforming institutions <\/p><p><br \/>  We have made good progress on all strands.  The Deputy will be aware of the institutional changes arising from the merger of the Community Welfare Service and F&Aacute;S employment services with my Department - both of which were transferred on time and within budget at the start of last year.  Progress has been made on working with employers with the establishment of an Employer Engagement Unit within my Department.  With regard to activation places and opportunities 2012 saw the very successful roll-out of JobBridge and T&Uacute;S while Budget 2013 provided for an additional 13,000 places on various employment schemes representing a 30% increase on existing provision.  Jobseekers have a stronger incentive to take up these and other employment opportunities by virtue of changes to referral processes, payment arrangements in respect of casual work and the introduction of penalty rates of payment  for non-engagement with activation initiatives.<\/p><p><br \/>  The impact of the Pathways approach is most evident in the more frequent and more intensive manner of our engagement with jobseekers.  For example 68,600 clients participated in a group engagement process last year, while over 40,000 clients have benefitted from such engagements already this year.  Similarly the Department conducted 158,000 initial one-to-one guidance interviews with jobseekers last year.  The target is to complete 185,000 initial interviews in 2013.  Significantly under the Intreo model being rolled out across the country, the process of engagement starts immediately when a client registers for a Jobseekers payment and is informed by a personal profile captured in respect of each individual.  In the past no such profiles were captured and clients had to wait at least three months before being invited to a Group Engagement.  In addition decision times in respect of jobseeker claims are significantly reduced from an average of four weeks under the old method of operation to under a week, and in most cases to no more than 2\/3 days, in Intreo offices.<\/p><p><br \/>  The 12 twelve Intreo offices are now live and it is intended to convert 40 offices to full Intreo working by the end of this year and to complete the full roll-out to all 63 offices of the Department in 2014.  It is to be noted that key elements of the Intreo model are being rolled-out in advance of the physical modification of offices.  Personal profiling is already in place in all offices while individual progression planning and the accelerated integrated decision process will be operational in all offices by the end of this year. <\/p><p><br \/>  With respect to plans for 2013 I have published a comprehensive set of performance targets, set out on a on a quarter by quarter basis, on the Department's website  and will publish performance against these targets starting in July of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800076#WRT02700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1940,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 422 and 423 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":1941,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800076#WRT02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1942,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[25954\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800076#WRT02900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will outline the details of the claim for carer's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Carlow; if the appeal which was lodged by this Deputy and acknowledged on the 6 of December 2010 was fully processed; if the outcome of this appeal will be outlined; if she will confirm if the applicant was contacted during the appeal process and is they were notified of the outcome; if she will confirm the way the overpayment occurred as the applicant claims to have been caring for a person since 1990; if any action will be postponed regarding the suggested overpayment until the applicant has time to respond and they are now in poor health","asker":"965","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1943,"content":"<p>I can confirm that Carer's Allowance was awarded from 7th July 2005 to the person concerned.

The Recommendation is that Member States should: \"Ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.\"<\/p><p>  While it is recommended that the guarantee should be implemented as soon as possible, it is recognised that implementation will be more gradual in the Member States experiencing the most severe budgetary difficulties and higher rates of youth unemployment. The government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee.<\/p><p>  With regard to job creation for youth in support of the guarantee, the Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery. The government&rsquo;s job-creation policies are outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs, which sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people. Under the updated Action Plan for 2013, a new recruitment incentive &ndash; JobsPlus &ndash; has also been developed by my Department and was approved by the Government.  This incentive will cover the cost of c. &euro;1 in every &euro;4 of an employer&rsquo;s wage costs and will be launched for availability by July 2013.

It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.  In this regard the State already provides a significant number of initiatives which are of relevance to young people and the Department of Social Protection took steps in Budget 2013 to increase funding and places for schemes such as JobBridge, Community Employment, T&Uacute;S and a new state employment scheme in the local Government sector.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.<\/p><p>  The Government is implementing a number of programmes to assist young unemployed persons and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance\/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies and include:-<\/p><p>- The Youthreach programme providing 6,000 integrated education, training and work experience for early school leavers without any qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age;<\/p><p>- The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme scheme, which provides a range of courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people over 21 years of age, particularly focusing upon early school leavers;<\/p><p>- The Back to Education Allowance scheme run by the Department of Social Protection provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated on this scheme in the last academic year;<\/p><p>- Approximately 12,000 persons aged under 25 completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2012. This excludes apprenticeships and evening courses;<\/p><p>- This year MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions, which is part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs initiative, is currently being rolled out by the Department of Education.  MOMENTUM will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 long term jobseekers to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors.  Over 1,250 of these places are assigned specifically for under 25s;<\/p><p>- The JobBridge National Internship Scheme is focused on providing work experience to young people with the total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 at 2,700. The recent interim independent evaluation of the Scheme conducted by Indecon Independent Economic Consultants found that 61% of individuals who have participated in JobBridge progressed into employment within five months of completing their internship placements. This high level of progression suggests JobBridge is an appropriate labour market intervention which has achieved very significant progress in a short period of time.<\/p><p>- Long-term unemployed youth will also benefit from the JobsPlus initiative which is designed to encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. Under this scheme the State will pay circa &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the employer to recruit a person from the Live Register;<\/p><p>- In the December Budget, funding was secured for an additional 10,000 places this year across a range of programmes -- including JobBridge, T&Uacute;S and Community Employment. About a quarter of these places are expected to be taken up by unemployed young people.<\/p><p>  With regard to targets, the original Action Plan for Jobs sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people. In addition, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 includes the Pathways to Work initiative&rsquo;s targets for increasing the number of people who are long-term unemployed moving into employment and reducing the average length of time spent on the Live Register.  Specifically, these targets are that:<\/p><p>(i) at least 75,000 of those currently long-term unemployed will move into employment by 2015.<\/p><p>(ii) Increase the exit rate of people on the  live register  for two years or more by 50%  (to 40%)  by the end of 2015<\/p><p>(iii) Reduce the persistence rate (the rate at which short term unemployed people become long term unemployed)  to 25%.<\/p><p>  As two out of five young unemployed are long-term unemployed, these targets are pertinent to young people.  A new recruitment incentive &ndash; JobsPlus &ndash; has also been developed by my Department and was approved by the Government as part of the Action Plan for Jobs.  This incentive will cover the cost of c. &euro;1 in every &euro;4 of an employer&rsquo;s wage costs and will be launched for availability by July 2013.  Young people are likely to be major beneficiaries of this initiative as employers tend to hire young people when there is a recovery in employment.<\/p><p>  Following from the formal adoption of the EU Recommendation on Implementing a Youth Guarantee, the government will review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.  The scale and nature of the measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.

The approach of the national plan may unlock some flexibility, within the terms of the Habitats Directive, in regard to the most difficult of sites, where relocation options are limited.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has now engaged a team of specialists who are undertaking the necessary scientific work to underpin the national plan and to inform the future restoration and management of each of the SACs. This work is being overseen by an independent steering group with input from the Peatlands Council.<\/p><p><br \/>  In collaboration with the Peatlands Council and with the assistance of Bord na M&oacute;na, my Department is also working with local communities to arrange for relocation to nearby bogs of those who wish to continue turf-cutting. Arrangements have been made for the relocation of turf-cutters from Clara Bog in County Offaly, who have now commenced turf-cutting on their relocation bog, and from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog in County Galway who will be cutting in their bog next year.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the remaining 49 raised bog special areas of conservation, the Department has identified potential relocation sites for a further 32 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites. Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation.  The provision of financial payments or deliveries of turf is available to those awaiting relocation and to those awaiting the finalisation of the National Plan.<\/p><p><br \/>  Relocation is a complex process requiring the investigation of suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, assessment of infrastructure\/drainage works required, establishment of the number of turf-cutters who can be accommodated on the site, assessment of the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and in certain cases securing required planning and environmental consents. Accordingly, it will take a number of years to bring this process to a conclusion in respect of all the relocation sites.<\/p><p><br \/>  If it becomes apparent, following detailed analysis, that no relocation possibilities exist for a particular SAC, then a case can be made to the EU Commission for a more flexible approach, as provided for in the Habitats Directive. I hope that the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan can be completed by November, in time to submit an application to the European Commission under Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, if required, prior to the 2014 cutting season.<\/p><p><br \/>  The <i>Turbary Rights Transfer Programme for Irish Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation <\/i>was submitted by the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association (TCCA) to me and to the European Commission in March 2012, some weeks after the passing of the Private Member's Motion. This document represents an honest and genuine attempt to find an acceptable resolution to this difficult issue. In fact, many of the suggestions made in this document, and in previous documents submitted by the TCCA and by other groups were subsequently incorporated into my own document, the <i>National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan - Proposed Approach<\/i>  , which was published in September last.<\/p><p><br \/>  However, there is one crucial element contained in the TCCA proposal that is clearly not within the terms of the Habitats Directive. The proposed continuation of turf-cutting on many of the SACs for several years while a national plan is put in place is clearly at variance with EU law, and in particular Article 6 of the Habitats Directive. The European Commission and the Government have concluded that we simply do not have the legal discretion to follow that path. In face of our current infringement proceedings, to do so would be to invite certain litigation against the State, including potential injunctive action and substantial fines.<\/p><p><br \/>  The clear majority of domestic turf-cutters on the raised bog SACs are now engaging with my Department in finding acceptable solutions within the law. The door is still open for the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association to engage in this process with me, my Department and with other stakeholders to address the needs of turf-cutters and other interested parties. Such engagement would, I am sure, help to address the needs of turf-cutters more speedily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800077#WRU02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Presidency Engagements","counter":1980,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800077#WRU02650"},{"type":"question","counter":1981,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[25853\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800077#WRU02700","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will give details of Ireland's contribution to the European Maritime Day Conference recently held in Valletta, Malta; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":1982,"content":"<p>While I do not have statutory functions in relation to maritime issues I had the pleasure to represent the Irish Presidency of the EU at the annual European Maritime Day Conference held in Malta on 21-22 May.

In relation to Energy Efficiency a number of actions enhancing the public, private and household sectors are identified in the report for implementation by my Department and include the following:<\/p><p>Publish a second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan<\/p><p><br \/>  I published the second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) in February which reaffirms Ireland's commitment to a 20% energy savings target in 2020 in pursuit of our EU obligations.  This is equivalent to 31,925 Gigawatt hours (GWh) or a reduction in annual CO<sub>2 <\/sub>  emissions of around 7.7 Mega tonnes (Mt).  Recognising that Government must lead by example, we are committed to achieving a 33% reduction in public sector energy use by 2020.  The Plan contains 97 actions, each of which will play a part in securing a more sustainable energy future for Ireland and will play an integral role in the delivery of the national target.<\/p><p>Introduce an Energy Framework for the Public Service which will further improve the level of energy consumption by the sector.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2010-2011 the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and my Department developed and launched a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system to record each individual public body's progress towards the 33% target.  A database of over 30,000 meters has been established to enable the accurate gathering of public sector data.  This database is being developed with linkages to the National Procurement Service and will lead to better procurement of energy supplies for the public sector.  A report on public sector consumption will be published later this year.  This report will set out progress towards achieving the 33% public sector reduction target.  Work on the National Energy Services Framework, which will standardise energy performance contracting in Ireland and provide a robust process for establishing investment-ready projects, is well advanced and the first draft of the Framework will be published shortly.  The Framework will be underpinned by an Energy Efficiency Fund, to which Government has already committed &euro;35 million in the 2013 Budget as seed capital. <\/p><p>Continue to support energy efficiency improvements in homes through the Better Energy scheme up to the end of 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  The SEAI administers the Better Energy Programme that consistently delivers energy efficiency improvements across a number of sectors including energy saving targets for energy suppliers.  Since the start of the programme over &euro;250 million in Exchequer funding has been disbursed.  The Government has committed to spending &euro;44.519 million on the Better Energy Homes Programme during 2013 allowing substantial economic activity supporting jobs and generating anticipated energy savings of 418GWh (99.6 kt CO2) at a time of severe budgetary constraint.   <\/p><p>Introduce a Pay As You Save (PAYS) scheme to replace the Better Energy Homes scheme from 2014, and a strand of the PAYS scheme to improve energy efficiency in the public and commercial sectors in 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  The NEEAP and the Programme for Government include a commitment to roll out a Better Energy Financing (formerly known as Pay-As-You-Save) energy retrofit scheme for domestic buildings after 2013.  The Better Energy Financing (BEF) model proposes that the current suite of Exchequer funded grants for energy efficiency measures, excluding the low-income housing retrofit programme, will be replaced by a new financing scheme open to households and commercial operators.  My Department has put in place a project team to design a replacement retrofit financing scheme under the direction of a Project Board representing key State and industry stakeholders.  Project resources have been drawn from industry experts and elsewhere in the public sector.  It is planned that the design of the scheme will continue to be developed over the coming months and that a public consultation process will be undertaken in quarter three of this year.<\/p><p>Continue to provide supports to business to improve their energy and resource efficiency and manage their costs through the SEAI, EPA and Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Large Industry Energy Network (LIEN) and the Energy Agreements Programme is a well-established networking and information programme for large industrial energy users.  Now in operation for over 16 years, it engages 160 of the largest energy users in ongoing relationships, including site visits, workshops and annual performance reporting.  Energy spend across the LIEN is approximately &euro;800 million and accounts for approximately 60% of all industrial energy usage.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Energy Agreements Programme supports large industry to implement an energy-management system through the EN 16001 standard. Consistent annual saving across the Network averages between 2% and 3% accounting for annual energy saving of &euro;16 million and above.<\/p><p><br \/>  Competitiveness is high on the Government's and the business community's agendas and SEAI's focus continues to be on promoting energy efficiency and associated cost reduction programmes throughout small and large business sectors.  Over 200 SMEs participated in a wide range of activities including energy assessments, small business training, EnergyMap training and a number of networking events. 140 registrations to the Advice Mentoring and Assessments (AMA) programme in 2012 were recorded and the projected savings were 42 GWh.  Annual savings of over 10% are being generated by the participating businesses year on year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800077#WRU03800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Better Energy Homes Scheme Applications","counter":1997,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800077#WRU03850"},{"type":"question","counter":1998,"qnumday":444,"qnumall":"[25325\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800077#WRU03900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will expedite a warmer homes scheme application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":1999,"content":"<p>The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) under the Better Energy Programme.

By encouraging companies to purchase energy efficient equipment, the ACA aims to improve the overall energy efficiency of Irish companies Additionally it benefits companies, especially Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs), by reducing tax liabilities, increasing cash flows and reducing future energy costs.<\/p><p><br \/>  SEAI continuously review the eligible technology categories and criteria with a view to amending the Triple E (Energy Efficient Equipment)\/ACA list of qualifying products as appropriate.  Currently the ACA, which has been incorporated into the wider Triple E register, covers 10 different equipment categories and 52 associated technologies, and only energy efficient equipment that meets the relevant eligibility criteria are listed.  Twice a year (April and November) Statutory Instruments (S.I.) are published with the latest updates of eligibility criteria and eligible products.  With the publication of the latest Order (SI 123 of 2013), there are now over 10,000 products on the ACA list. <\/p><p><br \/>  Regarding the specific product, namely radiant heaters, the advice to me from the SEAI is that the dedicated testing standard for radiant panels (EN 14037) describes a procedure for measuring the rated thermal output and the mean surface temperature of the panel but does not describe a procedure for testing the radiant efficiency of the panel.  In the absence of such a standardised test procedure for this critical parameter it is not possible to objectively define efficiency criteria for their inclusion in the Triple E\/ACA database.

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. <\/p><p>  In terms of addressing the demand for social housing, the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. I am monitoring expenditure under my Department&rsquo;s housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014.<\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure delivery of housing units for social purposes.<\/p><p>  The housing policy statement identifies approved housing bodies (AHBs) as key partners in the delivery of social housing.  This recognises both the constrained funding levels available for local authority construction programmes and the capacity and track-record of the voluntary and cooperative housing sector. <\/p><p>  The move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by approved housing bodies to more revenue funded options presents challenges for AHBs and will take some time to be fully agreed and implemented.  As such, I intend to develop a regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it in the policy statement and to underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions. <\/p><p>  This framework is being developed in consultation with the sector and it will:<\/p><p>- assist approved housing bodies to develop key governance and management structures to facilitate an expanded remit;<\/p><p>- provide independent scrutiny and validation of such bodies' competences; and<\/p><p>- place sustainable housing management policies and practices at the heart of a coordinated approach to the development of the sector.<\/p><p>  An important step in this regard will be the publication in the coming weeks of a voluntary code for the regulation of AHBs. This code will be a first step towards a statutory regulatory framework that will protect the very significant State investment in the sector over the last two decades and will provide assistance to those working in the sector to meet the challenges ahead.  It will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop this longer-term statutory framework to best support the enhanced role of AHBs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800078#WRV03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electoral Divisions Report","counter":2053,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800078#WRV03450"},{"type":"question","counter":2054,"qnumday":462,"qnumall":"[25182\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800078#WRV03500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the procedures that are in place if a boundary commission does not fulfil its remit as outlined in its terms of reference as set down by him; if he has the power to ask the commission to redo boundaries to comply with the terms of reference; the steps a private citizen can take to set aside a decision of a boundary committee that has been made outside its terms of reference; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2055,"content":"<p>I established a Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee on 15 November 2012, in accordance with sections 28, 32 and 33 of the Local Government Act 1991, to review and make recommendations on the division of each council area, other than Cork City, into local electoral areas, and to make recommendations on the number of members of each council to be assigned to each local electoral area.

The local government sector must not impact negatively on the General Government Balance (GGB) in any one year.<\/p><p><br \/>  The downturn in the economy and substantial pressures on Government funding generally require a sharp focus in all sectors, including local government , to ensure effective control and management of public finances.  In order to stay within the overall GGB limit, it is necessary for local authorities to maintain both their current and capital accounts broadly in balance. The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income equals capital expenditure in the year. Balance is only required at an overall level and this allows considerable scope for authorities to draw on their existing capital reserves as an element of their overall investment programme.

Following a review of submissions received under this process, I gave effect to new consolidating solid fuel regulations, the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 326 of 2012).  These Regulations introduced a number of improved and updated provisions to ensure that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of residential fuels.<\/p><p>  The Regulations extended the smoky coal ban to seven new towns with effect from 1 May 2013. The ban now applies in all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people.  Greystones is among the towns added to the ban and the Greystones ban area includes the adjoining village of Delgany. Maps of all smoky coal ban areas are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.environ.ie\/en\/Environment\/Atmosphere\/AirQuality\/SmokyCoalBan\/.<\/p><p>  Air quality monitoring by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has shown that air quality is poorer in towns where the smoky coal ban does not apply. However, smaller smoky coal ban areas tend to be less effective, with residents living inside smaller ban areas more easily able to source smoky coal being sold outside the ban area. As such, the further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the best approach.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the regulatory improvements brought about by the new Regulations, I recognise that having different standards applying to coal between larger urban and smaller urban\/rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for people across these different locations. While I have set the challenging target of introducing a ban on smoky coal across the State within the next three years, I fully recognise the cross-border enforcement difficulties arising, if a national ban is introduced unilaterally in the South rather than on an all-island basis.<\/p><p>  With this in mind, I announced on 6 May that a joint North-South study is being commissioned, in collaboration with the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment, to examine emissions from residential heating, and in particular, air pollution from residential smoky coal in both jurisdictions and the potential policy options to reduce such emissions.  A more effective alignment of solid fuel policy and legislation on an all-island basis would support the introduction of a nationwide smoky coal ban. In addition to the clean air benefits, a nationwide ban would facilitate more effective enforcement, promote broader regulatory compliance and help to eliminate black market activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800080#WRX00800","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Union Citizens' Initiative","counter":2138,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800080#WRX00850"},{"type":"question","counter":2139,"qnumday":493,"qnumall":"[25855\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800080#WRX00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of dealings with various groups, Irish or otherwise, his Department has had regarding the Citizens Initiative; if he will detail the process his Department has in the verification of signatures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2140,"content":"<p>The European Union (Citizens&rsquo; Initiative) Regulations 2012 put in place the arrangements necessary for the implementation in Ireland of the European Union Citizens Initiative.

In addition, the Criminal Assets Bureau has also been active in targeting the proceeds of deception, fraud, money laundering, bribery and corruption and other types of criminal activity commonly referred to as &ldquo;white collar crime&rdquo;.<\/p><p>  The conviction rate for any given category of offence relates in the first instance to the outcome of the criminal prosecution process and the Deputy will appreciate that my role does not extend to the bringing of prosecutions, or indeed to the determination of guilt, which is a matter for the courts.   In relation to the trends which may be observed from the official crime figures published by the Central Statistics Office, as I have previously observed in responding to the Deputy, it is important to note in interpreting figures for detection and conviction rates that the investigation, detection and prosecution of any offence may take a number of years and the circumstances and complexity of any given case may vary considerably.  Great caution should therefore be exercised in comparing, as the Deputy appears to do, conviction rates for offences recorded in 2003 and those recorded up to 2011, which is the latest year for which the CSO have published such detailed data.<\/p><p>  However, I am of course concerned to ensure that the investigation and detection of fraud and white collar offences is as effective as it can be and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has available to it the necessary legislative and other supports to this end.

Shortly after taking up office I moved urgently to introduce additional legislation in this area which was enacted as the Criminal Justice Act 2011, and provides vital assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the completion of current white collar crime investigations as well as providing assistance to them in future investigations.

The main area of complaint with regards to investments is the alleged mis-selling of these policies. This complaint type accounted for over 37% of investment complaints for the period 2007-2010. The majority of complaints relate to the consumers' contention that they were sold unsuitable products.&quot;<\/p><p><br \/>  More recently, in its bi-annual review for July to December 2012, the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman has again highlighted the mis-selling of financial products in noting that, &quot;Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) complaints, representing 32% of all insurance complaints in 2012, have increased by 216% on 2011 figures&quot; (from 405 in 2011 to 1280 in 2012), and that, &quot;in general, the main feature of the complaints concern the suitability of PPI for the consumer and the consumer's knowledge or lack thereof that they agreed to and paid for the product in the first instance.&quot; I am also aware that the Central Bank has sought a review by banks of the sale of PPI and the refund of customers who could never claim under that insurance as purchased.<\/p><p><br \/>  While not under the aegis of my Department, the Financial Services Ombudsman was established under the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004 and became operational on 1 April 2005. It is a statutory body funded by levies from the financial service providers. The Financial Services Ombudsman can investigate, in an impartial and independent manner, complaints from individual customers and small businesses who have unresolved disputes with Financial Service Providers who are either regulated by the Financial Regulator or are subject to the terms of the Consumer Credit Act 1995. <\/p><p><br \/>  Under current law, the Financial Services Ombudsman may not investigate a matter which occurred more than six years before the complaint is made. This is in line with the limitation period for most civil claims in the courts, including contract. This limitation period is provided for under section 57BX of the Central Bank Act of 1942, as amended by section 16 of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004. The relevant provision states:<\/p><p><br \/>  &quot;(3) A consumer is not entitled to make a complaint if the conduct complained of--<\/p><p><br \/>  (<i>a<\/i> ) is or has been the subject of legal proceedings before a court or tribunal, or<\/p><p><br \/>  (<i>b<\/i> ) occurred more than 6 years before the complaint is made, or<\/p><p><br \/>  (<i>c<\/i> ) relates to a matter that is within the jurisdiction of the Pensions Ombudsman, or<\/p><p><br \/>  (<i>d<\/i> ) is of a class prescribed by Council.&quot;<\/p><p><br \/>  I would also point out that the statutory functions of the Financial Services Ombudsman Council include the keeping under review of the efficiency and effectiveness of the Office of the Ombudsman and advising &quot;the Minister for Finance, either at the Minister's request or at its own initiative, on any matter relevant to the Ombudsman's operation&quot;. It would seem, therefore, open to the Council to make any relevant recommendations concerning the current limitation period that it considers appropriate to the Minister for Finance - who will be best placed to consider the appropriateness of such a change in relation to overall Government policy as it applies to financial services. I am also aware that a different approach has been taken to this issue in the United Kingdom. While consumers in that jurisdiction must bring complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service within six months of the final response letter from the business concerned, no limitation period applies to the matters on which the complaints are based. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Law Reform Commission has made recommendations in relation to enhancing the coherence of the broader limitation of actions regime in its Report on the Limitation of Actions of December 2011 and in relation to the limitation period applicable to contract law which could have a bearing on the matters raised. I will be happy to take account of these recommendations in any proposals for legislation that I may develop on periods of limitation in the future. In relation to directly addressing the issue of mis-selling raised by the Deputies, this will, in the first instance, have to take account of any relevant developments in core sectoral policy between the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman, its Council, and the Minister for Finance.

Equally, a person who is 18 or over cannot bring a claim of discrimination on the age ground  which is based on a comparison with a person aged less than 18. For example, an adult cannot seek children's fare on a bus.  I would emphasise, however, that the Acts do apply to discrimination against under 18s based on the other eight grounds. It is, therefore, possible for a young person to bring a claim of discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, membership of the Traveller community etc. Such complaints have in fact been dealt with by the Equality Tribunal. It is not correct to say that the Acts exclude young people.<\/p><p>  The Equal Status Act has been amended twice to make changes in the way it impacts on young people. The law was clarified in relation to the regulation of access to licensed premises by persons under 18 years of age and the conditions under which it is permissible to set an age limit for the purchase of liquor higher than 18 years. The Equal Status Act was also amended to apply it to discrimination on the age ground in the provision of motor vehicle insurance to drivers under 18 years of age.<\/p><p>  The reason for excluding under 18s from claiming discrimination on the age ground is that 18 is a standard cut-off for access to many services. For example, it is the age of majority, the age at which contractual commitments are fully enforceable, the age for sale of drink, etc.  It would be impractical to extend the age ground to under 18s as this would necessitate the provision of an extraordinary number of exemptions within the legislation and would entail a revisiting of virtually every area of the Equal Status Act. It would also mean that, in principle, it would no longer be permissible to give any preference (such as a reduced price) to young people.  There are clearly important issues of protection for children involved here.  A general application of the age ground to persons under 18 would not be practical or appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800081#WRY03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Services Regulation","counter":2214,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800081#WRY03500"},{"type":"question","counter":2215,"qnumday":520,"qnumall":"[25291\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800081#WRY03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his proposals to amend the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 with regard to the appointment of lay persons to the board of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority announced at the recent annual conference of the Law Society; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":2216,"qnumday":521,"qnumall":"[25292\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800081#WRY03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the reported amendments to the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 will set out the process, means and criteria by which the Law Society of Ireland and Bar Council of Ireland will select lay members for nomination to the Board of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2217,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 520 and 521 together.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 gives legislative expression to the commitment in the Programme for Government to <i>&quot;establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints&quot;.<\/i>  Furthermore, as a sectoral objective under the EU\/IMF\/ECB Troika Memorandum of Understanding, it supports the objectives of structural reform, national competitiveness and early economic recovery, building on the relevant recommendations of the Legal Costs Working Group and the Competition Authority.

I will be proposing that this be done by means of nominating bodies among whom will be numerous bodies of relevance to the mandate of the new Regulatory Authority in addition to the legal professional bodies.  In a similar vein, I will be enhancing the modalities of appointment of members to the Complaints Committee and of the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal. I also intend to bring forward an amendment to stagger the appointment of members of the Authority to ensure its continuity and minimise the scope for external interference by a wholesale reconfiguration. Taken together, these amendments will put to rest previously voiced concerns about the independence of the new regulatory regime.

The unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.  The current average processing time for applications is approximately 12 weeks from date of receipt.  However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  All organisations registered for Garda vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.<\/p><p>  I remain in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best the service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the process.  Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the GCVU and this must remain the case.  The possibility of introducing an e-vetting system has been assessed and the Garda authorities are now in the process of developing a system which will enable vetting applications to be submitted electronically through a secure web service.  In addition, the system will facilitate the checking and monitoring of applications.  The relevant work is being pursued on a priority basis and it will be completed as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that there are currently one Superintendent, two Sergeants and approximately 113 civilian personnel assigned to the GCVU.

The European Commission&rsquo;s recent notification to the Faroe Islands pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 1026\/2012 is in relation to their recent actions in the Atlanto Scandian Herring fishery. <\/p><p>  Since 1996 the stock of Atlanto Scandian Herring has been jointly managed in a Coastal States Framework with, the Russian Federation, Norway, the Faroe Islands, Iceland and the EU.<\/p><p>  In 2007, following consultations with the five Coastal States a long term management plan based on scientific advice was agreed by the parties. The intention of the plan was to deliver a sustainable fishery which kept catches within safe biological limits. <\/p><p>  In January this year the Faroe Islands withdrew from the Coastal States consultations, indicating their intention to declare an autonomous TAC for 2013. Prior to this withdrawal they had not made any specific demand, nor provided any substantive case for a revised share of the fishing resource.  On 23 January this year, the remaining four coastal states set their 2013 quotas in accordance with scientific advice and on the basis of the long term management plan and existing sharing arrangements. The four parties set aside 31,940t for the Faroe Islands equivalent to their traditional share of 5.16% of the overall TAC.<\/p><p>  The Faroe Islands subsequently set their own unilateral TAC at 105,230t for 2013; this decision ignores the agreed management plan, the scientifically recommended TAC for the stock and the legitimate rights of the other four coastal states.  The notification issued by the Commission to the Faroe Islands pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 1026\/2012 is the first step in a process that could lead to the introduction of trade sanctions. However, it is designed to allow the country notified time to consider their position and take whatever remedial action necessary.  I support the decision by the Commission to issue this notification, and I am hopeful that a resolution can be found that does not necessitate a further escalation of the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800083#WRAA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Applications","counter":2332,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800083#WRAA02150"},{"type":"question","counter":2333,"qnumday":561,"qnumall":"[25310\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800083#WRAA02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when an application for payment under the agri-environment options scheme 2012 will be finalised in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway; when payment will issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2334,"content":"<p>The person named was approved for participation in the 2011 Agri-Environment Options Scheme with effect from 1 September 2011 and full payment totalling &euro;1,333.32 issued in respect of 2011.

Following consultation with Met Eireann, Co Ops, the farming organisations, Teagasc<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>  and the advice of officials working on the ground, the decision was taken to allow a further two weeks for fodder to be imported into the country with a doubling of the transport subsidy fund to &euro;2 million.  Fodder, eligible under the scheme and delivered into the country was covered up to Friday 24 May. I also decided, as an exceptional measure, that any definite purchases that were placed by that date, but which will not be delivered until this week, will be included under the scheme.  By the end of this week some 2,300 loads of imported fodder, amounting to about 34,000 tonnes, will have benefited from my Department's contribution to these transport costs. My Department is monitoring the situation on a very regular basis.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is also important that while continuing to focus on the emergency fodder position in the short term, farmers should also focus on growing and conserving fodder for next winter's needs. We should be maximising production in the coming period and I have asked Teagasc to prioritise this policy in their advisory campaigns over the summer months.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is clear that the main cut of silage will be delayed this year and as a consequence we need to look at the potential for the growing of additional fodder later into the season.  In this regard myself and my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr Phil Hogan, T.D., have announced a temporary and targeted adjustment of two provisions of the Nitrates Regulations to support additional fodder production on Irish farms in the coming months.  The adjustments involve: a discounting of some concentrate feeding when calculating the overall level of phosphorus allowed on grassland farms in 2013 and 2014; and an extension of two weeks to the period during with chemical fertiliser can be applied to grassland.<\/p><p><br \/>  Phosphorous is essential for grass growth. In order to ensure sufficient allowance of phosphorus for grassland application this year and 2014, some meal feeding in 2012 and 2013 will be discounted.  The period during which chemical fertiliser can be applied to land this year has been extended by two weeks up to and including 30 September 2013.  These measures will provide every opportunity to farmers to maximise grass growth and conservation into next Autumn.  <\/p><p><br \/>  For many farmers concerns regarding access to credit and flexibility around loan repayments have been a significant issue. I have been in contact with banks, co-ops and feed merchants to urge flexibility and co-operation at this challenging time. I am happy to note that a number of co-ops have introduced measures to support fertiliser usage, such as interest free credit terms for a period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800083#WRAA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Exports","counter":2350,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800083#WRAA03350"},{"type":"question","counter":2351,"qnumday":567,"qnumall":"[25440\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800083#WRAA03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the amount of grass fed beef exported to Canada per annum for the past ten years; the value of this produce; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2352,"content":"<p>While more than 90% of our beef exports go to EU markets, it is always beneficial to have the maximum possible number of market outlets available for our high quality food products.

The CCS programme, which is provided through more than 900 community services throughout the country, is a major support programme for parents.  Approximately 19,500 families are availing of the CCS programme in the current school year at an estimated cost of &euro;50 million.  <\/p><p>  Community childcare services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, low and middle income working parents may qualify for support.  <\/p><p>  In the case of full day care, parents qualifying for the higher rate of subvention under the CCS programme can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge for childcare in the participating childcare facility.  The overall charge is based on the total costs incurred by the facility in providing the service and can vary depending on what the level of overhead costs are.

Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.

In 2014 the savings required in the youth budget under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure amount to &euro;2.976m which entails a 5% cut across most schemes and programmes and a 10% cut on the Youth Service Grant Scheme, under which For&oacute;ige receives funding as a national organisation.<\/p><p>Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding.<\/p><p>My Department has tried to be as equitable as possible in achieving these savings. In considering how best to manage within the reduced budgets available, organisations are being asked to consider the scope for reducing administration costs and overheads, if this is at all possible, in order to maintain the front line youth services for young people. I have met, and continue to meet with, many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to minimise the impact of these necessary savings in order to ensure that the provision of quality youth services to young people is sustained in these challenging times.<\/p><p>In 2011, For&oacute;ige, following an internal review of the organisation&rsquo;s wide range of provision for young people, reprioritised its areas of youth provision and programmes.  This reprioritisation, which was proposed to my Department, enabled For&oacute;ige to strengthen their Big Brother Big Sister (BBBS) Programme nationally.  For&oacute;ige decided, with the permission of my Department, to reallocate the funding provided by my Department from their Youth Information services to the Big Brother Big Sister Programme.  Additional funding was also provided by my Department to For&oacute;ige for the Big Brother Big Sister Programme in 2012 and 2013.  While I fully appreciate the value of the Big Brother Big Sister Programme and the challenges facing it in the current fiscal climate, given the savings required within my Department's budget under the CRE, I do not envisage any further scope for the provision of any further increase on the funding already provided to For&oacute;ige.<\/p><p>A comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding has been commenced in my Department and it is anticipated that the findings of this report will inform the future development of youth programmes and services.<\/p><p>My Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year.

Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities. This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of job opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and demonstrates how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.<\/p><p>  The initiative is expected to receive full year funding of &euro;14 million to provide over 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school in order to support parents to take up employment.  This funding has been made possible through savings from the Vote of the Department of Social Protection. <\/p><p>  Eligibility for the new After-school Childcare programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Officials from the Department of Social Protection and my Department are continuing in close collaboration on the operation of the programme.   The first pilot phase has commenced.  Up to 500 childcare places are available with  Department of Social Protection local offices in Tralee, Mullingar, Dundalk, Cork City, Finglas, Kings Inn and Limerick City participating.  The second phase of the pilot will be rolled out in July, with the full roll-out of the programme in September 2013, to coincide with the new school year.   <\/p><p>  As you know the emphasis now in relation to all childcare support programmes is the delivery of easily accessible, affordable and quality childcare provision.  The pilot programme will assist both Departments in determining the procedural, quality and practical issues that require attention prior to the finalisation of the programme.  The programme will provide &euro;35 per week per child enrolled in a participating service for after school services and this payment will rise to &euro;100 per week during holiday periods when parents will be availing of full day care.  A further &euro;20 per week will be paid by the parent to the provider in both instances.<\/p><p>  Service providers seeking to join the programme can apply to participate, with effect from September 2013, in the normal manner.  There is, however, no obligation on childcare services to provide for places under the Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800085#WRCC04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":2464,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800085#WRCC04200"},{"type":"question","counter":2465,"qnumday":607,"qnumall":"[25892\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800085#WRCC04300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when she intends to publish the Parenting Support Strategy.","asker":"1065","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2466,"content":"<p>The family continues to occupy a central and vitally important place in Irish Society, and the quality of family relationships, and factors within the home, impact hugely on children's development.  We are lucky that in Ireland we have generally positive parental&ndash;child relationships. For example, the &lsquo;State of Nation&rsquo;s Children&rsquo; Report which I published earlier this year indicates that 82% of children aged 10-17 reported that they find it easy to talk to their mother when something is really bothering them.<\/p><p>  A further report from last year by Dr. Elizabeth Nixon, based on Growing Up in Ireland data and focusing on &lsquo;How Families Matter for Children&rsquo;s Social and Emotional Well-Being&rsquo;, highlighted just how instrumental parents and families are for child well-being and this cannot be emphasised enough.  It also highlighted how parenting can have just as great an impact on a child&rsquo;s life chances as family structure, income or social class.  Put simply, good parenting is crucial for children&rsquo;s outcomes.  That is why this Government and I have committed to supporting children, parents and families.<\/p><p>  The HSE Child &amp;amp; Family Services, along with the existing Family Support Agency, fund a variety of programmes to support families and parenting. The National Educational Welfare Board, which comes under my Department&rsquo;s remit, provides funding to the Teen Parents Support Programme.  These various bodies will shortly be incorporated into the new Child and Family Agency. At the heart of the Agency will be an enhanced focus on early intervention and family support; and this will be greatly supported by the inclusion of the nationwide network of 106 Family Resource Centres.  I believe that establishing this new Agency presents us with a very exciting opportunity to consolidate and develop effective, evidence-based parenting and family supports.  <\/p><p>  In addition, a range of parenting programmes, including home visitation services, have been introduced under the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme which has been funded by my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies.  Evaluations to date of the three sites in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale have shown that parenting programmes can have a positive impact in tackling the early onset of behavioural and emotional problems among children as well as reducing parental stress and improving parental well-being.  Building on the critical learning emerging from the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme I hope to see effective, evidence-based parenting supports being included in the new Area Based Approach to Child Poverty which is currently being established on foot of funding announced in Budget 2013,<\/p><p>  The work of the new Child &amp;amp; Family Agency and the Area Based Approach to Child Poverty, as well as broader policy and programme delivery across Government, will be advised by ongoing work on the Government&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s &amp;amp; Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework and Ireland&rsquo;s first-ever National Early Years Strategy, work on both of which is at an advanced stage.  The Early Years Strategy has been a specific priority for me and I see the Strategy as providing an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s Early Years sector aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to age six.  Policy considerations relating to supports for families and parenting will be considered in the context of the ongoing preparation of these strategies.<\/p><p>  In the case of the Early Years Strategy, I have established an Expert Advisory Group and this group has had specific and focused meetings on the issue of parental support including presentations by the Centre of Effective Services who have shared the learning from their evaluations of early intervention and prevention programmes and the work of the Special Interest Group on Parenting which they have established and facilitated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800085#WRCC04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Preschool Services","counter":2467,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800085#WRCC04500"},{"type":"question","counter":2468,"qnumday":608,"qnumall":"[25894\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800085#WRCC04600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the inspection regime for the preschool sector; the number of such facilities per county; the number of same that have been inspected in each of the past three years per county; the result of these inspections; and her plans to ensure that all children attending such facilities can be assured of a quality service.","asker":"1178","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2469,"content":"<p>Under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006, the inspection of pre-schools is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE), and I have referred the Deputy&rsquo;s specific queries to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p><p>  I understand that, in 2011, 2,789 childcare providers were subject to inspections by the HSE Pre-School Inspectorate.

This compares very favourably with comparable jurisdictions such as England, where Ofsted operates a policy of inspecting childcare providers on a 3 &ndash; 4 year cycle.  However, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, driving the early childhood care and education quality agenda is one of my key objectives.  I believe we can achieve this objective by taking a number of steps in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, including the adaptation of the existing pre-school inspection system to provide a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for pre-schools, moving to a greater focus on outcomes for children.  In support of this, a Joint Pilot Inspection of Early Years Services was carried out by Inspectors from the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills between September 2011 and May 2012.

This Forum has been established with a view to generating ideas which would help address health insurance costs. Its core focus has been on identifying ways of addressing costs throughout the industry, while always respecting the requirements of competition law. The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model (UHI). The future delivery of health services under UHI will require competing insurance companies driving efficient, cost effective delivery of high quality health care.<\/p><p>  The Forum met five times during 2012. In addition, bilateral meetings took  place with each insurer  (i.e. Quinn Healthcare (now known as Laya), Aviva and VHI) in March 2012 where they brought forward their own ideas for cost savings in the market. Following its entry on to the Irish market, GloHealth accepted an invitation to join the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance in August 2012. The Forum has met twice so far in 2013, on 31st January and 28th March, and it is intended that a number of issues will be considered during the course of this year, including:<\/p><p> - costs and affordability in the context of a sustainable market<\/p><p> - data-sharing<\/p><p> - the establishment of a Subgroup to consider regulatory issues relevant to the health insurance market, and<\/p><p> - measures to encourage greater participation of younger, healthier people in the market.<\/p><p>  In addition to the ongoing work of the Forum, a Subgroup of the Consultative Forum was established earlier this year to consider regulatory issues relevant to the health insurance market. The third meeting of this Subgroup, with membership comprising two representatives from each insurer and representation from the HIA and my Department, took place earlier this month. The Subgroup provides a valuable opportunity for insurers to contribute views and proposals on initiatives which could assist the sustainability of the private health insurance market, such as lifetime community rating and the possible introduction of a standard plan or core set of benefits to the health insurance market. Further work will be undertaken by the Subgroup over the coming months to further consider the merits and viability of such proposals, with a view to overseeing the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to a UHI system.<\/p><p>  It is envisaged that the Consultative Forum will continue to provide a useful platform for continued engagement with the commercial insurers and I welcome any other measures or initiatives that insurers wish to contribute as part of the ongoing work of the Forum, and the Subgroup, which would be considered beneficial to maintain affordability in the private health insurance market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800085#WREE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Suicide Prevention","counter":2569,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800085#WREE01200"},{"type":"question","counter":2570,"qnumday":640,"qnumall":"[25269\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800085#WREE01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of funding that has been allocated to the ASIST programme in 2011, 2012 and 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2571,"content":"<p>The HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) is the national coordinator for the ASIST suicide prevention training programmes.

This Forum has been established with a view to generating ideas which would help address health insurance costs. Its core focus has been on identifying ways of addressing costs throughout the industry, while always respecting the requirements of competition law. The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model (UHI). The future delivery of health services under UHI will require competing insurance companies driving efficient, cost effective delivery of high quality health care.<\/p><p>  The Forum met five times during 2012. In addition, bilateral meetings took  place with each insurer  (i.e. Quinn Healthcare (now known as Laya), Aviva and VHI) in March 2012 where they brought forward their own ideas for cost savings in the market. Following its entry on to the Irish market, GloHealth accepted an invitation to join the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance in August 2012. The Forum has met twice so far in 2013, on 31st January and 28th March, and it is intended that a number of issues will be considered during the course of this year, including:<\/p><p> - costs and affordability in the context of a sustainable market<\/p><p> - data-sharing<\/p><p> - the establishment of a Subgroup to consider regulatory issues relevant to the health insurance market, and<\/p><p> - measures to encourage greater participation of younger, healthier people in the market.<\/p><p>  In addition to the ongoing work of the Forum, a Subgroup of the Consultative Forum was established earlier this year to consider regulatory issues relevant to the health insurance market. The third meeting of this Subgroup, with membership comprising two representatives from each insurer and representation from the HIA and my Department, took place earlier this month. The Subgroup provides a valuable opportunity for insurers to contribute views and proposals on initiatives which could assist the sustainability of the private health insurance market, such as lifetime community rating and the possible introduction of a standard plan or core set of benefits to the health insurance market. Further work will be undertaken by the Subgroup over the coming months to further consider the merits and viability of such proposals, with a view to overseeing the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to a UHI system.<\/p><p>  It is envisaged that the Consultative Forum will continue to provide a useful platform for continued engagement with the commercial insurers and I welcome any other measures or initiatives that insurers wish to contribute as part of the ongoing work of the Forum, and the Subgroup, which would be considered beneficial to maintain affordability in the private health insurance market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800087#WREE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Suicide Prevention","counter":2899,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800087#WREE01200"},{"type":"question","counter":2900,"qnumday":640,"qnumall":"[25269\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013052800087#WREE01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of funding that has been allocated to the ASIST programme in 2011, 2012 and 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2901,"content":"<p>The HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) is the national coordinator for the ASIST suicide prevention training programmes.
