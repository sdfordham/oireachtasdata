The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, or as it is commonly known, the Aarhus Convention, was adopted on 25 June 1998, just two decades ago.  The Aarhus Convention lays down a set of basic rules to promote public involvement in environmental affairs.  The convention governs environmental justice rights and is formed by three aspects or pillars of the convention, namely: access to information on the environment; public participation in decision-making on environmental matters; and access to justice in environmental matters.  The European Union subsequently introduced two directives to implement the Aarhus Convention.  These are Directive 2003\/4\/EC, on public access to environmental information and Directive 2003\/35\/EC, on public participation in respect of drawing up certain plans and programmes relating to the environment.  For the avoidance of any doubt I confirm that Ireland has already fully ratified the Aarhus Convention and this was achieved on 20 June 2012.<\/p><p>Since then Ireland has also ratified two related agreements: the protocol on pollutant release and transfer registers; and the GMO amendment to the Aarhus Convention.  The convention and these two related agreements entered into force on 18 September 2012.  An implementation table which details various legislative measures taken to implement the Aarhus Convention and related EU directives into Irish law is available on my Department's at <i>dccae.gov.ie<\/i>.  This includes measures in the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011, principally to introduce new rules about costs to apply in certain legal cases.  Since Ireland transposed the convention in 2012, a body of case law has naturally emerged, as Irish and EU courts interpret the convention as transposed. <\/p><p>My Department is currently working on the heads of a Bill to address such matters.  This Bill is intended to reflect the recent case law and streamline the legislative framework, and to remove any doubts as regards Ireland&rsquo;s intentions in terms of the transposition where the courts have expressed the need for greater clarity.  The issues to be addressed in the Bill include: automatic recognition that certain environmental NGOs have sufficient interest in relevant environmental cases; establishing in law that judicial review is an appropriate review procedure under Article 9(2) of the convention; and where they exist, that administrative review procedures must be exhausted prior to an application for judicial review.<\/p><p>While it had been originally anticipated that the heads would be approved by the Government before the summer recess, a small number of issues still remain to be settled in consultation between my officials and those of the Office of the Attorney General.  It is, therefore, now more likely that the Bill will the published in the autumn, although my officials are still striving to have the heads approved by the Government before summer if possible.  Although this Bill, when enacted, will clarify certain matters regarding the transposition and implementation of the convention by Ireland, I would like to reassure the House that Ireland is already in full compliance with the Aarhus Convention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070300002#A00500","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1530617400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response and to note that he is bringing forward a Bill.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Would the Minister consider initiating the Bill in the Seanad?

I met two ladies, Ms Aoife Caulfield and Ms Judy Breen, in Ennis two or three weeks ago.  I have a particular interest in education, particularly that of small children.  I am committed that they should be able to read and write as proficiently as possible.  These two ladies brought to my attention that a child's ability to read and write can often be dictated by his or her reflexes and muscle movement if the child's neural system is developing correctly and appropriately.  Certain movements in the neck, head and other parts of the body of many kids may not be developing, or may not have developed, appropriately and properly.  There has been much research done on this internationally, although it is limited in Ireland.  In England, it was proven beyond doubt that where children's reflexes and bodily movements are impaired, it leads to an literacy impairment.<\/p><p>We have seen a great commitment by the Government in recent times with more than 10,000 special needs assistants and significant resources put in to helping kids who have challenges reading, writing and so forth.  That is very welcome but we need to think outside the box.  I was struck by what these two ladies proposed, which they were able to back up by international research, that where programmes to help children with their reflexes were carried out their literacy skills improved dramatically.<\/p><p>I am not in any way suggesting this should be rolled out nationally immediately.  It should be looked at for in-service training as part of the curriculum, particularly in primary and pre-primary education.  Would the Minister consider doing this on a pilot basis with the proper analysis and reviews, and looking at the results?  I have no doubt the results will be positive and we will see there is merit in looking at rolling this out at a national level.<\/p><p>At the very least, I am looking for a commitment in principle from the Department of Education and Skills that it will engage with these people and listen to what they have to say.  They are doing it in schools on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis at the moment.  They are getting the results.  I would really encourage the Department of Education and Skills to engage with them and to carry out a pilot programme for the academic year 2018-19 in two or three schools.  If it works, perhaps we could look at doing it on a more streamlined national basis.  We need to think outside the box with these issues.  When one thinks about it, it makes sense that, if children have issues with reflexes, movements and so on, it is bound to have a knock-on effect on their ability to read and write.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070300002#B00300","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1530617400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Conway.  I apologise for taking this on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills who has provided me with this response.<\/p> <p>Officials in the Department of Education and Skills were contacted in May by the organisation which promotes this movement therapy programme.  At its core, the programme has the aim to promote learning readiness in children.  On 19 June, officials met with the organisation and listened to a detailed presentation on therapy intervention.  The specific intervention is known as the Institute for Neuro-Physiology Psychology, INPP, method.  The theory behind the INPP method is the presence or absence of certain primitive reflexes or postural reactions are key stages in a child's development, and provide signposts of the maturity in the functioning of the central nervous system.  Examples of primitive reflexes might include sucking and grasping, while postural reflexes might include head-righting reflexes or certain rolling reflexes.  The theory suggests where there is a presence of an apparent reflex or postural reaction, which is not explained by an identified pathology, the reflexes and-or postural reactions can be associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental problems and specific learning difficulties.  In simple terms, certain movement characteristics can signal certain neurodevelopment problems or learning difficulties.  <\/p> <p>The theory further suggests that, by addressing these issues through the exercise programme, neurodevelopmental programmes and specific learning difficulties can be improved.  The INPP method uses the assessment of primitive reflexes and postural reactions in school-aged children and beyond to identify signs of immaturity and the functioning of the central nervous system.  The reflex profile of an individual child is then used as a clinical tool to identify the earliest point in development from which a physical remedial programme should be started.<\/p> <p>The method requires that physical movements based on movements normally made during infancy or the first year of life are prescribed and practised daily.  When applied, progress is assessed at eight-week intervals using tests for primitive and postural reflexes, gross muscle coordination and balance, and ocular motor functioning.  If the exercises are effective, the score on all physical tests should, in theory, decrease.  There should be measurable improvement in the range of neurodevelopmental problems, including speech and language problems, where they arise.<\/p> <p>In order to ensure there is a full understanding of the method, including any evidence of its effectiveness or merit, or potential application in schools, the National Educational Psychological Service was asked to consider the body of evidence provided by the presenting organisation along with any other research or studies on this intervention, and to report back to the Department when this consideration has been completed.  Until such time that the review, or any further review which may be deemed necessary to establish the merit of the programme, is completed it would not be appropriate to consider its inclusion in any existing or new programmes, or for pre-service or in-service provision for teachers.  The Department of Education and Skills is committed to considering any proposal for new or innovative evidence-based interventions.  Officials will remain in contact with the organisation during the review and will inform it of the outcome as soon as it is available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070300002#B00400","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1530617400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for a very detailed explanation of the theory, which I am getting my own head around.

The Senator has highlighted a particular initiative that may assist a small cohort of people, which I have consistently raised in the past.

He could have asked a Minister of State to come in so I appreciate him taking the matter in person.<\/p> <p>The Minister knows the area well.  He has lived in this part of Dublin for a long number of years.  He is well aware of the proposal for MetroLink, which will erect a wall in the middle of the community of Ranelagh.  It is proposed that a train will run every 90 seconds.  It will separate the community forever and it will have a great impact on traffic and emergency services.  If they had to attend to a heart attack on one side of the line, for example, trying to access the incident would be difficult because of the way the emergency services are configured.  There has been little opportunity for the residents to make their views known.  Residents on the northside were invited to appear before the transport committee.  The Minister has no control over whether one group or another is invited to appear before the committee but they were excluded from that.  I feel particularly aggrieved by that.  They have requested a meeting with the National Transport Authority, NTA, which I hope will be granted shortly, and they have also asked to meet the Minister.  I ask the Minister to look at his diary on Friday, if that is when he has his diary meeting, to see if he can facilitate the representatives of the residents and schools in the Ranelagh area.  <\/p> <p>The proposal is to close the Luas green line for up to two years.  The official papers say it will be a year but the structural surveys on the embankment have not been carried out yet.  If the embankments have to be reinforced, which I believe will be the case, it will take substantially more than a year.  It will have an impact on the immediate area, not only Ranelagh and Rathmines but the entire southside of the city.  To put the number of people who use the green line back on to other public transport or in their cars would destroy the southside of the city for up to two years.  The economic impact would be substantial.  I ask that the Minister look at continuing the MetroLink further underground past Milltown, which the papers propose, would only close the green line for three months.  The green line could be closed for June, July and August during the school holidays which would lessen the impact on the city and its economic activity and mean having a better scheme to service the city.<\/p> <p>The Minister's officials will probably say he cannot implement these proposals without breaking eggs.  I am a realist.  To put in the infrastructure that is needed, some people will be discommoded and disadvantaged but we have to try to ensure we do not destroy where we do not have to.  There is a solution, although it is not a perfect solution.  It may not be the one everyone likes but it would certainly maintain the integrity of Ranelagh.  It would prevent an old-type Berlin Wall through the heart of Ranelagh, which would not only separate families and communities but would have an impact on small businesses and their economic viability if half their footfall is taken out.  <\/p> <p>I ask the Minister to meet the representatives of the residents' groups, who are the people most impacted.  They have formally written him asking for that meeting.  He may not have had time to consider it.  I ask the Minister to meet them as soon as possible with his officials, to allow them to explain the impact on their communities. He will see that there is a viable alternative.  The costing is &euro;420 million.  Similar major changes have taken place on the northside regarding the location of the stations.  We are hearing rumours.  The NTA said it may be move to a single bore tunnel.  We need to know what impact that will have and what can be done.  If it is moved to a single bore tunnel, as a result of the reduction in cost, can we reduce the impact it will have on communities such as Ranelagh and Rathmines?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070300002#C00400","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1530617400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue on which he has been a loud and extremely effective voice.  It is a difficult issue because when we embark on projects like this, some communities almost inevitably suffer discomfort or worse.  It is partly my job to ensure it is Government policy that the kind of disruption to which the Senator refers, particularly in Ranelagh, is deferred or does not happen at all.  It is difficult to embark on a project without doing that but I assure the Senator we have no intention of splitting communities in any way.  We will do everything we can to ensure no communities are split by this particular project, which is of such great importance to the entire city and county of Dublin.<\/p> <p>The recently published national development plan, NDP, which was launched earlier this year by Government as part of Project Ireland 2040, brings together the metro north and metro south projects, as envisaged by the NTA's greater Dublin area, GDA, strategy, into one project called MetroLink.  It is a massive project and Ranelagh is an important part of it.  Ranelagh will greatly benefit from it but the sensitivities of the people of the community have to be taken into consideration.  <\/p> <p>The MetroLink project is the development of a north-south urban railway service that will run between Swords and Sandyford, connecting key destinations along the 26 km route.  There will be 25 stations in total, 15 of them brand new.  A large proportion of the route will be underground, including where it passes under the important city centre area and Dublin Airport.  The underground section will terminate close to the Charlemont stop on the Luas green line, south city area, where the metro will connect to and run southwards on the existing Luas green line.  The Luas green line will be upgraded to metro standard as part of the project.  It will provide Dublin with a high-capacity, high-frequency, cross-city rail corridor, serving critical destinations such as Swords, Dublin Airport, Dublin City University, Ballymun, the Mater Hospital and existing destinations along the Luas green line to Sandyford.  MetroLink will provide faster reliable journey times to and from these key destinations while offering interchange with other rail, DART expansion, light rail and bus services.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> It is predicted that capacity for 15,000 passengers per direction per hour during the busiest peak times will be required along this corridor.  MetroLink will have the capacity for 30 trains per hour in each direction, so it will greatly enhance the public transport offering in Dublin.  The creation of about 4,000 jobs during construction is also envisaged, which is highly significant for the economy in the region.  The NTA, in conjunction with TII, recently completed a public consultation process on the emerging preferred route.  The emerging preferred route is the proposal which has been identified as the likely optimal scheme from a technical design perspective, without the benefit of public consultation and input.  It is not a finalised and selected scheme.  The final layout will only be determined after consideration and evaluation of the issues raised during the consultation process.  The purpose of that process, which also includes public consultation meetings, was to obtain the views of the general public, particularly those along the identified emerging route and to take that input into account in finalising a selected route.  I gather there have been consultations and meetings on this subject in the Senator's area.<\/p><p>Following receipt of all of the submissions, the issues and concerns identified are being carefully considered by TII and the NTA in determining the final scheme proposal.  A public consultation report is expected to be published later this year, following a full appraisal of the 8,000 submissions received.  The NTA and TII expect that an application for a railway order, comprising the final design scheme, will be submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la during quarter 3 of 2019.  A further public consultation will be undertaken in 2019 as part of the statutory planning consent process.  This will include a report assessing the environmental impacts of the project as well as final details of any land acquisitions needed for the scheme.  Subject to receipt of planning approval, construction of the project is expected to commence in 2021 with MetroLink open for passenger use in 2027.<\/p><p>I absolutely understand the concerns raised by affected stakeholders, including those communities in Ranelagh, so well represented by Senator Humphreys.  I believe that the MetroLink project can bring many benefits.  I am confident that the NTA and TII, through the consultative process that they have under way, will find a way of delivering the MetroLink project, maintain good routes that interchange with other public transport modes, and do it in a way that respects the social and community life of our city.<\/p><p>Given the MetroLink emerging preferred route proposal is the subject of a current independent public consultation process, I am sure the Senator will understand it would be highly inappropriate for me to comment any further on the details of the proposal at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070300002#C00500","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1530617400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>It is not my intention or that of the residents' groups to put the Minister in an awkward position, but the residents in Ranelagh believe the consultation process was deeply unfair.

When we requested a two-week extension to the public consultation we were informed that it would not be extended because of a specific request from residents on the northside that it should close on time.<\/p> <p>The opportunities for people to express their views were very limited.

I clearly remember five years ago turning the sod on the &euro;6 million primary care centre and the 20-bed community nursing unit in what is a very impressive campus.  It was a great privilege for me as a local Deputy back then to turn the sod on the wonderful development.  We now have a modern purpose-built primary care centre and an interconnected 20-bed care managed unit.<\/p> <p>The role of the primary care centre fits in with the Government's primary care strategy which is to provide a range of key services addressing the needs of local communities all under one roof.  Using this approach, the primary point of contact between a person and the health system is through the local primary care team.  The community nursing unit works in tandem with the primary care centre, acting as either a step-down facility for patients well enough to be discharged from general hospital but not well enough to go home or those who require additional therapies.<\/p> <p>Regarding my first query over the day-care centre, it was clearly stated in the project's brief at the very outset that this campus would have a day-care facility.  Unfortunately this is still to happen.  I would like to establish when the facility will commence.  It is certainly long overdue.  Day-care centres provide a range of social and rehabilitative services for older people with disabilities, and are a vital lifeline for many elderly people.

Given this situation, I want to ask Minister of State whether there are any plans to provide additional beds at the site.  There is certainly more space in the site for a further build, which would provide more beds to cater for this demand.

I also acknowledge his work on this issue and with regard to health and disability services and senior citizen services in his area.<\/p> <p>The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live with dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, and to support access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate, and this appropriateness is the important aspect.  Yesterday we announced &euro;14 million for housing adaptation grants for senior citizens with disabilities and this is another step in the same direction, so we have more people living in their own homes, where possible, as long as they have the proper facilities and accessibility.<\/p> <p>The HSE has operational responsibility for planning, managing and delivering health and personal social services.  Home care and other community services provide a greater range of options to avoid admission to acute hospitals, support early discharges and, where appropriate, to rehabilitate and re-able patients after periods of particular difficulty.<\/p> <p>Our ageing population is one of the most significant demographic and societal developments that Ireland has encountered in modern times.  Not only are people living longer, but a great many people are staying healthier and living better for longer.  Demand for community services is rising as more people are supported in their own homes rather than in hospitals or nursing homes.  However, quality residential care must continue to be available for those who need it.  I emphasise this angle to the debate.  It is for those who urgently need it.<\/p> <p>Primary care centres provide a range of key services to address the health needs of their local communities.  Access to day centres can make an important contribution by providing invaluable support, advice and social interaction for older people who may, for any number of reasons, be experiencing isolation and loneliness.  The Ballinamore primary care centre and community nursing unit consists of a modern purpose-built primary care centre and interconnected 20 bed community nursing unit.  The community nursing unit has been operational since May 2016.  There are 18 single bedrooms and one twin bedroom.  Residents are supported by a full nursing team and support team, who provide nursing care and support on a 24-hour basis.  Medical care is provided by a GP service Monday to Friday between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  Outside these hours medical care is provided by NoWDOC.  Multidisciplinary team members are accessible to residents through a referral process.<\/p> <p>Ballinamore forms part of the south Leitrim complement of nursing home beds, which includes St. Patrick's hospital in Carrick-on-Shannon with 65 beds and Arus Carolan in Mohill with 36 beds.  At present, there are no plans to provide additional beds in Ballinamore.  However, as the Senator is aware, the national development plan acknowledges the need for additional capacity.  It is expected that 4,500 additional short-term and long-term beds will be required across the public system in community nursing units and other step-down facilities, as identified by the health capacity review.<\/p> <p>Health capital projects and programmes under way will continue, and these major priority projects will require the bulk of the notified capital allocation over the initial period of the plan from 2018 to 2022.  The next planned phase of service provision for Ballinamore is the introduction of an integrated social day care service, which will further enhance day service provision in the south Leitrim area.  It is envisaged that hot meals for clients who attend will be provided through the Ballinamore community nursing unit based on the same site.  Social day services help to prevent social isolation, reduce possible hospital admissions and support early discharge from acute settings.  The integrated social day care service will provide clients with opportunities to engage with their peers while participating in social activities.  The HSE is seeking funding through the 2019 Estimates process to progress this plan and I will be very supportive of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070300002#E00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1530617400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his, as always, considered contribution.

There is a very elderly community in Ballinamore and it should get priority funding and attention.<\/p> <p>The fact that 4,500 additional short-term and long-term beds will be required throughout the public system in community nursing homes and other step-down facilities was identified by the health capacity review.

Providing an extra 20 beds in Ballinamore would bring it on par with Mohill.  It is not that one is competing with the other, but that these beds are needed in the south Leitrim area.

There is a crisis in the construction sector now because of a lack of skilled construction workers.  This stems from the fact that in recent years we have completely neglected the operation of apprenticeship schemes in this country.  In 2017, for example, a grand total of 121 bricklayer apprentices commenced training.  That figure was obtained through a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Niall Collins.  This is a drop in the ocean when IBEC estimates an additional 80,000 workers are needed in the sector in order to deal with current housing demand.  There are 134,000 workers in the construction sector and the serious lack of investment in apprenticeships in recent years is a matter of grave concern.  These skilled workers are not just needed in the short term, they are also very much needed in the long term in order to ensure that we have a sustainable housing supply to deal with future growing demands from the rising population.<\/p> <p>Instead of supporting apprenticeship schemes, the Government scrapped the new shared apprenticeship model in March.  The latter was a pilot partnership between SOLAS, the Construction Industry Federation and Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board.  This pilot programme was deemed a success but, despite this, the Government failed to roll it out nationally.  I call on the Minister of State at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills, Deputy Halligan, as well as the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, to see what they will do about boosting apprenticeship numbers.<\/p> <p>My second matter is a call for the public, especially Dubliners, to look at the proposed new Dublin Bus network routes.  This will replace the current system, which has 130 routes, and the new proposed network will form around the concept of seven spines around the city running from one end of the city to the other, as well as a circle line.  A public consultation process will start in the next month and I urge all Dubliners, as well as people who come here and use the public transport system, to engage with the process and make their views known.  Our current system is quite cumbersome and difficult to access; it is it hard to get from one end of the city to another without going through the centre.  This new system aims to make Dublin Bus routes more accessible and easier for tourists and others to use.  I urge Senators to review the new Dublin Bus network and I ask them to urge supporters and others to review it and submit their opinions to the National Transport Authority in the next month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070300002#T00300","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1530617400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I wish to raise a matter that is due to be discussed later.

We spoke on many occasions about the increasing value of seaweed with respect to job and enterprise creation.

Along with some of my colleagues yesterday I impressed on the NTA and Dublin Bus that the public consultation should not take place in the summer months when most Dubliners will be away on holiday.  Cynics would say that a great deal of public consultation takes place at Christmas time, Easter time or during the summer holidays.  It will not achieve the responses we need and will not generate the inclusion and ownership by Dubliners of this public consultation if most of them are unaware of it or are unavailable to do it.  I plead with the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to intervene and extend the public consultation period.  It is intended to examine the appropriate public transport for Dublin so we need everybody's voice at it.<\/p> <p>The other issue is that Dublin Bus has invested in a fleet that is diesel hybrid.  Diesel has a bad rap and it is a pollutant.  Even if the hybrid is an improvement the diesel part of the exchange is not.

We all know that if one has an emergency, one rings 999, but when one comes across this type of behaviour who does one contact?  We need greater public awareness about citizens' rights in these situations.  We could do with a debate about our laws and how we can enforce them and make the public aware of them.  Only this week, we have heard of a hosepipe ban and people were told they could be fined if they use a hosepipe to water the garden.  The question must be asked about who will enforce it, who will fine them and sort this out.  We have no enforcement of the law.  Who will enforce these provisions?

I have been making the first one here most afternoons.  It is about the fact that we now have a new poor in Ireland.  If one earns anything between &euro;30,000 and &euro;60,000 in Ireland and if one happens to be in the area of trades, teaching, health, retail or services, one cannot afford to live in one's own country if one is young.  One cannot afford to buy a house or even to save for a home.  One cannot afford even to have the expectation that one might one day own an apartment, because one will not be able to save.  One is so busy renting that one will not be able to save the &euro;20,000, &euro;30,000, &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 the appalling pillar banks are demanding of people.<\/p> <p>I keep asking the Leader to tell me what is happening about An Post and the New Zealand style community banking model which An Post is trying to implement.  The Minister has not yet come back to me to tell me what is happening about the report.  This is another report we cannot see.  In Germany one can get a mortgage for ten years at 1.1% in one of its community banks.  We are not allowed do that here.  Some 95% of our banks are commercial.  Only 12% of banks in Germany are commercial.  We are not allowed.  We seem to be waiting for the next report or the report after or the next committee meeting.  This matter recently came before the Joint Committee on Climate Action, Communications and Environment.  Will the Leader bring the Minister to the House?  This is very political.  If one wants young people to stay in our country - and we are roaring about them staying in the country - or to bring them back to the country but they cannot afford to live here or to rent here and they cannot have an expectation of getting a house or apartment in their own country, it is not going to happen.  They do not even get tax relief on the rents they pay out.  <\/p> <p>I am a great believer that something should come from a freshwater place.  We are supposed to be freshwater people in here with clean ideas which come in under the door like a fresh breeze.  This Bill has not come from a freshwater place.  It has come from a conditional place - if someone gives me something, I will give something back.  Sinn F&eacute;in came in on the back of it.

The BBC reported yesterday that two thirds of LGBT people fear holding hands in public.  I hold hands with my boyfriend in public but we only do so if we have a sense of place.

A locum was put in place but the locum has also resigned.  As a result, young people are not able to get access to psychiatric services.  It is extremely worrying.  It is worrying for parents and the young people themselves.<\/p> <p>What is wrong is that there seems to be an entrenched position that if people come from a particular area then a consultant from another area is not entitled or prepared to see them.

These figures are at an all-time high.  The National Association of General Practitioners is encouraging its members to refer patients who have been waiting for a long time to the cross-border health directive.  As Senators will be aware, this procedure enables patients to avail of the treatments they require across the Border or indeed abroad.

I think the communication of the high-profile hosepipe ban in the greater Dublin area to consumers has been very poor.  I believe many people are confused.  Some confusing and sometimes contradictory statements have been attributed to representatives of Irish Water, including a suggestion in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that people should be reluctant to flush their toilets during the current water shortages.  I think we should pooh-pooh that suggestion for sure.  It says a lot about the so-called progress in improving our water infrastructure that a couple of weeks of fine weather is all it takes to see widespread concern about the availability of water.  I say that as somebody who was in favour of water charges and who deplored the hysteria and tribalism that left us in our current circumstances, where there is no incentive to the public to conserve water.  The current water shortages are not confined to Dublin, but are also being experienced in the west and the midlands, etc.  This raises questions about the proposal to take 330 million litres of water from the Parteen Basin to Dublin each day.  Given that water shortages are affecting the country across the board, surely there are questions to be asked about this plan.  The proposed pipeline seems to be Irish Water's preferred quick-fix option for solving these problems, rather than the more fundamental work that is needed to repair our water infrastructure.  I would appreciate a debate on these matters in early course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070300002#Y00500","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1530617400,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I call Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070300002#Y00600","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1530617400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>On a point of order-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018070300002#Y00700","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1530617400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>No, please.

Of course we should remember the role Fianna F&aacute;il played in regard to F&Aacute;S as well.  Then again, Senator Clifford-Lee might get into hysterics again.<\/p> <p>Government is about strong pathways for education and training.  Government is cognisant of the scar that the training and education sectors felt during the recession.  That is why we have seen an increase of 25% in the number of people choosing apprenticeships, and that is welcome.<\/p> <p>I have said it in the House before and I will say it again: we should not simply always be about third level education.  While postgraduates and graduates in third level are important, we should ensure that we have a strong group of people who are involved in further education and training as well.  As I said before, I commend Senator Wilson on the role he plays in that regard.  Let us be assured that Government is committed to a quality apprenticeship scheme.<\/p> <p>Senator Ardagh also made reference to the issue around the construction sector.  Today the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, are hosting the third housing summit with chief executives of local authorities in Ireland.  Government is committed to expanding and increasing all forms of social housing delivery and all delivery of housing.  That is why we have seen strong growth in employment in the construction sector.  I call on Senator Ardagh to cast her mind back to the national economic dialogue forum last week.  We saw figures coming from independent sources indicating strong growth in the construction sector.  The indicators are that the housing sector is beginning to grow again and we welcome that.<\/p> <p>Senators Boyhan, McDowell, Craughwell, Bacik, Humphreys, Norris, Marie-Louise O'Donnell, Clifford-Lee and Mullen raised the issue of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.  Subject to the vote, the debate will take place later on.  I am confident, as is the Government, that there has been well-informed debate on the matter.  I am not accepting the proposed amendment to the Order of Business.  I am not going to get into a political war of words with Members this afternoon other than to say that I will not accept the proposed amendment to the Order of Business.  Government does not support the amendment.  We are confident that what Government is proposing is the correct course of action notwithstanding the differing viewpoints around the Bill and the views expressed on the GRECO report.  We have had a well-documented debate on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill for over 12 months.  We had a good Second Stage debate.

The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has published draft legislative proposals on the issue of supervision of convicted sex offenders.  I have listened to the comments of Senator Butler.  I am not familiar with the case he has mentioned.  A proposal is being put forward by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, around the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill, which will have a variety of issues tackled in terms of notification and requirements of communication.  We will have that debate in due course.<\/p> <p>Senator Horkan raised the issue of the confidence and supply, as did Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  The most important thing that can happen now is that Government, in association with all of us, gets on with governing the country.  To be fair to Senator Horkan, he has always demonstrated a willingness to work in this House, unlike his party leader.  I think the sun must have gotten to him last weekend.  A period of calmness until the summer recess would be best and a most prudent course of action.  Then we can have the debate around confidence and supply.  As others have said, we have important work to do in terms of getting the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill passed in the House and getting a third budget passed.

We will have that debate in due course, and there is a public engagement process that should be engaged in.  I join with the speaker and Senator Feighan in commending all involved in the safe relocation of the young people in Thailand.  It was a great story to hear yesterday, and made for even better imagery on our televisions of them being safe and well.

I think it is an important piece of work that she is undertaking.  I also think that Deputy Catherine Byrne is a very proactive Minister of State at the Department, as was Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  We need to see the old concepts and precepts change and be challenged, and I commend the Senator for the work she is doing in that regard.<\/p> <p>Senator Hopkins raised the issue of mental health in Roscommon, particularly in reference to the Rosalie unit and St. Joseph's Mental Health Day Centre in Ballaghderreen.  I know she has raised the matter with the HSE.  I think it is important that those who need specialist residential care should be able to access the appropriate service for them.  Equally, it is important that centres should not be closing.  They should be resourced and staffed.  We had a very significant week last week in mental health with the passing of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 sponsored by Senator Joan Freeman and Deputy James Browne.  It is important that confidence in the system is built in the case of Roscommon.  I know that Senator Hopkins has been questioning the HSE at length in regard to it.  As a matter of expediency, she might get that more quickly through a Commencement matter.<\/p> <p>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of anti-social behaviour.  I am not sure that it is caused by the heat.  I think it is partly due to some young people being off school and being available all day.  The important point that was made is that there are tools available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in regard to the matter.  I think it is important that people accept personal responsibility and that families accept that they have a duty of care to their own loved ones and to the wider community.  The issue the Senator raises is one we need to have a further debate on, because it is not peculiar to Carlow.  There are also people affected in many parts of the country and I would be happy to have that debate. <\/p> <p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell raised the issue of An Post.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, has appeared in the House, and the Senator had a number of amendments to the Order of Business last week.  We are awaiting the publication of the report she mentioned, but I think the point she makes in regard to An Post is a very important one.  I concur with her.  I have stated publicly here that An Post is very important and central to rural Ireland and small rural villages, but also to urban life.  If we do not use our post offices, we cannot expect them to continue.  We need to have competition within the banking system, but we do require pillar banks as well.  I would be happy to have that debate again in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>Senator Feighan raised the issue of Unite and its vote on Brexit.  I welcome that decision.  I think as the issue of Brexit looms, it is becoming quite clear that the British Government does not have any plan B.  It does not have a vision of where it wants to go.  I think it is important, and I want to wish the T&aacute;naiste well tonight in London as he travels for talks. <\/p> <p>Senator Warfield raised the issue of hate crime legislation.  I join with him in utterly condemning the attacks last weekend in Dublin and Portlaoise.  It is unacceptable that we have seen an increase in any type of hate crime or backlash against diversity.  We have a number of measures in place by which people can be sanctioned.  However, I accept that we do need to increase our hate crime legislation.  It needs to be strengthened.  Any increase in hate crime incidents is a worry and must be condemned.  I accept fully that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and his predecessor, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, had plans to update and strengthen hate crime legislation.  There is the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, and criminal laws concerning assault and criminal damage, but I think the point the Senator makes is that we need to see hate crime legislated for.  I hope that we will have that during the lifetime of this Oireachtas. <\/p> <p>I congratulate all involved in Dublin Pride at the weekend.  I welcome the increase in the number of participants.  Unfortunately I could not be there, but again I welcome the numbers participating.<\/p> <p>Senator Burke raised the issue of psychiatric services in the north side of Cork city.  I do not have the information that he requires to hand, but I think that he might get a faster reply through a Commencement matter. <\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher raised the issue of waiting times.  The Government has increased funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  He raised the issue of the cross-Border healthcare directive.  That is an important piece of work that we can see is of benefit to all of us.  There is a benefit in having a North-South dimension to our health system.  I would be happy for the Minister to come before the house. <\/p> <p>Senator Mullen raised the issue of the water shortages.  I think it highlights the folly of the approach of some in opposing Irish Water and and investment in fixing a broken system.  Water meters may not be the answer but they will find the source of a leak, and that is part of our problem.  Communication is important.  I am surprised that the Senator commented on Irish Water.  I think the company was very proactive both in our national media and on social media, but I will be happy to take the point the Senator makes on board.  <\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred to Deputy Michael Lowry.  Deputy Lowry is an Independent Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  He is not a member of the Government.  He did not vote for the Taoiseach in his election.
