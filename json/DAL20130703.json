In that bank alone we are looking at the loss of employment of between 1,400 and 1,800 jobs, which is a staggering blow to those employees and their families.  In a presentation to investors, the chief risk officer went further and said that the bank is anxious to break even by 2014 and to make a profit again in three years&rsquo; time.  In that context, he very worryingly said that the bank would target distressed mortgage holders in arrears.  In an extraordinary statement he said that it was his view that up to 35% of those in arrears were strategic and that the bank was going after them.  He blamed the Dunne judgment in the context of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act.<\/p><p>  It is interesting that the Government&rsquo;s response to the mindset and mood revealed in the presentation to investors yesterday was essentially to capitulate to the bank&rsquo;s agenda.  It is clear that the banks are targeting those in arrears and the Government has facilitated it, first, by simply changing the legislation, bringing it through this House, to make it easier for banks to repossess family homes and, second, by unravelling the existing protections and code of conduct that existed for mortgage holders and those in arrears.  The new code of conduct represents a significant rebalancing of powers towards the lender as against the borrower.  What we saw yesterday was a revealing insight into the thinking within the bank boardrooms and the bank management across the board.  It is their belief that it is legitimate to use legal action to go after people in arrears on the basis that they are all strategic defaulters anyway.  It seems to me that what we are witnessing, which explains why the Government has created a situation that coincides with the agenda of the banks, is a dilution of protections that existed for people in mortgage arrears and a change in legislation without any conditionality to protect those in arrears.<\/p><p>  Does the Minister share the view of Ulster Bank that up to 35% of mortgage defaulters are strategic?  Is that the Government&rsquo;s view as well?  Given the mindset, as revealed by the bank, will the Government reconsider intervening on behalf of those in arrears and put in place independent oversight to arbitrate between the banks and those in arrears to ensure that those in mortgage arrears in this country get a fair hearing and genuinely sustainable resolutions to the predicament in which they find themselves?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300003#A00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1372843800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>It is difficult to take lectures from the Deputy opposite about capitulation to banks given the history of what we have been through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300003#A00300","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1372843800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300003#A00400","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1372843800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The Minister wanted to guarantee Ulster Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300003#A00500","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1372843800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Would an answer be out of the question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300003#A00600","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1372843800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Deputy Cowen to the rescue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300003#A00700","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1372843800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>All of us in this House will express sympathy with those who have lost their jobs in Ulster Bank, which is the initial question raised by the Deputy.

The truth is that we inherited an economy that was losing 90,000 jobs per year.  That is 7,000 jobs per month.  The latest CSO figures show that we have added 20,000 jobs in the last 12 months.  In respect of the private sector, we are adding 2,000 jobs per month.  That is a dramatic transformation.  If one looks at what is happening beneath that, one will find that the IDA has had the best two years in a decade and Enterprise Ireland has had its best year in five years.  There is a real transition going on in our economy in certain sectors which we discussed earlier.  Part of the domestic banking sector continues to have problems but we are seeing the emergence of new strong sectors.  That is ultimately the response to the challenge of emigration and youth unemployment.<\/p><p>  We need to create more employment and the Government has put in place a number of innovative approaches to deal with this.  We have done it through our action plan for jobs, the strategic investment fund and our ability to find innovative ways of funding stimulus at a time when we cannot use conventional borrowing.  That is the way in which we will create new employment and deal with the scourge of emigration.<\/p><p>  In respect of youth unemployment, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has set this as a very high priority.  She has successfully negotiated the agreement at European level to make this a top priority for Europe.  Her agreement will now release &euro;6 billion in funding for youth employment initiatives across the EU.  We will also be developing that.<\/p><p>  As regards the Deputy's specific suggestion, this month the Minister, Deputy Burton, will be announcing a new scheme whereby an employer can take on a person who has been out of work for 12 months and get a subsidy of &euro;72 per week which will be paid monthly in arrears.  That is a straightforward cash support to help businesses which are in a position to recruit to take people off the dole.<\/p><p>  There are a lot of initiatives going on precisely to deal with the challenge the Deputy has set.  It is, and remains, the Government's firm purpose to deal with the employment crisis.  That is what gets us up in the morning every day.  That is what drives Ministers each day to seek to resolve this matter, which is the central crisis for the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300005#C04300","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1372845000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>If that is the best that Ministers can do, they should all stay in bed in the morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300005#C04400","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1372845000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300005#C04500","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1372845000,"counter":153,"content":"<p>What people want are sustainable long-term jobs, of which the Minister promised 70,000.

This is the reason for the genuine concern on the part of the Government to have the legislation passed before the summer recess. <\/p><p>  The other Bills before the Houses for the final Stages of consideration are also subject to time constraints arising from finance commitments in respect of membership of the European Union and so forth. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300007#E00900","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"vote","time":1372846500,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the proposal for dealing with No. 17 be agreed to.\"<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 86; N\u00edl, 43.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Emmet Stagg and Paul Kehoe; N\u00edl, Deputies Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh and Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Feargha\u00edl.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300008#F00050","aye":["1062","974","1016","1079","989","1029","1030","975","1092","988","1031","972","1041","1093","1087","1099","986","1036","994","1091","1046","1075","1007","1103","957","1078","1014","1085","1105","1009","1068","1055","1051","1076","995","1106","958","949","1097","973","1033","1012","1098","1088","1021","1110","1053","990","982","1023","996","1180","1000","997","1082","977","1038","1026","1070","985","1034","1067","1056","1018","1060","1058","1069","1073","971","1061","1063","1081","964","966","1035","947","952","1074","1013","1025","1048","961","978","1010","1109","1024"],"nay":["1066","1003","1096","1032","1083","1101","1015","959","976","1022","1047","1084","1100","1050","1108","1094","960","1049","1179","983","998","999","1008","1017","1090","981","992","987","1052","1177","969","1044","1054","1028","984","1059","1001","953","1178","970","1102","1065","956"]},{"type":"speech","time":1372846500,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 18, Order for Report, Report and Final Stages of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2013, agreed to?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300008#F00100","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372846500,"counter":233,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300008#F00200","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1372846500,"counter":234,"content":"<p>This is very important legislation that essentially gives <i>carte blanche<\/i> to the banks to repossess family homes without any conditionality attached.  When this is combined with a dilution of the protections of the code of conduct to unravel the protections that existed for people in mortgage arrears, we have a new landscape.  People in mortgage arrears are now much more vulnerable as a result of this legislation and are losing rights and protections.  A substantial number of amendments remain to be discussed.  On Committee Stage, Members did not have sufficient time to deal with all those amendments.  This is the second Bill on the Order Paper to be rammed through the House by guillotine notwithstanding the Government's commitment in the programme for Government that it would not do this.<\/p><p>Further, it is in the context of a proposal to come before the people in the autumn to abolish the Seanad.  What we are witnessing, bit by bit, is an incremental reduction of the democratic process, a dilution of the democratic process and a reduction of scrutiny of all measures.  One can imagine a unicameral system with one House where the Government has a majority and it can ram Bills of all consequence through without debate.  It says it in the document.  Only one question can be voted on now.  There is no facility to vote on particular amendments because of the guillotine.<\/p><p> We already know that the Government has clocked up a record in terms of the number of guillotines it has introduced since this D&aacute;il commenced on very serious Bills such as those relating to the property tax, cuts to child benefit and the respite care grant.

These amendments get to the heart of what this legislation is about, namely, the fairness and impartiality of the Oireachtas in carrying out an inquiry.  My amendments No. 3 states specifically that the committee conducting the inquiry shall consist of a minimum of 40% of members of the Government and a minimum of 40% of members of the Opposition.  The purpose of that is to ensure there is equality across the Chamber.  If the Government has a big majority it allows for it to have the majority of members on the committee but at least the Opposition to the Government would have a minimum of 40% of members.  On Committee Stage I suggested a 50%-50% membership but that may be too high and therefore I have refined it to a more reasonable percentage, and what I propose in amendment No. 3 is reasonable.  If the Government cannot agree to this amendment and allow the Opposition 40% of the membership it is a poor look-out in terms of the way any Oireachtas inquiry would conduct its business.  If the Government does not accept this it will lead to what I call institutional bias in terms of any future Oireachtas committee of inquiry.<\/p><p>  My amendment No. 4 specifically states: &quot;A chairperson of any committee established under this Act shall be a member of the opposition.&quot;  That is similar to the long-standing practice of, say, the Committee of Public Accounts or our current Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.  That has always been a good practice where the Government has a majority, in this case a big majority.  If the Government does not accept amendment No. 3, it is not allowing the Opposition have even 40% of the membership.  If the Minister does not accept this amendment the Government will be saying &quot;No.  We will want 70% of the membership.&quot;  If the Minister rejects the amendment on an Opposition chair the Government in effect will be saying that it wants 70% of the membership of this committee and that it wants to chair the committee.  It is immediately in the territory of institutional bias at that stage in terms of the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>  The kernel of the issue that people will appreciate is whether this will be a fair and impartial inquiry.  As the Minister is well aware, we are here dealing with this legislation because he proposed a referendum to amend the Constitution to enable the Houses of the Oireachtas undertake full inquiries and overview of the proposed system of Oireachtas inquiry.  The Minister put that question in a referendum to the people in November 2011.  We will not fight that again but it was lost.  It could have been won but the actions of individual members of the Government resulted in it being lost.<\/p><p>  On 12 September 2011 the Minister's Department gave us an explanatory note on the reason that referendum was necessary.  Obviously, it dealt with the Abbeylara case with which the Minister's Department will be familiar because he drafted it.  We are here today confined by the Abbeylara judgment.  That is the essence of what is before us.  The purpose of the referendum was to broaden the scope of inquiries beyond the Abbeylara judgment.  That referendum failed and therefore by definition we are here with plan B to try to work within the Abbeylara judgment.<\/p><p>  The briefing the Minister's Department gave us on the Abbeylara judgment referred to the issue of objective bias.  We all understand the issue of objective, that is, if individual members of a committee making a determination at the same time make comments in the media which indicate that they had prior strong views or fixed opinions, a situation of objective bias could arise.  I would be surprised if there is a Member of this House who has not expressed a prior strong view on the banking situation.  In a court of law, and this legislation will end up in the Four Courts before any inquiry proceeds or witnesses are called to give evidence, it will be difficult to find the required number of Members of this Parliament who have not expressed a strong prior view.  That is one hurdle this legislation will have to overcome.  The Minister's legislation for a banking inquiry is doomed to failure because of the actions of his Government, particularly in the past week or so.<\/p><p>  The second aspect of the Abbeylara judgment dealt with bias.  I quote from the Minister's explanatory note to us on 12 September 2011 when the Supreme Court referred to the issue of institutional bias.  The explanatory note states: &quot;<i>Institutional bias <\/i>refers, in summary, to a situation where, irrespective of the circumstance of a particular case, it is argued that a specific body [that is, the Oireachtas or the Oireachtas committee] may, of its nature, be inherently biased and cannot, therefore, be relied upon to assess evidence and form judgments in an objective and unbiased fashion.&quot;  They did say that it is not necessarily the case that the Oireachtas suffers from institutional bias.  If that were the case we would not be allowed deal with impeaching a President or a judge, and that was the follow-on note in that document, but the question of institutional bias does arise in regard to committees of inquiry.<\/p><p>  I suggest that the statement by the Taoiseach last week on foot of the revelations in the tapes from Anglo Irish Bank executives demonstrated institutional bias on the part of the Head of this Oireachtas.  He is the elected Taoiseach and leader of this Oireachtas and he said they had to look into the issues of collusion.  Collusion is a fraudulent, illegal, undercover arrangement in place between people.  The Taoiseach has come in here and said that in relation to the Anglo Irish Bank affair, those tapes raise the question of fraudulent collusion between individuals in the then Government and Anglo Irish Bank.<\/p><p>This indicates that the head of the Oireachtas has formed a strong prior view that an issue of collusion arises.  It was the Taoiseach who raised that issue.  I am of the view that the conversation in which we are engaging now will be played out in the courts before an Oireachtas inquiry comes into operation because some witness who does not want to come forward will take a case regarding the bias of this institution.  That prospective witness will use the words of An Taoiseach to demonstrate the institutional bias referred to by the Supreme Court in the Abbeylara case.<\/p><p> The matter does not stop there.  The main party in Government has been producing and circulating to all its members documents relating to the roles played by Fianna F&aacute;il and the former Anglo Irish Bank.  This demonstrates that Fine Gael and, by definition, all of its members - some of whom will serve on the committee of inquiry - have been influenced by the Taoiseach's approach in respect of what he refers to as collusion between Fianna F&aacute;il and the former Anglo Irish Bank.  We entirely refute the idea that there was such collusion.  The relevant tapes have subsequently shown how furious were the people in the former Anglo Irish Bank with the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan Jr.  This shows that there was anything but collusion.  Since the Taoiseach made his comments, he has sent out his minions to appear on several national media programmes to restate the position that there are charges to be answered by Fianna F&aacute;il.  This shows that a bias exists.  Inquiries must examine the facts and people are not brought before them, charged with wrongdoing and made to answer for what they have done.  Members of the Fine Gael Party recently appeared on national television and indicated that there are charges to answer.  They also restated this view in the House in the past day or two.<\/p><p> The actions of the Taoiseach and his party should be a source of concern to the Minister.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, contributed to scuppering the referendum on the previous amendment to the Constitution in this regard by his display of arrogance.  Now Fine Gael, led by the Taoiseach and supported by his minions, is talking about collusion and the fact that there are charges to be answered.  In my opinion this demonstrates not only subjective bias on the part of individual Members but also an institutional bias on the part of the head of this Oireachtas.  Whatever chance the Minister had of having an objective inquiry carried out in respect of the banks has been damaged by the Taoiseach and other Fine Gael Ministers.  I have not been following everything that has been said by members of the Labour Party on this matter and I accept that I am singling out the Fine Gael Party.<\/p><p> The Minister would, if he could accept these amendments, be in a position to put up some small defence when a case is brought before the courts regarding why this legislation should not be used in respect of the holding of an inquiry into banking.  Regardless of what the Taoiseach stated, we are prepared to accept the committee of inquiry being chaired by a member of the Opposition.  That is the basis of amendment No. 4.  Despite the personal and institutional bias the Taoiseach, as leader of this Parliament, has demonstrated in respect of any future banking inquiry, we are of the view that a minimum of 40% - the Minister could opt for a higher percentage - of the membership of that inquiry should not be from the Government parties.  If the Minister were to accept my amendments, he would be showing the courts, the public and those who might be called to give evidence that the proposed inquiry will not be tainted by either institutional or personal bias.  As I have already stated, the Taoiseach's comments - which demonstrate personal and institutional bias on the part of Fine Gael and its members - are going to remain on the record.  If the Minister cannot accept the amendment to the effect that the inquiry should be chaired by a member of the Opposition and that 40% of its membership should comprise those in opposition, then he will also be demonstrating bias.  Not only will he be insisting that the Government should have a huge majority on the inquiry, he will also be insisting that it should control the Chair.<\/p><p> It is not acceptable to state that this is a matter for the Oireachtas to decide upon because the Taoiseach controls the Oireachtas.  We witnessed what he did yesterday when members of Fine Gael defied the Whip and voted against the Government.  We had not even left the Chamber when e-mails to remove those individuals from Oireachtas committees were issued from the Office of the Government Chief Whip.  That is how the Government and the Oireachtas operate at present.  If the Minister cannot accept the amendments, this will show an even greater level of institutional bias than that demonstrated by the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300011#J01800","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372848600,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I recognise the intent behind Deputy Sean Fleming's amendments.  For the purposes of underscoring inclusivity and putting paid to any concerns relating to the Government delivering a ready-up in the context of the membership of a committee of inquiry, it would be useful if they were included in the Bill.  I think we are all clear on the fact that in the context of the legislation before the House, we must work within the existing constitutional and legal framework.  As a result, we cannot make adverse findings of fact.  There is, of course, an issue of bias and there is an attempt to cater for this in the legislation.  However, I cannot accept Deputy Fleming's narrative in respect of what has transpired recently with regard to any potential inquiry into banking.  By definition, when an inquiry - whatever its format - is under way, it will examine what happened in the banks and a very legitimate public question that will arise will relate to the interaction or otherwise between the political system and the banking system.  I do not believe that raising this issue represents bias, it merely acknowledges one dimension of what was, in some ways, a very complicated turn of events.<\/p><p>  I am not even sure that this is the right place in which to engage in this discussion.  However, I could not allow the Deputy's commentary to pass without stating that for its part, my party recognises the limitations - by definition - of any potential inquiry into banking.  The latter will simply reflect the legal position.  I am also of the view, however, that a methodology can be found to ensure that bias can be offset.  In such circumstances, the inquiry will have to be very structured and focused and I believe this is possible.  I do not buy the Fianna F&aacute;il line that this endeavour is doomed because the Taoiseach has hurt the feelings of that party by making a legitimate political charge against it.  Not so long ago, Deputy Fleming was very much in favour of an Oireachtas inquiry into banking.  At that time there was some tension between the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Finance on the issue because people believed an inquiry would be a good thing and they all wanted to be involved.  Let us not back off holding a legitimate, properly structured, disciplined and functioning public inquiry because as such it is politically awkward.  People should not make charges of bias, either individual or institutional, unless they are based in fact.  Neither should they make charges of bias against any potential inquiry simply because such an inquiry would be politically uncomfortable.  Making such charges is dishonest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300012#K00200","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1372848600,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fleming for putting his finger on the kernel of the problem.

I do not agree that there should be a 40-40 split, that the Chairman should be a member of the Opposition or that a Government Deputy should hold that position.  I am of the view that this matter is no longer suitable to be examined by a committee of inquiry comprising Oireachtas Members.  I say this for a specific and obvious reason, namely, that I cannot think of any Oireachtas Member who has not already stated quite categorically how he or she feels about the underlying issues relating to this matter.  Neither can I think of one who has not made statements about bankers - such statements are almost always in the negative - which will provoke those witnesses who are going to be called at a later stage, namely, bankers and civil servants, into going to the Four Courts.  It is common knowledge that bankers and well-off existing and former civil servants are already equipping themselves with well-heeled lawyers as they prepare to injunct this inquiry.<\/p><p>That is what will happen and what will delay it for a considerable length of time.  It may mean this inquiry goes the way of other Oireachtas inquiries such as the Abbeylara, the mini-CTC signalling project and the Callely inquiries.  Oireachtas inquiries have a very poor record of coming to any conclusions because they end up down on the quays in the Four Courts.  This inquiry, whatever about the other ones which have preceded it, will inevitably end up in the courts and it may be stalled or stopped.  That will be particularly true because of its membership.  This issue has reached a point where it is impossible to find any Member of the Oireachtas - I do not know if it is possible to find one who has not spoken about the banking issue - who has not given hostage to fortune and it will end up in the Four Courts which may mean the inquiry comes to a sticky end and ends in a fiasco.  That is a real difficulty we have here.<\/p><p> While Deputy Sean Fleming addressed the issue by going 40-40, he was wrong to accept the premise that will somehow produce a fair result.  This issue is deeply politicised at this stage.  It is an open goal for many Members of the Oireachtas to be on this inquiry and to kick their opponents in the political solar plexus.  We know that is what will happen, that there will be a Government majority on this inquiry and that it will dictate the terms of reference, the result, the tone and so on.  It will be impossible for the Oireachtas to hold what is suggested will be an impartial inquiry.<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Sean Fleming that the statement by the Taoiseach last week was the height of irresponsibility and that it actually torpedoed this inquiry in one phrase.  &quot;Axis of collusion&quot; was a clever phrase and a good soundbite and it went down very well, but it said that this inquiry will look at Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party and others and that it will connect them automatically with what happened.  The Taoiseach may well be right but he should not have said it because it immediately turned this into a massive political football.<\/p><p> As night follows day, it is inevitable that the day this inquiry opens with whatever number of Oireachtas Members are on it, there will be grandstanding.  We will all do it, if it is necessary, in front of the cameras.  People will accuse their political opponents of one thing or another.  If the Taoiseach is called before the inquiry, of course, the members of Fianna F&aacute;il will put him under extraordinary pressure and if a member of Fianna F&aacute;il is called before the inquiry, as will happen, the Fine Gael and the Labour Party members will put him or her under enormous pressure.  They should be put under pressure but not by their political opponents.  That is the real danger of this inquiry.  It should be taken out of the political arena if it is to have any credibility at all.<\/p><p> Oireachtas Members are unsuitable for this type of inquiry because of their very nature.  They deal in the currency of attracting votes and media attention.  They are elected to advocate and legislate but not necessarily to use a very important issue of this sort to batter their opponents.  It has already been politicised by the Taoiseach.<\/p><p> I am also worried about the timetable of this inquiry.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, said it would take two years, which would be particularly close to an electoral timetable.  If this is to be to the advantage of anyone, because of not being in power, the Government members will benefit from this.  That may well be fair but to time this to coincide with the next general election is deeply suspicious and I worry about that.<\/p><p> I worry about this simply being a political trial of political opponents.  It is no good to say findings of fact, which are adverse, cannot be made.  The terms of reference might be designed in such a way that it looks suspiciously like turning out to be a kangaroo court.  That is not what we should have and it makes me doubt whether people are really serious about finding out the facts and that they see this as a powerful political vehicle and nothing else.<\/p><p> If we are going to restrict its terms of reference up to the night of the guarantee, and as we are looking into banking and how it is practised, why can we not look into how it is practised today and not just under one Administration?  What happened under the last Administration was indefensible but what is important is that this Administration also comes under scrutiny, if it is to be fair.  Serious questions need to be asked as to whether the banks have reformed in any way since the night of the guarantee in 2008.  The question the Government is asking here is a legitimate one but there are equally legitimate ones as to whether it has reformed the banking system and the relationship between Government, senior civil servants and the banks in the way it should have done by this stage.<\/p><p> I want to know happened and how decisions were made about the liquidation of Anglo Irish Bank.  I was here on the night, as were many other Members, and it was chaotic.

We have been working on this Bill for a considerable length of time - since the rejection by the people of the referendum in 2011 - to structure a framework for the holding of constitutional inquiries.  One or two Deputies opposite seem to be under the illusion that this is a measure to set up a particular inquiry into one particular issue.  It is overarching legislation which will structure how inquiries are to be conducted by this House and by the other House in the future, including inquiries in regard to the impeachment of judges, the impeachment of the President, should it ever arise, and inquiries into legislation and on the gathering and presenting of facts.  It is not legislation designed for one impending inquiry.

If the normal balance of the people, or the votes cast in the last election, are reflected, it is seen by these people as somehow crushing their democratic right to have their voices uniquely heard.  That even applies to those Members with platforms elsewhere who have vented their views very clearly.<\/p><p> I dealt with the issue in amendment No. 3 on Committee Stage, and I perfectly understand the Deputy's intentions with regard to the composition of the committee of inquiry.  In section 19 of the Bill, it can be seen that we have addressed this as far as is practicable.  In essence, the reasoning behind the Bill is for committees of inquiry to be determined by this and the other House and not to be dictated by the Executive.  Section 19(2)(<i>g<\/i>) states, &quot;to the extent practicable, achieving a balance between committee members as regards their respective political affiliations&quot;, and that is captured as part of the Bill's proposals.<\/p><p> Similarly, with regard to amendment No. 4, it is not appropriate to dictate in legislation that forever more, every single inquiry to be conducted by the House under any of the provisions of the legislation, either into the impeachment of a judge or any matter of fact, should have a chair from the Opposition, even if it is demonstrably suitable for a member of the Government parties.  That is wrong and it should be a matter for the House to decide.  The underlying principle of the Bill, in so far as it is possible, is to confer on the Houses the autonomy to regulate and manage the conduct of inquiries.  The House is the determinant of who should chair a committee and the balance to be had on that committee.  All through the debate I have argued that it is inappropriate for a Whip system to operate with regard to Part 2 inquiries under this legislation.  Each member of an inquiry team is obliged to find individually, with findings appropriate to the evidence heard.  It is the same process as that carried out by a juror.<\/p><p> Neither of the amendments is appropriate.  We can be myopic and seek to focus on the likely first inquiry, trying to craft legislation to suit it as opposed to what is intended in this Bill.  The Supreme Court Abbeylara judgment made a very clear requirement on the State to lay out rules for inquiry.  I was at the Supreme Court and the High Court and one of the big criticisms was that we did not set out clearly the procedures to leave citizens sure that there would be safe and constitutional channels dealing with inquiries.<\/p><p> Deputy Fleming made much of the notion of institutional bias.  In the Abbeylara judgment, the Supreme Court indicated that the Houses can conduct a legitimate inquiry and rejected the idea that, intrinsically, because of the point referred to by Deputy Ross, politicians are somehow institutionally biased because that is the nature of the trade.  That has already been rejected by the Supreme Court as untrue.  Inquiries of the Houses allow Members to be involved in this type of investigation as long as they are on a sound constitutional basis.  We have set out in this legislation the constitutional pillars allowing for inquiries.  In her Supreme Court judgment, Mrs. Justice McGuinness stated:<blockquote>Members of the Oireachtas have been given highly important constitutional duties; they have been elected by their constituents to fulfil these duties.  If whether under Statute or otherwise they have been properly mandated to carry out an inquiry, I consider that they cannot be disabled from so doing by an automatic assumption of objective bias.<\/blockquote>That is a clear provision.<\/p><p> I absolutely reject the contention of Deputy Ross that somehow this particular Parliament is so uniquely infirm that it cannot do what every other Parliament does as a matter of course.  It is a poor judgment of Members of this and the other House if the Deputy truly believes that.  This House can be as forthright, clear, objective, thorough, professional and parliamentary as the House of Commons, the Assembl&eacute;e nationale in Paris or any other parliament that does this work as a matter of routine.  In the Westminster model, people make clear differences between what goes on at Prime Minister's question time with its associated rough and tumble and the nitty-gritty work of inquiry that goes on in committee rooms.  People there would not make the sort of assertions that have been made here on these matters.<\/p><p> I agree with much of what Deputy McDonald said and there are net issues to be inquired into.  With the referendum, we sought to allow conclusions to be adduced by a committee on the basis of evidence given.  The people did not accept that proposal so what is not acceptable is the assigning of culpability with regard to any matter that is not the proper remit of the Oireachtas under the Constitution as determined by the Supreme Court.  That still gives us enormous scope.<\/p><p> We can deal with the banking inquiry as it is likely to the be first up.  The people of Ireland did not need any editorial comment to come to their own conclusions on the evidence of the tapes presented.  I will not say too much about a banking inquiry as I do not want to stray from the generality of our provisions.  People want to know the facts in a banking inquiry and there is no need for politicians to come to a conclusion, assigning guilt to a person or persons.  They want to know what happened, and the facts can be put into the public domain by calling all those involved in the run-up to the debacle of a decision made in 2008 to explain the circumstances.  I do not want to be drawn into that debate in the short time we have as we can have that discussion when there are proposals to establish an inquiry.  I am anxious that it should be done and there is an historic requirement for this and the other House to prove themselves capable of doing that kind of investigation and the people's work.  They have risen to the challenge in the past.  With this legislation we are crafting an overarching Bill designed to allow us a variety of types of inquiry, and it sets out the scope, terms and rights of people involved in this.<\/p><p> Deputy Ross made two other points, with the first related to the timeframe and how long would be the process.  I do not know and the decision is not for me.  When it comes to shaping any inquiry, the thrust of the legislation is to hand the authority to the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>The Oireachtas can be assertive in these matters and determine the terms of reference, the membership and the chair.  There should be some debate about that.  There will have to be proportionality in respect of it in accordance with the terms of this Bill.  I know it is another nice handy sound-bite but there is no question of there being a kangaroo court.  We saw posters about that the last time.  There will be no kangaroo court because culpability cannot be assigned in respect of any matter.  Those are the confines within which an inquiry must work under the Constitution.  <\/p><p> In respect of the two-year period, since a committee can only have a horizon of the duration of this Parliament, that would be the horizon.  I hope any committee established to look at the banking situation would have different modules of work to do.  <\/p><p> In respect of extending the scope of it to the current situation, I am sure another article will come out about that.  That can be done at any time by the current Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of current banking oversight.  There is a need to get on with that.  It should be the normal bread and butter of any finance committee's work.  It could hear from the Minister for Finance, who would be delighted to attend, and the Governor of the Central Bank and anybody else the committee wished to ask any questions about.  What we need to do is have robust legislation that expands as much as it can but lives within the confines of the Constitution to enable this D&aacute;il to have inquiries into matters of public concern and to stand the test of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300013#L00800","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372850400,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I will be concise and to the point.  The Minister's final remarks let the cat out of the bag about this inquiry because he was responding to the remark about what happened after the night of the guarantee.  He said it was up to the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to do that at any stage.  The implication was that he, as a Government Minister, and this Government will not allow the Oireachtas to do that if the Oireachtas so chooses.  The Minister said it is a matter for the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  Clearly, he does not intend for it to be done by the inquiry committee.  Leaving it to the Oireachtas committee means the Government will dominate it.<\/p><p>  I agree with the Minister about institutional bias.  Of course, we can impeach a President or judge.  We are not inherently biased except that the Taoiseach demonstrated inherent bias and abused the privilege of this House by essentially making criminal charges and allegations of collusion.  If he believes there is collusion and that criminal charges should be brought, he should refer the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.  I was very much in favour of this Oireachtas undertaking a banking inquiry until the Taoiseach started showing the true colour of this Government in respect of its sole function regarding what an inquiry is about.  <\/p><p>  I will finally move on to remarks made by Sinn F&eacute;in, whose spokespersons said we were offended by this.  I am putting this on the record because I have refrained from saying it before in connection with the remark about us being offended by our relationship with Anglo Irish Bank.  I will take no lecture from any member of Sinn F&eacute;in about how to deal with banks.  It is a party whose associates carried out several armed robberies in this State and the Six Counties.  Their associates raided the Northern Bank, robbed post offices and killed members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the process.  I will never take a lecture on how to deal with a bank from any member of Sinn F&eacute;in in or outside this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300015#N00200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1372850400,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I joined this debate because I have concerns that if we are talking about trying to get to the truth of the matter - the Minister says the first inquiry will probably be the banking inquiry, which is the obvious one of public interest - and if it is the Oireachtas that decides these things, it is the Oireachtas and not the Minister or anybody else which decides which inquiry will be the first one.  I assume it will be in the context of what we are talking about.  There will be inherent bias in it.  Let us be very clear.  The reason the Irish people rejected the Government's amendment in 2011 was because it believes it will be impossible for this D&aacute;il and Seanad, as presently constructed, to have impartial investigations that can come to conclusions, find fact and report.  They do not trust the current situation with political partisanship shown on a continual basis.  I spoke against that referendum for that specific reason.  I do not believe that one could find and record fact because we are inherently partisan in our commentary here on a continual basis.  I can assure the Minister that there is no Deputy on any side of this House who has not made utterances that would prejudice their views in the context of an inquiry.  The Minister referred to what former Supreme Court Justice Catherine McGuinness said in her response in the Abbylara case.  The Minister should know the Abbylara case very well because he was a central character in the judgment.<\/p><p>  The bottom line here is that if people are mandated to inquire, the difficulty is that one must go to the people to seek a mandate.  We are now establishing an inquiry halfway through a D&aacute;il term and will be in a position where we could as an Oireachtas be inquiring into very serious matters of public importance and the inquiry then falls because of the holding of an election.  For the next two years plus, we could be discussing the banking inquiry, going through the whole process, bringing in witnesses, using the available information in the context of the Nyberg and Honohan reports and bringing in all the central figures involved.  Then the Labour lads walk out the door and bring down the Government and the entire inquiry falls.  It is perplexing.  If there was a fixed-term Parliament, one might have some chance.  However, we will have modules and, obviously, the political modules will be first.  That will take us up to a certain period of time.  After that, we will have other characters that will be central to any proper, thorough investigation.  However, when a Parliament falls, that is the end of the inquiry.  The inquiry cannot even finalise the report because there is an election.<\/p><p>  That is an inherent flaw in this legislation and if nothing else, the Government should look to see that there are some obligations somewhere along the line that a report must be finalised at a certain period of time.  We do not have fixed parliamentary terms.  Other European jurisdictions and the US have fixed parliamentary terms.  This inquiry system could lead to people being brought in and certain slants put on it from a political perspective and there might not be an opportunity for a person to present themselves because an election has been called.  That is inherently unfair and wrong.  <\/p><p>  The Irish people were very clear in their decision on an amendment sponsored by the Government.  The Minister does not even have faith in this legislation and the reason why he has no faith in it is because he is already saying that the Government might revisit the constitutional referendum put forward previously.  If this is the belt and braces inquiry the Government is talking about, why is it even talking about the need to have another referendum?  It is because this is false and failed in the sense that it would not uncover the truth in respect of any investigation, not just the banking inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300015#N00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1372850400,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Could I ask the Deputy to confine himself to the amendments before the House?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300015#N00400","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1372850400,"counter":383,"content":"<p>We will have two years of a banking inquiry and then have an election and the inquiry will probably not even report.

We appreciate that and respect the fact that the Government spent the first year in office preparing for a referendum that it did not win.

As the Minister is aware, this is common practice in many European parliaments.  Seven European parliaments have in place a system whereby between one quarter and one third of their parliament is sufficient to instigate a parliamentary inquiry.  In Germany it is just one quarter.  I have article 44 of the basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany which states the Bundestag shall have the right, and on the motion of one quarter of its members, the duty to establish a committee of inquiry which shall take the requisite evidence at public hearings.  I think it is important.  We know it is common practice in some well-functioning democracies.  For the Germans it is 25%.  As I said to the Minister on Committee Stage, I am not hung up on whether it is 25%, 35% or even 40% but I would not go above 40%.  Listening to the previous debate on the banking inquiry and inherent bias I am all the more convinced that something of that nature would be very useful in order to instil some public trust that these kinds of inquiries are being set up for the right reasons.<\/p><p>  The Minister made a comment that the Oireachtas can do whatever Westminster does.  We have seen some excellent inquiries there, for example, the Leveson inquiry, among others.  The Minister said we have to prove this House capable of doing the normal work of parliaments.  Unfortunately, due to the stranglehold which the Fianna F&aacute;il Cabinet had for years over the D&aacute;il, and which the Fine Gael and Labour Cabinet now exerts over the D&aacute;il, this House cannot do the normal work of Parliament.

Last year in Westminster Government MPs voted against the Government 40% of the time and they did not lose the Whip.  This is the only parliament in the democratic world that is run like this.

It is reciprocated.  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform has just set up a sub-committee to examine taxation loopholes, at my request.  It will be important work.  At our first meeting only one Government Deputy showed up.  When Government Deputies show up on Committee Stage they are not allowed to speak or table amendments against the Government.

I tabled the amendment because of my concerns.  The Minister outlined the concerns people have on the basis that 58% of the people who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the referendum wanted the Oireachtas to have the power to inquire into issues.  Everyone across the House agrees it should have such power.  One of the main concerns, as highlighted by Members on this side of the House during the referendum campaign, and it is highlighted in the poll results, is that the inquiries could be seen as being politically motivated and orchestrated by a Government to have, in effect, political show trials.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 8 is an attempt to try to ease that situation, in that it provides that a proposal for an inquiry to be held would not pass unless two thirds of recognised Opposition Deputies supported it.  This would provide a safeguard against the Executive dominating the establishment of inquiries in the House.<\/p><p> The Minister's responses to the other amendments were interesting.  He constantly referred to the Oireachtas being able to do what it wanted.  However, the fact of the matter is that it cannot.  The Executive controls the House.  The Executive decides what goes on the Order Paper, what is discussed and whether something is guillotined.  It governs the House's workings.  There may be 113 or so Government Deputies, but only 15 of them have any power in the House.  This is the problem, and is what the people saw when they considered the potential risks in the referendum.  The Bill can get us over the problem if amendment No. 8 is accepted so that, if a majority of Opposition Deputies are in favour, an inquiry can go ahead.  This amendment should be taken on board.<\/p><p> This is an important matter, as the Oireachtas should be able to inquire into the issues in question in the same way as obtains in Westminster and elsewhere.  Our inquiries should be quick, strong and reach findings.  We and the people need to be able to see that inquiries are fair and not controlled by the Executive.  In the parliaments of seven European countries, a small number of members can ensure that an inquiry is held.<\/p><p> Regarding constitutionality, the legislation provides in section 13 that the House shall make rules and Standing Orders on voting in inquiries.  Amendment No. 8 is in line with that section.

This is unconstitutional for the reasons that I have given.  Even were this proposition constitutional, I would reject it.  I have been longer on the Opposition benches than I have been on the Government benches in this House.  There is almost a flavour emerging that, somehow, the Government side is inherently political and would act politically and the Opposition side does not act politically.  I have served long years on both sides of the House.  My experience is that the temptation to act politically is not the universal prerogative on either side.<\/p><p>  In terms of what is right, we must respect the vote of the people and their democratic decisions.<\/p><p>  Deputy Donnelly gave a dissertation on the role of the Whips.  He is a new Independent.  I entered politics because I was interested in a political party.  Originally, I did not expect to be an elected Member, but I subscribe to the views of the party and we debate vigorously within it.  We are not sole traders.  I do not stand in the Chamber as a sole trader.  I must argue my case within the confines of the parliamentary party first and, ultimately, within the confines of the conference of my party, which makes policy.  The notion that we are all sole traders and that everyone can amble in here as he or she pleases is not how political parties work.  It is not normally the way for Fianna F&aacute;il.  Except when the exigencies of the situation, shall we say kindly, require it to be otherwise, Fianna F&aacute;il normally requires the consensus view within the party to prevail.  If one is a member of any organisation, one can have a vigorous democratic debate, but once the majority decides, that decision becomes the organisation's policy.  We are not sole traders.  I understand that it is difficult for people outside the political party system to understand that.

However, it is a bit like coming to a meeting of the flat earth society.  One comes in here and everybody says, \"No, it has to be done this way, it couldn't possibly happen any other way\".  When one says that it happens successfully in this \"impossible\" way in other parliaments, we are told: \"No, it couldn't possibly work.  There'd be chaos.  All the debate has to happen within the parties and away from the public.\"<\/p><p>  Heaven forbid that in our national parliament Deputies in the same party would be allowed to disagree with each other.  The reality is that the current rules, which give an Irish Cabinet more control over Parliament than in any other developed country, suit whoever comes into power.  The Minister spent a long time in opposition and railed against a lot of these things.  The programme for Government aimed to get rid of the guillotine system, but once in power the Government chose to keep it.  In fact, it is being used three times today because it is useful.  They use it on all the sensitive Bills because it is useful.  When a Government gets into power, Ministers consider that this level of control is pretty useful.  They quite like it and want to keep it.<\/p><p>  On national radio recently, the Government Chief Whip described the Government's efforts at political reform as deplorable.  The result is that nobody trusts us.  The Irish people trust us less than virtually anyone else in the developed world trusts their politicians.  That is because they know, when they are listening to Government Deputies, or Opposition Deputies in parties, that they are not necessarily hearing what those people believe.  On radio and television, and in here, I have debated issues with good Government backbenchers.  I have listened to them discuss points, although before the debate they have told me they do not agree with them.  Yet they have to toe the line and say that I am completely wrong.  That is the way it is.  They know they are not representing their own views.  The people are not stupid and they know it as well.  <\/p><p>  The Minister's argument is that the Government will do the right thing if there is an overwhelming demand from the people, but what happens if there is not an overwhelming demand?  What happens if it is a really important issue that we in the House know should be investigated, but the public do not really care about it because it is boring and technical?  The Government will not investigate these things. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300019#R01200","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1372852800,"counter":456,"content":"<p>We will have this debate again.

Let me be very clear - children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to this support on precisely the same criteria as they did last year.

That was agreed but, unfortunately, it has been reneged on.  I have before me a letter from one parent who has three children attending the newly amalgamated school.

I cannot quite understand why history teachers are so fearful that their subject is suddenly going to be abandoned.  As Deputy O'Sullivan will be aware from her professional background, in the traditional free voluntary sector the subject is compulsory in many schools.  However, throughout the entire spectrum of the 723 post-primary schools in the country it is not compulsory, yet 90% of pupils study it.  There is clear evidence to suggest that if the curriculum, in terms of what is required to be studied by different students, is too prescriptive and does not allow for different interests to be expressed, then there would be early departures from the system.  That would be a negative effect that I have no wish to bring about either.  Anyway, I have every conference in the interest that Irish people have in history to ensure that the vast bulk of them will continue to study the subject, but not only as a project in transition year.  That is not the intention.

However, the fear remains that it will not convey all the skills involved with the teaching of history, including literacy, numeracy, analysis, critical thinking and the question of how can we know who we are as a people unless we know where we have come from.  It is also important in terms of teaching bias and the role of the media.  I do not believe all of that will come across under the new proposal.

In the past year, more than half or approximately 20,000 students did not get paid their first grant instalment until the new year.  Parents and families have experienced exceptional hardship in a difficult time with the single biggest cause of hardship being the mishandling by the Minister and his Department of the nationalisation and centralisation of the system for administering grants.  In addition, the Government has claimed repeatedly throughout that process that the students were at fault by not providing documentation.  This was the standard response to which they were obliged to listen whenever they came up against the wall of not getting an answer regarding their grant applications.<\/p><p>  The current position, after examinations are finished, is that almost 500 students remain within the appeals system and 133 students still await a decision.  In many such cases, these students are having difficulty in accessing the examination results.  I will provide the Minister with one particular example, in which a postgraduate student was not able to access either the examination result or the college facilities to complete the dissertation.

SUSI only came into operation for undergraduates last year for the first time.  The rest of those students were dealing with 66 separate bodies that were brought together.  Incidentally, they were not nationalised.  The Deputy's County Donegal colleague brought in the legislation to combine all the separate 66 individual grant-aiding bodies.  In many cases, the actual performance was worse than the average outcome.  There is a problem with SUSI, which is the reason a special study was made of it and is the reason I am making available additional resources.

As the Minister is aware, it is often the case that two, three or four schools may be obliged to come together in order to make up a resource teaching post.

However, it is crucial in terms of ensuring standards and giving students a fair benchmark of their progression.  My concern is that if we remove it, how do we ensure uniform standards?

It is only to a certain extent that the education budget has been ring-fenced, as each departmental budget must amount to an overall targeted total of public expenditure.  The reason for this target is our current position of deficit, where we are borrowing money to provide public services.  We are raising taxes and many people are struggling and finding it difficult, so we do not want to put any more of a burden on them, so to speak, in their outgoings.  We must try to find savings within the education budget as a result, which is of the order of &euro;8 billion.

In that case there may have been two DEIS schools beside one another with one having more resources than the other because it got its resources earlier.  When that attempt at levelling the field provoked a reaction - I understand the reasons the reaction was clear and sincere - we altered the decision, and I have done so again in this case.

I accept that this week is an extraordinary one in that there is a Committee Stage debate so I ask the Minister of State to pass on my comments to the Minister and I would welcome a response if there is a further one.  I tabled this Topical Debate matter on a number of occasions, possibly eight or ten, and it has now been selected.  What prompted me to do so was the fact that on 19 May 2013, a 46-year-old man died in Naas.  This individual may well not have survived but there was a very long delay in the ambulance arriving at the scene.  He was with his 14-year-old daughter, which makes the situation even more tragic.  Garda&iacute; were on the scene quite quickly and were able to revive him but the delay in the ambulance getting there certainly did not give him the chance he needed.  I am told by people working in the ambulance service that one must get to somebody within the first eight minutes or get them to a hospital within eight minutes for them to stand the best possible chance of surviving.<\/p><p>  There have been some modifications to the ambulance services in Kildare.  On this occasion, there were two ambulances available.  The hospital is only a kilometre from where this happened.  One ambulance was out on a call while the paramedic in the second one had to go home ill so that second ambulance was not available.  The delay happened because there was no back-up ambulance.<\/p><p>  People might not understand how large County Kildare is but it is the fourth most populated county in the country with a population of 210,000.  I fully accept that developments like the call centre and other examples of centralising services can produce efficiencies but one must have an ambulance and a back-up ambulance within a realistic distance and properly staffed to make sure this scenario does not happen.<\/p><p>Is there a modelling system for the changes in ambulance cover which have taken place?  I have no doubt an inquiry will take place into this tragedy and we will await the report.<\/p><p> I certainly do not want to give any indication I am criticising the ambulance workers.  They can only drive and staff what is in front of them.  If there is no ambulance they cannot magic it up.  I wonder whether they are being put at risk when they try to arrive within the designated call-out time.<\/p><p> There is little point in us developing our hospital services when there is a question as to whether the ancillary services are capable of getting people to the hospital in time in an emergency.  Some of the cover in Kildare has been withdrawn and it is quite difficult to figure out what ambulance cover is now available.  Some of it comes from hospitals in Blanchardstown and the fire brigade service.  We need to know what is the cover.  We must examine the call-out times and receive assurance there is backup if someone is out sick.  People are being put at risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300029#CC02000","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372858800,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and I ask her to accept the apologies of the Minister for Health and the Ministers of State at that Department.  Like Deputy Murphy, I extend our deepest sympathies to the family of the deceased.  The loss of a loved one is hard for family and friends at any time, but a sudden and unexpected death is particularly difficult.<\/p><p>  The response of the HSE national ambulance service to the incident was incorrectly reported.  In addition, claims have been made, based on this incorrect information, which can, unfortunately, only deepen the distress of this poor person's family.  I will outline the facts.  The ambulance service received a 999 emergency call at 7.47 a.m. on 19 May 2013, concerning an incident on the ring road between Naas and Newbridge, near a Garda station.  Local garda&iacute;, as the first personnel on scene, provided first response treatment.  An emergency ambulance was available and was dispatched to the incident.  The ambulance arrived at 8.03 a.m. which was within 16 minutes of receipt of the call.  A second emergency ambulance, with an advanced paramedic, was also dispatched, arriving within 19 minutes of the call at 8.06 a.m.  <\/p><p>  The response time of the first emergency ambulance was within the national response time target of 18 minutes and 59 seconds for a patient-carrying vehicle, as set by the Health Information and Quality Authority.  The newspaper involved subsequently printed an apology and retraction, admitting its claims on the ambulance response time, staffing levels at the time of the incident, staff management and plans for coverage in the area were incorrect.  Similarly, inaccurate claims have been made in the media in a number of recent tragic incidents, contributing further to the distress of the families and staff involved.  In one of these other cases, a national newspaper published a retraction and an apology to the ambulance service.<\/p><p>  A significant reform programme is under way to reconfigure the way the HSE manages and delivers pre-hospital care services, to ensure a clinically driven, nationally co-ordinated system, supported by improved technology.  This includes progressing a number of efficiencies arising from Labour Court recommendations on rostering arrangements.  The ambulance service and trade unions have concluded discussions on roster changes at 30 ambulance stations throughout the country, including 11 stations in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  The new rostering arrangements have been implemented in a large number of stations, including Tallaght, Swords, Maynooth, Kildare and Wicklow, and these are operating successfully.<\/p><p>  These changes mean resources can be deployed dynamically, based on need and demand patterns, rather than simply by station location.  The greater flexibility and responsiveness will produce better response times, and help to ensure a clinically driven, nationally co-ordinated system to support all pre-hospital emergency care activity in the State, as set out under Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Health Reform in Ireland 2012-2015.<\/p><p>  I assure the Deputy the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, will receive her comments and I fully acknowledge she is not criticising the service with regard to the facts as she saw them and as she raised them here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300030#DD00200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1372858800,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I accept the information delivered by the HSE on the time the call was made and the time the ambulance arrived.  I do not dispute this information but having to wait 16 minutes when one is 1 km away from a hospital, which one can almost see, while a number of garda&iacute; are at the scene trying to revive somebody knowing they do not have the equipment which would be in an ambulance does not give a person the best possible chance.  I am using this tragic case to question whether this could happen again.<\/p><p>  There seems to have been a failure with regard to the back-up.  I wish to know about the back-up provided in general and not just in this particular case. It is all very well to speak about dynamic rostering but if extra ambulance cover for Naas needs to be provided from the far side of Dublin or Athy then the system is failing.  How is this modelled?  Must we wait and see whether tragic outcomes arise and then state it is a failure?  This is the wrong way to go about it.  I would like reassurance on how the process works with regard to the deployment of people to cover sick leave because this will happen.<\/p><p>  The ambulance service in Maynooth has been taken off each Thursday and instead a paramedic on a motorbike is deployed.  This is better than nothing but it is not the same level of cover and it may be inappropriate cover in some situations.  The ambulance service is a critical part of the health service and if we do not get it right it does not matter how high-tech the hospital is because if one does not arrive at the hospital one does not have a chance.

Recently Deputy Hannigan and I met representatives of the north east federation of salmon anglers to discuss their legitimate concerns about the implementation of the catch and release policy and some of the assumptions underlying it.  Clubs such as the Drogheda and District Anglers Club, the Rossin, Slane and District Angling Club and the Dee and Glyde club and others see themselves as responsible custodians of the river.<\/p><p>They have been raising concerns for some time about the methodology applied to many rivers in Louth and Meath which have, essentially, copperfastened the catch-and-release policy since 2006.  As the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, is aware, the fishermen want to work in partnership with Inland Fisheries Ireland.  They have asked questions about the methodology applied that in their view have yet to be adequately addressed by the authorities.

It is very important that we get the catch-and-release system right.  As Deputy Nash said, there is currently contention as to whether we are correctly measuring the amount of fish in the rivers.<\/p><p>  I wrote to the Minister of State on the matter last April and I received a reply from him.  He referred to the forecast model used to identify the number of fish in the rivers.  In the Glyde river the forecast is approximately 19% of the conservation limit for salmon and it is 27% for the River Dee.  From speaking to fishermen locally who know the rivers in question, they think the figures are very low.  All we seek is that the officials would speak again to local fishermen and try to come up with a revised methodology and that both sides can agree on the exact number of fish in the rivers based on as close an estimate as possible.

Ciaran Byrne, chief executive officer of Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, has always made himself available to everyone concerned.  He has visited on Friday afternoons and on Wednesdays.  He has gone to Dundalk.  His senior management team has met on a number of occasions with interested parties.  The first point is very clear, the IFI and I are very happy to meet and to look at all the facts.  However, we must deal with the facts and they are as I will outline.<\/p><p>  First, it is not true to say, as Deputy Nash said, that there is no fishing on the Boyne.  There is fishing on the Boyne on a catch-and-release basis.  That allows people to fish and to catch but it does not allow them to keep.  The Deputy is probably misinformed in that respect.<\/p><p>  The standing scientific committee for salmon has identified 143 rivers throughout the country which contain 152 fisheries, as some rivers have other tributaries.  In 2013, a total of 94 fisheries were open for angling.  Of these, 62 fisheries are open because there was a surplus of fish.  A total of 32 fisheries are classified as open for angling on a catch-and-release basis only and 58 fisheries are closed as they have no surplus of fish.<\/p><p>  In 2006, the Government committed to alignment with the scientific advice and moved to restrict the harvest of fish to those which meet the conservation limits.  The effect of this advice was that the mixed stock fisheries were closed.  Indiscriminate mixed stock salmon fishing at sea was ceased, that is, drift netting at sea was effectively stopped.<\/p><p>  There are five salmon rivers in the Dundalk district which are scientifically assessed on an annual basis, the River Flurry, the River Fane, the Castletown River, the River Dee and the River Glyde.  Only one salmon river in the Drogheda district is scientifically assessed on an annual basis and that is the River Boyne.  In 2013, one of these six rivers, the River Fane, is open for the harvesting of salmon.  Of the remainder, the River Flurry is closed to all angling, and the remainder the River Boyne, the River Glyde, the Castletown river and the River Dee are open for catch and release angling.<\/p><p>  This country manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis due to the fact that each river contains a genetically unique stock, which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn.  The conservation imperative means that exploitation of salmon in each river is only permitted where the independent standing scientific committee for salmon, SSCS, which includes expertise from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, the Loughs Agency, LA, the ESB, and the Marine Institute, MI, determine that the stock in that river is above the conservation limit.  The decision is not a political or administrative decision; it is based on science.  The conservation limits are set out in the reply.<\/p><p>  Significant analysis has been carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland through the use of catchment wide electro-fishing to determine salmon fry abundance.  In other words, it is not just based on conservation figures, as experts carry out tests in the fisheries to establish whether some fish were not identified.  Further research is carried out to establish that.  The goal of IFI is to protect the stock and to make it available for the future.  If the conservation limit is exceeded, it is possible to catch and keep fish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300031#EE00500","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1372859400,"counter":634,"content":"<p>The Minister of State must conclude now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300031#EE00600","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1372859400,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I will respond in more detail as I am entitled to a further two minutes following the supplementary questions.

The level of activity is certainly not the same as it used to be.  That is understandable given the catch-and-release policy.<\/p><p>  Essentially, what Deputy Hannigan and I suggest is that the policy would be further reviewed and that IFI would continue to work on a partnership basis with local anglers to try to achieve the best possible outcome from a conservation point of view, which is extremely important, and also from the point of view of fishermen, current and future, who wish to engage in angling and to see a situation where they can at least aspire to having a catch-and-keep system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300031#EE00800","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1372859400,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comments and the fact that he is happy to meet anglers.

The clarity is in the figures.  In terms of opening a river for catch-and-keep fishing, the Flurry river is at 23% of its conservation limit, which is well below the required level.  Even if only every second fish was being counted, the level would only be at 46%, which is not even half the level required to catch and keep fish.  We must deal with the facts.  I would be very happy to meet with the Deputies concerned and to arrange for the provision of any data they or the fishermen have not received.<\/p><p>  In summary, 32 fisheries in this country operate on a catch-and-release basis and to unilaterally open the four rivers in the Drogheda and Dundalk districts to harvesting would set a dangerous precedent that would ultimately compromise the entire scientific process to which the Government agreed to commit in 2006.  In short, the rivers are open for catch-and-release angling and therefore there are angling opportunities for all anglers.  A small minority believe they should be able to take fish and they do not wish to engage in the conservation-focused practice of releasing fish.

As she recalls, she informed me at an Oireachtas committee meeting last July that the audit had been completed and that the report was being prepared, yet the report had been completed three months previously by the consultant, Ms Lynne Peyton.  Frustratingly, Ms Peyton discussed the audit's conclusions at a conference in Belfast whereas it took 14 months for the HSE to publish the report.<\/p><p>  Since 2005, there have been warnings about inadequate resources and calls for additional social workers in Roscommon to deal with child protection and neglect cases.  It was a time of affluence and there appeared to be no shortage of money in some quarters, yet child protection referrals in Roscommon trebled between 2005 and 2009.  The case in Waterford was roughly the same.  The number of neglect cases increased fourfold, but it was 2010 before additional staff were recruited.  At one point, Roscommon was said to be dangerously understaffed.  In Castlerea, the staffing arrangement was described as unsafe.  Social workers in Roscommon had an average caseload of approximately double the national recommended level at 35 versus 17.5.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, threatened to withdraw registration unless staffing issues were addressed.<\/p><p>  This situation was reflected to some extent in all three of the areas focused on in the report, showing a historical lack of suitably qualified social work staff and resources.  In County Roscommon, 180 children have been on a waiting list for psychological services for two years.  Nationally, the report highlighted inadequate provision of protection in the case of one in every five families in the neglect category.  In County Roscommon, that figure was seven out of 30 families.  Nationally, the audit identified 17 families as having been failed miserably by the State.  It is important to remember that the audit only represents a small snapshot of the numbers throughout the country.  That it took 20 to 30 referrals from a number of agencies for a social worker to be appointed is a damning indictment of the national services in terms of the level of priority they give to the issue of neglect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300032#FF00300","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1372860000,"counter":642,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, we once again find ourselves discussing a report on the welfare of children and the inadequacy of the HSE's response.

The report was received by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in May 2013 and was published on the HSE website two weeks ago.<\/p><p>  The report follows the publication in October 2010 of the report of the Roscommon child care inquiry, which catalogued a number of concerns arising from the examination of the management of serious neglect in a family known to the HSE's child protection services.  The findings of that inquiry raised the concern, as Deputy Naughten well knows, that this might not have been an isolated case and that there might be more widespread practice and governance issues in the management of cases of neglect in Roscommon and throughout the country.  That report led to work on a national audit of neglect cases.<\/p><p>  From the outset, it was the intention of the HSE that the neglect audit would comprise a number of phases.  Therefore, the audit was not simply a one-off exercise, but constituted one element of a wider process to improve practice in respect of such cases throughout the country.  For phase 1, which is the report in question, the HSE commissioned the services of Ms Lynne Peyton, an independent consultant in child protection, to complete an initial pilot audit of the Roscommon case.  This pilot was extended to two other areas, those being, Waterford and Dublin south-east, was conducted in early 2012 and was worked on subsequent to completion.  Since completion, the report has acted as an important working document informing preparations for the second and third parts of the process, namely, the workshops and training for staff and the national audit of neglect files that will follow on from this.<\/p><p>  Last August, the attention of HSE social work staff was drawn to the ongoing and systemic impact of neglect as identified in the three audits.  I welcome the report, from which we see that, in practice, neglect and the terrible damage that it can do to children has not been sufficiently identified.  Given the fact that physical and sexual abuse cases have been responded to quickly, it may be a broader societal issue that neglect has not been taken as seriously.  The Roscommon case has sensitised us to the situation, as has this initial audit.  We need to do the rest of the work.  An implementation plan to address the report's recommendations has been developed.  I have details of that plan.<\/p><p>  The report is well worth reading in detail, as it identifies improvements, changes in practice and instances of more attention being paid to neglect.  It is important that these aspects are recognised.  I will provide a number of examples of some of the changes that have occurred.  In Roscommon, there have been developments with respect to the implementation of monthly child care meetings chaired by the general manager, a restructuring of social work teams and the streamlining of family support services to include a single point of entry for referrals.  This is important.  In addition, more than 50 staff in all of the relevant disciplines - Deputy Naughten mentioned psychology - have participated in training on the identification of neglect.  One of the points the report repeatedly made was that it was critical for all disciplines - doctors, social workers and public health nurses - to take neglect more seriously than had been the case traditionally and to realise the damage that it does to children.<\/p><p> In Dublin south east the social work department has been restructured and the new arrangements are working more effectively.  There has been a blitz on the waiting list there and unallocated cases have been significantly reduced.  There are quite a number of other points concerning each area, which are identified in the report.  I want to reassure both Deputies that there has been a follow-up implementation plan.<\/p><p> The audit found that parental alcohol misuse was a factor in 62% of families in the overall sample.  It states that family dysfunction, which ended up with the kind of neglect that both Deputies have described so graphically, was often associated with chronic alcohol and drug abuse.  The audit also found that domestic violence was a key issue, parental mental health issues featured in two thirds of the Dublin cases, and standards of hygiene and physical conditions were unacceptable in more than half the cases.<\/p><p> There is a need to identify neglect at an earlier stage and intervene more effectively.  The report makes the point that many children were left in family settings for too long.  That is a similar finding to the report on child deaths.  The new national approach to managing social work cases involves more streamlined procedures, a national risk-assessment and national standards.  It will make a huge difference to the disturbing findings that were outlined in this report.<\/p><p> In addition, we are currently undertaking the recruitment of new social workers.  Some 84 were recruited recently and the recruitment of a further 90 is under way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300032#FF00500","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372860600,"counter":645,"content":"<p>We owe it to the children at the centre of the Roscommon case to ensure that their courage and bravery is recognised.

My Department's goal is to ensure that children do not fall through the cracks.  That is why we are changing the way these services are being delivered.  We are developing a focused management team and national leadership which was not there before.  I would point out that during the previous ten years, as Deputy Naughten rightly observed, these children were being dealt with like this during the so-called Celtic tiger period.  We must now focus on ensuring that these children and their families get the kind of services they have not received previously.<\/p><p>  The development of the new child and family agency, together with a more structured approach with national standards and greater risk assessment at an earlier stage, will ensure that children will receive a much better service.  The recruitment of social workers is an important part of that.  The 270 social worker posts, which were recommended by the Ryan report to bring social work teams to an appropriate level, have been recruited.  We do have high levels of maternity leave and some sick leave, but recruitment is going on as we speak.  Some 84 social workers have been recruited which has to make a difference to the quality of work that is being done. <\/p><p>  Major efforts are being made by front-line staff.

It vacated rented accommodation and was distressed because it could not recoup a deposit of &euro;2,000 that was due to it from the landlord.  It took great heart when three years ago a determination was made by the PRTB that the deposit should be refunded.  It could not believe, however, that the landlord did not turn up or engage in the process at all.  As a result, it lost heart.  The family's opinion of the PRTB is that it is powerless and useless.

The Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, was established on 1 September 2004 as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  The principal activities of the PRTB include the registration of private residential tenancies and the resolution of disputes between tenants and landlords, as well as the provision of information, assistance and advice to the Minister on the private residential rented sector.<\/p><p>  The mandate of the Private Residential Tenancies Board is defined in section 151 of the Act and can be summarised as follows: the resolution of disputes between tenants and landlords; the registration of particulars in respect of tenancies in the private residential rented sector; the provision to the Minister of advice concerning policy in relation to the private rented sector; the development and publication of guidelines for good practice by those involved in the private rented sector; the collection and provision of information relating to the private rented sector, including information concerning prevailing rent levels; the conduct of research into the private rented sector and monitoring the operation of various aspects of the sector where the board considers it appropriate; the review of the operation of the Act and any related enactments, and the making of recommendations to the Minister for amendments to same and the performance of any additional functions conferred on the board.<\/p><p>  The PRTB received 2,272 adjudication-mediation applications in 2012 and 268 appeals to tribunal.  Deposit retention continued to be the single biggest category of dispute and accounted for 37% of all applications in 2012.  The case referred to by the Deputy is one of those cases.  A tenancy deposit is the property of the tenant.  A landlord is only entitled to retain a deposit where there is damage in excess of normal wear and tear or where there are rent arrears or utility bills outstanding.  In determinations by the PRTB on deposit retention disputes in 2012, 43% of deposits were partially returned to the tenant, 33% were refunded in full and 24% were retained in full by the landlord.  As such, in 76% of cases some or all of the deposit was wrongfully retained by the landlord.<\/p><p>  The commitment in the programme for Government 2011 to establish a tenancy deposit protection scheme is to address the problem raised by the Deputy.  On foot of this commitment, I asked the PRTB to commission research on such a scheme.  The research contract was awarded to Indecon economic consultants.  I received the final report on the topic from Indecon in November last year.  The report presents a comprehensive analysis of the range of options for delivery of the programme for Government commitment.  I am engaging with the Office of the Attorney General with regard to the drafting of proposals to establish a deposit protection scheme with a view to bringing proposals to Government and introducing these provisions on Committee Stage of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 in the Seanad, which Bill the Deputy will be aware was debated in this House earlier on this term.<\/p><p>  The unjustified retention of deposits by landlords is an issue that concerns me greatly and I am very much committed to the establishment of a deposit protection scheme in this jurisdiction.  The establishment of such a scheme was a priority I identified when I was appointed as Minister of State.  I am fully committed to delivering on deposit protection in the context of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012.  As I said earlier, it is proposed to introduce the amendment in the Seanad.  Following, enactment of that Bill there will be a deposit protection scheme in place, which means large numbers of cases, including that referred to by the Deputy, will no longer be required to go directly for arbitration.  The deposit will be held by the scheme, which means a much more simplified system of ensuring deposits are returned unless there is a justified reason for a landlord retaining it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300034#HH00200","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1372861200,"counter":653,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply and proposed solution to the problem.

The purpose is to make an appropriate link with the insolvency provisions contained in the 2012 Act.  In contrast, what amendment No. 3 seeks to do is replace the carefully worded proposal contained in the Bill with a much broader proposal, which would have the effect of rewriting the relevant provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  There is no provision in the Personal Insolvency Act which would allow a court to direct that a personal insolvency arrangement be considered.  A provision of that nature would undermine the voluntary nature of the personal insolvency process.<\/p><p>  Under the 2012 Act, the court has no power of instruction in regard to a voluntary process.  A personal insolvency arrangement can only be proposed by a debtor through a personal insolvency practitioner where a debtor meets the eligibility requirements for such an arrangement and there are sufficient funds available to make some payments to ground a proposal.  The proposed amendment does not have regard to either the context or appropriateness of such a proposal over the debtor's repayment capacity.  In any event, the proposed amendment could not have any lawful effect in binding a creditor.<\/p><p>  In addition, the amendment seems to consider the personal insolvency practitioner to be an officer of the court, which is a fundamental misreading of the legislation.  The personal insolvency practitioner has no role or standing in an application for repossession.  There is no provision in the law to provide for the court to appoint the practitioner as an officer to essentially force a settlement on creditors.<\/p><p>  The provisions outlined in paragraph <i>(d) <\/i>of amendment No. 3 seek to impose a duty on the court with regard to the costs of a personal insolvency arrangement.  Again, this approach would run counter to the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act.  There is no lawful provision to allow for such an approach, nor could one be imposed.<\/p><p>  With regard to amendment No. 5, which proposes an increase in the two month time limit for the adjournment, I remind the House that the Bill includes a provision at section 2(4) which allows the court to consider granting a further adjournment if, by the end of the two month period, it sees real evidence of progress towards a personal insolvency arrangement.  The wording of subsection (4) is as follows: &quot;On the expiry of any period of adjournment granted under <i>subsection (2), <\/i>the court may grant a further adjournment of the proceedings concerned where it considers that significant progress has been made in the preparation of a proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement.&quot;  I emphasise that the subsection provides that a court may grant an adjournment, not where a proposal has been agreed but &quot;where it considers that significant progress has been made in the preparation of a proposal&quot;.  As Deputies will note, the wording refers to the preparation of a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement, in other words, the personal insolvency practitioner has been engaged with the debtor and would have the expertise to ascertain the eligibility of the debtor.  In the two month period of the adjournment, the practitioner may examine the overall background financial circumstances and, where he or she considers that a personal insolvency arrangement is possible, he or she can start preparing a proposal.<\/p><p>  As I indicated, the provision does not stipulate that the personal insolvency arrangement has to be agreed with the person's creditors.  It is a two month period to engage with the personal insolvency practitioner who effectively starts the process of preparing a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement.  The further adjournment provided for in subsection (4) is not time limited in the manner of the adjournment in subsection (2) but is at the discretion of the court.  If it is clear at the end of the two month period that there is no prospect of preparing a proposal because there is no reasonable proposal that could be presented which would facilitate the workings of a personal insolvency arrangement, there will not be a second adjournment.  However, the opportunity exists for this to happen.  <\/p><p>  To put the matter simply, the purpose of the two month period is to enable the debtor to engage a personal insolvency practitioner with a view to the consideration of an application for a personal insolvency arrangement and, within the personal insolvency arrangement process, to apply for a protective certificate under section 96 of the Personal Insolvency Act.  Deputies should be aware that the effect of the protective certificate, which will operate for a period of 70 days, with a possible further extension of 40 days from the date of issue, will be to prevent the creditor whose debts are covered by the certificate from initiating proceedings or continuing with proceedings, even where such proceedings were initiated before the application for the protective certificate was made.  Again, this is an important issue as it provides additional time for matters to be addressed and resolved. <\/p><p>  I stress that what is proposed in this section is something that has never existed in the law in this area in the past.  What we are doing is enacting a provision that provides an additional protection for home owners to bring into play when there is an application for repossession of their principal private residence.  Rather than providing that the courts may grant a repossession order, as they have done under the legislation that was in place until 2009, we are introducing a possibility for the courts to adjourn the case and instruct the debtor to consult a personal insolvency practitioner.  The personal insolvency practitioner can examine the debtor's overall financial circumstances and consider whether there is a reasonable possibility of making a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement.  Moreover, the practitioner can obtain a protective order in the courts which gives the debtor additional protection.  If a proposal is prepared or in the process of being prepared, albeit not necessarily finalised, proceedings to repossess can be adjourned again.  This is a very important protection and reform and one I undertook to introduce when we were dealing with this issue during our discussions on the Personal Insolvency Bill.<\/p><p>  In that context, some of the amendments that have been tabled are unnecessary because we have provided a format that is workable.  When one factors in the protective certificate and interaction with the insolvency legislation, this provides the protection necessary for anyone who has a reasonable prospect of entering into a personal insolvency arrangement.  For all of those reasons, I cannot accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300035#JJ00400","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1372861800,"counter":664,"content":"<p>I apologise again for the absence of Deputy Mac Lochlainn who is chairing a committee meeting.

The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 already requires this in the case of mortgages created after 1 December 2009.  The new section, which I am proposing in Amendment No. 8, provides that in the case of mortgages created prior to 1 December 2009 in respect of principal private residences, any repossession proceedings must be commenced in the Circuit Court.  This means that such cases must be commenced in the Circuit Court irrespective of the date of creation of the mortgage.  I consider that this meets the intention of Deputy Mac Lochlainn as indicated in Amendment No. 7.<\/p><p>  However, in order to avoid legal challenges in respect of proceedings which have already been commenced, section 2(4) provides that where other such proceedings relating to the enforcement of a mortgagee's rights have been commenced in the High Court but have not yet been determined, then notwithstanding section 2(2), proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence may be taken in that Court.  This provision will also help to avoid the risk of enforcement proceedings being taken in two separate courts simultaneously which would lead to increased costs for the parties concerned.  It will also avoid any constitutional difficulties arising with regard to the implementation of this provision.  Amendment No. 6 is a technical amendment which ensures that the definitions in section 2(7) will apply to the new section 3 which is being inserted by Amendment No. 8.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300037#LL00900","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1372862700,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I have two quick questions.  The first relates to the definition of a principal private residence.  The question probably applies to the entire Bill.  Will the Minister clarify one point?  When we use the term principal private residence most of us believe it refers to the home a person is living in.  However, there is a group of people who, due to the mortgage crisis, are in a somewhat unusual position.  They have a principal private residence but, since their family has grown, they have moved to another place.  They are renting the residence because they might be in negative equity or whatever.<\/p><p>Essentially, they are renting out their principal private residence and are living in rented accommodation.  In the context of the Minister's amendment and the Bill, does \"principal private residence\" afford the same protections in section 2 to a place if people are renting and renting as if they were simply living in it?  Second, the Minister should set out the specific reason he is referring these matters to the Circuit Court, as opposed to the District or High Courts, in the amendment and the advantages thereof.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300037#LL01000","speaker":"1107","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372863000,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I will deal with the second question first.  The proposal was that these matters be dealt with in the Circuit Court as they are appropriate to the Circuit Court and not to the District Court.  That is the position in the context of post-1 December 2009 mortgages, as contained in that particular legislation.  There is already experience and expertise in the Circuit Court in dealing with these issues and the suggestion arose in the course of Committee Stage that there should be a synergy and the same approach to both pre-1 December 2009 mortgages and post-1 December 2009 mortgages.  It was my view that this was reasonable.  When the Bill was being drafted, an issue was originally suggested to me that to so change the law might give rise to some constitutional issue because there might be some vested right, for example, in the lenders to take their proceedings in the High Court.  I did not think that was a particularly strong issue and have had the matter looked at again.  Consequently, I have proposed this amendment, which I hope will be welcomed because it was an amendment urged on me on Committee Stage for which I expressed support, provided the Attorney General's office confirmed to me it could be implemented.  This is the reason we are heading down that route.<\/p><p>  In the context of all my experience as a lawyer over the years, principal private residence would primarily mean the residence in which someone is residing and this would be the consistent legal interpretation thereof.  As it does not normally mean a residence that is being rented to someone else, regardless of circumstances, I am very anxious not to mislead the House in that way.  There is a difficulty where it is a rental property as opposed to a property that - if I can put it this way - genuinely is an individual's family home.  However, in the exceptional circumstances that have arisen, there may be some area of appreciation or discretion where, bearing in mind the unusual individual circumstances of an individual or a couple, the court may extend that definition.  The phrase &quot;family home&quot; has not been used.  The phrase &quot;principal private residence&quot; has been used with some deliberation in these circumstances.  However, Members also must ensure they do not create a situation in which, for example, someone buys a property with the intention of using it as an investment property and lives in it for two or three months before renting it out and asserting these special procedures should apply.  I have dealt with this issue in the manner I believe to be the best way it can be dealt with.  It is clearly intended largely to apply to individuals who are in mortgage difficulty or living in the home in respect of which they have mortgage difficulties.<\/p><p>  The Deputy, like me, is aware of individuals who for a number of reasons have moved out of homes in which there are mortgage difficulties.  Families in two-bedroom apartments simply have found they have grown beyond that original residence they might have acquired in 2004 or 2005.  Such people may now have two children who are growing up and, consequently, they have moved out and rented the property.  They now are either renting another property or those who are in employment may well have purchased property because of the collapse in values.  Consequently, one could not have two principal private residences.  They may be renting it as a matter of convenience or they may be renting it to avoid incurring losses on their original investment.  A myriad of different circumstances arise but this principally is about individuals living in a property, that is, residing in that property and in mortgage difficulty with that property, to ensure as best as possible that everything is done to try to avoid their loss of the roof over their heads.  Obviously, this is part of an issue.  If one is renting somewhere else and if the property one is renting out, which one originally purchased as a principal private residence, is lost in a repossession case, one still has a roof over one's head, namely, the property one now is renting.  However, there may be some circumstances in which the courts might be willing - but that will depend very much on individual circumstances that do not lend themselves to definition in legislation - to give some area of discretion or appreciation.  The Deputy and I probably could invent at least half a dozen examples to which this might apply but in the context of drafting the legislation, I am advised this is the appropriate terminology that can be used.  It is the best that can be done in this context and, hopefully, it will have the intended impact.<\/p><p>  I refer to both the Circuit Court issue and the application of the personal insolvency protections, the adjournment of court proceedings and the facility to give people an opportunity to re-engage or to engage with a financial institution when confronted by repossession.  I am conscious these all are issues about which Deputy Donnelly had concerns, that were featured in his own Private Members' Bill and which he and I discussed a considerable time ago in the context of the insolvency legislation.  Consequently, I am doing what I can in this area to be of assistance to individuals.  The Circuit Court obviously is a better venue because whether one is a creditor or the person in debt who has not paid his or her mortgage, the legal costs are less onerous than would be incurred in the High Court.  Consequently, there is an important cost issue in keeping it at Circuit Court level.  The District Courts have never traditionally had this particular area of jurisdiction.  They do not have the background expertise in dealing with it and for that reason, I proposed this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300038#MM00200","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1372863000,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply and for leaving open the door that people who are renting and renting may have the protections afforded to them under section 2.  The Minister referred to my Family Home Protection (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill from 2011 and I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the Minister's good faith in this regard.  During the debate in 2011, the Minister asked that I withdraw the Bill to avoid forcing a division in the House on something for which there was cross-party support.  At the time, the Minister indicated he would consider ways to have what the Family Home Protection (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was trying to do brought into the law.  Essentially, section 2 is the result of that and I wish to acknowledge publicly the good faith under which the Minister has laboured.  It is greatly appreciated.<\/p><p>  I take the Minister's point that this might be available in some situations.  The reason I emphasise this issue is because a great number of people are in this position.  Most of my friends are in this situation, as I imagine are a great many other people in their mid-30s.  Such people bought tiny homes for far too much money that they could not afford and did not really want but by 2008, 2009, 2010 or 2011, they had kids, would no longer live in a one or two-bedroom apartment and have moved out.  However, although they would love to do so, they cannot sell.  Obviously, the original idea would have been to sell and to buy themselves a three bedroom semi-detached house in which to raise their family and so on.  However, they are stuck for a few reasons, the first of which is that the tax position changes completely.  Once one leaves one's home and one rents, one no longer gets the mortgage interest supplement.  One cannot deduct the full costs from the rental income in respect of tax, as this was reduced from 100% of interest to 75%.  Moreover, these same people will now be charged PRSI on the rental income.  Consequently, the financial and taxation hit for being obliged to move out is huge and it would be a great pity if such people could not be afforded the protections afforded under section 2.<\/p><p>  The purpose of section 2 essentially is to stop the bank from repossessing homes when a sensible personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, could be constructed.

That is what I would hope many people will do.  I hope that people who have the possibility of an engagement that could produce a productive outcome will not wait until they are at the receiving end of repossession proceedings, both for their own peace of mind and to avoid unnecessary expense being incurred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300039#NN00100","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372863600,"counter":681,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1372863600,"counter":682,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<blockquote>In page 5, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&#8220;Proceedings relating to certain mortgages to be brought in Circuit Court<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>3. <\/b>(1) This section applies to land which is the principal private residence of--<blockquote>(a) the mortgagor of the land concerned, or<br \/><br \/>(b) a person without whose consent a conveyance of that land would be void by reason of--<blockquote>(i) the Family Home Protection Act 1976, or<br \/><br \/>(ii) the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010,<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>and the mortgage concerned was created prior to 1 December 2009.<br \/><br \/>(2) Subject to <i>subsection (4)<\/i>, proceedings brought by a mortgagee seeking an order for possession of land to which the mortgage relates and which land is land to which this section applies shall be brought in the Circuit Court.<br \/><br \/>(3) The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to hear and determine proceedings referred to in <i>subsection (2) <\/i>where the land concerned is land to which this section applies shall be exercised by the judge of the circuit where the land or any part of it is situated.<br \/><br \/>(4) <i>Subsection (2) <\/i>does not preclude a person initiating proceedings in the High Court where other proceedings relating to the enforcement of the mortgagee's rights under the mortgage concerned have been commenced in that court prior to the coming into operation of this section where those other proceedings have not been determined.&#8221;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300039#NN00400","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372863600,"counter":683,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1372863600,"counter":684,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 9 and 14 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300039#NN00600","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1372863600,"counter":685,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 9:<blockquote>In page 5, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&#8220;3. <\/b>In any proceedings brought by a mortgagee seeking an order for possession of land to which the mortgage relates in a case to which this section applies the court, when making its decision whether to grant a possession order shall consider:(a) whether a mortgagee has fully complied with the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears;<br \/><br \/>(b) whether a mortgagee has behaved in a manner deemed reasonable by the court.

As I have stated previously, this is not the intention of the Bill or of section 2, which provides a necessary link to the personal insolvency process.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 9<b><\/b>contains an astonishing proposal, in paragraph (c), that the court should consider whether, when a personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, has been rejected by creditors, the mortgagor has been given adequate opportunity to appeal the substantive decision of the mortgagee to reject the proposal.  This completely misunderstands the way in which the PIA process works.  As I have said many times, it is a voluntary process and where the necessary approval of creditors cannot be obtained on the proposal, the process then ends.  There is no appeal to the court in this regard.  There exists a possibility that the mortgagor could, through his or her personal insolvency practitioner and where time permits under the protective certificate period, propose a new arrangement which could meet with the approval of creditors.  That may be a possibility for some.  With regard to amendment No. 14, I repeat that the amendment seeks to rewrite provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act, which is not the purpose of this Bill.<\/p><p>  The House should be aware that the protection to a mortgagor proposed by this Bill is to require that the court allow for a personal insolvency arrangement to be considered where, for example, none previously had been attempted, as with the requirement now in bankruptcy petitions, and not that the court should direct a first or a new PIA and effectively determine its outcome.  Once a PIA proposal has been rejected by the creditors' meeting and no subsequent proposal is made during the protective certificate period, the personal insolvency practitioner's role ends as a mediator or negotiator for the debtor.<\/p><p>  However, members should also remember that where a proposal is rejected at a creditors' meeting and where the protective certificate period still exists, as I said earlier, this does not stop a personal insolvency practitioner making a different proposal that creditors may accept.  Therefore, once a proposal has been rejected and where there is no other proposal that can properly be made within the timeframe, the personal insolvency practitioner has no standing whatsoever in the repossession process and the law does not provide for the court to appoint him or her as an officer essentially to force a settlement on creditors.  As such, a practitioner cannot do that.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendment No. 14<b><\/b>ignores the fact that the personal insolvency legislation is designed to allow agreed settlements to be reached as an alternative to court ordered settlements.  It is my view this amendment would overturn this carefully calibrated approach.  I must add that the Deputy's proposed provision that a PIA proposal should only offer to repay the current value of a property would represent a huge interference in contractual and property rights and would be likely to be subject to swift challenge in the courts.  Indeed, it could give rise to constitutional issues.  The amendment makes no reference to the repayment capacity of the debtor, which it seems essentially would be determined by the current value of the property.  This would have obvious negative consequences for banks, other financial institutions and ultimately for taxpayers.<\/p><p>  I believe this amendment could encourage delinquent behaviour on the part of all debtors, nearly 90% of whom are repaying their mortgages, in order to get their mortgages reduced to current value.  This would seriously risk a complete collapse of the property market and would threaten the solvency of the financial institutions and indeed the economy.  Finally, I consider that this amendment would run the risk of turning every proposal for a PIA into a costly preliminary to repossession.

We tabled this amendment on Committee Stage also and we discussed it in some detail but I want to reiterate our position on it for the record.  I note the Minister is not accepting the amendment.  That does not come as a surprise.  We discussed this on many occasions in regard to the personal insolvency legislation.  The thrust of legislation is all the time recalibrating the balance of power away from the borrower into the hands of the lender, but unfortunately we have seen over the years, and day in, day out in our constituency offices, that the banks adopt quite a high-handed and draconian approach to dealing with people in distress.  That is the issue we raised during the debate on the personal insolvency legislation.  That is the reason we sought to have an independent appeals process.  That is why we pointed out the issue in regard to what we have described as the bankers' veto.  We had it again this week in regard to the new code of conduct launched by the banks, with Government support, whereby the protection being afforded to borrowers in distress and in arrears has been watered down and people will now be subjected to more vigorous pursuit by the banks.<\/p><p>  Taking all that in the round and remembering also that the bona fides of the banks have to be called into question, have they acted reasonably?  The answer is &quot;No&quot;.  Will they act reasonably from now on with the passage of this legislation?  I believe the answer is &quot;No&quot;.  The Minister mentioned in rejecting this amendment that it would promote delinquent behaviour.  The banks can act in a delinquent fashion also.<\/p><p>  The effect of our motion was to try to stem the erosion of protection which the borrowers have enjoyed to a certain degree but, unfortunately, the Minister has already said he will not accept that.

I would disagree with the Minister's economic analysis.  He may be right but I do not think he is for two reasons.  Last year, the IMF conducted a 100 year review of the way countries have successfully got out of mortgage crises and it concluded that the only two countries where it ever worked were Iceland and Norway.  In Iceland and Norway they did something similar to what Deputy Collins spoke about, which is a very broad write-down of mortgage debt.  I met two Icelandic Members of Parliament yesterday to ask them how they managed to do that without destroying their banking system.<\/p><p>They informed me that they had split their banks in two, namely, into good banks and bad banks and that the former retained the functioning assets.  I am currently involved in drawing up a paper on a debt-for-equity product which would allow something similar to happen here but without the banks being obliged to take a write-down.  I disagree with the Minister's economic analysis.  I believe the opposite is the case, namely, that job creation and economic growth will only occur and that emigration will only be stemmed when the quantum of household debt is brought back down to a sustainable level.  The latter will require the banks to play ball in a way in which I have no faith in them doing.<\/p><p> In the context of the mechanism under discussion, I would like to consider the case of a couple who engage with a personal insolvency practitioner who then engages with their bank on their behalf in circumstances where a reasonable personal insolvency arrangement can be arrived at.  Some banks are already engaging in this fashion.  To its credit, AIB has made some very positive noises in this regard.  Let us imagine that there is equity in the house owned by the couple to whom I refer but they cannot pay off their mortgage.  With some restructuring, they could retain their house but their bank indicates that it has no interest in retaining them as borrowers for the next ten, 15 or 20 years.  It then states that it is taking in the house and calls in the full mortgage.  The bank proceeds to seek repossession and, as a result of the provisions in section 2, the judge states that there is a deal to be done and that the parties should try to arrive at a personal insolvency arrangement.<\/p><p> The bank then states that while other financial institutions are restructuring in circumstances such as those I have outlined, it is not doing so.  It further indicates that it is not interested in such arrangements, that it no longer wants the debt on its books and that it is taking the house and is going to sell it on.  The personal insolvency practitioner informs the judge at the next court hearing that it is his or her opinion that there is a personal insolvency arrangement to be arrived at, that such arrangements are being arrived at by other banks and that the bank in question is refusing to play ball.  The bank then states that the latter is the case and insists on taking possession of its asset.  Can anything else be done at that stage or is this how the Minister sees matters playing out in the context of the powers the banks retain to ignore reasonable personal insolvency arrangements and repossess properties?  I am of the view that banks will repossess in circumstances where the house on which a mortgage is held is not in negative equity.  Will the Minister outline whether that is his understanding of how the banks might enforce their rights?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300039#NN01300","speaker":"1107","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372864200,"counter":692,"content":"<p>There is a very simple answer to the questions posed by Deputy Donnelly.  Section 2(4) states: &quot;On the expiry of any period of adjournment granted under <i>subsection (2)<\/i>, the court may grant a further adjournment of the proceedings concerned where it considers that significant progress has been made in the preparation of a proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement.&quot;  Let us assume that any progress has been made on one side and that the creditor has not adequately engaged.  Section 2(3)(d) refers to the conduct of the parties to a mortgage in any attempt to find a resolution.  I am of the view that this is going to guide the courts in certain circumstances.  Obviously, this legislation has not yet been enacted but despite the fact that there is no statutory obligation on them, even now judges are adjourning proceedings in order to give individuals experiencing difficulties an opportunity resolve them.  In recent cases a number of judges actually encouraged engagement.  Section 2(2) states that in any proceedings brought by a mortgagee seeking an order for possession of land to which the mortgage relates in a case to which this section applies, a court - without prejudice to any other power which a court may have to adjourn proceedings - may, of its own motion, etc., adjourn proceedings.  The courts have an inherent power to adjourn proceedings.<\/p><p>  In circumstances where if I were the owner of a principal private residence and my lender informed me that it wanted to repossess and if I consulted a personal insolvency practitioner and made an eminently sensible proposal, it must be remembered that in the background there are directions to the banks to engage with those who are in difficulty.  They must engage not only in the context of considering the possibility of debt forbearance, but also, in appropriate cases, debt forgiveness.  A borrower who is experiencing problems and who is able to truthfully inform a court about a constructive proposal he or she has put forward which makes sense in the overall background circumstances may find that a lender who has not been willing to properly engage may get into great difficulty with the courts.  In such cases the courts may simply adjourn proceedings and tell everyone to go away and reconsider matters for a period of three or six months.  What the courts cannot do is force a personal insolvency arrangement on anybody.  This is because the fact that there must be agreement is the very essence of the personal insolvency legislation.<\/p><p>  We are referring here to debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangements and the emphasis is on the term &quot;arrangement&quot;.  Of course, where a mortgage is involved it will be a personal insolvency as opposed to a debt settlement arrangement which will apply.  Judges have all sorts of wonderful ways of relaying messages to people whom they believe to be recalcitrant.  I am of the view that the Bill creates the legal backdrop to facilitate them in this regard.  Judges may show reluctance to grant orders of possession in circumstances where the lender is behaving unreasonably.  I accept that I have been talking for far longer than should have been the case but these are important issues.<\/p><p>  I hope the architecture we are providing will facilitate that to which I refer.  Ultimately, there is a matter of Central Bank oversight.  The Central Bank has now required lending institutions to specifically engage in respect of this matter.  There have been a number of years of debt forbearance, resulting in medium or short-term relief for many individuals who are in difficulty with their mortgages.  The Central Bank requires that the institutions must engage in order to put medium and long-term arrangements that are viable in place.  I do not believe it envisages that wholesale repossessions will occur in respect of family homes or principal private residences in circumstances where practical and sensible financial arrangements can be entered into, particularly in situations where, if a sale is forced and if there is negative equity, the lender will not recover its money in full and where there are certain matters which should be addressed.  We are putting in place an interesting and important architecture which will allow the courts to assess the bona fides not just of those against whom repossession orders are sought, but also of those who seek such orders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300040#OO00200","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372864200,"counter":693,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1372864200,"counter":694,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 10 to 13, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300040#OO00400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1372864200,"counter":695,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 10:<blockquote>In page 5, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&quot;3.<\/b> Where the court grants an order of possession the court shall instruct the mortgagee to abide by the full terms of any tenancy agreement in place with respect to the property and for the mortgagee to assume the full responsibilities of the landlord as stipulated in that tenancy agreement.&quot;.<\/blockquote>This amendment is designed to ensure that where a repossessed property is buy-to-let concern with a tenant <i>in situ<\/i>, the tenancy agreement will be respected in full.

Amendment No. 10 relates to situations where tenancy agreements are in place and seeks to invest the court with the power to require mortgagees to abide by the terms of such agreements.<\/p><p>Repossession is not the only option in such situations.  Where rents are being paid and where it is viable, the mortgagee may opt to appoint a receiver of rents rather than seek repossession.  Where, however, the mortgagee wishes to sell the property, the mortgagee is under an obligation to obtain the best price reasonably attainable, which would normally require vacant possession of the property.  In those circumstances, the proposal in amendment No. 10 would work to the disadvantage of the borrower and impede operation of the terms of the mortgage contract between the borrower and the mortgagee.   For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p><p> In regard to amendment No. 11, which seeks to instruct the court in regard to the orders, it may make in reaching its judgment on a repossession action, I will, once again, point out that the court has a general power to stay proceedings, and on a regular basis, the courts stay orders for possession for a period of time to enable people to reorder their lives, obtain alternative accommodation or, as happens on occasion, allow children to sit examinations.  In those circumstances, I do not think it necessary to legislate on this issue as proposed in the amendment and, therefore, I will not be accepting it.<\/p><p> Turning to amendment No. 12, if we were to go down this route, which would in effect introduce non-recourse mortgages to this jurisdiction, we would, in the current circumstances where non-recourse mortgages are not available in this country, encourage strategic default and compound our current difficulties.  While I stated on Committee Stage that I, on a personal level, would favour the introduction of a non-recourse mortgage product, the fact remains that such products are not available nor can we prescribe them by legislation.  To accept this amendment would create even more serious difficulties for both financial institutions and the State and I cannot accept the amendment for that reason. <\/p><p> Amendment No. 13 seems to indicate that the Oireachtas should legislate to provide that the cost of the repossession should be paid by the mortgagee.

We are discussing amendments Nos. 1 to 13, inclusive, as part of this overall topic.  We discussed it at length on Committee Stage.  It is the same amendment, by and large.  Some of my other amendments might be slightly different.  This amendment is a repeat so I will go through it to the same extent.<\/p><p>  There is merit in a number of these amendments.  I can understand how the Minister might have a technical issue with one or two issues.  The essential issue is that each year when we come to discuss our voted Estimates in the D&aacute;il, we only discuss the Estimates that come before the line Minister for voting.  This can equate to somewhere in the order of &euro;40 billion per annum whereas there is approximately another &euro;10 billion per annum which does not come before the D&aacute;il as part of the annual Estimates process.  The fact that the national Parliament does not discuss the full range of Government expenditure each year is a flaw.  In a way, some of the money is kept away from the full level of public scrutiny one would have during the normal Estimates debate.  We could discuss the Estimates debate and I must be critical of my colleagues in the House because they do not give sufficient time to the Estimates debate in respect of line Departments.  I know some of them must still go through the House for this year.  We all know that most of the money is already spent and committed and we are still only voting on the Estimates.  <\/p><p>  That said, many Members of the House will give scant regard to the actual Estimates debate.  I want all these items to be brought into the Estimates process and voted expenditure.  We can have many Departments with budgets of &euro;8 billion, &euro;9 billion and up to &euro;12 billion and &euro;13 billion going through each year and the Estimates debate can take an hour or two.  When one takes out the set pieces - the opening statements - very little real detailed scrutiny takes place and I would welcome greater scrutiny for the Estimates across the House.  <\/p><p>  That said, the purpose of these 13 amendments is to take out items from the Central Fund that should be brought into the Estimates debate.  I understand there is an issue with the question of the servicing of the national debt.  The Minister's official spoke nicely to me after Committee Stage to say that many countries might not want to lend to a country if they felt it could be caught up in a political wrangle over whether we pay the interest each year.  I accept that point.  Essentially, the next Government is bound by whatever is agreed now and it cannot be changed by way of an Estimates debate or a Government having a slim majority or no majority on some occasions.  There is merit in that point but a halfway house can be found and a proper debate on that issue held in this House in parallel with the Estimates debate.  As part of the Estimates debate, there might be an addendum, appendix or complementary note added to it involving items relevant to that Minister's Department, for example, the Department of Finance for payment of the national debt, which will not be voted on but the process of having the debate should happen each year.  There is a case to be made for doing that.<\/p><p>  My real concern related to when I went down through the list of items.  The second item, which is amendment No. 2, relates to a contribution to the EU budget.  I know somebody will give me a reason that the Oireachtas should not be allowed to discuss that each year but I am sure-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300043#RR00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372865700,"counter":715,"content":"<p>It is a treaty obligation.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1372865700,"counter":716,"content":"<p>I am sure the same treaty obligation put on an obligation on EU institutions, yet consider the discussion we had in recent months about agreeing its budget.  The European Parliament gets to discuss the EU budget  - what it takes in and receives from us - but we do not have an equivalent and reciprocal debate, yet we are governed by the same treaty.  If the same debate can be held at European level, it should be possible to have it here.<\/p><p>  In respect of payments to the ESM, I know there are very large amounts of money but I suspect that very few members of the public are aware that those payments are going through because they are not being discussed here.  There is no reason that items like the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and election posting cannot be included in the Estimates and if, for example, there is to be a referendum that was not planned, a figure could be included as part of the Estimate that would be brought forward to cover the actual referendum.<\/p><p>  The Minister understands my point.  He will probably not accept these 13 amendments.  He did not accept them on Committee Stage and I do not expect him to accept them here.  It is a point we will wish to revisit separately from this legislation because &euro;10 billion should not be spent each year on behalf of the Irish taxpayer without a debate in the Chamber.  Perhaps it would not happen in the voted expenditure mechanism about which we are discussing but there should be a debate.  A payment of &euro;8 billion or &euro;9 billion should not be made each year in respect of the national debt as if the Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad could not even have a discussion of the matter.  They may not have the power to amend it but I think they could.<\/p><p>  The Minister refers to international obligations and legally binding agreements.  In respect of the promissory note, every known agreement that we draw down is always subject to renegotiation if the NTMA can source other funds and perhaps re-finance it in a better way.  That is what the NTMA does every day of the week.  It tries to re-finance some of the existing loans in a better manner so there is an ebb and flow in these matters each year, yet we are not allowed to have that debate.  The Minister knows my views well.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300043#RR00500","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1372865700,"counter":717,"content":"<p>Deputy Fleming is right.  We had a comprehensive debate on these matters on Committee Stage.  I do not disagree with the argument that we should always be pushing out the boundaries of scrutiny to ensure that we can take full account in this House and make officers of the State, particularly the Executive, amenable to D&aacute;il oversight.<\/p><p>  As I previously stated, non-voted expenditure represents expenditure which the Oireachtas has declared by law to be paid from the Central Fund without annual reference to the D&aacute;il.  These are items that are a permanent charge on the State's revenues.  They represent those services that are payable out of the Central Fund - many of them are listed in the amendments tabled by Deputy Fleming - by the continuing authority of statute law.  We debate them when we pass laws here that this is an ongoing charge that should be paid from the Central Fund.  Therefore, they are not subject to the normal annual voted expenditure-type process.  <\/p><p>  The Central Fund activity is regularly reported.  It is in the public domain through the monthly Exchequer statements that the Department of Finance and my Department publish.  In addition, the Department of Finance publishes detailed annual accounts of the Central Fund for the previous year, known as the financial accounts.  As I explained in some detail to the committee, these accounts contain detailed analysis and classification of receipts and issues of the Central Fund, as well as details of the national debt.  In the presentation of the Exchequer figures for this period published this week - I do not know whether Deputy Fleming had a look at them - we disaggregated out the debt servicing elements of it, which was a suggestion of the Deputy, so that it is much clearer.<\/p><p> They must be laid before the D&aacute;il not later than 30 September each year.  As discussed on Committee Stage, debt servicing requirements are encompassed in the budgetary arithmetic and are shown in the annual budgetary papers on the presentation of the budget every year.  The Bill before us does not deal with debt service or any other Central Fund charge.  Consequently, the Bill does not propose any change to the long-standing practice with regard to such non-voted expenditure.  Such practices are in accordance with the Constitution and, as I stated on Committee Stage, changing them in the way Deputy Fleming suggests would primarily be a matter for the Minister for Finance rather than for me.  I am speaking about treating the annual expenditure voted Estimates in the way I am describing.  I understand the transparency issues the Deputy has raised and they are something we can work on.<\/p><p> Even in terms of the Estimates process, we can do much better.  The Deputy is right in this regard and I hope we can do this proactively.  We will have an opportunity this year as the budget will be in October and all the Estimates must be debated and passed between October and December.  Before any euro is expended next year it will have been debated, rather than doing it afterwards, which has been the practice for as long as I am here.  This is an innovation in and of itself.  This is an evolution rather than a revolution and Deputies will embrace this detailed analysis.  I hope more resources will be available to the committee system, particularly if we move to a unicameral House, so we have not only ongoing analysis of expenditure in advance of the money being expended, but also a look at options for expenditure so we will have a real Estimates debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300043#RR00600","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372866300,"counter":719,"content":"<p>The Minister stated the various items I have mentioned in amendments Nos. 1 to 13 are matters which the Oireachtas has decided by law are to be paid.

I wish to firm up the significance of ministerial expenditure ceilings.  I suspect that the Minister would be happy with the general approach, although he might not agree with my exact mechanism.<\/p><p>  Last year's expenditure ceilings were breached by the Departments of Social Protection and Health.  The Minister might claim that the Government has matters under better control this year, but my perspective is based on the largest Supplementary Estimates process in the history of the State, amounting to more than &euro;1 billion, because the Department of Health sought hundreds of millions of euro in December after failing to control its expenditure.  Its Estimates were not valid to start with.  This was stated at the outset and proved to be the case.  In terms of the Department of Social Protection, requirements in demand-led schemes can change.  That Department also returned to the D&aacute;il for additional money.  The outcome was that expenditure ceilings for the following year needed to be rejigged, so much so that the members of the troika whom I met last year expressed concern regarding the excessive expenditure by these two Departments in particular.  The troika wanted to meet the Ministers in question during some recent visits to discuss why they were not in control of their Departments' spending.  Several times during the past 12 months, I told the Minister present that the Minister for Health was not listening to him, the Taoiseach or anyone on the issue of expenditure.  It took being hauled in by the IMF.  I welcomed Europe's intervention.  Perhaps the IMF did some good work in this regard as well.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Health claimed that various legislation would reduce expenditure as the year passed, citing two examples.  They are the reason behind this amendment.  The first legislation was to deal with recouping money from private insurers, some of which has been done.  The second was to get a better deal from the pharmaceutical companies on the products they supply in Ireland.  It might come as a surprise to the Minister but when the Committee of Public Accounts recently asked the most senior officials at the Department of Health and the HSE, bodies that spend hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers' money with the companies that supply these products, to explain what happened when they sat down opposite those companies and asked for price reductions, we were told that they had never sat down to have that conversation with the companies.  They told us that they met a representative body of the companies concerned and did not deal with them on a one-to-one basis.  It would be as if the Government tried to negotiate with the Irish Banking Federation, IBF, instead of the major banks that the IBF represents.  This came as a shock and made it immediately clear why we were not making progress, that being, we were not even having face-to-face discussions with the companies.<\/p><p>  I will make a suggestion about the cost of medicines, a matter on which I tabled a parliamentary question this week.  It is germane to this Bill, as the largest expenditure ceiling is at the Department of Health, where one of the largest costs is the purchase of drugs.  We will find out how we stand in the ESRI's international comparison.  We should approach the country that is getting the best deal, be that England, France or the Netherlands, and ask it to buy our medicines for us at the price for which it gets its own and to sell them to us at a mark-up of 5%.  The cost to us would be a fraction of our current outlay.  Other countries seem to be able to get a better deal.<\/p><p>  This is the background to the overspend and the need for the expenditure ceilings.  I am asking that the latter be set by way of regulation, as there is no sight of an expenditure ceiling in this Bill.  The section refers to Government and ministerial expenditure ceilings for this and the coming three years, yet the legislation contains no figures.  The Minister might claim that including them in a Schedule would require us to change them each year, but we deal with the finance Bill, the social welfare Bill and appropriation accounts every year.  A similar mechanism could be used in this case, thereby strengthening the Minister's hand in his dealings with other Ministers who might not be keeping within their expenditure ceilings.  He could tell them that their ceilings were not just something agreed at the Cabinet table, but were on a statutory footing.  The Minister will tell me that the figures are printed in some other document, but there is no sight of them in this legislation, the essence of which relates to expenditure ceilings.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 23 on the same issue would set out statutorily those items that are current expenditure and those that are capital expenditure.  The Minister will recall the confusion between how Departments interpret current and capital expenditure.  He announced a stimulus package recently.  Some of that money will go to filling potholes and repairing roads, which I consider to be current expenditure as routine maintenance.  However, someone else might view it as capital expenditure because the tar will be there for the next ten years.  I do not know which it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300046#UU00100","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1372867500,"counter":755,"content":"<p>I hope it will survive ten years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300046#UU00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1372867500,"counter":756,"content":"<p>Depending on the winters.

It is easy to see how, depending on need and where the budget is flush, something could be considered capital expenditure today and current expenditure next month.  We want to know where we are going.  The definition should be set out by way of regulation so that, as opposed to just ourselves, everyone in the country and those who are carrying out international comparisons can know what is capital and what is current.  Perhaps it was not intended, but the impression is that last year's stimulus package was new capital investment for infrastructural projects, schools and roads.  Lo and behold, some of it was current expenditure.  For example, I do not know whether the retrofitting of local authority housing is considered capital or current expenditure.  Perhaps the finance officers of various local authorities have different opinions on the issue.  It is important that there be uniformity so that everyone can know how to compare.<\/p><p>  I picked the date of 15 September because it was one month before the annual budget or thereabouts, providing time to examine the ministerial expenditure ceilings and the amounts of capital and current expenditure.

It would be helpful if legislation is understandable to the ordinary lay person.  I would be surprised if there are 50 people in Ireland who could tell the difference between the two documents concerned.  <\/p><p>  Rather than tamper with the wording of the Bill, which I am sure is in place for good reason, the amendment seeks that the Minister shall provide by way of regulation, memorandum or information to the House, on an annual basis, a detailed reconciliation between the macro-economic forecast and the official forecast.  What is proposed in the amendment would not tamper with either of the definitions as set out in the legislation but would help the public to understand the difference between the two documents and to reconcile one with the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300048#WW01600","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1372868700,"counter":803,"content":"<p>The Minister might when replying to the amendment spell out in plain English the difference or similarities of the macro-economic forecast and the official forecast.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300048#WW01700","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1372868700,"counter":804,"content":"<p>On the amendment, the Deputy's suggestion relates to the possibility that the fiscal council could endorse a set of forecasts in advance of a budget and that last minute budgetary measures, involving contraction-stimulation of the economy or on the price side, would have to be taken into consideration in the final forecast.

He is doing good work on the taxi industry.  For example, he met all the key stakeholders and chaired a review group established early this year to examine ways to improve legislation on the taxi industry.<\/p><p><b><\/b> I have the greatest respect for the vital job that is done by taxi service operators as I see it at first hand every day in my Longford-Westmeath constituency and Dublin city.  Taxi men and, more recently, taxi women have served their communities for generations.  The sector makes an essential contribution to urban life and has helped rural areas move from isolation to connection.<\/p><p>   Front-line workers such as taxi drivers must be protected.  Taxi drivers are akin to emergency response personnel in that they work irregular hours, away from their families, with no set or guaranteed income at the end of their long working day.  They must often wait for long periods in taxi ranks before being called into service.  In performing their role, they provide a service to people when it is needed.  The burden and sacrifice attached to their job adds a certain amount of hardship and stress.<\/p><p>  In the past ten years, taxi drivers have been squeezed by improper and excessive regulation which has been imposed from the top down.  Licensed taxi service owners are being threatened daily by illegal operators because enforcement has failed.  It is now proposed to remove the right of taxi operators to pass on their businesses to their children.  I am concerned about the adverse effects this proposal will have on established licensed taxi service operators.  Deregulation in other areas is also destroying the taxi service business.<\/p><p>  The enforcement of small public service vehicle rules, which is undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and National Roads Authority compliance officers, is not working owing to the excessive amount of cross-compliance.  The taxi sector is a good example of an industry that has been over-regulated.  Before the Minister of State assumed responsibility for the taxi sector, the voice of the ordinary taxi driver working at the coal face of the business had been seldom, if ever, heard.  Taxi drivers deliver the service on the ground and listen to users' views on where services could be improved.<\/p><p>  In the past decade, far too may changes and demands have come from the top down.  Licensed taxi service owners are finding it more difficult by the day to juggle the demands of work, legislation, deregulation and family life.  Taxi operators who started operating prior to deregulation and have built successful businesses through hard work, often to the detriment of their health, have fallen victim to the actions of illegal operators.  The problem is not small public service vehicle requirements but the fact that illegal operators are falling through the cracks in terms of enforcement.<\/p><p>  I understand the Commission on Taxi Regulation was established for the purposes of bettering society, improving the security of taxi operators and the general public and delivering a better licensed taxi service.  It is heart-breaking that hardworking taxi operators who work long hours as they seek to provide for their families in a difficult and competitive sector are falling victim to legislation which could victimise them and their families by removing the right to pass on their business, except in the event of death of a licence holder.  I ask the Minister of State to provide greater clarity on this issue and the provisions of section 2.  This proposal runs counter to competitive norms and will act as a major disincentive to enterprise.  No one in his or her right mind could condone such a rule.  By virtue of their self-employed status, taxi drivers lack certain entitlements.  For this reason, we must ensure that, in common with farmers and the owners of land, shops and other businesses, the owners of taxi businesses are allowed to pass on to their children the business they have built up.  The current draconian provision should be removed from the Bill to allow taxi drivers to operate in a manner similar to other businesses. <\/p><p>  This Bill is the most forward-looking and comprehensive legislation on the taxi sector since the foundation of the State.  It replaces a 2003 Act which was written in great haste following a court case and corrects many of the mistakes Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments made.  The current legislation fails to protect consumers and taxi drivers.  This Bill will bring to an end the practice of turning a blind eye to taxi regulation and allowing irregularities to continue unchecked.  Its main provisions include mandatory disqualification from holding a licence on conviction for certain offences.  This provision will be implemented through an amendment to section 36 of the 2003 Act.<\/p><p> The Bill provides for suspension or revocation of a licence or refusal of a licence application, having regard to the suitability of a person to hold a licence based on, among other considerations, convictions for relevant offences or breaches of taxi regulations.  It will remove certain categories of criminals from the taxi sector.  When the Garda refuses to grant a person a taxi licence, he or she is able to win on appeal because of the flaws in the old legislation.  I am delighted this section is being changed in the interest of public safety.<\/p><p> Taxi drivers should not be allowed to stop suddenly on a main thoroughfare on a busy evening to collect passengers.  I have often had near misses as a result of such behaviour and have received many other complaints on the issue.  This is a practice that should come to an end and should be liable to a very severe penalty.  I hope we will see the use of cameras, CCTV and other apparatus for the enforcement of laws and for this evidence to be used in court proceedings.  I was alarmed when I heard of a recent report which pointed out that one in three taxi drivers had experienced threatening abuse and violence against them in the past five years.  This is shocking and to prevent this type of behaviour we need enforcement of the law regarding security by way of CCTV cameras and other apparatus.<\/p><p> The often hidden but nonetheless increasingly important service and supports some taxi drivers provide to people with disabilities must be acknowledged.  I would fully support extending the excise duty rebate that was given to private bus operators and goods vehicles in last year's budget.  This is something that should be considered.  Perhaps the Minister of State might bring it to the notice of his colleagues, Ministers Noonan and Howlin.  It would be very welcome if it were implemented in the forthcoming budget.<\/p><p> Over the years I have worked with many different groups and organisations in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath in an effort to bring about improvements in the day-to-day lives of ordinary families and businesspeople, who have seen their livelihoods destroyed by the recession.  I have also worked closely with the Government to improve their circumstances.  I meet groups of taxi drivers once or twice a year and they always express their concerns.  They are very reasonable people who carry a vast amount of knowledge.  They have their fingers on the pulse and provide an insight on how the country is going, the views of the people, etc.  We would not need all the opinion polls we see in the media if we listened more frequently to the concerns and issues taxi drivers raise with public representatives.<\/p><p> I welcome that the Bill will give powers to the licensing authority to suspend or revoke a licence for non-compliance with the law.  An area that needs to be addressed and cracked down on is taxi operators who hire undocumented immigrants and pay them a pittance.  Only a very small minority carry on in this fashion but it is unfair to the legal operators who run their business within the law.  As we know, every year thousands of people enter our country legally and another few thousand people come without authorisation or overstay their legal visas.  It is rumoured that some of those are employed in the taxi trade.  Companies or individuals who hire undocumented workers in this area or any other area are just as guilty of breaking the law as the people they hire and I understand the Bill addresses this ongoing issue.<\/p><p> Customer safety must be a top priority and we must ensure that adequate background checks are done on all would-be drivers and licence holders be they Irish or non-Irish.  If this necessitates contacting foreign embassies for further clearance, then so be it.  All passengers must be assured that they are travelling with trustworthy individuals.  It is important that we require all companies in the taxi business and elsewhere to be in compliance with the law, as we need to hold everyone accountable.<\/p><p> While the Government is ensuring new employment eligibility verifications are being put in place, not alone for taxi companies but for all companies, the odd one still slips through the net.  We have made it mandatory for employers to verify that their employees are legally eligible to work in the State.  We all know and recognise that the taxi service in Ireland is extremely important to the economic profile of many of our towns with foreign investment, particularly those that do not have a rail service.  Taxis provide an essential countrywide service and it is important that it is maintained, enhanced and upgraded.  <\/p><p> The rural transport project has proved to be a wonderful success story and has given rural people a wider choice in addressing social exclusion in rural areas and providing a door-to-door service to the most vulnerable in our society.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill relating to the rural hackney service, which will give rural people a wider choice.  In recognition of the lower levels of access to taxi or hackney services in rural areas, this is very welcome.  Many people in rural areas are isolated in their homes.  It will provide support to small rural pubs and other businesses.  I hope it will enhance the lives of many people in such areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300049#XX00700","speaker":"1062","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372869900,"counter":822,"content":"<p>I wish to share my time with Deputy Mattie McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300050#YY00200","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1372869900,"counter":823,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I have lost count of the number of taxi men and women I have met recently who tell me of the difficulty of making a living from driving a taxi.  Some other regulations that have been introduced seem to be making life particularly difficult for them.  Nobody objects to regulation provided it is fair and equitable and has the best interests of those it is trying to regulate at heart.  I know the objectives of the regulations relate to the quality of taxis and ensuring the safety of taxi passengers.  At the time the 2003 Act was introduced, we had a quality service and passengers were generally safe.  Back in the 1970s when I probably used a taxi for the first time, I was aware that we were getting a good service.<\/p><p>However, that does not mean there were no areas in need of reform or regulation.<\/p><p> One issue of major concern to taxi drivers is oversupply, but that is the one issue the Bill does not address or try to regulate.  I come from Dublin Central and I see the queues of taxis all the time waiting for fares.  There is visible evidence of oversupply.  Only yesterday I had to take a taxi.  The man told me that I was the second fare in six hours.  We know that the large increase in numbers started in 2000.  In 2011, the taxi review group stated that the oversupply was between 13% and 22% but I reckon that is something of an underestimate.  It is surprising that the taxi review group did not recommend capping numbers.<\/p><p> No doubt when the downturn came it was easy to get a taxi plate.  Taxi drivers whose sole means of income was driving a taxi faced severe competition from double jobbers and the increase in those who found it so easy to get a taxi because it seemed to be the answer to the lack of jobs.  Had that been handled more efficiently, we would have had a better industry.  I believe that lack of regulation opened the floodgates.<\/p><p> As with most jobs, it is all about exits and entrants, but in the taxi business the numbers are not matching.  Far more are entering than exiting and this makes it very difficult for taxi drivers to earn an adequate income.  This results in their working longer hours and sometimes working beyond the time they should be working.  There are resulting issues relating to health and safety.  If they work in excess of the permitted time, they could pose a serious risk to themselves, to passengers and to other road users.  Therefore, tackling the number should be the first step.<\/p><p> I wish to draw attention to one particular example.  Let us consider the lines of taxis waiting on a fare.  That can take several hours, but there are parts of the inner city where these lines are not near public toilets and where it is not possible for the taxi drivers to get to a public toilet, with the unfortunate consequence of nearby lanes and corners being used as urinals.  This has caused much annoyance to communities in the inner city, who have had to walk past.  It has meant that the local authorities have had to carry out a good deal of power washing in these particular areas as well.<\/p><p> One cannot blame drivers for leaving the engine running for heat in cold weather but it is not economical or environmentally friendly.  Coming along Dame Street last Friday night was rather like taking my life in my hands because of the amount of taxis double-parked and idle, trying to pick up fares.  I know the arguments against the regulating of numbers relating to competition, ensuring an adequate supply, ensuring new entrants, ensuring customers have a good supply and the fact that if the competition is not intense then standards will fall.  However, I do not necessarily agree with all of that.  The Indecon report noted that attempts to restrict numbers has led to difficulties because regulators were not especially good at estimating the level of supply needed to meet demand.  However, that is no reason not to try to regulate the numbers to ensure reasonable competition, an adequate supply of taxis and that taxi drivers can earn a reasonable income and work reasonable hours.<\/p><p> Let us consider other jobs and professions that have incentives to retire.  I realise taxi drivers are self-employed but perhaps there is a need for some incentives to encourage retirement in certain areas to bring about some matching between entrants and exits.  I do not believe the industry can take any more new entrants at this point, certainly not in Dublin.  However, I support the comments of other Deputies about rural areas because certain rural areas could do with a more comprehensive taxi service.  We know about the sadness and loneliness in isolated parts of rural Ireland and the social consequences.  I believe there is a role for the taxi industry in that regard.<\/p><p> One implication of the new mandatory disqualifications for the conviction of certain offences is that some current drivers may lose their licences.  That is fair enough if it is warranted but I hope there will be a fair system, that there will be an appeals system and that it will not be used as a way to restrict numbers.<\/p><p> In the past, the number of taxis was inadequate to meet demand and finding a taxi at certain hours, on certain nights or on certain occasions was like finding gold-dust in the city.  Securing a plate almost required gold-dust as well, such were the costs in those times.  I recognise that we have no wish to go back to that, but nor do we want what is happening now, which is an oversupply, long and unhealthy hours and too many drivers seeking too few fares.<\/p><p> There is an issue with wheelchair-accessible taxis, which are badly needed.  I believe those taxi drivers do a fantastic job.  However, the number of specially-adapted wheelchair-accessible taxis is falling.  There are very expensive to buy, adapt and maintain.  Everyone agrees with taxis being properly maintained and kept in good condition but I believe the economic downturn is causing severe difficulties for taxi drivers who are trying to replace such vehicles.  That should be examined as well.<\/p><p> Another issue has come up recently in Dublin.  Taxi drivers who normally work at the rank at the Gresham Hotel are going to be moved because of the Luas works.  They are being moved from a prime location that accommodates many on O'Connell Street to an area where there are only a few spaces on a small street off O'Connell Street.  This will put additional stress on these men and women who are looking for fares.<\/p><p> Another thing struck me when I was reading the Bill.  It is a case of too many chiefs because the National Transport Authority, the Taxi Regulator and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are all involved.  Let us consider one example.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issues small public services vehicle, SPSV, licences.  The NTA administers the test.  Then it is back to the Garda to certify that the person is fit and proper.  Then the NTA issues the SPSV licence.  There seems to be a lack of co-ordination between all of these.  Surely, one authority could do all of this.<\/p><p> Before I finish I wish to acknowledge the increasing difficulties for taxi drivers.  This has resulted in an increasing number of suicides among taxi drivers.  I also wish to acknowledge that they do fantastic charity work.  We see this in Dublin on certain occasions and the charitable organisations with which they are involved are grateful.  On the downside, they take chances and we have all seen examples of U-turns in the middle of the street and of stopping in the middle of the road to let fares out.  We know that there is something of a love-hate relationship between taxi drivers and cyclists.  However, if they could operate on the basis of mutual respect and if each of them kept all of the rules of the road, it would be better.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300050#YY00400","speaker":"1005","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372870500,"counter":826,"content":"<p>Deputy, you are in possession and we have no other speakers offering.

This means that in preparing Bills relevant to the budget and other operations of public sector bodies, the authority can give advice to those public sector bodies on how they should approach and ensure equality in their operations and planning.  It ensures the public bodies will have a strategy to foster equality in their operations and in wider society as a result of what they do.  Moreover, it will monitor the outputs to ensure these things actually are happening and that the organisations in question will have, through further training, the capacity to do this.  Equality budgeting is a sensible path for Ireland to follow and I suggest this is an opportunity to improve Ireland's planning and implementation capacity in order that particular groups and marginalised groups in particular are not inadvertently discriminated against in highly important legislation, such as the annual budget process.<\/p><p>  The Cabinet handbook states that regulatory impact assessments should be conducted for all significant legislation.  As every Member of this House is aware, this does not happen.  However, it must happen if Members as legislators are to improve their effectiveness over the coming years, and the inclusion of equality budgeting in that process would be a useful addition.  There is no downside to introducing equality budgeting in Ireland and putting it on a statutory footing.  It improves transparency and provides useful checks on how public assets are deployed to make sure one group is not inadvertently discriminated against or gaining over another group.  It also improves strategic thinking and analysis at a national level, at the official level here in Parliament and at a local level within individual public sector bodies.  In short, equality budgeting is a more enlightened and smarter way for officials, politicians and civil society to work.<\/p><p>  I encountered equality analysis in the form of gender-proofing in the course of policy work I was undertaking in the United Kingdom.  It was the first time I had seen it and it was highly effective, because what we were proposing was put through a gender-proofing process and that forces the mind to start thinking in different ways.  When thinking about policies or seeking to deploy public assets, it forces the mind to ensure the inclusion of various groups, be they based on gender, sexual orientation, religion, income level or whatever.  I commend the Bill the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300052#AAA00600","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1372871100,"counter":836,"content":"<p>This is an important amendment Bill which I support fully.  The issue of equality budgeting was raised more than a year and a half ago in respect of its impact on sections of society.  It has been seen to operate fairly effectively in places such as Scotland, where it has been in place for a number of years.  Consequently, useful legislation in this regard exists in other countries that could used as a map.  Equality budgeting is really important because of the internal devaluation that has taken place on foot of the Government's troika programme.  It has meant the driving down of wages and conditions in all areas, particularly for the lower paid and in respect of women and young people.  As to whether the impact this is having is known, like others, I am aware of its visual impact and of the stories people tell me.  However, neither the actual figures nor how it is affecting people are known, and it is really important that they be known.  Obviously, such cuts will increase income inequality and it is a question of how other austerity measures, including cuts to the health services, education, special needs assistants, disability supports and welfare entitlements, as well as the imposition of the universal social charge, are affecting the system.  A group of carers representing the Give Carers a Break! campaign today made that particular point.  They outlined how they had experienced a devastating cut of approximately 5% when there was an overall cut of 1.2% in the social welfare bill last year and they have called for equality-proofing.<\/p><p>  I also wish to make a point about a group of people who are particularly vulnerable, namely, the self-employed, who have been badly hit in the economic collapse, particularly given the lack of access to social supports and so on.  A man named Tony Rochford has been outside the gates of Leinster House for the past two days.  He had his own business that failed and is not paying the local property tax because he cannot afford to do so.  He considers it to be the final straw that broke the camel's back.  He has been on hunger strike for 17 days and while some Members might suggest leaving him outside for a while as he will give up, this man will not do that.  He is absolutely determined to make an issue out of this and every Deputy and backbencher in Leinster House should listen in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300052#AAA00700","speaker":"1032"},{"type":"speech","time":1372871100,"counter":837,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300052#AAA00800","speaker":"1023"},{"type":"speech","time":1372871100,"counter":838,"content":"<p>They should state that because of austerity and what has happened in Ireland, a man has been on hunger strike for 17 days and this should not be ignored.

Consequently, this Bill is welcome.<\/p><p>  I wish to give two instances of what matters can lead to when equality is not taken seriously.  The first is the case of the aforementioned Tony Rochford, who is outside Leinster House.  I had never met the man before but he was a self-employed tiler who, like many self-employed people in the construction sector, has been devastated by the economic crisis.  He is trying desperately to pay his mortgage, only to then have the property tax loaded upon him.  However, because of the particularly draconian manner in which non-payment is dealt with in the case of the self-employed, as opposed to the PAYE sector, he now cannot work because he has not been given a tax clearance certificate.  This is really desperate; he is faced with a choice of either paying his mortgage or paying the property tax and has taken what is an extreme form of action.  I do not suggest it is the right form of action but it is an action he has decided to take, namely, to go on hunger strike.  He has been on hunger strike for 17 days and he appears to be expressing determination to go all the way.  I ask the Government to consider the self-employed in this regard because in all sorts of ways they are hit disproportionately by the impact of the crisis, the property tax and so on.  I believe that Tony Rochford's case underlines the need to do something urgently about this.<\/p><p>  How much longer do I have?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300052#AAA01000","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1372871100,"counter":840,"content":"<p>The Deputy has 20 seconds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300052#AAA01100","speaker":"1023"},{"type":"speech","time":1372871100,"counter":841,"content":"<p>I also might mention briefly just where such desperation might lead.

However, it was reversed for the senior civil servants and they got away with it.<\/p><p> I believe there is a cartel in the public service that has its hands on the power and is associated with Ministers.  It does not care about the ordinary people.  It not care about Tony Rochford or people like him who are self-employed who pay their taxes.  He is now on hunger strike and in a very serious situation because of what I believe, as a self-employed person, is an anomaly in the Bill.  A section of the Bill states that he cannot get his C2 certificate because he did not pay his property tax.  I paid my property tax.  I had no problem with that even though I believe it is unjust but this man did not pay it and now he is being penalised.  He is not allowed work.  He is self-employed.  An 8% rebate is total robbery.  It is blackguarding self-employed people.  It is twice that of what applies to PAYE people, which I do not agree with either in the way it is taken out of their wages.<\/p><p> I am looking across at a Labour Minister of State and I see Labour Deputies who talk about standing up for ordinary people and small business people, the backbone of this country.  This man wants to pay for his family and earn his keep but this was rushed past him.  The property tax was rushed through this House.  Despite what the Taoiseach said, it was an unjust and unfair measure in terms of a person's home.  This man wants to do work.  He had his C2 and was tax compliant but now he cannot do anything because he has not paid the property tax.  That is a disastrous law.  I know the Government must try to collect it whatever way it can and I do not mind if the full amount of property tax is taken out of a self-employed person's business but I have a huge problem with not giving him a C2, not allowing him do his VAT returns and putting him out of business.  Furthermore, if he has no business, he will not get any unemployment benefit or assistance.  It is a perilous situation that has driven him to the gates of these Houses on hunger strike for 17 days.<\/p><p> I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to bring some sanity to the situation.  Legislation was rushed through this House and guillotines were used and what is the Government doing?  Abolishing the Seanad when we could better scrutinise legislation.

I had to read the Bill a number of times to try to figure out its purpose, and I am still not sure about that.  I think the author of the Bill is trying first to extend the nine discrimination grounds in the Equal Status Acts to include a number of additional grounds such as the rural ground and the convicted prisoner ground and, second, to create a duty on existing public bodies to have regard to promoting equality of opportunity and developing equality impact schemes for approval by the Equality Authority and also to make sure that anything it introduces is proofed in this way.  One such thing it is proposing is the annual budget.<\/p><p>  According to its author Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill seeks to introduce mandatory equality impact assessments on public bodies, introducing measures that impact on these categories as well as the existing nine categories of gender, civil status, family status, etc.  I hate to point out the obvious but the Employment Equality Act already prohibits discrimination in the employment sector and the Equal Status Acts prohibit discrimination in the provision of goods and services in each of the following nine grounds: gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community.  There are already a range of detailed exceptions that avoid extreme or unintended consequences, for example, to protect children or the age ground that applies to the maximum age at which people can attend school, etc.  <\/p><p> I am not clear if the omission of the Employment Equality Act was done deliberately or by way of a drafting error.  There were not any notes published with the Bill, which made it more difficult for me to understand what it was about.  There were no assessments of the impact the obligations in the Bill would have on any of the statutory bodies.  There was no assessment of the scope of the grounds or what the impact of incorporating them would be on the State.  There were no qualifications or exceptions as to the possible variations that might be present in the equality legislation, and there was no assessment as to the considerable staff resources each public body would have to provide to enact the changes.  I have to ask if this is serious equality legislation or just ill-thought out.<\/p><p>  Equality legislation has come a long way, and I regret when legislation such as this is put before the House when we can speak of the record not just of this Government but previous governments.  What we are faced with currently is the challenge to turn the rhetoric of fundamental rights into the reality for people living every day under the rule of law throughout our communities.  <\/p><p>  In terms of what is happening on the ground and what our Government is doing as opposed to talking about, earlier this year the Minister for Justice and Equality, who is present, appointed the members of the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  The Minister said that the merger of the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority is to promote human rights and equality issues in a more efficient, effective and coherent way, a single institution whose remit is to establish a footprint at local level.  It is independent from Government and that independence is guaranteed by its statute.  The status is vital to its credibility, both here in Ireland, in Europe and internationally.  The body will become the front-line body for turning commitment of human rights and equality into reality at national and local level.  I am in favour of practicalities and on a practical level it will promote public awareness campaigns in the print media, radio and online.  It is to remind the members of the public of their rights and to reinforce awareness of the support and redress mechanisms available.<\/p><p>  Equality is not always about treating everybody the same but it is about people treating others in such a way that the outcome for everybody is exactly the same.  From the outset this Government has shown that it is about best practice in words and in deeds.  That is the reason I will be opposing the Bill tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300053#BBB00300","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speech","time":1372871700,"counter":848,"content":"<p>On the issue of equality, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, was in the 25th D&aacute;il when the constituent members of the then rainbow Government, who now form the current coalition, drove an equality agenda when it was neither popular nor profitable to do so.  If we cast our minds back to the genesis of the debate on equality, in July 1973 that coalition Government, which is what we were referred to before Fianna F&aacute;il got into the habit of coalition, introduced legislation to remove the marriage ban.  This country has an appalling history of treating women badly and unequally but that Act passed in the 1970s removed a discriminatory ban on women who were married and working in the Civil Service.  We all know and are perhaps related to people whose careers suffered as a result of that.  If we look back to 1973 and the record of these two parties in government then we see that this discriminatory nonsense was removed.<\/p><p>  We created the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  When Labour went into Government in 1992, Mervyn Taylor was Minister for Equality and Law Reform and he initiated the campaign to remove the constitutional ban on divorce.  The prohibition on divorce in the Constitution basically meant that we were treating citizens of this country inherently unequally.  The decriminalisation of homosexuality and the passing of the Equal Status Act are the hallmarks of the now constituent parties in Government.  The record in that regard is there for anyone to see, and it is a very proud record.<\/p><p>  Listening to the debate opposite one can understand the confusion that Deputy Doherty has pointed to in regard to the specific pieces of legislation to which the Private Members' Bill refers.  It refers to the Equal Status Acts of 2000 and 2004 but curiously, either erroneously or deliberately, it does not refer to the Employment Equality Act.  That confusion is only matched by the level of debate I have heard thus far in the context of this Private Members' business.  We heard a great deal about what we already know, such as the protests and so on, but something that happened this evening should not necessarily inform a debate about equality.  All our experience as professional politicians, public representatives or people involved in active citizenship in communities in some shape or form should cherish that notion of equality and speak about it in isolation, irrespective of whether the economy is struggling or buoyant.  We all know where it should stand.<\/p><p>  The Bill proposes to create a number of grounds in terms of the Equal Status Acts, one of which, curiously, is trade union membership.  How do we establish whether someone is a member of a trade union?  I am a member of SIPTU.  I carry a SIPTU membership card with a Labour Party membership card in my wallet but how can we tell if someone is a member of a trade union?  The other curious heading is the native Irish speaker.  How do we distinguish between someone who speaks c&uacute;pla focal fluently and competently or someone who speaks it because it is their native language?<\/p><p>How does one put in place a measure to evaluate the position in that regard?

Nuair a d'fh&aacute;g m&eacute; an scoil, rinne m&eacute; dearmad ar go leor de.  We are all students of politics because we are here practising it at a level that is important in the context of our professionalism.  However, we also have personal links.  How does one assess whether someone is a competent speaker of Irish or whether he or she is a native speaker?  What would be the position with regard to someone who speaks German as his or her native language?  How would the provisions of this legislation apply to such an individual?<\/p><p> Another issue which arises is that which relates to qualifying prisoners.  One can easily understand the subjective nature of the provision in this regard.  In terms of the law, however, a prisoner is a prisoner.  How does one distinguish between the reasons one individual has been imprisoned and those - non-political - reasons another person has been imprisoned?  There is a vested interest in this regard.  It is difficult to understand how this matter should be viewed in the context of equality.<\/p><p> Reference is made in the legislation to a person's socioeconomic background.  How does one establish this?  Should one sift through the reports of the CSO and examine the breakdown of social classes?  Should one allow for the massive social mobility that occurred in this country during the Celtic tiger years?  There could be one person who left school without sitting the leaving certificate and who obtained employment on a construction site at a rate of &euro;1,000 per week and another individual with a degree in business who took up a managerial position in a company and earned half that amount.  How should we assess people's socioeconomic backgrounds?<\/p><p> The Bill is extremely flawed and there is a great deal of confusion surrounding it.  I am of the view that the flaws and confusion in question are not deliberate but are the result of error.  I, along with other colleagues, will be opposing the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300053#BBB00400","speaker":"996","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372872300,"counter":850,"content":"<p>I neither welcome nor agree with this Bill.  The Employment Equality Act prohibits discrimination in the area of employment and the Equal Status Act prohibits discrimination in the supply of goods and services.  A great deal of work was done in order to produce these two items of legislation.<\/p><p>  A number of members of the Opposition raised the case of Tony Rochford, who is on hunger strike outside the Houses.  Mr. Rochford is similar to many self-employed people.  I was self-employed and I employed 30 people at one stage.  The self-employed are experiencing serious difficulties.  Self-employed people work every hour that God sends and they put a great deal of time and effort into their businesses.  In many instances those businesses are family concerns.  As a result of the downturn, many of these people were obliged to diversify.  Diversification can involve moving into other areas of business but it can also mean moving into property or buying shares in banks - which were previously perceived as blue-chip companies - in order to provide for one's pension.  Many people such as Tony Rochford have experienced tough times.  I am of the view that the Government should try to meet this man and address his grievances.<\/p><p>  People in this country are currently involved in a love affair with the airwaves and other forms of media.  They feel that their problems can be solved by contacting Joe Duffy's &quot;Liveline&quot; programme or the Shannonside radio station, using Twitter or writing to the newspapers.  I have seen evidence of this.  As a local Deputy, people telephone me in respect of various issues.  I ask them to meet me and discuss how their problems might be resolved with the relevant Minister, Department, etc.  However, they do not want to do this.  It may have been the case when we were on the other side of the House but I believe matters have become worse as a result of a race to the bottom because all those in opposition now want to do is to go on the airwaves and state how bad things are.  As sure as day follows night, people's problems must be solved at some point.  This must be done in a rational way by trying to identify the nature of such problems and then finding solutions to them.  The Opposition must oppose the Government and that is great.  However, we must tell our constituents the truth and try to resolve the issues they raise with us rather than attempting to score political points.<\/p><p>  Point-scoring such as that to which I refer occurred in respect of both the household charge and the local property tax.  Like everyone else, I am obliged to pay the local property tax.  I do not particularly like paying it but I must do so.  I am also obliged to pay the second home charge.  I was only in a position to pay that charge on half the properties I own and, as a result, an additional fee of &euro;20 will be applied in respect of each of them next month.  When I get paid next month I will pay those charges, but I do not want to pay them.  However, we must all pay these charges because they relate to the provision of services.  There was a great deal of hoo-ha about the charges to which I refer and there were those who stated that people should not pay them.  Unfortunately, many individuals listened to what was said and are now being charged extra as a result.  I inform anyone who approaches me to see if anything can be done that I cannot help them.  I cannot even do anything about the charges that apply to me.  In my opinion, those who advised people not to pay should take responsibility for their actions.  As has often been stated, two things in life are certain, namely, death and taxes.<\/p><p>  We must try to be lenient because there are other people who, like Tony Rochford, find themselves in difficult situations.  As already stated, Mr. Rochford's problems would be much better resolved if representatives of the Government met him and, hopefully, tried to address the matter about which he is aggrieved.  It is not good that politicians in this House are seeking to try to articulate his case in the House in a way which appears to make a martyr of him.  Having said that, my heart goes out to the man.  The Government and other politicians must try to resolve this matter.<\/p><p>  The Bill would require the adoption of a hugely resource-intensive approach.  It is far too much to expect local authorities to try to address many of the matters with which it deals.  In light of the constitutional status of the Irish language, it is not clear what is intended by the provision that deals with native Irish speakers.  Does this provision relate to the 2% of our people who are native Irish speakers or to the further 8% or 10% who are competent speakers and who are natives?  The position in this regard is not clear.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag foghlaim na Gaeilge agus t&aacute; feabhas ag teacht orm.  I had the honour of being made a member of the Fine Gael Front Bench three years ago and 10% of my brief related to the Irish language.  A number of academics who profess to speak a much purer form of Irish than anyone else decided to write to the newspapers about my elevation.  We in this country can hardly speak English properly.  Like tens of thousands of others, I spent 14 years trying to learn Irish in school but I was put off the language by people such as the so-called academics to whom I refer, who expressed the view that they did not consider me pure enough to hold the position on the Fine Gael Front Bench to which I was appointed.  The native Irish speakers I encountered during my time on the Front Bench - those in Conradh na Gaeilge and Comhdh&aacute;il N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na Gaeilge - were absolutely fantastic.  They understood the position in which I found myself and I really appreciate the support they gave me.<\/p><p>  I have fundamental problems with this Bill and I will be opposing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300054#CCC00200","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1372872300,"counter":851,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I accept the spirit in which the Bill has been introduced.  My understanding is that the basic intent behind it is to ensure that decisions made by the Government and public bodies will, in essence, be proofed in order to assess the impact they might have on certain sections of society.  In theory, that is a fair enough concept.  However, the problem is that the Bill is simply not practical.<\/p><p>  As everyone is aware, the Government is operating within extremely tight and difficult budgetary constraints.  Major efforts have been made to reduce the numbers in the public service in order to bring down costs.  A number of State bodies have been abolished or merged as we attempt to secure greater efficiencies of service.  The Haddington Road agreement, if implemented, will lead to many public servants working additional hours as well as making other major sacrifices.  Only last week the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, announced the redeployment of 54 staff from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and other areas of the public service to the Garda central vetting unit.  While this is most welcome and will, I hope, help to alleviate the delays relating to the processing of vetting applications, and also the backlog,<\/p><p>it also serves to highlight the severe constraints within which we are working when staff must be moved from one Department to another to alleviate backlogs.  This is all because the continued focus of this Government since taking office had to be on trying to do more with less.  It is in this regard that this Bill does not stand up to scrutiny.  The Bill proposes what could be very resource-intensive obligations on a number of public bodies to prepare and publish equality impact assessments of their work for approval by the Equality Authority.  While such a move is likely to create much paperwork, it will not necessarily lead to greater equality.<\/p><p> I welcome the commitment from the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, that the Government will shortly publish the Bill to establish the new Irish human rights and equality commission.  As she stated, the Government is focused on imposing a positive duty on public bodies to look at the equality issues they face and address these in their annual reports.  The role of the human rights and equality commission will be an active one, which focuses on providing support and facilitation - in other words, less administration and less paperwork and more results.  <\/p><p> The Bill proposes to create five new grounds in the Equal Status Acts, including the case of criminal conviction.  This is an area in which I have a particular interest as, over the past two and a half years, I have encountered a number of cases where people have experienced major difficulties when applying for jobs due to relatively minor offences on their criminal records.  That certainly is an issue of equality.  Obviously, if a person breaks the law, regardless of how minor the offence, he or she deserves to be punished.  There should be no ambiguity about that.  However, the bottom line is that we all can make mistakes, in particular when we are young.  It is important these mistakes are not held against a person for the rest of his or her life, thus impinging on future career opportunities.  This issue has been dealt with in some detail by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, who brought forward the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill some time ago and which is currently on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il and, hopefully, will be enacted in the autumn.  <\/p><p> That Bill is much more practical in its application than the one before us.  Rather than dealing with all convictions as if they were equal, the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill differentiated between various convictions.  For example, convictions for offences such as murder, manslaughter and sexual offences may never become spent.  Likewise, convictions resulting in sentences of more than 12 months may not become spent and not more than two convictions in a person's life may become spent.  Essentially, the Bill aims to ensure that those who commit minor one-off offences are not stigmatised when seeking employment in the future.  In essence, the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill was about giving people a second chance.  <\/p><p> This Bill has chosen to extend the discrimination grounds in the Equal Status Acts but not in the Employment Equality Acts.  I am confused as to the reason for this but I understand that, as it stands, the Bill will not apply to employment issues.  <\/p><p> The Bill also proposes to extend the discrimination grounds in the Equal Status Acts to those living in rural areas, which is an interesting point.  I live in a rural area and I recall last year having a conversation with a gentlemen about the household charge.  He argued that he did not avail of any of the amenities the charge was supposed to cover.  He lived in the countryside and he advised that he did not use the public library, the swimming pool, the park and certainly did not have street lighting.  He said all of these amenities were in the town and that he did not use them but eventually he agreed that he used the roads.  Obviously, these need to be maintained too.  It was ironic this year, when the property tax took effect, that those who lived in the major cities and towns felt they were being discriminated against as their properties were of a higher value.  It was a case of the shoe being on the other foot.  <\/p><p> I note the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, made a similar point last night in regard to the provision of broadband services.  Often people living in the countryside are not able to obtain as good a quality of service as those living in towns.  Under the proposed Bill, this could be also seen as discrimination when, in fact, it is sometimes due to logistics and economics.  On that note, I was pleased, when I met with Eircom this evening, to hear it is investing &euro;1.5 billion of capital expenditure to deliver the nation's newest fibre network, reaching 1.2 million homes and businesses.  I was particularly pleased that fibre broadband will be available in Monaghan Town from July of this year and that by June 2015, Eircom fibre broadband will be extended to the towns of Carrickmacross, Castleblayney and Clones.  <\/p><p> I note that under the Bill the Government would be also classed as a public body and as a result, the annual budget would also have to be proofed and approved by the Equality Authority.  The Government and all the elected representatives of this House engage with various interest groups and organisations in the lead-up to the budget each year.  A number of these organisations hold pre-budget submission meetings which every Deputy has the opportunity to attend and take on board concerns and raise these matters thereafter.  This Bill seems to propose that we take budgetary decisions and put them in the hands of an unelected State body.  <\/p><p> At the outset I said I accepted the spirit in which the Bill was being brought forward but what it proposes is simply not practical.  It is for this reason and the other issues I have outlined that I will not support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300054#CCC00300","speaker":"973","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372872900,"counter":853,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this Private Members' Bill.  When I first read it, my sense of it was that it was positive and that this was a well-meaning Bill.  I still hold that position.  However, as someone who speaks on Private Members' and other Bills from time to time, I requested the explanatory memorandum but there was none.  I then found there was no impact assessment nor scoping of the cost of the various measures.  I am sure the Deputies opposite will not welcome this observation but it is an exceptionally broad attempt, which covers many areas.  In that regard, it is almost impossible for the Government to amend it in such a way as to support the intent.<\/p><p>  I was in business for 20 years, employed people and provided services and I came across the Equality Status Acts and the Employment Equality Acts on many occasions and in many different ways.  This Bill does not pertain to the Employment Equality Acts but much of its sentiment belongs with those Acts.  Many of the issues are covered by them, including the right to be a member of a trade union and the people's diversity and socio-economic backgrounds are protected.<\/p><p>  When we talk about the Equal Status Acts, it is difficult to envisage a situation in which in the purchase or the provision of services, the issue of whether someone is a member of a trade union, his or her socio-economic background or whether he or she speaks Irish would apply.  I would be interested to hear specific examples of where that might apply.  As a purchaser of services, in particular, my focus would be on the cost of what I was purchasing rather than on where, how or by whom the services were being provided.  <\/p><p>  There is more substance in the area of criminal convictions.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, was very open to amendments to the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill.<\/p><p>We are now awaiting Report and Final Stages of the Bill.  The spirit of allowing people with convictions to be allowed to rehabilitate is worthy of pursuit, and many of the amendments went towards allowing people a second chance.  That will cover a large portion of the criminal conviction issue.<\/p><p> I disagree about trying to designate a crime by type of person or whether it is linked to a cause.  For example, that might apply to an act of violence of a certain level carried out by somebody who may be an animal rights campaigner or who may believe an act of vandalism is a valid protest against the property tax.  That would create a great difficulty so the matter should be set, as it is currently within the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill, at the crime level rather than at person type.  I support that element of the Bill.<\/p><p> There is the potential for further debate on rural issues, particularly with regard to publicly provided services.  There is a requirement to protect people living in rural areas but when we speak about privately provided services, we should accept that for some provision of services, the cost of delivery to rural areas must be built into pricing.  One cannot allow for prejudice against people living in rural areas but equally we cannot force an uneconomic cost on business.<\/p><p> The spirit of the Private Members' Bill is good and if parts of it could come back before us, it would have merit.  There was much good work done here in debating spent convictions and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, accepted amendments from many parties.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, to push through that legislation as it would go a long way to achieving what is requested in this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300055#DDD00200","speaker":"985","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372873500,"counter":855,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Stanley, who is sharing time by agreement.

Sinn F&eacute;in has long promoted the idea of an Ireland of equals in a Europe of equals, and this not just a hollow slogan dusted down for elections.  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to building a united Ireland where equality is at the centre of how we measure the nation&rsquo;s success.  This equality will include social, political and economic equality but, unfortunately for citizens on the island, we see an Ireland far more unequal now than in the past.  Consecutive governments have pursued policies that have created inequality and contributed to the level of inequality that exists today.  A former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, former Deputy Michael McDowell, promoted inequality when he stated, \"A dynamic liberal economy like ours demands flexibility and inequality in some respects to function\".  He also indicated that it was such inequality \"which provides incentives\".  I hope we have moved on from that view.<\/p><p>  In November last year Sinn F&eacute;in pledged support for the Equality Budgeting Campaign, a broad-based coalition of trade unions, community groups and non-governmental organisations seeking the introduction of equality budgeting in this State.  Simply put, equality budgeting means that no Government could introduce a budget without it being equality-proofed first.  It is no surprise that this Government has failed to embrace this process as budgets we have seen here would never see the light of day if they were equality-proofed.<\/p><p>  So what will the Sinn F&eacute;in Equal Status (Amendment) Bill 2013 do?  It has three basic aims.  It will add six new additional anti-discriminatory categories to the already existing nine categories.  Namely, Sinn F&eacute;in would include in the category trade union membership, socioeconomic back ground, Irish language speakers and former political prisoners.  The previous speaker referred to this and although he may not be familiar with it, this concept is in the Good Friday Agreement.  It specifically refers to people who were in prison as a result of the conflict and who have served their sentences or got early release under the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>  We would also include rural dwellers in the list of categories.  The Bill will also introduce equality impact assessment, with all public bodies and Departments having to implement the process.  It will also introduce a notion of equality budgeting, where economic policy making and planning places equality at the centre of decisions concerning public expenditure and income.<\/p><p>  One issue I want to raise is the right to join and be represented by a trade union.  People have the right to join a union but they do not have the right to be represented.  We should remember that any gains made by ordinary people and their families were achieved after campaigning and struggle, and without trade unions many of the gains we now take for granted would never have been achieved.  Issues of child labour, maternity benefits, annual leave and the 40-hour week were all successfully won not because the likes of William Martin Murphy woke up one morning and said he would grant such requests but rather because trade unions won the fight.  In this city we are commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 1913 Lock-out and in the streets around here, people were engaged in an epic struggle for the right to join and be represented by trade unions.  Jim Larkin and James Connolly gave leadership and dignity to those people.<\/p><p>  It is only appropriate tonight that we reflect on the gains made by trade unions and we must also reflect on challenges facing us today.  How much has really changed?  Sadly, workers remain fearful of the consequences of joining a union, and I am sure the Minister of State comes across such people as much as I do.   It is shameful that 100 years after the great Lock-out, men and women live in fear of what their employer will do if they join a trade union.  This is a very common issue and I feel very strongly about it.  I have met trade unions organisers in the midlands on this very matter, and they recount stories of workers - men and women - living in fear of even being associated with trade unionism, never mind joining a union.<\/p><p>  In particular, this problem prevails in  the meat industry, where some employers in their race to the bottom to increase profits have employed immigrants on a minimum wage - in some cases it is reported to be even less - and proceeded to isolate them form the rest of the workforce.  When unions attempt to engage with and organise the workers they are met with a wall of silence and fear.  We have heard of cases where fathers use their children to translate stories to union organisers of bullying and victimisation in work and threats from employers.  This is unacceptable and should not be tolerated in 21st century Ireland.  This Bill is an attempt to help overcome some of this fear, and it will make it illegal to discriminate or bully workers who organise themselves in a union.  It is 100 years since the Lock-out and such steps are long overdue.<\/p><p>  I will also highlight inequality in our communities.  For years the great and the good, including people in Government, have dismissed any debate on inequality as airy-fairy, but such arguments can no longer be dismissed.  The boast of being a low tax economy has had serious negative social effects, and we only have to look at number of telling statistics to see that.  The number of children living in poverty has increased by nearly 32,000 since last year, from 200,000 in 2012 to 232,039 in 2013.  That is nearly one in five children living in poverty.  The number of people living in poverty overall has jumped from 706,000 to 731,984 during the same period.  This is the human face of austerity and inequality, which forces people into poverty and divides our society with devastating consequences.<\/p><p>The overall tax take in this State as a percentage of GDP is 31.3%, well below the European average of 35.6%.  Linked to this is the startling figure of &euro;11.49 billion.  That is the figure this Government grants in tax relief.  We must look seriously at this and I urge the Government to look at it in the run up to the budget.  It is the case that people who are wealthy get richer. <\/p><p> In their book <i>The Spirit Level<\/i>, Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett claim that for each of 11 different health and social problems such as physical health, mental health, drug abuse, education, imprisonment, obesity, social mobility, trust and community life, violence, teenage pregnancies and child well-being, outcomes are significantly worse in more unequal countries.  We know that from looking around the globe.  Their striking conclusion is that the societies that do best for their citizens are those with the narrowest income differentials - the Nordic countries - while the most unequal such as the US and the UK do worst.  <\/p><p> In conclusion, the question is where we want Ireland to be in a few years' time.  Do we want a more unequal society or do we want a more equal one that is safer, more caring and more productive?  We should say &quot;Yes&quot; to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300056#EEE00300","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372874100,"counter":858,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; iontach s&aacute;sta seasamh anseo anocht chun taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don Bhille um St&aacute;das Comhionann (Leas&uacute;), 2013.

This legislation is not revolutionary or unrealistic.  It is a simple step forward in the way a normal democratic society should deal with its affairs.  There should be protection for the six different areas that have been listed in this legislation.  Very importantly, equality budgeting should be the cornerstone of how we deal with budgets into the future.<\/p><p>  The question we have before us in this legislation and the question Deputies must ask themselves when a vote is called later on tonight is whether they fear equality and fairness and whether they want to turn their backs and protect themselves and the Government in which they are involved in continuing with the budgets they have implemented over the past number of years, which are a far cry from the slogan of equality.  I have listened to the contributions made in this Chamber.  I am amused, particularly by the Labour Party which is voting against its own party policy on equality budgeting and the views of SIPTU and the ICTU, of which many of them are proud members and shop stewards and in which they have a long history, and both of which have asked all Members of this House to support equality budgeting and this legislation.  I am amused by the squirming of Labour Deputies in particular when they try to come up with reasons to justify voting against the issue of equality.  <\/p><p>  We heard Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch tell us that equality is a subjective concept.  This is very similar to the cries made by the former leader of the Progressive Democrats, Michael McDowell, which said he was against equality.  I ask the Labour Deputies of 2013 to imagine what it would be like if they transposed themselves back to nearly 100 years ago, if one of their leaders was in place of the great Labour leader, James Connolly, when they sat down to discuss what would be in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, and if when James Connolly put forward the notion that all children of the nation would be treated equally, the Labour Party of today said &quot;equality is a subjective concept, James, we can't have that in the Proclamation&quot;.  That is the message they are sending out here today.  <\/p><p>  Why fear equality?  The answer can probably be seen in the type of measures this Government has introduced over the past two years.  Equality is not a concept.  Equality is something that is rooted in the Irish people and very dear to them but it is something that is very distant from this Government, as has been seen in its actions.  We have seen it time and time again in budgets and in the presentation made by the Carers Association in the AV room today.  It will not be the only group that will come in here asking, demanding and begging that the Government and Deputies bring forward the issues of equality and fairness.  Why attack carers when the wealthiest in society are being protected?  Why attack those with special needs while those in the privileged elite are protected? <\/p><p>  We know there is no easy way out of this crisis.  We know the mess Fianna F&aacute;il, its banker friends and corrupt developers left this State in but there is a fair way to get out of it.  This Bill would lift the veil of this Government which likes to proclaim that it is standing shoulder to shoulder with those who demand equality and fairness but which in its actions does something quite different.  I commend this Bill.  I hope the Labour Deputies look into their consciences and vote to support this legislation, which their party dictates they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300057#FFF00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1372874100,"counter":859,"content":"<p>A phrase to the effect that any free society or state should be judged on the basis of how it treats its most vulnerable members or lowest class has been used by many people down through the years.  However, its meaning is as important today as it ever was.  I think every Member of this House could agree that the Government needs to ensure that it protects the most vulnerable members of society.  Again, there is commonality in respect of that statement.  Irish society has changed rapidly over the past two to three decades and while there have always been vulnerable groups in our society, the increased diversity of our society means more and more groups and individuals need enhanced protection from State resources.<\/p><p>  This Bill proposes to create that protection and supports closing the clear cracks in Irish society.  This Government recently released One World, One Future, its new policy for international development, and reducing inequality is a key part of that policy.  In fact, the policy paper states: <blockquote>Evidence clearly shows that high levels of inequality, including gender inequality, can not only harm economic growth, but can also lead to people being trapped in poverty across generations, and in some cases social and political unrest.<\/blockquote>It commits the Government to using its aid programme to &quot;target those most excluded, deliberately addressing the inequalities these people face&quot;.  Does this evidence not apply to Ireland?  That is the question we are asking here tonight.  Does the Government believe that this should only happen abroad in foreign countries?  Inequality does not fix itself through market forces or by simple state hand outs.  To reduce inequality, one has to tackle the root causes of it and this requires robust mechanisms whose essential element is ensuring that vulnerable groups are protected.  Over 60 countries worldwide use equality budgeting to tackle inequality and poverty in their countries and surely it is time this State considered following suit.<\/p><p>  Existing equality laws ban discrimination and unfair targeting of people based on their gender, civil status, family status, age, race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, and membership of the Traveller community, but we all come across cases of discrimination every day.  Our Bill would add new and additional anti-discriminatory categories.  It would prohibit discrimination against trade union members, Irish language speakers, former political prisoners who served their sentences before the Good Friday Agreement or were released under its terms and rural dwellers and on the grounds of socio-economic background.  <\/p><p>This approach would ensure that all Departments and public bodies, when introducing new policy or budget measures, would complete equality impact assessment schemes and consultation on a statutory compulsory basis.  The Bill would ensure the Government and public bodies exercised their functions in a way designed to reduce inequality and create the conditions for a more inclusive society.  Who could be opposed to this?  It should be a key priority of the Government at all levels.<\/p><p> Everyone is aware of the economic crisis we are going through.  It is affecting families and individuals in every village and town in Ireland, but it affects some groups more than others.  Some in the vulnerable groups I mentioned earlier are overwhelmed.  The Government talks the talk of getting Ireland&rsquo;s finances back on track, on improving our international standing and increasing trade, but we must ask for who.  In the meantime the Government is going after the unemployed, single parents, the elderly, the sick, the disabled, the youth and those with special needs.  Have those at the very top, the high income earners, the wealthy and the speculators felt the pinch?  Do they shoulder their fair share of the weight?  This has led to a significant rise in inequality and poverty in the State.  Figures show the gap between the richest and poorest in Ireland increased by 25% in 2010, with the top 20% earning 5.5 times the income of those in the lowest 20%.<\/p><p> The percentage of people in Ireland living in consistent poverty increased in 2010, as did the percentage of children at risk of poverty which stands at 19.5%.  I see this in my constituency of Dublin South-West.  Large parts of my constituency have unemployment rates of more than 40% and the Government has no magic wand.  Yesterday in the D&aacute;il I raised the case of two constituents with life threatening illnesses who have been waiting for more than three years for housing adaptation grants.  These simple grants would not cure them of these terrible illnesses, but it would massively improve their lives and the lives of their families.  These people are not looking for millions, but for small amounts which would transform their quality of life.  Under the Bill their rights would be supported.<\/p><p> It is time the Government wakes up to the needs of the Irish people.  The average family and household in Ireland is drowning in debt yet every budget takes more and more from their disposable income.  Families the length and breadth of the State deserve better.  They deserve equality budgeting and it is time the Government started serving the needs of the majority of our citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300057#FFF00300","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372874700,"counter":861,"content":"<p>Yesterday I listened to Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn opening the debate.  In the course of his speech I received a text from someone in my office telling me to ask Deputy Emmet Stagg and other Labour Party Deputies whether they support the Bill.  Unknown to me the person who sent the text had read the Labour Party's policy.  I replied that I would ask.  I listened to the arguments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and I was not impressed.  I am impressed at Fine Gael's ability to put Labour Party Ministers and Minsters of State on the front line for contentious issues such as this.  Yesterday it was Deputy Kathleen Lynch and today it is Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock.<\/p><p>  Essentially the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, said we cannot afford equality.  From a Fine Gael Minister this would have been understandable because Fine Gael does not believe in equality, but the Labour Party&rsquo;s stated policy is for equality proofing.  By opposing this equality-proofing Bill Labour Party Deputies will vote against their party&rsquo;s policy position.  What is the value of the Labour Party in government if its only role is to bolster the conservative economic and social politics of Fine Gael?<\/p><p>  As Deputy Pearse Doherty stated, the Labour Party&rsquo;s founding father James Connolly is accepted as the principal author of that part of the Proclamation which guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities and the section which commits to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  The fact is equality does not exist in this society.  It is a republic in name only and the policies of the Government and of successive Governments have contributed directly to a growing inequality, particularly between the rich and the poor.<\/p><p>  I am an Irish republican.  I believe in a republican system of governance.  I believe in a real republic in which the people are sovereign and equal and have all&ndash;encompassing rights, including economic rights, the right to a home, job and education, to a health service from the cradle to the grave, to a safe and clean environment and to civil and religious liberties.  This is what republicanism and genuine democracy are about.  They are about embedding equality into the daily life and experience of citizens.  The imposition of equality duties and equality-proofing Government policies and budgets and public bodies through impact assessments are a means of achieving this and of dictating outcomes.  Without this, equality will remain little more than a pipe dream.<\/p><p>  It is a fact that inequality is all around us in this part of the island.  It famously exists also in the North, but there it has the added dimension of generational, sectarian and political discrimination.  Interestingly, the other parties here reference the continued existence of inequalities in the North as a pretext for attacking Sinn F&eacute;in.  There is no logic, truth or rationale to this position.  They quote poverty levels in west Belfast to justify their own position.  They refuse to acknowledge the citizens of west Belfast, in common with other communities throughout the North, are tackling these issues on a daily basis and succeeding against the odds.  It is because these citizens took a stand &ndash; they would be waiting a long time for Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or the Labour Party to help them &ndash; generational and political discrimination are being tackled.  In the Six Counties there are now equality protocols and equality-proofing of government policies, budgets and public bodies.  If this is good enough for the North why cannot citizens in this part of Ireland have these rights?<\/p><p>  Equality is cited 21 times in the Good Friday Agreement, including in the pledge of office for Ministers.  The Government is co-author and guarantor of this Agreement.  A complete section is given over to equality protocols, and legislation is designed to ensure equality in employment.  We all live in a post-Good Friday Agreement Ireland.  This is very obvious in the North but not so obvious here.  It is catch-up time in this State and legislating for equality here must be a key part of this.  This should include the charter of rights to which the Irish Government signed up 15 years ago.<\/p><p>  Active discrimination against the Traveller community is totally and absolutely unacceptable.  Apart from being ethically wrong, no person or community should be treated as second class or non-citizens.  Equally is good and inequality is bad for society.  Inequality is expensive and uneconomic.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s equality legislation is about achieving a more equal and prosperous society, which is in everyone's interests.<\/p><p>  If we consider the programme and record of the Government the need for this approach is obvious.  The ESRI found the budget for 2012 had a disproportionate impact on the least well-off in society and this was repeated in the budget for 2013.  Every day we see the removal of citizen&rsquo;s rights and the reinforcement of privilege for the elites in society.  Our Bill would require an equality impact assessment to prevent the implementation of unfair policies, which is why the Government opposes the Bill.<\/p><p>  We also need equality for the Irish language and for rural Ireland.<\/p><p>I commend the Bill.  I repeat what I said previously, that it will bring us in line with the North.  I repeat also that it is official Labour Party policy as adopted at last year&rsquo;s conference.  I appeal to Labour Party Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la to stand by their own policy.  They can forget about Sinn F&eacute;in.  They should stand by their party's policy and vote for this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300058#GGG00200","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372875300,"counter":863,"content":"<p>In the five minutes available I will do my best to address the contents of the Bill.  The Bill proposes to extend the discrimination grounds in the Equal Status Acts, which deal with provision of goods and services, but not in the Employment Equality Acts, which cover employment, by adding five or six new grounds for discrimination which have been articulated by Deputy Stanley.<\/p><p>  The existing equality legislation prohibits discrimination on nine grounds, but also contains a range of qualifications and exceptions to ensure that we avoid unintended and extreme consequences.  Thus, discrimination based on age is outlawed, but we ensure that children are protected and special treatment can be provided for older people where that is appropriate.  Gender may not be used to discriminate in employment, except, for example, in employment providing intimate caring services.<\/p><p>  Many of the contributions from the Opposition benches last night covered employment issues, to which the Bill as published does not apply.  We were told last night that this is a drafting error that can be easily fixed.  However, it is not the type of drafting error that can easily be corrected.  That is because there are no exceptions or qualifications proposed in the Bill in respect of the proposed five new grounds.  That is a serious omission.  As my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, said last night, equality legislation seeks to eliminate unfair or prejudicial discrimination based on a person's inherent characteristics - gender, race or age, for example - rather than affecting rational assessments of risk based on a person's previous actions.  The question of wiping the record of criminal convictions, for example, requires a nuanced approach via spent convictions legislation.  I acknowledge Deputy Dara Murphy's point in that regard.  In certain employment areas, as well as in the provision of certain goods and services, a history of conviction for serious criminal offences, such as sexual offences, fraud or theft, can be directly relevant risk factors which should be taken into account.<\/p><p>  The second<b><\/b>major defect is that the Bill does not understand the way in which equality legislation interacts with other legislation.  Reference was made last night to taxi licences and the security industry.  The Bill may be an attempt to compel the relevant authorities to grant licences in such cases, irrespective of genuine concerns about suitability, but it cannot achieve that objective.  The Equal Status Acts apply to the provision of goods and services other than public services that are regulated by other legislation.  The Equal Status Act 2000, in section 14, makes clear that it operates without prejudice to other statutory provisions.  Essentially, the 2000 Act does not apply to an issue that is governed by separate legislation.<\/p><p>  The overly simplistic approach is also illustrated by the inclusion of living in a rural area as a proposed ground for discrimination.  Access to broadband was raised in last night's debate, as it was tonight.  The Government is committed to ensuring that we have high-quality broadband services and that rural areas are served as well as urban areas.  Deputy Heather Humphreys spoke on that point.  Does anybody seriously think this goal can be achieved by a simple prohibition on discrimination, or that increased provision of broadband services in the market would be positively encouraged by an outbreak of litigation before the Equality Tribunal?<\/p><p>  The third<b><\/b>problem area is the proposal to create an elaborate new proofing mechanism by which all public bodies would draft equality schemes for approval by the Equality Authority.  The Government is taking a much more balanced, nuanced and proportionate approach to embedding concern for human rights and equality in the work of the public sector.  In the Bill to establish the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, we are taking a different approach to ensuring that public bodies place equality and human rights at the heart of what they do.  Instead of a formalistic box-ticking exercise, with an enormous administrative overhead, we are imposing a positive duty on public bodies to look at the human rights and equality issues they face and address those in their strategic plans and annual reports.  Instead of agreeing voluminous paper schemes and deploying a small army of staff for monitoring, the role of the new IHREC will be the much more active one of providing support and facilitation.  That will be a much more positive and useful approach.<\/p><p>  The final<b><\/b>point is that budgetary decisions are for the democratically elected Government of the day and for the approval of the national Parliament and cannot be subject to approval in terms of the process or content of any State agency's board.

It would be at the heart of every policy and would be the aim of every initiative.  That kind of approach would not just honour our past but ensure our future, not simply as an economy or a state but as a society thriving and growing, cherishing its people and nurturing the generation that will carry it onwards.  Some might describe that as woolly rhetoric, but those ideas are the foundation of a progressive approach and a government that ignores them is not worth electing.  I appreciate that government is not an easy task.  I know that many in this Government have been pushed to do things they did not want to or to accept policy they did not support because they felt it was unfair or unequal.  But if one starts policy discussions on the basis of what one can get away with rather what is the right thing to do, one has already lost.<\/p><p>  The Government has been far from the equality-driven administration I described.  In nearly every instance it seems to have taken the opportunity to take from those who can least absorb a cut, to take services from those who need them most and to deny those who are most vulnerable of their most basic rights.  The only time Ministers have reflected on those decisions has been after the expression of widespread vocal anger, such as in the case of recent cuts to services for disabled children.<\/p><p>  This Bill proposes to make equality budgeting a legislative requirement.  Equality-proofing a budget or policy would mean that each Minister would have to approach his or her brief and budget with the impact on wider society of the policy in mind.  It would require the carrying out of equality impact assessments by Departments.  I have asked the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on a number of occasions whether they had impact assessments carried out when deciding on certain policies.  The answer I received was depressing but also enraging.  The respective Departments claimed they had no responsibility for such a practice.  It was bad enough to be told that no impact assessments were carried out, although I suspected as much given the nature of the policies in question, but to be told that a Minister had no responsibility to ensure a policy did not increase inequality was really galling.<\/p><p>  The Bill proposes to amend the existing legislation, which was a positive step when introduced but is relatively passive and toothless.  While setting out to protect some sections of society, it did not put the onus on policy makers to prove their work was based on the principles of equality.  That is the much-needed ingredient this amendment adds and to fear it is to fear good governance and good policy.<\/p><p>  One of the groups the original Act protects is the Traveller community.  However, we do not have to look too hard to find that this group has not benefited greatly from the current legislative protection.  Perhaps in the context of a requirement to carry out such assessments and to promote equality, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, would have thought again before intervening in the housing of Traveller families he did not know.  Perhaps he would have chosen also not to speak when he used an ethnic slur against Travellers to journalists or when he stood over a cut to the maintenance of Traveller housing which saw funding drop to just &euro;50,000 for the city of Dublin.  Equality-proofing requirements might also have caused the Cabinet to pause for further reflection when the idea of cutting housing adaptation grants for disabled or elderly people by 40% was proposed, or perhaps it would have changed minds on the cut to the transport mobility grant.<\/p><p>  Another situation in which the Government has moved with no consideration for the wider impact on society is its attack on the livelihoods of taxi drivers, particularly those who were at one time political prisoners.  Despite my campaign, it is clear the Government does not give a damn that its measures will put people out of work and put their families on the breadline.<\/p><p>Government Members will claim that Sinn F&eacute;in is not being real about the finances of the State.  I propose that those who believe they will build an economy and maintain a society based on cuts to the most vulnerable - the disabled, the elderly, Travellers and single parents - are not being real.  They are being lazy and callous.  If they are neither of these, then they are weak and apologetic for these grossly unfair and insufficient approaches.  Equality is something for which we should all strive.  We should oppose inequality across the board.  The Minister of State's rhetoric indicates that he will never strive towards equality, given some of his excuses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300059#HHH00400","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372875900,"counter":867,"content":"<p>Tonight, we saw Labour's version of equality, that being sharing the same speech two nights in a row so that both speakers might make the same statement.<\/p><p>  I will cite some of the arguments made last night by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and again tonight in the same speech given by the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, for not supporting our Bill.  One of the reasons given by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for the Government not supporting the Bill was that &quot;the Bill proposes that there would be very resource-intensive obligations on the full range of public bodies to prepare and publish equality impact assessments of their work for approval by the Equality Authority&quot;.  This is an absurd argument and is an argument for not doing anything.  This is surprising, given that it is the Labour Party's policy.  How are jurisdictions with less resources than Ireland able to conduct budget equality impact assessments when this State cannot because doing so would overburden an already stretched public sector?  The North and Scotland can do it, but Ireland refuses to do it.  The only reason is that there is no political will on the part of the Labour Party and Fine Gael.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, also stated: &quot;In the Bill to establish the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, which we are working on and hope to publish before too long, we are taking a different approach to ensuring that public bodies place equality and human rights at the heart of what they do.&quot;  Let us see how this fits in with the Government's proposals.<\/p><p>  Last September, the Taoiseach attended a ceremony to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC.  While he was commending the work of the IHRC, he was proposing to merge it with the Equality Authority and to water their powers down.  At the time, we published a Bill to oppose the merger because we wanted to safeguard the bodies, one of which - the IHRC - was established as part of the Good Friday Agreement to which the Government is a co-guarantor.  In opposition, the Ministers of State, Deputies Kathleen Lynch and Sherlock, opposed any such merger.  Now in government, they seem to have rolled over to Fine Gael's demands.<\/p><p>  Last night, the Minister of State also stated:<blockquote>The reality is that resources are limited and additional expenditure demands or costs arising - for whatever reason - will have to be paid for through expenditure reductions elsewhere or through the raising of additional revenue.  Nothing is this Bill can change that reality or be of any help to the Government in making the difficult decisions its members have been elected to make on behalf of the people as we work to restore the country's economic sovereignty.<\/blockquote>After attacking some of the Bill's technical drafting issues, she got to the nub of the issue, that being, what would be the point in proceeding with the Bill if, as she believed, it would change nothing.  If she believes that the introduction of a budget impact analysis assessment process will achieve nothing, it says more about her than it does about anything else.  This is her party's policy.  SIPTU, ICTU and a number of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, came out yesterday and today in support of the Bill.  Is the Minister of State telling them that the introduction of such analyses will have no positive or progressive effect on society?  It beggars belief.<\/p><p>  I also wish to cite two comments made by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch last night.  He stated:<blockquote>Equality is a subjective concept.  Someone might come before this House and propose that because of the mortgage difficulties which obtain, everyone should receive a write-down of 30% on his or her mortgage.  That would be an equal measure but it would also be subjective because we would be giving a break to people who would not deserve it and we would probably not be giving enough assistance to those who require it.  When we discuss equality, we should place it in a subjective context.<\/blockquote>This is complete waffle.  I do not even know where he gets it.  He is obviously confusing the concept of equality with equity.  He also stated: &quot;The legislation before the House constitutes another aspect of Sinn F&eacute;in's subjectivity when it comes to dealing with prisoners.&quot;  He may recall that Sinn F&eacute;in tabled a Private Members' motion in the D&aacute;il to mark the 15th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement last May.  In moving the Government amendment, the T&aacute;naiste, Labour's leader, and the Taoiseach stated during the debate:<blockquote><blockquote>-- the Government, as joint and co-equal guarantors of the agreements, is committed to continuing to:<blockquote>-- work to ensure that the agreements are fully implemented.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>There is nothing subjective in what we propose.  It may have escaped Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch but the agreements also include political prisoners.  Is the Labour Party stating that it refuses to implement the agreements fully?<\/p><p>  Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch also stated: &quot;If the Bill is an attempt on the part of Sinn F&eacute;in to embarrass the Government, then it has missed by a mile.&quot;  We are not in the business of trying to embarrass the Government.  It does a good enough job of that itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300060#JJJ00200","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1372875900,"counter":868,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300060#JJJ00300","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1372875900,"counter":869,"content":"<p>It does not need help from us.

In addition, the Minister for Health would not have reversed disability cuts.

In 2003, the taxi sector was deregulated.  In terms of how this was done, it was an abject and total failure.  I accept that at the time there were too few taxis in some areas, particularly Dublin.  However, this was not relevant to other parts of the country, particularly rural areas.  Under the new system anybody who wanted to could apply for a taxi licence.  Most of those who applied for a licence were unemployed.  The introduction of deregulation led to conflict between local authorities.  For example, there were so many taxis in Waterford and in other areas the number of ranks available was insufficient.<\/p><p>This and a lack of sufficient parking for taxis gave rise to conflict between taxi drivers and the Garda and local authorities.<\/p><p> Deregulation was a grave error and was introduced for two reasons.  The reason cited by the Government at the time was to address a shortage of taxis in some areas.  I suspect, however, that another reason was to reduce the number of people drawing unemployment benefit by encouraging people to acquire a taxi licence.  Deregulation has resulted in a large number of taxi drivers being unable to earn a regular or decent income.  This had a twofold impact.  First, a taxi driver who decides to leave the taxi industry because the job is not working out will find it extremely difficult to obtain social welfare benefits because taxi drivers are self-employed.  This is unfair.  Second, it led to people on unemployment benefit entering the taxi industry to bolster their income.  Given that they were acting illegally to some degree, this created conflict.  The result has been that we have too many taxis on the roads and many taxi drivers are unable to make a decent living.  This issue should have been addressed because it has done considerable damage to the perception of the taxi industry.<\/p><p> I stand open to correction but I understand it is possible to purchase a taxi licence through the <i>DoneDeal.ie<\/i>website.  While I understand this issue is being addressed in the Bill, it is beyond me that this position was allowed to continue for so long.  I accept, however, that the problem precedes the election of the current Government.  Taxi drivers generally support my view that all licensing should be processed through the Taxi Regulator. <\/p><p> Deputy Pringle and I have spoken to representatives of taxi drivers.  They would like a retirement age to apply to taxi drivers, as is the case in other industries, and an arrangement to be made so that in cases where drivers are unable to work due to a long-term illness, their taxi plate would be returned to the regulator.  No such legislative provision is in place.  I have met taxi drivers who have been unable to work due to long-term illness but still have their taxi licences.  Perhaps their licences should be automatically returned to the regulator.  I believe the Irish Taxi Drivers Federation would accept such a measure. <\/p><p> I return to the decision to deregulate the taxi industry.  The large increase in the numbers of taxi drivers has meant that taxi ranks have become a dreadful problem nationwide.  In Waterford, Kilkenny and similar towns, taxis are found all over the place.  One cannot blame the drivers for the problem and we need to discuss with the relevant planning authorities what they propose to do to address it.  If some form of stay is not imposed on the issuing of new licences and people continue to be granted licences provided they meet certain conditions, the problem will quadruple in the coming years.  An accurate assessment must be made of the number of people who hold taxi licences versus demand for taxis in various areas.  For example, should the same ratio of taxi drivers to population apply in Dublin as in relatively small towns, such as Kilmac, County Waterford.  Such an assessment would prevent much of the conflict that is taking place in the taxi industry.  Before travelling to Dublin earlier this week, I spoke to garda&iacute; in Waterford who deal with taxis.  They informed me that while they do not want conflict with taxi drivers, there are constant problems because many drivers park illegally as they try to get as close as possible to full ranks.  <\/p><p> While I not have a problem with the Bill in general, given the volatility associated with the taxi industry and problems with how the system operates, it will be necessary to maintain ongoing contact with the Irish Taxi Drivers Federation.  <\/p><p> Taxi drivers agree with me on the need to ensure passengers are automatically provided with receipts and that receipts are monitored.  I take a taxi occasionally and I am only sometimes given a receipt.  In most other countries in Europe receipts are provided automatically.  A system must be put in place that ensures punters believe they are getting a fair deal.  While taxi passengers generally do get a fair deal, people purchasing goods or services in shops are entitled to a receipt.  It should also be mandatory to provide a receipt in the taxi industry, although I am not certain how any such requirement would be monitored.  The issuing of receipts would prevent disputes between taxi drivers and their customers.  How often has one heard someone say he or she was ripped off or overcharged by a taxi driver?  Many of them will not have been ripped off because much depends on traffic and so forth.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this proposal, which taxi drivers support.  It would be a step forward for punters if they knew they would be charged a reasonable amount for their journey and would be given a receipt that is monitored to prevent overcharging.  <\/p><p> The Minister of State will be aware of the volatility of the taxi industry which had given rise to taxi disputes all over the country.  We need to keep in contact with the various representative organisations, of which I understand there are two, although there may be several unofficial organisations.  They are making an effort to unionise the industry and ensure it offers a decent service to customers.  They know it is in their long-term benefit to achieve these objectives but they need assistance.  Taxi drivers need to be treated as other workers in industry are treated.  They require reasonable rates of pay and must be able to retire.  Many of them are earning wages that are far below the minimum wage but cannot sign on for social welfare benefits because they are self-employed. <\/p><p> I understand there are 25,000 taxi drivers.  This is a significant number of people who are generating money for the economy, providing a service and paying tax and PRSI.  If any other industry was employing 25,000 people, we would ensure it was regulated and monitored and those employed in it paid tax and PRSI and were paid a reasonable rate for the service they provide.  This is all taxi drivers are asking.  If we do this, the Exchequer, tourists and taxi users will benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300062#LLL00800","speaker":"1094","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372877400,"counter":883,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill, which repeals and replaces the 2003 Act.

This will introduce a third layer of taxis.  We have the taxi-plate holders, the hackneys and now these new rural hackneys.  There will be major problems with the policing and regulation of it.

Hackney licence holders in rural areas are struggling and barely making a living as things stand.<\/p><p>  The difficulty in making a living leads me to a matter not addressed by the legislation, which is the oversupply of taxis in the country.  While it is difficult to make estimations, the Indecon report estimated that the oversupply could be as high as 22%.  Based on what I see in Dublin I believe that is an underestimation of the oversupply.  We all remember the complaints in 2001 and 2002 about the lack of taxis in Dublin.  Then we had deregulation and the supply exploded.  It is an example of market failure at the other end where the market has failed due to oversupply and has not been able to rectify itself.  It would be an interesting study for some economist to figure out how to adjust for market failure in the other direction.  We always talk about market failure being a lack of supply but we now have a complete oversupply.  While it is not covered in the Bill, it needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>  I know that the whole country is now effectively a taxi-meter area and taxis from rural areas can come in and operate in Dublin at the weekends etc.  They will go where the business is and try to make a living.  That further highlights the difficulty taxi drivers have in making a living as things stand at the moment.  We cannot rely on the recession to deal with it because when the recession is over and things improve again, the supply will explode again.  I do not know how it can be addressed but it needs to be considered on a longer-term basis.<\/p><p>  I agree with the Bill's provisions to exclude people from getting PSV licences based on past convictions.  I cannot understand why the provisions in the 2003 Act were never implemented because potentially a sex abuser or rapist could be plying his trade as a taxi driver, which makes no sense.  I take it that will be implemented rapidly on the passing of the legislation.  I have one note of caution.  Existing taxi drivers who lose their licences under this provision can opt to go to the courts to have the licence reinstated if they show their good character in the intervening period since their convictions.  However, it should be possible to have a system that is not as costly as going to the courts to have that right vindicated.  Particularly in the transition period where existing taxi drivers lose their licences we should provide that a judge, a barrister or someone else could hold a review and make the decision on that basis rather than requiring that they go through the courts to have the right vindicated.<\/p><p>  I agree with the assertions of the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies about the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and the former combatants who would be excluded under this Bill.  There may be an obligation on the State to make some provision for that.  That should be addressed.<\/p><p>  Moving the licensing to the NTA and away from the Garda and the Carriage Office streamlines the process.  However, the Bills digest for the legislation referred to concern that has been expressed relating to the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill that is on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  It specifically states that its provisions do not apply to applications for licences under section 34 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.  Owing to timing constraints it might not be possible to address that in this Bill, but it should be addressed and people with spent convictions should not have to disclose them when applying for taxi licences.<\/p><p>  I agree with the introduction of a demerit system.  I have already mentioned the lack of enforcement officers, which is a problem we have throughout Irish society.  We are great at making the laws but terrible at enforcing them and we do not commit to the enforcement.  I know the Bill provides that the NTA can enter service agreements for the enforcements.  I have concerns about that.  The outsourcing of enforcement is a retrograde step and we should have a system that is financed through the licence fees with our own enforcement officers.  We should not outsource more enforcement.  We have outsourced speed cameras and we will probably privatise and outsource the Garda at some stage in the future, which is not the way to go.  That is a philosophical point of view I have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300064#NNN00500","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1372878000,"counter":889,"content":"<p>I agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300064#NNN00600","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1372878000,"counter":890,"content":"<p>I agree with the basic tenets of the Bill.

While a taxi driver can pick passengers up in Donegal and drop them at their destination, it is not possible for the taxi driver to end up in Dublin and start operating out of Dublin.  The Deputy has made a very good suggestion about the courts.  However, the Bill provides for an appeal mechanism which will probably meet the Deputy's requirements.<\/p><p>  Deputies' contributions have ranged from the legislation before us to the multiplicity of regulatory changes introduced as a consequence of the implementation of the review which I chaired.  As there is considerable duplication and overlap, I will refer to both of them.  Indecon estimated a 22% oversupply, which I regarded as quite low.  While I rarely see Dublin on a Saturday night, even on a Thursday or a Friday it is possible to see it.<\/p><p>Clearly, there is oversupply and I accept that totally.  However, I want to say out straight that I deal with the taxi industry at a level of detail that, by and large, no other Minister has done previously.  The majority of taxi drivers are decent, honest and genuine people and that is the case throughout the country.  I have met them in Letterkenny, Galway, Cork, Portlaoise and throughout the country.  This is the case in particular for full-time taxi drivers.  The motivation behind the regulations and legislation I am introducing is to ensure they can do an honest day's work and not work a 16 hour day to ensure they bring home an honest day's pay.  Unfortunately, through the <i>laissez-faire<\/i>and non-priority approach politically of previous Governments towards this industry the food has been taken out of their mouths, but I aim to change that.  Much of this work is motivated by my personal experience, knowledge and interaction with such people, who, I believe, are decent hard-working people.<\/p><p> I examined the issue of capping licences when I first came to office.  However, legally I cannot do it.  There are various reasons relating to Irish and European law which mean I cannot do it and there are several court cases that have set a precedent in this area.  All of this means it would be folly for me to try to set a cap.  Having said that, we have considered the issue through this legislation and the regulatory changes we are introducing through the National Transport Authority.  The idea is to change completely the way the industry is regulated through the NTA.  Under the authority there will be a range of qualitative and legislative changes to deal with the industry and make it fit for purpose.  This will not happen overnight - I accept that - but I believe it will take place as a result of all the changes.  If they are truthful about it, those in the industry would admit they have seen that already.<\/p><p> Some Deputies raised the issue of a buyback scheme for licences in order to bring down the numbers.  To put it straight, I do not believe licences should have a monetary value.  My driving licence does not have a monetary value and similarly I do not believe taxi licences should have such a value.  Years ago a person had to pay thousands for a licence which were trading for serious money and it was absolutely ridiculous.  I am ensuring there is a prohibition on the transfer of licences.  This is something the majority of taxi drivers have welcomed.  The situation of the rental market and that aspect of the industry was completely ridiculous.  Now, when a person rents a car, he must rent the whole package.  A person does not simply secure his licence and then proceed to get the car and the equipment.  The whole thing must be in one and, therefore, an owner is responsible.<\/p><p> I had to make one change relating to the prohibition on licence transfer.  This relates to when someone with a licence passes away.  There is an exemption in this area for several months afterwards and someone can apply as a member of the family to take on the licence.  To be honest, I did that as a result of representations to the taxi steering group and I made the change on the basis of the request.<\/p><p> The issue of prohibition has been raised.  An amendment will be introduced on the next Stage relating to companies because a percentage of licences are owned by companies and we need to ensure there is an approach to deal with that.  I will deal with that on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> Much of the Bill deals with the issue of people who have serious convictions and who have a licence to drive a taxi.  Put simply, there are people, possibly driving by this building tonight, who simply should not be behind the wheel of a taxi.  I am not suggesting there are many of them, but they do exist.  Given that there is legislation providing powers to deal with this, it is an insane and crazy situation in 2013.  We all have loved ones who could get into the back seat of a taxi driven by a person who certainly should not be behind the wheel of any public service vehicle.  That is the motivation.  The motivation is to ensure we have an industry fit for purpose and, from a consumer point of view, one in which the consumer can trust and feel safe using.  In addition, drivers must feel safe as well because the number of attacks on drivers is ridiculous and there has been completely unacceptable behaviour by some among the public.<\/p><p> People have raised the issue of the various timelines that are being put out depending on the conviction.  This relates to the number of years, whether retrospective or in future, a person will lose his licence if he has certain convictions.  We must be proportionate and we need to work closely with the Attorney General to ensure the prohibition or withdrawal of a licence is proportionate to the crime of which the person is convicted.  This is what the table in the Bill outlines.<\/p><p> The issue of those who have convictions and who were released under the Good Friday Agreement has been raised by several colleagues, especially those in Sinn F&eacute;in.  I simply do not believe this is the appropriate place to deal with that issue, but that is not to dismiss it.  The issue goes beyond the Taxi Regulation Bill.  It is a broader issue.  I have taken many soundings and advice, including advice from the Attorney General.  The issue is broader than the Bill and most Deputies, if they thought about it logically, would accept that.  There is a broader issue in respect of those who were released under the Good Friday Agreement, their rights under the Agreement and how, as a nation, we are dealing with it.  That is why there is a provision in the Bill to allow people a fair amount of time to go through the courts in a reasonable way if they believe they should have their licences back.  However, there is another point, which was raised by Deputy Pringle as well.  There is a possibility that this issue should have been raised under the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill in some fashion.  Some Deputies, especially from Sinn F&eacute;in, have said that amendments were tabled.  I have not had a chance to clarify it but I understand amendments were tabled to this Bill in the Seanad.  However, to my knowledge no amendments were tabled in the D&aacute;il or Seanad on the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill in respect of the Good Friday Agreement.  That may be something that should be reflected on by others.<\/p><p> This legislation brings changes in the area of fixed penalties.  I took advice from the taxi advisory committee in respect this issue.  I changed the penalties and made some of them more lenient because I believed it was necessary.  We added several penalties and we brought in the issue of penalty points or demerits as they are termed in the legislation because if someone is constantly going against the regulations and laws, he should have his licence suspended.<\/p><p> I accept absolutely the views of every Deputy on rank space.  It is an issue in every major city.  Every year I meet people in local authorities in the major cities and I am always asking them to provide more rank spaces for taxes.  We are constantly looking at this and local authorities are constantly looking at the issue of bus lanes and lay-by space and anything that can be used, especially at night because that is when the surge occurs.  Work is ongoing in this area with all the major local authorities.<\/p><p> Many speakers have said that we are doing a good deal of work in this area but they have questioned whether there will be enforcement.  There will be enforcement.  I estimate the number of enforcement officers will treble.  This will not necessarily unfold as Deputy Pringle envisages.  We need to consider this area and reflect on what meets the requirements.  However, the capacity of the Bill allows flexibility if we need to ramp up or down in certain areas.  To be frank, initially, after this legislation is enacted, we need to ramp up quickly and that is what the Bill allows us to do.  I imagine Deputy Pringle appreciates that.  Enforcement is a major issue and there is no point in putting in place all of these regulations and the legislation to back them up if we do not enforce them.<\/p><p> Technology has contributed significantly to the industry in recent years.<\/p><p>For example, the National Transport Authority has developed an app for one's telephone that enables one to check every taxi driver before getting into the car.  This is a fantastic, widely used application, which incidentally is used a great deal by taxi drivers.  One also sees the Hailo app among others and technology is contributing greatly.  However, one must be able to ensure the industry is good enough both to allow this technology to facilitate people and to embrace the technology in the first place in order that it all works together, as I believe it will.<\/p><p> I propose to introduce a number of amendments on Committee Stage on a range of issues, one of which concerns the issue of a notification to the employer that one is driving a taxi.  There is an issue regarding the volume of hours that drivers work that often is discussed with the Road Safety Authority in my Department.  Some drivers could have other jobs and I note the case of the &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; television programme when someone also was a bus driver.  This issue must be dealt with because it is not safe to drive vehicles, be they buses or trucks, for hours on end and then get into a taxi straight away and continue driving.  I believe everyone will accept this point.  Rural hackney licences are necessary because of market failure.  This issue is being teased out at present and is a requirement in rural Ireland.  I emphasise its purpose is not to displace taxis but simply to ensure there is some form of provision in place to enable communities in rural areas to go about their business, socialise, etc., in a safe environment.  Everyone is aware of anecdotes concerning arrangements in different parishes whereby people get lifts, only for tenners to be left on seats and so on.  This simply is unacceptable and one is merely waiting for an accident to happen at which point someone will ask why the Government did not do something about it.  This is the reality, as I live in rural Ireland and know it well.  There also is the issue of community cars but I accept Deputy Pringle's point in particular regarding the subject of hackneys, examining that space and ascertaining how closely together they can be brought.  However, I believe this must happen, as rural Ireland is suffering detrimentally and this measure, together with a realigned rural transport scheme, can really help in this regard.  This is the reason I am making so many efforts on this issue.<\/p><p> A personal ambition is to ensure the issue regarding those with a requirement for wheelchair taxis is dealt with completely and rapidly.  It is unacceptable for people to receive subsidised licences on the basis they will offer this service, only to see them pulling up at Dublin Airport with a load of golf clubs in the back.  This is not acceptable.  I accept the cost of and specification for these cars are way too high and I am working on a separate measure to bring down those specifications.  Moreover, it is intended to create a centralised system whereby those who need such services will be able to place an order.  As a result, in the case of someone who refuses to meet the passenger or accept the booking on a number of occasions, there will be a consequence for that person.  I believe this to be appropriate and that all Members share my views in that regard.<\/p><p> I will conclude by making the point that over the past year and a half or more, I know of no other Minister who has met industry figures as often as have I.  I met them before and as part of the review.  I received deputations, accepted submissions and have met groups throughout the country.  Moreover, I continue to get representations and I deal with them as much as I can.  However, there is a point at which one must make decisions.  The industry is extremely fragmented and there are many disparate groups.  One probably cannot put two different groups or even two different taxi drivers into a room and get them to agree on things because they simply will not.  All Members present are aware of that and are all smiling and laughing because it is the truth.  That said, I acknowledge they have genuine concerns.  They have been represented and I have taken on each issue and digested it to come out with the best solution possible within the legal parameters that exist.  I hope Members respect the point that legal parameters are in place and my Department is bringing forth a combination of this legislation with the regulatory changes, comprising more than 46 measures, that are being put in place in tandem with this Bill.  Collectively, this will lead to a better and far superior industry in the coming years.  I look forward to the Committee Stage debate later, when I intend to introduce amendments.  I also will consider all amendments tabled by any Members at that Stage.  I thank Deputies for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300064#NNN00800","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372879200,"counter":894,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Taxi Regulation Bill 2012 [Seanad]: Referral to Select Committee","time":1372879200,"counter":895,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300066#PPP00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1372879200,"counter":896,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Sub-Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport pursuant to Standing Orders 82A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and (6)(<i>a<\/i>) and 126(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300066#PPP00400","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372879200,"counter":897,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1372879200,"counter":898,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 9.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 4 July 2013.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
