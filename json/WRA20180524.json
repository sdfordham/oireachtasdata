On an annual basis, Enterprise Ireland works with approximately 5,000 companies through a network of market and sector advisers based across 10 national offices and 33 international offices. These manufacturing and internationally traded services companies are a critical source of existing employment and job creation in every county in Ireland. <\/p><p>Brexit presents the most significant economic challenge of the past 50 years, and it is important that we prepare for any long-term structural and disruptive change that may emerge.  Being prepared is crucial to ensure resilience to emerging challenges.  To promote awareness, and supported by a national <i>Prepare For Brexit<\/i>campaign, Enterprise Ireland designed and launched a &euro;5k <i>Be Prepared Grant<\/i>that supports the costs of SME clients in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit.  This grant is demand led, and I am confident that Enterprise Ireland has the budgetary resources to meet the needs of all eligible companies who apply for the Grant.  To date, 106 Be Prepared Grants have been approved to Enterprise Ireland client companies.  <\/p><p>I have also launched a Brexit Working Capital Loan Scheme in April 2018, which will provide affordable working capital financing to eligible businesses. My officials are examining policy proposals for a new longer-term Business Investment Loan Scheme to support businesses. <\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland will continue to promote and develop supports across all counties and regions to ensure that the maximum number of clients are engaged in preparing for the impact of Brexit. These additional schemes include the Strategic Consultancy Grant supports the hiring of an outside consultant to assist the company in devising and\/or implementing strategic initiatives aimed at improving business function and resilience. It is designed to facilitate business growth as the consultants can act as coach, mentor, facilitator, analyst, negotiator and\/or operator for the company.  Up to 50% of the costs incurred in hiring a consultant are available up to a maximum grant amount of &euro;35,000. <\/p><p>The Market Discovery Fund provides support to companies to assist them in researching the viability of exporting in new or existing markets. The maximum funding is 50% of eligible expenditure up to a maximum grant of &euro;150,000. <\/p><p>EI is continuing to work with companies to help them to become more innovative. The Agile Innovation Fund is an RD&amp;amp;I grant aimed at clients in sectors with rapid design cycles.

The EU remains committed to the continued full and effective implementation of the JCPOA.  The lifting of sanctions against Iran under the JCPOA has led to a positive impact on trade and economic relations with Iran, and its commitment to ensuring that this can continue to be delivered in the interests of improved geo-political stability.<\/p>  <p>  Form a trade perspective, Iran, with a population of 80 million, and a relatively wealthy middle class, is a potential growth market worthy of further exploration for Irish exporters.  However, I agree that the recent announcements by the US Administration are likely to have a negative effect on this growth potential, in particular if the US imposes sanctions on European companies that do business in Iran following their withdrawal from the Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  According to CSO figures, Irish goods exports to Iran nearly doubled from &euro;72 million in 2016 to &euro;143 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase of &euro;67m in the General Industrial Machinery category.  However exports to Iran are a very small proportion of Ireland's total global goods exports - amounting to only 0.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s total goods exports in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Goods imports from Iran to Ireland increased from &euro;1.6 million in 2016 to &euro;3.5 million in 2017.  According to the CSO, there is no services trade with Iran.  <\/p>  <p>  According to CSO data, there is no Iranian foreign direct investment into Ireland. There are no Iranian companies in the IDA portfolio at present.  IDA Ireland is maintaining constant contact with their client base in relation to any potential impacts the sanctions may have and the Agency will continue to monitor the situation closely.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the alleviation of sanctions under the JCPOA, there remain practical difficulties for Irish businesses seeking to do business in Iran.  The continuance of some US financial sanctions has meant that European banks - including Irish institutions - have been cautious with regard to engaging in financial transactions with Iran.  In addition, Iran is often not included as a covered geographical territory for travel insurance and\/or other types of business insurance, where the insurance company is from the US, or has a US mother company, and travelling to Iran negates the visa waiver for Irish passport holders travelling to the US.  <\/p>  <p>  Despite these difficulties, Enterprise Ireland has supported the efforts of Irish companies wishing to trade with Iran, while highlighting the practical difficulties of doing business there.  EI has previously brought trade delegations to Iran, and also held a 'Doing Business with Iran' Event in Dublin in July 2017, which 35 EI clients attended.  EI has also secured the services of an in-country Iranian market expert\/pathfinder, to provide advice and assist EI clients WHO may encounter difficulties due to the re-imposition of sanctions or the threat of same.<\/p>  <p>  As regards client companies of EI, the precise consequences arising from the very recent announcement by the US Administration of its withdrawal from the JCPOA are still being analysed and EI, together with my Department, will keep the impacts on those companies under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400048#WRA02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Meetings","counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400048#WRA02700"},{"type":"question","counter":29,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[22852\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400048#WRA02800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will report on the recent meeting of the Digital 9 EU conference; the key issues discussed at the meeting and the way in which Ireland compares with the other members of the D9 in terms of the digital economy; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":30,"content":"<p>As Minister of State responsible for Trade, Employment, Business, EU Digital Single Market and Data Protection, I hosted a Ministerial meeting of the EU Digital 9+ (D9+) front-runner countries, which is a loose affiliation of like-minded Member States on Digital Single Market issues, on 15 May.

This has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in. Despite improvements in Irish cost competitiveness, the openness of the economy means that the enterprise sector is particularly vulnerable to negative price and cost shocks which are outside the influence of domestic policymakers. Brexit also brings into sharp focus the importance of our cost competitiveness. <\/p>  <p>  Government is committed to take action to address unnecessarily high costs (i.e. cost and price levels not justified by productivity) wherever they arise. A range of initiatives set out in the Action Plan for Jobs are in train across Government Departments to improve the ease of doing business, reduce the administrative burden, enhance our cost competitiveness and productivity, and drive greater efficiencies across the enterprise base. <\/p>  <p>  The National Competitiveness Council and my Department and its agencies are continually engaged with relevant stakeholders on the particular policy needs required to support cost competitiveness. These stakeholders include other Government Departments, regulatory bodies, other public bodies and the private sector. In this regard, there is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage the controllable portion of their respective cost bases, drive efficiency and continue to take action to address unnecessarily high costs. Such actions will ensure that improvements in relative cost competitiveness are more sustainable, leaving Ireland better positioned to cope with external shocks. <\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises that rising insurance costs for enterprise are an issue. For this reason, the Minister for Finance established the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016. In terms of my own Department&rsquo;s work, in December 2017, we published the First Report of the Personal Injuries Commission, which was established on foot of a recommendation from this Cost of Insurance Working Group. Implementation of the actions in the Report of the Personal Injuries Commission will help to bring more consistency to medical reporting and diagnosis of personal injuries, leading to a better functioning personal injuries environment in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The ongoing work of the Personal Injuries Commission, the implementation of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and the complementary work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group should contribute to a better functioning personal injury litigation system and should also help to deliver reduced premiums for businesses.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of commercial rates, the levying and collection of rates is a matter for each individual local authority. The Department of Housing and Planning has developed legislative proposals to modernise and consolidate the legislation governing commercial rates.  Among the measures included in the General Scheme of the Bill are provisions to allow a local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support the implementation of policy objectives, including in: local economic and community plans; Development Plans and Local Area Plans; and national planning policies.<\/p>  <p>  The Government approved the drafting of a Rates Bill. The General Scheme of the Bill is currently with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office for drafting, with a view to its introduction as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400048#WRA03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development Data","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400048#WRA03300"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[22859\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400048#WRA03400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her views on whether the Innovation 2020 research and development intensity target of 2.5% of GNP will be attained; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>In 2011 and as part of the Europe 2020 Strategy to support growth that is smart, sustainable and inclusive, the Government committed to raise gross investment in Research and Development to 2.5% of GNP by 2020. This commitment was reiterated in Innovation 2020 in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Expenditure on Innovation, Research and Development consists of both public and private expenditure. Gross investment in R and D has since risen to &euro;3.2 billion in 2016. This is an increase of over half a billion euro since 2011. The estimated expenditure on R and D by Government Departments in 2017 is &euro;768 million. This represents an increase of almost &euro;40 million over 2016 and is the highest level of public expenditure on R&amp;D since 2012. <\/p>  <p>  A very significant part of our innovation policy has been to align public investment efforts in a manner that leverages R and D activity in the enterprise sectors. While private spending on R and D slowed during the financial crisis, it has been increasing steadily since 2011. Business Expenditure on R and D rose to &euro;2.3 billion in 2016 from &euro;1.7 billion in 2011, an increase of over 35%.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the fact that overall expenditure in R and D has increased every year since committing to Europe 2020 targets, reaching the 2.5% of GNP intensity rate target presents a very significant challenge. In 2016 our GNP intensity level stood at 1.43%, down from 1.91% in 2012. Even when using GNI* as a complementary indicator (GNI* removes globalisation impacts on the Irish economy), the R and D intensity rate is estimated at 1.72% for 2016. <\/p>  <p>  This is in part due to the strength of our economic performance and subsequent increases in GNP growth rates year on year over the last number of years. Our challenge is to increase the level of investment in R and D to keep pace with GNP growth rates, in the context of significant demands on the public purse.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the level of the R and D intensity rate, I am pleased to note that Ireland performs well in international comparison tables.

Funded by my Department, LEO Donegal plays a critical role in supporting microenterprises in the start-up and expansion phases.  <\/p>  <p>  The LEO Donegal has invested significantly in micro and small businesses by way of its core suite of supports since its establishment in 2014. Between 2014 and 2017, the LEO Donegal paid out over &euro;1.4 million in grant funding in respect of 121 projects. Clients supported with grant funding have consistently added new jobs with 100 new jobs supported in 2017 and 621 in total over the last 4 years. During this time, over 5,200 participants attended LEO training courses and 132 participants received mentoring. Furthermore, 211 applicants from the county entered the Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) competition since it was launched in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  As you know, my Department secured an additional &euro;4m capital funding for the 31 LEOs for 2017 to fund a range of LEO Brexit supports across the country, including Donegal. This additional funding has been maintained for 2018. These supports are aimed at strengthening the capacity of micro and small businesses to better cope with the changing external environment, especially the impacts arising from Brexit. The supports include grants to assist LEO clients in diversifying their markets, targeted training and mentoring to address Brexit-related challenges and opportunities, as well as a Lean for Micro programme to help micro-enterprises to address competitive issues within their businesses by building the capability of their employees to identify problems and improve operations.<\/p>  <p>  The LEOs can also assist businesses in accessing other Government supports, for example, business loans from Microfinance Ireland or Trading Online Vouchers for businesses that want to improve their online sales. <\/p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plan for Jobs, launched in the North East\/North West in November 2015, is a central pillar of the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create more jobs in rural areas including Donegal. Under the Plan, the aim is to increase employment in the region by 10-15% over the period to 2020, resulting in the delivery of 28,000 jobs. 12,000 more people are in employment in the Border region from Q1 2015 to Q2 2017 representing good progress towards the target of 28,000 jobs by 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In May 2017, my Department with Enterprise Ireland launched the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) with funding of up to &euro;60m designed to support the ambition, goals, and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs. The first call under this Fund concluded last August, with results announced on 11th December. Three projects across the North East\/North West secured funding under the first call including Donegal Digital Innovation which will involve the creation of an innovation ecosystem in Inishowen, by delivering a 3-year enterprise capacity-building programme based on the peninsula&rsquo;s location factors, high tech skillsets and applied research potential in traditional sectors. <\/p>  <p>  The second call for projects under the Regional Fund opened for applications on Monday 16 April.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, my colleague Minister Ring has responsibility for the Action Plan for Rural Development which takes a whole-of-Government approach to the economic and social development of rural Ireland.  The Plan contains over 270 actions to be delivered by a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other bodies. The Plan seeks to support sustainable communities, support enterprise and employment, maximise our rural and recreation potential, foster culture and creativity, and improve rural connectivity.  A key objective of the Plan is to support sustainable communities through the enhancement of local services, in areas such as rural schools, post offices, and convenience shops.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400048#WRA03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400048#WRA03900"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[22860\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400048#WRA04000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of the introduction of legislation to enhance the powers of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board in view of the recommendation in the cost of motor insurance report; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>On 27 June 2017, the Government gave approval to the drafting of the Personal Injuries Board (Amendment) Bill along the lines of the General Scheme.

Given the size of the investment involved, and the subsequent issues encountered by the company throughout the planning process, IDA Ireland was in regular contact with its management throughout this time. The Agency, however, had no role in the independent planning process and court challenges in respect of it. As far as I am aware, Apple currently has not made any decisions in relation to the future of the site.<\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the Government, together with IDA Ireland, did everything it could to support this investment. This included high-level engagement with the company, both at home and abroad. The Taoiseach, for example, met with the firm&rsquo;s senior management in the USA in November 2017, where he made it clear that the project had the support of our Government and the local community in Athenry.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, in spite of these efforts, Apple has taken a commercial decision not to proceed, making it clear that the delays that beset this project caused them to reconsider their plans. As I have made clear, these delays have underlined our need to make the State&rsquo;s planning and legal processes more efficient. The Government has therefore already been working, over the last number of months, to make improvements to those processes. This will ensure that we are better placed to take advantage of future investment opportunities, whether from data centre providers or other sectors. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has, for example, published legislative proposals to designate data centres as \"strategic infrastructure\" for planning purposes. This will ensure that future data centre-related planning applications can move more swiftly through the planning process. I am hopeful that these legislative changes can be enacted by the end of the current D&aacute;il session.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government also agreed, in October 2017, to the implementation of a strengthened policy framework to support the continued development of data centres. This framework includes a number of actions which, once fully implemented, will help Ireland attract and sustain such investments in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Part of this work is the development of a National Policy Statement on the role of data centres in Ireland&rsquo;s overall enterprise strategy. This will set out their potential in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s economic development, especially in regional locations, whilst taking account of wider challenges in energy and renewable energy policy. The importance of data centres to Ireland is recognised as well in Project Ireland 2040, which makes clear that the promotion of Ireland as a sustainable international destination for information and communications technology infrastructure is a key national objective. <\/p>  <p>  The IDA, meanwhile, is already working hard to win new data centre investments for Ireland. Despite the disappointing decision made by Apple, Ireland is still a highly attractive destination for data centre projects. There are nearly 30 major data centres located here that are operated by some of the world&rsquo;s leading technology companies and I am confident that this number will increase in the future. Ireland&rsquo;s strengths for this type of investment, including our climate, energy supply and business environment, remain well-known to other potential investors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400049#WRB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits Data","counter":55,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400049#WRB01000"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[22890\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400049#WRB01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her views on recent changes she made to employment permits for workers from outside the European Economic Area; and her further views on the way in which this will impact on employment here.","asker":"1361","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>On Monday 14th May, I announced a pilot, quota based system that will address the immediate needs of the Horticulture, Dairy and Meat Processing Sectors and is a first step in addressing some of the challenges facing the sector.

For this reason, I asked the review group in advance of completing the full review, to prioritise the emerging labour shortages in the sector in its deliberations.<\/p>  <p>  I am applying a quota of 500 permits for horticulture workers, 250 for meat processing operatives and 50 for dairy farm assistants. This is to ensure that in the longer-term, strategies are put in place to source labour supply from both the domestic and European labour markets and to invest in innovative technologies for the sector.  A new minimum remuneration threshold of &euro;22,000 is being introduced for these occupations. Furthermore, there will be specific obligations on the employers around the welfare and prospects of the foreign nationals employed. This includes ensuring they have access to suitable accommodation and to training in areas such as language skills.<\/p>  <p>  This is a departure from our current employment permits regime, which has generally focused on critical skills gaps at the higher end of the labour market as we position Ireland for further growth in the knowledge economy.  Like many developed countries, however, we are now seeing pressures at the lower-skilled end of the market. In seeking to deal with these pressures, I am also conscious that any changes introduced must not disrupt the domestic labour market.<\/p>  <p>  Employment permit policy is part of the response to addressing skills deficits which exist and are likely to continue into the medium term, but it is not intended over the longer term to act as a substitute for meeting the challenge of up-skilling the State&rsquo;s resident workforce, with an emphasis on the process of lifelong learning, and on maximizing the potential of EEA nationals to fill our skills deficits.<\/p>  <p>  The report of the Inter-Departmental review group, due this summer, is tasked with recommending a strategy for economic migration to meet the State's changing labour needs into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400049#WRB01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Action Plan for Jobs","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400049#WRB01300"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[22873\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400049#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the key measures in the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 for persons with disabilities.","asker":"1262","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":60,"content":"<p>The Action Plan for Jobs is one of the Government&rsquo;s key instruments to support job creation.

This strategy provides a comprehensive framework for delivering SFI&rsquo;s actions to retain and increase the participation of excellent female researchers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) careers.  Since the launch, SFI has moved towards streamlining gender initiatives across all its programmes, with the overarching aim of redressing the gender imbalance amongst SFI award holders. <\/p>  <p>  SFI&rsquo;s Gender Strategy sets out the agency&rsquo;s roadmap to improve the representation and progression of women in all aspects of STEM careers in Ireland:<\/p>  <p>  - Strand 1 of the strategy focuses on gender equality across SFI education and public engagement initiatives, with the aim of increasing the participation and interest of girls in STEM-related activities.<\/p>  <p>  - Strand 2 targets female representation within the SFI funded portfolio and SFI review panels. Concrete measures to achieve these targets are outlined.<\/p>  <p>  - Strand 3 will ensure that gender perspectives are integrated into the research content of SFI funded research programmes. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, SFI achieved its Agenda 2020 target of making 25% of its awards to female researchers and this target has now been revised upward to 30%.  This target has been aided by SFI providing incentives for research bodies to submit applications from female researchers to various programmes, with a focus on those aligned with early career stage. <\/p>  <p>  The SFI Research Outputs Census 2017 shows that the percentage of female SFI Award Holders Active in 2017 was 28%, up on 25% in 2016 and 21% in 2015.  The percentage of female team members (those employed on SFI awards) was 37%, an increase on 35% in 2016, which represents progress towards redressing gender imbalance. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, award holders&rsquo; success rates (2016) shows that female researchers are as competitive as their male counterparts in terms of their SFI funding success rate i.e., 32% across all programmes.  However, female researchers within the same cohort (2016) accounted for only 25% of SFI funding applications received. <\/p>  <p>  SFI is also supportive of the Athena SWAN Charter which is the internationally recognised &lsquo;quality mark&rsquo; for gender equality.  It was established to encourage and recognise commitment to advancing the careers of women in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine.  <\/p>  <p>  Science Foundation Ireland continues to implement specific grant management policies to deal with the needs of female researchers during periods of maternity and adoptive leave, and will continue to innovate in this regard. The policies being developed and associated outcomes will complement and support the Athena SWAN initiative, whereby the Irish Research Council, Science Foundation Ireland and the Health Research Board will require research bodies to have attained a bronze institutional Athena SWAN award by the end of 2019 and a silver institutional Athena SWAN by the end of 2023, to be eligible for research funding.  <\/p>  <p>  Another aspect of Science Foundation Ireland&rsquo;s Gender Strategy is to ensure that gender is integrated as a perspective in all the research Science Foundation Ireland funds, when this is relevant. While this approach was launched for some programmes during 2017, applicants will in future be required to provide a statement articulating the sex\/gender variables in their research and will include guidance for applicants and a request for comment from the reviewers. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, further rollout of gender redressing initiatives amongst SFI award holders will include those to address gender imbalance in senior academic roles.  Specifically, in order to encourage more applications from excellent female researchers to the SFI Research Professorship Programme, SFI is mandating that for all institutions wishing to nominate candidates to the programme, one of the next two successful Expressions of Interest (i.e. approved by SFI) must be associated with a female candidate, which must then be followed up with the submission of a Full Proposal.<\/p>  <p>  The above detail shows that SFI is proactive in bringing about a sea change on gender equality matters in the field of research and development and I am confident that the initiatives employed by SFI to date will continue to bring further successes in the future.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400049#WRB03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Retail Sector","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400049#WRB03100"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[22624\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400049#WRB03200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she has had discussions with the Minister for Finance and-or on a European level on fair taxation of imported goods that are being purchased over the Internet by consumers in direct competition with retailers operating in cities and towns here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":78,"content":"<p>With the increase in digitisation and internet developments, consumers are enabled to make purchases of goods from across the world that can be delivered to their doorstep.

This is being driven by factors such as market demand, technology shifts, the impact of cloud computing, and digital transformation of the economy. <\/p>  <p>  A large number of investments by IDA Ireland client companies into the country require technically proficient staff.  For example, new projects announced in 2018 &ndash; such as Jaguar Land Rover&rsquo;s planned software engineering centre in Shannon or MSD&rsquo;s planned new biotechnology facility in Dublin &ndash; will need highly skilled employees. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland supported a total of 181 start ups in 2017 (90 of which are classified as High Potential Start Ups).

Other relevant factors taken into account include whether the Garda&iacute; were acting on foot of a search warrant or whether they had other lawful authority to carry out a forced entry to a premises.

The recommendations which were incorporated were that prisoners should have the terms and conditions of their temporary release explained to them, that the prisoner must acknowledge the conditions of the temporary release and sign the Temporary Release form, the prisoner must consent to being granted a period of temporary release and that a written record of the decision must be placed on the Prisoner Information and Management System.<\/p>  <p>  I am also advised that the total costs associated with the commission of the investigation report was &euro;32,140.60 and &euro;900 for the review.

The Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI, who are responsible for operational policing cooperation, have repeatedly emphasised the scope and the value of the close and high quality cooperation between the two police services in combating crime, protecting community safety and saving lives. The two police services operate a joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island. <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including 53 to the Cavan\/Monaghan Division, 13 of whom were allocated from the most recent attestation of new Garda&iacute; in March. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.<\/p>  <p>   This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its legacy is still having an impact. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Cavan\/Monaghan Division.<\/p>  <p>  The investment in personnel I have outlined is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 provides for an investment of &euro;46 million the Garda fleet to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit for purpose fleet. This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013 to 2015. <\/p>  <p>  In the period 2013 to end of 2017 almost &euro;44 million will have been invested in the fleet with some 2,000 vehicles coming on stream in that period.<\/p>  <p>  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the Cavan\/Monaghan, like all other Garda Divisions will benefit from these new resources becoming available. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400052#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sex Offenders Notification Requirements","counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400052#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":210,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[23036\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400052#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to amend the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to ensure that victims are informed when a sex offender is appealing to be removed from the sex offenders register; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":211,"content":"<p>There have been a number of developments over recent years which allow for information to be passed to victims of crime by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Victims\u00a0Services Offices, in particular the coming into force of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017.

One of the actions being taken forward in 2018 under &quot;Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - A health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017 - 2025&quot;, relates to strengthening the effectiveness of the Reporting Programme. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the NFSN will each carry out their own evaluation of the Reporting Programme with a view to informing its further development.<\/p><p>There is growing evidence, both internationally and in Ireland, that partnership approaches involving local communities, state agencies and other stakeholders offer the mosteffective method of responding to many drug problems, including illicit drug markets. Any proposals for more innovative approaches to the problem, whether adopted from international experience or building on the current approach under Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, and which offer further value in tackling the problem as it occurs in this jurisdiction will be given due consideration. <\/p><p>Under the Reporting Programme, a Garda Inspector has been selected in every Garda Division to respond to the issue of drug related intimidation.  These Inspectors are at management level within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and liaise directly with their local Superintendent in relation to each individual case.  Persons seeking the assistance of the Inspector in their area may contact them to arrange to meet either formally or informally.  It is also possible for a person to ask a local family support worker or drugs worker to contact the Garda Inspector for their area or to ask the National Family Support Network to contact the relevant Inspector. The contact details for the nominated Garda Inspectors are available on the Garda website.<\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently delivering seminars and briefings to local Garda management on the Reporting Programme and gathering feedback as to its performance.<\/p><p>In dealing with any reports of drug related intimidation, or advice sought in relation to this issue, I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do so with the utmost regard to the safety of the person making a report and the most effective means available to afford persons subject to a threat, the best level of security, advice and support that can be offered.  Most importantly, all reports are handled with the utmost regard to confidentiality. <\/p><p>At the heart of the concerns expressed by the Deputy, is the relationship between communities and their local Garda&iacute;. It is worth recalling that the Programme for a Partnership Government underlines the importance of community policing in responding to the concerns and expectations of both urban and rural communities. I would like to re-affirm that the Government remains committed to supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make communities safer.  The Government has allocated very significant resources to policing in recent years, and this will continue, in particular through the accelerated programme of Garda recruitment. This undoubtedly will enhance policing services for all communities across the country. <\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is involved in a variety of activities, including Local and Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces, Garda Youth Diversion Projects which support the operation of the statutory Diversion Programme, the Garda Schools Programme and proactive operations designed to address drug supply in communities.  I would also like to emphasise in particular, that where communities experience intimidation, Joint Policing Committees have a very important role in facilitating consultation, cooperation and synergy on policing and crime issues between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Local Authorities and elected local representatives.  Active engagement by elected members is very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400052#WRE03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":240,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400052#WRE03600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400052#WRE03500"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[21667\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400052#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she is satisfied that all contracts a company (details supplied) holds with her Department and State agencies under her aegis have been tendered for; if her attention has been drawn to contracts awarded to the company that have not been tendered for; if her attention has been further drawn to contracts awarded to the company that have rolled over; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>My Department, and the agencies under its\u00a0aegis, comply with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's guidelines for awarding public procurement contracts.\u00a0Contracts are awarded based on the most economically advantageous tender (specifying, in addition to price, various other criteria including running costs, servicing costs, level of after sales service, and technical merit).<\/p>  <p>  My Department does not have any contracts currently in place with Capita.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that the agencies under the aegis of my Department have a number of contracts in place with Capita, all of which were awarded following tendering processes and in compliance with public procurement guidelines.<\/p>  <p> - The Personal Injuries Assessment Board signed a contract in 2014 for business process support services with Southwestern Business Process Services Limited (subsequently acquired by Capita) for an initial period of\u00a0three years, with the contract providing an option to extend by two periods of 12 months.

gap or need in the market by developing innovations that will ideally be ready for licensing to Irish industry, or may form the basis of a new start-within 5 years.\u00a0 Licenses developed may be accessed by companies in order to develop products, processes and services, in order to bring them to a point where they are ready for new domestic and international markets.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Commercial Case Feasibility Support is a funding support which can be obtained by researchers, in partnership with their Technology Transfer or equivalent office, for a short Feasibility Project (up

This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth.<\/p>  <p>  Through the Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, &lsquo;Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World&rsquo;, we aim by 2020 to increase indigenous exports by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, including food, to reach &euro;26 billion and secure 900 new foreign direct investments.  Specifically, in relation to Brexit, there is a clear priority to intensify and diversify the export base with a target of 80% of indigenous export growth to 2020 to be outside of the UK market and maintain exports of at least &euro;7.5 billion to the UK. More recently, Government&rsquo;s Enterprise 2025 Renewed strategy published in March 2018 sets out targets for export growth and diversification within the indigenous exporting base, with ambitions to increase exports as a percentage of total sales of Irish owned companies from 52 percent to between 55 and 60 percent by 2020 and increase Enterprise Ireland client exports beyond UK markets from &euro;14.1 billion to &euro;17.4 billion by 2020. The strategy also targets a 50 percent increase in the number of FDI investments from non-US markets by 2020.   <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, Enterprise Ireland launched its Eurozone Strategy as a key element of its supports to help companies diversify their export markets. In particular, it aims to increase exports to the Eurozone by &euro;2bn per annum by 2020, equivalent to 50 percent increase. This would represent one of the most significant shifts in Enterprise Ireland supported client exports into the Eurozone and is particularly important in the context of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification.  Enterprise Ireland delivered an impressive programme of international trade events in 2017, giving Irish companies the opportunity to meet with potential buyers and network with key influencers in countries around the world.  In total, 57 internationally focused trade events were organised by Enterprise Ireland in 2017 including ministerial-led trade missions to Canada, Singapore, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and a major trade programme as part of the State visit to Australia and New Zealand.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to 2018, the programme of ministerial-led trade missions and events has been finalised and published by Enterprise Ireland, with 70 Ministerial-led trade visits planned to 33 different markets.  Several events have already taken place, including ministerial-led missions to the USA in January, and Mexico and Russia in February.  Missions to EU markets will be a priority focus for the 2018 programme, together with missions to key markets where the EU has or is negotiating free trade agreements.  As part of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day &ldquo;Promote Ireland&rdquo; Programmes, Ministerial visits around the world were organised to ensure that we use this exposure to maximise the promotion of Ireland's trade, tourism and investment interests. The Government has signalled its ambition to further enhance its overseas networks through the Global Footprint 2025 initiative, which aims to double the impact of our overseas presence through an increase in our enterprise agency global footprint and Embassy network. <\/p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors.  The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more.  These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.  In this regard Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  Most recently, the EU&ndash;Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) entered into force provisionally from the 21st September 2017.  Irish companies may now take advantage of the all-important provisions of CETA including the elimination of tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, the easing of regulatory barriers and more transparent rules for market access.  CETA presents new opportunities for Irish business and professionals to work and provide services in Canada.<\/p>  <p>  On the 21st April 2018, the EU and Mexico reached an agreement in principle on a new trade agreement that will be part of the broader Global Agreement.  The Agreement will provide a platform to increase Irish exports to Mexico, the current total value is just over &euro;2 billion per year with total imports of nearly half a billion euros per year.  It will further remove industrial tariffs and important agricultural tariffs.  This will be significant for Ireland&rsquo;s important Agri-food sector especially for dairy, pork and poultry products.  Ireland is a significant exporter to Mexico of powdered milk and milk derivatives but there are currently significant barriers both to increasing powdered milk exports and to commencing exports of fresh dairy produce.  There are many exciting opportunities in Mexico for Irish businesses including manufacturing, automotive, engineering, telecommunications, ICT, aerospace, software and service and manufacturing technology.  The Agreement will also open up public procurement markets to Irish businesses and remove technical barriers to trade which will reduce the costs of entry to the Mexican market.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is continuing its negotiations with Mercosur and recently announced the successful conclusion of negotiations of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement.  The agri-food sector, in particular will see benefits from access to Japan&rsquo;s highly valuable export market, with improved access for beef, pork, cheese and processed agricultural products.  In addition the EU&rsquo;s trade deal with Singapore is hoped to come into force by the end of the year.  <\/p>  <p>  During his September 2017 State of the Union address, the President of the European Parliament, Jean-Claude Juncker, proposed opening trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand.  This month, the Trade Council of Ministers adopted a decision authorising the opening of negotiations on free trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand, as well as adoption of the respective negotiating directives for the Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new FTA&rsquo;s giving Irish firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries.  My Department has recently commissioned a study to examine the economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland arising from FTAs, both currently in place and in negotiation. The objective is to deepen our understanding of how Ireland can best take advantage of these opportunities, and ensure that our businesses are prepared to access new markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400053#WRF02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services Provision","counter":284,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400053#WRF02100"},{"type":"question","counter":285,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[23074\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400053#WRF02200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of new enterprises seeking and obtaining the support of her Department both in the manufacturing and services sectors; the extent to which she expects these contacts to mature into the creation of new jobs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":286,"content":"<p>My Department, through its enterprise agencies is committed to supporting companies in urban and rural areas to start, innovate and remain competitive in international markets, now and into the future. \u00a0Reflecting the strength of the Irish economy and of global markets in 2017, Enterprise Ireland client companies reported strong employment performance.

Major flagship awareness events were held last year in both Belfast and Dublin, attracting several hundred companies each. In addition, an extensive series of information events have been held in smaller centres on both sides of the border. Such events have been organised by ITI in Lisburn.

The first phase of this research was aimed at improving our understanding of the impact of different trade and tariff regimes which might be imposed following Brexit. The second phase focused on the patterns of cross-border trade on the island of Ireland, and on the role of supply chain links.

Enterprise 2025 Renewed\u00a0reaffirms our policy focus on export-led growth, underpinned by innovation, talent and investments in place-making.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In the face of global challenges, \u00a0Enterprise 2025 Renewed places a greater emphasis on five main areas: <\/p>  <p>  - supporting the development of Irish owned enterprises so that they are a driver of growth over the period to 2025; \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - placing a spotlight on innovation, skills and on leveraging Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in technologies - the fundamentals that underpin competitiveness and enhanced productivity;<\/p>  <p>  - stimulating greater levels of clustering that takes advantage of the distinctive enterprise mix we have here in Ireland including foreign and Irish owned and optimises spillovers; <\/p>  <p>  - developing Ireland&rsquo;s relationships with new like-minded members within the EU, managing our reputation in the US in particular, as well as more widely; and raising Ireland&rsquo;s visibility in overseas markets where we are less well known; and <\/p>  <p>  - realising the potential of all of our regions.<\/p>  <p>  While we cannot predict the impact of Brexit with any certainty, my Department and enterprise development agencies are focused on deepening the resilience of the enterprise base. We are building from a position of strength, notwithstanding the fact that there may be some vulnerabilities in our enterprise base.<\/p>  <p>  I am ensuring that my Department and its agencies continue to work relentlessly with enterprises, to strengthen sectoral and firm level resilience as a sound basis for future growth. Building Stronger Business &ndash; responding to Brexit by competing, innovating and trading, published in November 2017,\u00a0sets out work underway and planned, in response to Brexit, including supports available to companies to help them prepare for Brexit. Furthermore, the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 sets out actions aimed at solidifying progress made since the APJ was originally published in 2012, and at deepening resilience. A key focus in Action Plan for Jobs 2018 is to support businesses in accessing the finance needed to grow their businesses and address the challenges caused by Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  I am confident that we have a strong basis from which to grow. While we cannot influence what happens externally, we can ensure that Ireland's future prospects are strengthened by taking the right actions now across Government to ensure that: \u00a0Ireland remains internationally competitive; that our enterprises deepen resilience through investments in skills and innovation; and that we continue to create an environment that is supportive of business investment and growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400053#WRF03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Competitiveness","counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400053#WRF03900"},{"type":"question","counter":303,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[23081\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400053#WRF04000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which she remains satisfied that adequate incentives, supports, modern technology and innovative services remain available to the indigenous business sector here having regard to increased competition in the market place; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":304,"content":"<p>My Department, through its enterprise agencies is committed to supporting\u00a0business to understand and respond to\u00a0technological change and to incentivising indigenous businesses and entrepreneurs to\u00a0start, innovate and remain competitive in international markets, now and into the future.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus for 2018 is to help clients build on the strength of their 2017 performance by supporting them to innovate, be competitive and to diversify their global footprint - key attributes required to be resilient to economic shocks, such as those emerging from any kind of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  To build resilience, Enterprise Ireland has put an increased emphasis on market diversification, driving innovation and competitiveness.

Our Irish owned enterprises compete on the international stage and face unprecedented challenges as they face the implications of Brexit and need to diversify to other export markets. In this context it is crucially important that we, as a Government, continue to focus on improving Ireland&rsquo;s relative competitiveness and attractiveness as a location in which to do business &ndash; both for foreign and Irish owned enterprises. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has many strengths when it comes to attracting business investment, including our membership of the EU and the fact that we are an English-speaking nation.  For all enterprises, access to a highly skilled workforce, our supportive regulatory environment and an eco-system that stimulates and supports innovation are critical elements of an attractive location; as is access to world class infrastructures and services. Enterprise 2025 Renewed places a strong emphasis on driving export-led growth, underpinned by innovation, talent and placemaking. As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, my objective is to create the best possible environment for enterprise, entrepreneurship, innovation and investment across all regions. <\/p>  <p>  In today&rsquo;s ever changing global environment, we cannot afford to be complacent. We need to anticipate and respond to circumstances that may impact negatively on our competitiveness or on how we may be perceived internationally. In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query, it is important first of all to note that Ireland has a robust set of laws and regulations which govern planning and environmental considerations, encourages consultation and allows for appeal.  A planning system that balances the ambitions of development against the valid interests and concerns of local populations is an appropriate and necessary structure which we should maintain and be confident in. Nevertheless, there is room for improvement in relation to streamlining the planning service - particularly in regard to the speed at which planning decisions are taken.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government is currently considering a package of measures to streamline the judicial review of strategic infrastructure projects in order to provide greater certainty on the timeframe for decisions on planning and other consent processes. The measures will build on the accelerated, one-stage planning process for strategic infrastructure projects which is already operated by An Bord Plean&aacute;la. <\/p>  <p>  Providing certainty to potential investors as to the timeframe within which they can expect a decision should ensure that Ireland's planning system remains a key part of our overall attractiveness as a good place in which to do business.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, Project Ireland 2040 and the development of the associated Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies, should provide a more coherent and joined-up policy context for planning decisions.  This should better facilitate both developers and planning authorities to make consistent and appropriate planning decisions which are aligned with our national and regional policy objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400053#WRF04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400053#WRF04600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Clinical Indemnity Scheme","counter":308,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400053#WRF04500"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[23057\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400053#WRF04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of funds estimated to be required to settle cases (details supplied); if the Health Service Executive is required to make further contributions greater than 1% of costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":310,"content":"<p>The State Claims Agency has a statutory responsibility to manage claims under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme and to ensure that the State&rsquo;s liability and associated legal and other expenses are contained at the lowest achievable level.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There has only been one case settled by the State Claims Agency to date relating to the issue.\u00a0 In that case liability rested with and settlement costs were made by a third party, with a contribution by the State Claims Agency.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The State Claims Agency has advised my Department that given the small number of other cases involved that the Agency is unable to supply the information requested concerning the monetary contributions that may be made to settle these cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400053#WRF04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Reimbursement","counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400053#WRF04800"},{"type":"question","counter":312,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[22893\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400053#WRF04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) has been refused Versatis patches in view of the person's exceptional medical conditions; the eligibility criteria in order to be prescribed same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":313,"content":"<p>Medicines play a vital role in improving the health of Irish patients.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.<\/p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.<\/p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service. In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.<\/p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care. Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient. If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal, making a clear clinical case for the patient, to the MMP. Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at\u00a0www.hse.ie\/yourmedicines.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process is a matter for the HSE and you will appreciate that, as Minister for Health, I cannot intervene in individual cases.

I assured him Ireland fully embraced the ambitions of the new strategy. I asked the Commission to focus, in particular, on the most difficult non-recyclable plastics such as soft wrapping, film and single use items.<\/p><p>In addition, Ireland has supported the adoption of a set of ambitious measures to make EU waste legislation fit for the future, as part of the EU's wider circular economy policy. The new recycling and landfilling targets set a credible and ambitious path for better waste management in Europe. The new EU Circular Economy Legislative Package, which was published this week, () includes\u00a0a new recycling rate of 55% for plastic packaging waste\u00a0by 2035, which will help drive\u00a0real progress towards the circular economy,\u00a0and an ability for Producer Responsibility schemes to modulate costs for individual products or groups of similar products, by taking into account their durability, reparability, re-usability and recyclability and the presence of hazardous substances.<\/p><p>The statistic referred to in the question is based on our national packaging waste return, which we are obliged to provide by 30 June every year to the European Commission. While I am not disputing the figure quoted, I am aware that the manner in which these statistics are reported differs from Member State to Member State. The recent EPA research call includes a study to examine how we compile our packing waste statistics compared to other Member States. The waste characterisation study which is used as part of the return is from 2008. The new waste characterisation study taking place at the moment with funding from my Department will show the current picture of what materials are disposed of in bins in Ireland.\u00a0 This report, when completed, will affect future EU reports around packaging waste returns.<\/p><p>In relation to incentivising packaging producers to reduce the amount of plastic, our national producer responsibility scheme (Repak) is tasked with managing packaging in Ireland.\u00a0 It works with its members (including all the major retailers) to identify ways to reduce or optimise packaging.\u00a0 Repak charges fees to its members in accordance with the amount and type of packaging they place on the Irish market. These fees are used to subsidise the collection and recovery of waste packaging through registered recovery operators across Ireland.<\/p><p>Because Repak members pay fees based on the amount of packaging they place on the market, this incentivises them to reduce packaging where possible and in so doing to reduce their fees. To assist members to optimise their packaging, Repak employ packaging technologists who work with their member companies.

Currently, housing bodies are granted approved status by me as Minister, under Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 for the purpose of being able to receive funding from local authorities, to provide social housing.  An AHB seeking to obtain, and to retain, approved status in its memorandum or articles of association must:<\/p>  <p>  - Have as primary objectives the relief of housing needs, or poverty or hardship or the welfare of travellers, and the provision and management of housing;<\/p>  <p>  - Have provisions prohibiting the distribution of any surplus, profit, bonus or dividend to members and requiring the assets of the body be applied solely towards its objectives;<\/p>  <p>  - Have a winding-up clause which states that, in the event of winding up or dissolution of the company, there remains any property whatsoever, it shall be given or transferred to some other institution having objectives similar to the objectives of the company.<\/p>  <p>  This arrangement has been in place since 1992 and the Government acknowledges that a more modern regulatory system needs to be put in place to oversee a sector which has developed significantly since then. My Department is currently working on new legislation which will establish a Statutory Regulator to oversee, more effectively, the governance, financial management and performance of voluntary and co-operative housing bodies that provide housing in accordance with the Housing Acts.<\/p>  <p>  In the interim, the Government established an Interim Regulation Committee for the AHB sector under the auspices of the Housing Agency, which, supported by a Regulation Office based within the Agency, oversees implementation of a voluntary regulation code (VRC) for AHBs.  Since the Code was put in place, any AHB applying for housing funding from my Department and local authorities must furnish proof of compliance with the Voluntary Code.  Only those AHBs that have undergone a satisfactory assessment as part of the annual assessment process by the Regulation Office are considered eligible for funding local authorities for the provision of social housing.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of schemes under which AHBs can seek to access funding through borrowing from local authorities for the provision of housing. In addition to the oversight regime in relation to the governance and financial stability of the sector, AHBs seeking such funding have to enter into contracts with local authorities under the terms of the various schemes. The contracts provide the terms and conditions under which the AHBs may receive the funding, including provisions in relation to appointing receivers in the event of a default on the loan, so as to ensure the continued use of the relevant property for social housing purposes. If an AHB becomes insolvent and has yet to pay off any capital debts owed to the State, the State retains a substantial interest in the housing assets and the units are not lost from the social housing stock.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400058#WRL04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing","counter":578,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400058#WRL04100"},{"type":"question","counter":579,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[22902\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052400058#WRL04200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the measures in place during the scheme assessment process to ensure that the provision of affordable housing by local authorities or approved housing bodies on council or State owned lands does not unfairly compete on unit sale price with private sector investment in the supply of affordable housing under the local infrastructure housing activation fund schemes throughout the country in a manner that may deter or delay further private sector investment in such; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":580,"content":"<p>The development of residential lands owned by local authorities and the Housing Agency, for social housing and, where appropriate, for mixed-tenure developments, is a major priority under the\u00a0Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.\u00a0To this end, details of some 1,700 hectares of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership were published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map, with the potential to accommodate some 42,500 homes nationally.

Subsequently, Dublin City Council, as the designated development agency, began the process of drawing up a detailed masterplan or planning scheme for the area designated in the Government Order. <\/p>  <p>  A draft of this planning scheme was published for public consultation from late January 2017 to early March 2017. The draft planning scheme was further considered by the Council in May 2017, after which material alterations were published for 4 weeks from mid-June to mid-July 2017 for public consultation. The final SDZ Planning Scheme was approved by Dublin City Council on 2 October 2017, which decision was ultimately appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p>  <p>  My Department issued observations to Dublin City Council on the draft planning scheme in March 2017, which was followed by extensive engagement during April and May 2017 between my Department, Dublin City Council and NAMA and which also included interactions between my predecessor and the Housing Strategic Policy Committee of Dublin City Council, and local community interests. My Department made a further submission in July 2017 which noted the material alteration in relation to mixed tenure.<\/p>  <p>  All of the above interactions were concerned with determining an appropriate voluntary mechanism, whereby the private owners of the lands covered by the SDZ would agree to deliver additional social and affordable housing within the SDZ area, in conjunction with Dublin City Council and relevant housing providers, over and above the 10% statutory requirement under Part V, subject to satisfying value for money, procurement and qualitative criteria.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, my Department had no engagement with the receiver in control of these privately owned lands on or about the May 2017 decision by Dublin City Council to amend the draft planning scheme in respect of these matters.  Notwithstanding the fact that my Department has consistently advised that provision of additional social and affordable housing could be provided in the SDZ area through a consent-based and commercially grounded approach, the ultimate decision of the Council moved towards a mandatory approach, over and above the provisions of Part V.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2017, an appeal was lodged to An Bord Plean&aacute;la by the receiver and other parties.  There was no engagement between my Department and the receiver ahead of this appeal.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, officials from my Department were in contact with representatives of both Dublin City Council and the receiver.
