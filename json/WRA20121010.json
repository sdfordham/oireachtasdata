This plan identified procurement reform as a key instrument that can assist the public service to deliver services in an efficient manner. <\/p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS) has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service&rsquo;s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency; and enhanced service levels. In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements.<\/p><p>  My Department recently issued Circular 06\/12 that implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. The list of categories subject to national procurement arrangements includes: electricity; natural gas; stationery and office supplies; paper; ICT consumables; managed print services; print media advertising; and, motor vehicles. These national arrangements will secure best value for money and facilitate contracting authorities to maintain the delivery of services in the context of tighter budgetary constraints.  <\/p><p>  The Government recently agreed to the establishment of a National Procurement Office under the aegis of my Department. This Office will integrate procurement policy, strategy, training, and operations in one office. The primary objectives of the Office will be to improve public procurement capacity across the public service and to deliver increased value for money.<\/p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation in public procurement as outlined in Circular 10\/10, the National Procurement Service (NPS) recently established a Working Group on Small &amp; Medium Enterprises to respond to public procurement issues arising for SMEs. The Working Group consists of representatives from the NPS, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Small Firms Association.  The Working Group will develop measures to highlight the scope that contracting authorities have under Circular 10\/10 to encourage SME participation in public procurement processes.  The National Procurement Service, as part of its education and development remit, also has an active programme to assist SMEs in how to participate effectively in the public service procurement process.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,000 SMEs nationwide.  The next event in this programme will be a major 'Meet the Buyer' event in Kilkenny in November at which it is anticipated more than 400 SMEs will attend.<\/p><p>   While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements &ndash; for example the supply of energy or gas - it should not be taken that single supplier frameworks are to be accepted as the norm. The greater use where appropriate of multi-supplier frameworks &ndash; for example the supply of managed print services- can address local supplier issues while also ensuring ongoing cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000062#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000062#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[43385\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000062#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number and location of empty buildings owned by the State; the cost to the Exchequer per annum of each of these buildings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[43384\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000062#WRB00700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the cost to the State per annum of unused buildings owned by the State in terms of maintenance, security, insurance and any other relevant costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 30 together. <\/p><p>  The property portfolio of the State covers lands and buildings owned or leased by a wide variety of organisations, including local authorities, organisations such as the Health Services Executive and non-commercial State bodies such as the Industrial Development Authority and SFADCo.

Using best practice in the review and design of performance management systems, the <i>Review of PMDS<\/i>   was a comprehensive evaluation that provided baseline information on how PMDS was working in 2005.  The evaluation comprised feedback from a system-wide PMDS survey and a series of focus groups, interviews and workshops.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Since the Mercer evaluation, my Department reviews PMDS on an ongoing and comprehensive basis using both the survey instrument designed by Mercer and other methods of evaluation. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department ran a survey again in 2010, using the instrument designed by Mercer, across all staff in the Civil Service and the results of this survey - <i>The Evaluation of PMDS Survey 2010<\/i>  - are available on the Department&#8217;s website. <\/p><p><br \/>  Other monitoring carried out by my Department on an ongoing basis includes: <\/p><p><br \/>  - a review of the annual compliance with PMDS and the distribution of performance ratings across the Civil Service &#8211; also available on my Department&#8217;s website; <\/p><p><br \/>  - feedback from the Secretaries General and HR managers on their perceptions of PMDS;<\/p><p><br \/>  - focus groups and workshops on aspects of performance management including the management of underperformance. <\/p><p><br \/>  The analysis of the results from <i>The Evaluation of PMDS<\/i><i>Survey 2010<\/i>   and other reviews carried out by my Department identified that there are serious deficiencies in the approach taken to performance management in the Civil Service.  In general, PMDS is not seen as an effective tool in the management of performance. It is seen as overly bureaucratic, with an emphasis on form-filling, lacking in fairness and consistency, with too many staff getting high ratings. The feedback also highlights that there is a widespread belief across the system that underperformance is not being managed. <\/p><p><br \/>  The operation of the PMDS system has very recently been subject to independent scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the 2010 Report contained a Chapter on Performance Management and Development in the Civil Service.  The C&amp;AG&#8217;s audit highlighted issues such as the consistency and quality of the PMDS assessment process; the extent of timely compliance with PMDS; whether increments are effectively linked to appraisal results and how well the system is contributing to competency development and performance improvement. <\/p><p><br \/>  The conclusions of the C&amp;AG were in line with the findings of my Department&#8217;s analysis of the failings of performance management in the Civil Service.  I have on previous occasions stated that PMDS is not working well but that we are addressing the issues in a structured and coherent way.  My Department has used the findings from <i>The Evaluation of PMDS Survey 2010<\/i>   and the C&amp;AG&#8217;s Report to improve the design and operation of PMDS.  Significant changes to PMDS have now been agreed between management in the Civil Service and the unions under the Croke Park Agreement. <\/p><p><br \/>  In 2011, an initial phase of changes was introduced aimed at improving the operation of PMDS. This involved streamlining the paperwork associated with PMDS primarily to create space for more discussion about performance between staff and managers. Critically we have also increased manager accountability for managing performance by giving a low rating to managers who do not manage the performance of their staff proactively. <\/p><p><br \/>  In July of this year, my Department, alongside management of the Civil Service and unions, agreed further changes to address the more fundamental issues that were identified in both <i>The Evaluation of PMDS<\/i><i>Survey 2010<\/i>   and the C&amp;AG Report in 2010 and, in particular, a perceived lack of fairness and consistency in the application of the system.   These changes are:<\/p><p>- a new grade-based Competency Framework;<\/p><p>- a revised rating scale with improved descriptions of performance levels;<\/p><p>- reviews of performance will be decided by a process of calibration. This process is commonly used in many public and private sector organizations to assist managers in delivering a realistic and consistent approach to the assessment of performance;<\/p><p>- a more comprehensive process of internal review of ratings, with access to external review; <\/p><p>- a rating of &#8216;Fully Achieved Expectations&#8217; will be required for the award of an increment.<\/p><p><br \/>  A key challenge is for senior leadership across the Civil Service to demonstrate their own commitment to delivering a high performance culture and to fully engage line managers in the management and improvement of performance. My Department will continue to review how we mange performance in the Civil Service and on the basis of this we will continue to make changes aimed at improving PMDS as it is the primary tool for managing performance in the Civil Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000062#WRB01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Reform Review","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000062#WRB01250"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[43243\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000062#WRB01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if, as part of a wider programme of public service reform, he will confirm that a detailed and rigorous analysis has been undertaken or is underway to identify redundant processes across the service in terms of achieving both staffing efficiencies and service provision efficiencies; if so, if he will describe the analysis in detail; if he will provide details of the results or expected results; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":25,"content":"<p>The Government is making good progress on achieving all of our targets and priorities, as set out in the Programme for Government.

The purpose of the CRE was to identify: expenditure programme savings; scope for savings arising from efficiency and other reforms; redundant and obsolete processes; proposals for reducing and\/or merging of agencies; and associated reductions in staff numbers.  The detailed reports of each Department as well as the final Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014 have been published, in line with Programme for Government commitments, on my Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p><p>  This fundamental re-assessment of spending priorities forms a key platform for the Government&rsquo;s overall Public Service Reform agenda.<\/p><p>  The Government has set a target of reducing public service staff numbers to 282,500 by end-2014. As of mid 2012, Public Service numbers stood at 292,000, which is 28,000 below the peak numbers level of 320,000 in 2008 and is comparable to the 2005 staffing levels. Service levels have been largely maintained notwithstanding these considerable staff reductions due to increased productivity\/workplace flexibilities. The estimated reduction in the pay bill cost from 2009 to 2015 is &euro;3.8 billion.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to far reaching reform of the Public Service and providing better value for money in service delivery. The Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform Plan, which was published last November, outlines the priority actions and timelines for reform.<\/p><p>  Implementation of this Reform Plan is being co-ordinated and monitored by the Reform and Delivery Office in my Department. Good progress has been made and last month I published a Progress Report setting out the achievements made to date against the major elements of the Public Service Reform Plan. I will be meeting the Public Accounts Committee tomorrow to discuss progress and will also be meeting the Committee of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in the coming weeks in this regard.<\/p><p>  Major initiatives in the Reform Plan that are contributing to the achievement of efficiencies in both staffing and service provision include the increased use of shared services in all sectors which will mean that fewer staff and financial resources are required to perform those business functions as duplication is eliminated. Progress is being made on the consolidation of ICT across the Public Service, including a programme of data centre consolidation as set out in the Cloud Computing Strategy for the Public Service published in July. <\/p><p>  In addition, we are in the process of examining activities which may be suitable for external service delivery, which has the potential to deliver more efficient and flexible services and to lower costs. The reform of the central procurement function, through the establishment of a National Procurement Office to be led by a Chief Procurement Officer, the recruitment process for which is underway, has the potential to yield savings in the range of &euro;249 million to &euro;637 million over a three year period depending on the approach taken.<\/p><p>  Central to the delivery of the objectives of the Reform Plan is a strong focus on implementation and delivery. Government Departments and major Offices have produced Integrated Reform Delivery Plans, which place centrally driven initiatives in the context of organisational and sectoral reforms. Each sector is responsible for the delivery of their Sectoral Plans and progress made on these plans is being overseen by the Reform and Delivery Office, which is also driving an increased capacity and capability for change, both centrally and across the various sectors of the Public Service, to ensure that the focus is firmly on implementation and delivery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000062#WRB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Lottery Licence Sale","counter":27,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000063#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":28,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[43420\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000063#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of initial expressions of interest in the National Lottery licence that have been received; the date on which the contract for advisors is expected to be signed; the prospective date on which the awarding process will be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1096","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":29,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, I announced on 4th April 2012 that the Government has decided to hold a competition for the next National Lottery licence and that the licence will be for a 20 year period.  <\/p><p>  In July, my Department published a Request for Tenders (RFT) for Financial and Commercial Advice to the Department in relation to the next National Lottery Licence.

The general principle that has guided this assessment is whether the individual citizen's interest is served from inclusion of the public body or otherwise.

I provided for an increase in the rate of PSPR that applies to pensions in excess of &euro;100,000 to 20% of the excess amount, effective from 1 January of this year. <\/p><p>  In June 2011 the Government agreed with my proposal to apply a general pay ceiling of &euro;200,000 for future appointments to higher posts across the public service. Revised salary rates in line with that ceiling are now in place for future Secretaries General, who, in addition, can no longer get notional added years or immediate pensions before preserved pension age.  These retrenchments in respect of salary and exit terms will ultimately reduce Exchequer pension costs in respect of senior civil servants. <\/p><p>  Looking further ahead, the recently enacted Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 provides for a new Single Public Service Pension Scheme.  This scheme will apply to all new-joiner public servants and will ultimately deliver significant Exchequer savings through reduced public service pensions.  These long-term savings will derive from key features of the Single Scheme, principally an increase in pension age, inflation linkage of benefits and career-average accrual.  The career-average component of the Single Scheme, in particular, is expected to have a marked impact in moderating the pensions paid to persons retiring from senior civil service posts. <\/p><p>  It is important to point out that legal advice from the Attorney General says that it is possible to apply proportionate reductions to existing pensions, as has been done to date in the FEMPI legislation.

The Reform Programme is being driven by the Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform, and a number of other key groups are in place to support that. Implementation is being coordinated and monitored by the Reform and Delivery Office in my Department. Individual Departments and major Offices have also established Change Delivery Teams, which are working closely with the Reform and Delivery Office on their own reform plans.<\/p><p>  The recent Progress Report on the implementation of the Reform Plan, published last month, highlights the progress that has been made over the last nine months, including in areas such as shared services, eGovernment, procurement reform, external service delivery and the programme of political reform.<\/p><p>  eGovernment 2012-2015, approved by Government and published in early April, sets out a new approach to eGovernment for the Irish Public Service and is based on the recognition in the Programme for Government and the Public Service Reform Plan that Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) are key enablers to delivering improved public services.<\/p><p>  This strategy was developed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in conjunction with the Public Service Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council. The CIO Council is a representative forum for senior managers with responsibility for ICT and\/or eGovernment from across the Civil and Public Service to discuss key issues in these areas, and to provide expert input to decisions and actions to maximise the positive impact of ICT and eGovernment on public service modernisation and customer service.<\/p><p>  Following on from the eGovernment Strategy, the Government published, in July, its Cloud Computing Strategy for the Public Service.

Together with my colleagues in Government, I am committed to the delivery of this significant transformation initiative in a planned way and on the basis of international best practice.

In addition to leading Shared Services efforts across the Civil Service, the Unit is also working with nominated senior officials to ensure that ambitious and robust plans are developed and implemented across all Public Service sectors.<\/p><p>  The business case for a Civil Service HR Shared Service was approved by Government earlier this year.  A new Shared Services Centre, known as PeoplePoint, will be established in Clonskeagh in Dublin. I expect the first transitions to this new centre to commence in March of next year with all in scope bodies being transitioned by the end of 2014. It is estimated that the establishment of this centre will reduce the annual cost of HR services for the Civil Service by 26%, while the number of staff involved in currently delivering these services will reduce by a minimum of 17%. <\/p><p>  The Civil Service Pensions Administration Shared Services has been advanced well beyond our original target of 2014.

All Government Departments and agencies simply have to deliver better value to the public in order to reduce the deficit and protect frontline services.<\/p><p><br \/>  This Government's commitment to reforming our entire public service while protecting front-line services can be exemplified in the publication of the Public Service Reform Plan which highlights a range of specific and time bound commitments which involve a freeing up of administrative resources, and a reprioritisation of resources generally, to ensure that services can continue to be delivered to the public in as cost effective a way as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000066#WRF00262","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Allowances Review","counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000066#WRF00325"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[42657\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000066#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he has attended any meetings with Department Secretaries General in relation to allowances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":109,"content":"<p>I did not attend any meeting with Secretaries General of Departments, other than with the Secretary General of my own Department, in relation to the review of allowances.

The violence is indiscriminate and on an appalling scale; and it is not confined to one side. I also said that what is needed above all to stop the violence is a strong UN Security Council resolution which will authorise targeted sanctions.  This must include a comprehensive arms embargo, in order to halt the flow of arms to all sides in Syria and to compel those responsible for the violence which is violating the human rights of the Syrian people to stop their reprehensible actions.  That is what the Syrian people want from us, and what they have a right to expect. <\/p><p>  There also needs to be accountability for the serious human rights abuses which are being perpetrated in Syria.  To prevent further atrocities and to save lives, we need to demonstrate clearly that these abuses will not go unpunished.  Ireland fully supports, therefore, the calls which have been made for the situation in Syria to be referred by the Security Council to the International Criminal Court. <\/p><p>  UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon has warned about the risks of further militarization of the conflict in Syria, particularly in light of last week&rsquo;s appalling attack on the Turkish border town of Akcakale.  I do not believe that external intervention in any form at the moment will assist those suffering under Assad&rsquo;s oppressive rule or necessarily bring closer that ceasefire and end to the conflict which is so urgently needed.<\/p><p>  Similarly, I continue to have strong doubts and concerns about proposals to establish humanitarian corridors or safe zones within Syria, given the continuing divisions within the Security Council on Syria and the absence of any Security Council resolution authorising action on behalf of the international community.  Such proposals would require the deployment of large-scale resources, including enforcement mechanisms for which there is no consensus at the moment. There is also the risk that ongoing humanitarian operations would be severely compromised by attempts to establish safe zones or humanitarian corridors.<\/p><p>  The priority for now must be to lend strong support to the mediation efforts of the UN\/Arab league Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, in his mission to negotiate a ceasefire and to launch a political process facilitating the transition which is urgently needed in Syria. The international community must also concentrate on mobilising increased resources to deal with the worsening humanitarian situation within Syria and the region; some 1.5 million Syrians are internally displaced and an estimated 300,000 refugees have fled the violence to neighbouring countries. Ireland has already committed some &euro;2.45 million in humanitarian assistance in response to the crisis. <\/p><p>  Increased international pressure also needs to be applied to the Assad regime to end the violence and repression which it is inflicting on the Syrian people.  The EU has been to the forefront in imposing targeted sanctions on the Assad regime and those who provide it with support. I anticipate that a further round of targeted EU sanctions may be agreed at the Foreign Affairs Council which I will attend next week in Luxembourg. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000066#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Costs","counter":113,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000066#WRF00750"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[44067\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000066#WRF00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the expected total legal costs to be incurred in his Department in 2012; his proposals to reduce these costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":115,"content":"<p>It is not possible to predict legal costs with certainty in advance.

However, the budget measure that requires schools to manage the provision of guidance from within their standard staffing allocation must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times. The net impact on overall teacher numbers in our schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible. Teacher allocations to post primary schools for the 2012\/13 school year have effectively been settled at this stage and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. Decisions on how this is done are taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. All 195 second-level school in DEIS, including the school referred to by the Deputy, have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools. My Department also provided some limited short-term support to schools through curricular concessions in order to help them manage within their approved teaching allocation.<\/p><p>  It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students. While the school's guidance planning should involve the guidance counsellor(s) in the first instance, other members of school staff and management also have key roles to play. Parents and students must be seen as an essential part of the process. Through this process schools can, for example, consider the following options for maximising the use of their available resources for the provision of guidance:<\/p><p>  - Optimise the delivery of personal educational, career and vocational guidance in class group settings,<\/p><p>  - Enable students to use directly the extensive range of guidance tools available through the internet from relevant websites (e.g. Qualifax, Careers Portal) <\/p><p>  - Enable some of the curriculum elements of the planned guidance programme to be delivered through other teachers such as SPHE staff,<\/p><p>  - Maximise the role of the pastoral care team in schools, and,<\/p><p>  - Ensure that the guidance counsellor has 1:1 time towards meeting the counselling needs of students experiencing difficulties or crisis.  <\/p><p>  The support of the whole school community, parents and the relevant external agencies such as NEWB and NEPS are key to the provision of guidance and support to schools.  Psychologists from my Department's National Educational Psychological Service ( NEPS ) also provide a range of supports to schools. These include the promotion of positive mental health among the general student body and assistance in supporting pupils with particular social, emotional or behavioural difficulties.<\/p><p>  My Department is also aiming to launch the Guidelines on Mental Health for Post-Primary Schools later this year. These guidelines aim to support schools in developing a whole-school approach to mental health promotion and suicide prevention and are of relevance to all members of the school community. In particular, they have been developed to support principals, guidance counsellors, student support teams, and teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000068#WRH02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Digital Schools Award","counter":189,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000069#WRJ00125"},{"type":"question","counter":190,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[43627\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000069#WRJ00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on the digital school award in primary schools; his plans to enable all schools to achieve this award; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":191,"content":"<p>The Digital Schools Award is a worthwhile initiative which recognises excellence in a school's approach to the integration of ICT in learning and teaching.

A breakdown by primary and post primary spend is not readily available. This allocation covers all aspects of the programme for primary and post primary schools including teacher professional development in ICT, deployment of curriculum-relevant digital content, software and ICT infrastructure deployment in schools and internet access for schools. These components are essential for an integrated approach to ICT in teaching and learning. Continuous professional development in the pedagogical\/curricular use of ICT by teachers is  essential to ensure that ICT is embedded in teaching and the PDST &ndash; which now incorporates the functions of the National Centre for Technology in Education provides a comprehensive training programme for teachers. The percentage breakdown of training places in 2010 and 2011 shows that approximately 73% of the training places were taken up by primary teachers. <\/p><p>  The ICT in Schools Programme, through the PDST delivers a wide range of digital content through the Scoilnet.ie portal. The number of resources available has increased year on year. The PDST pursues collaborative strategies to develop appropriate digital content to match the Irish curriculum.<\/p><p>  I am keen to assess the impact of the funding in primary schools, and in that context it is planned to carry out a comprehensive census of ICT integration in schools before the end of the year.  In order to maximise the technology and digital content available to schools broadband access is key  and under the Schools Broadband Access Programme my Department provides for the supply of internet connectivity for all primary schools that wish to avail of this service. All contracts under the Schools Broadband Access Programme were recently re-tendered. As a result of this the number of service providers has been expanded from 6 to 13 and this should lead to improvements in the quality of services available to schools. These contracts were signed in July and August 2012 and the migration of schools onto the new services is currently underway.<\/p><p>  Following completion of the census referred to above work will commence on a new ICT Strategy which will address the new policy challenges and opportunities arising from major developments in curricular reform, digital publishing, digital content dissemination tools generally, cloud services, portable computing and student devices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000069#WRJ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Croke Park Agreement","counter":195,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000069#WRJ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":196,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[43629\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000069#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide details of changes in work practices negotiated under the terms of the Croke Park Agreement with the schools inspectorate through their union; the date on which such changes were implemented; the savings that resulted from any changes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":197,"content":"<p>In accordance with the Croke Park agreement, inspectors in my Department have implemented a significant programme of reforms to inspection procedures.

This is in keeping with Government&#8217;s overall reform and efficiency agenda.  In light of the need to accelerate the reform agenda, my Department published the Public Service Reform Plan in November 2011. This plan identified procurement reform as a key instrument that can assist the public service to deliver services in an efficient manner.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The reform plan includes specific measures to ensure that:<\/p><p>1. aggregated procurement arrangements are utilised across the public service;<\/p><p>2. public bodies have appropriately trained staff to implement reform and to ensure the State is getting value for money; and<\/p><p>3. greater emphasis will be placed on analysing what the State purchases in order to assess other savings that can be made through more efficient procurement methods.<\/p><p><br \/>  Since its establishment in 2009, the National Procurement Service (NPS) has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service&#8217;s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency; and enhanced service levels. In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements.<\/p><p><br \/>  The NPS has reported estimated procurement savings to the end of 2012 under its frameworks of &#8364;127m, comprising of &#8364;14m in 2010 and a further &#8364;35m in 2011 and projected savings of &#8364;78m for 2012.    In addition the NPS e-Tenders website generates estimated administrative savings of on average &#8364;10m per annum.  A breakdown of these procurement savings is not readily available by sector. The NPS has established a Working Group to develop the saving methodologies and reporting of procurement savings in the future.<\/p><p><br \/>  Circular 06\/12 implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. The list of categories subject to national procurement arrangements includes: electricity; natural gas; stationery and office supplies; paper; ICT consumables; managed print services; print media advertising; and, motor vehicles. These national arrangements will secure best value for money and facilitate contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The purpose of Circular 6\/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, it should not be taken that single supplier frameworks are to be accepted as the norm. The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring ongoing cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is estimated that &#8364;9 billion is spent by public bodies annually on the public procurement of supplies and services. This is a very significant portion of overall spending and it is essential that the Public Service is achieving maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement. It is for this reason that public procurement is one of the major pillars of key strategic importance under the Government&#8217;s Public Service Reform Plan.<\/p><p><br \/>  In order to ensure that the necessary elements are in place to implement these ambitious reforms, my Department engaged Accenture to undertake a capacity and capability review of the central procurement function to identify the actions required to realise substantial savings in public procurement in the short and medium term.  <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Of the estimated &#8364;9 billion annual spend on public procurement of supplies and services, there is a procurement addressable spend of approximately &#8364;7 billion. The review estimates that implementation of its recommendations, over a three-year period, could yield potential annual savings in the range of &#8364;249 million to &#8364;637 million, depending on the approach taken.<\/font>  The final report on this review is available on my Department&#8217;s website.<\/p><p><br \/>  Following the review, proposals were recently submitted to Government. These proposals represent a new consolidated and integrated approach to public procurement that includes:<\/p><p>- integrating procurement policy, strategy and operations in one office through the establishment of a National Procurement Office (under the aegis of my Department) which will be headed by a Chief Procurement Officer, this position was recently advertised;<\/p><p> - strengthening spend analytics and data management;<\/p><p> - examining the specifications set out for goods and services; <\/p><p> - evaluating demand levels to assess how demand (volume) can be reduced; and,<\/p><p>- strengthening vendor and category management. <\/p><p>These proposals have now been agreed by Government.<\/p><p><br \/>  These reforms will lead to reductions in the cost of goods and services; better procurement services at lower cost; introduction of technical standardisation; greater attention to contract management and better problem resolution; greater levels of professionalism among staff responsible for procurement; and better performance management of the central procurement function.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000076#WRQ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":316,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[43576\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000076#WRQ00400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the way that he can stand over a situation whereby &euro;69 million, which was earmarked for job creation here, was not actually spent on job creation.","asker":"1049","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":317,"content":"<p>The Department and its Agencies are extremely diligent and careful in their management and allocation of taxpayer monies in the support of different enterprise objective. The drawdown of exchequer monies through the Enterprise Development Agencies of my Department is based on commitments made in a given year and projected draw-downs against those commitments in the year in question.  It must be remembered that drawdown of exchequer financial support by companies or other bodies (e.g. Competency Centres) is demand-led and can only take place if the company or body in question has progressed a given project in line with the agreement entered into with the State at the time of the financial commitment.<\/p><p>  Due to this demand-led nature of grant payments and issues relating to the timing of expenditure, the bulk of an allocation is often drawn down in the last quarter of the year. It is expected therefore, that the snapshot figure referred to in the Question, will not be reflected in the end of year figure. One example is the new Microfinance Scheme that I launched on 27 September, which is now open for business and will have an associated Exchequer expenditure of &euro;10m before year end. <\/p><p>  In addition, there are other timing issues around finalising legal agreements with the private sector when setting up funds, for example under the Innovation Fund initiative, which means that while drawdown will take place, it may be pushed back by some months, thereby showing up as an &ldquo;underspend&rdquo; in a particular accounting period.<\/p><p>  Despite the very difficult domestic and external economic environment, we are beginning to see the positive impact of the Government&rsquo;s policies.  2011 saw an increase of 6,000 jobs in IDA-supported companies, compared with net losses of 15,000 jobs between 2008 and 2010.  So far this year, the IDA has announced investments with the potential to create more than 6,000 further jobs as these projects come on stream. IDA allocation for Capital Grants for the year 2012 is &euro;85m. The IDA has assured me that they will draw down their entire grant allocation before the end of 2012.<\/p><p>  Jobs in Enterprise Ireland companies started to grow again in 2011, for the first time in three years.  In the first eight months of 2012, a total of 4,669 job commitments over the next three years, linked to Enterprise Ireland approvals to client companies, have been secured. Yesterday, the Kerry Group announced the establishment of an industry-leading Global Technology and Innovation Centre in Ireland. This &euro;100m investment will create 800 jobs over the next four years, as well as 400 jobs in the construction phase, which will be part-funded by my Department through Enterprise Ireland.  Job creation is at the core of this Government&rsquo;s policies and the evidence to date in 2012, despite a challenging external environment, is that it will be a strong year for agency outputs in terms of job creation and exports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000076#WRQ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Costs","counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000076#WRQ00525"},{"type":"question","counter":319,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[44069\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000076#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the expected total legal costs to be incurred in his Department in 2012; his proposals to reduce these costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":320,"content":"<p>I can advise the Deputy that, in so far as it is possible to give an estimate at this point of the amount that will be incurred by my Department and its offices by way of legal costs in 2012, this is likely to be in the region of &euro;1m.  This is based on current knowledge and does not include, for instance, any legal proceedings that might be instigated between now and year end 2012, any awards of costs in any cases arising, the timing of payments or any alteration in fees further to any references and examination by legal cost accountants, etc.  <\/p><p>  I should emphasize also that the estimated costs are inclusive of legal costs incurred by the offices under my Department&rsquo;s aegis, principally the Companies Registration office (CRO), the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE), the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) and the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA),   in the normal conduct of the enforcement, judicial and regulatory functions carried out by those offices.<\/p><p>  In responding to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, a very broad interpretation of the term legal costs has been assumed.  The services that make up the estimated total cost cover a very wide range of legal services including the bill of costs in legal cases taken against the Minister\/Department, legal settlements, the provision of legal advices across a wide range of issues in the Department\/offices,   the servicing of documentation e.g. signing of affidavits, the prosecution of cases including court appearances and representation.<\/p><p>  My Department seeks, where possible, to minimise legal costs and has adopted a number of measures to achieve this.  The Department\/offices avails of the services of the Chief State Solicitors office and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in terms of the provision of legal advice and in terms of representation of the Department\/offices in Court cases.  In the case of the ODCE for instance and in line with overall Government policy,   the ODCE obtained a reduction of 8% in legal fees.  The services of legal cost accountants are availed of where fees demanded appear to be high.  Additionally, my Department has recently completed a tendering process for prosecution and civil debt enforcement services in the case of the pursuance of employment rights cases on behalf of individuals which is expected should reduce further the Department&rsquo;s legal costs in 2013 provided the number of cases to be prosecuted does not increase significantly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000076#WRQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":322,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000076#WRQ00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defined Pension Benefit Scheme Issues","counter":321,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000076#WRQ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[43624\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000076#WRQ00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her views on a matter regarding defined benefit pension schemes (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":323,"content":"<p>I am very aware of the serious funding challenge facing pension schemes. It is acknowledged that the fundamental problem is that pensions are significantly more expensive due to increasing life expectancy and lower than expected investment returns which are reflected in increased annuity rates. <\/p><p>  The Pensions Regulator suspended the Funding Standard four years ago, following the downturn in the financial market, to give trustees\/employers an opportunity to assess the impact on pension funds and to enable them time to develop responses to the challenge. The re-introduction of the Funding Standard was delayed on a number of occasions pending changes to legislation which were designed to help trustees respond to the funding challenges facing pension schemes. Among the measures introduced at that time was provision for Sovereign Annuities. Sovereign Annuity products are now available and it is expected that the range of products will grow over the coming months.<\/p><p>  The Funding Standard provides a benchmark against which the &ldquo;health&rdquo; of a scheme can be tested. The existence of the Funding Standard itself is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded. Rather the responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed. However, the Funding Standard does provide the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a scheme can live up to the &ldquo;promised&rdquo; level of pension benefits.<\/p><p>  The requirement for a risk reserve is also being introduced from 2016, to provide a level of protection for scheme members against future volatility in financial markets. It is accepted that the requirement for a risk reserve presents an added challenge for schemes, however, guidance issued by the regulator identifies options which the scheme can consider in meeting this requirement by 2023. This guidance is being kept under review.<\/p><p>  Reference has been made to the easing of the solvency regime in a number of other countries. It should be noted that the solvency regime even after those changes is still more onerous that the current Irish regime. It should be noted that the changes to the Funding Standard are being implemented over the next 11 years, not immediately. This is the longest recovery period generally allowed in any European country.<\/p><p>  The Pensions Board recently announced that the timeframe for pension schemes to submit funding proposals has been extended to 30 June 2013. This extension will give schemes additional time to help them address the issues they are facing.<\/p><p>  Overall, the changes made to defined benefit schemes are intended to lessen schemes&rsquo; exposure to risks and bring increased stability for pension scheme members so that they receive the pension promises in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000076#WRQ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Eligibility","counter":324,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000076#WRQ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[43531\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000076#WRQ01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a contributory pension will be issued in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":326,"content":"<p>According to the records of the Department, the application was disallowed as the person concerned does not have sufficient paid social insurance contributions.

The figures quoted are estimates based on a variety of assumptions.  A 2009 report by the Irish Wind Energy Association (IWEA) entitled &ldquo;Jobs and Investment in Irish wind energy&rdquo; estimated that the wind energy sector in Ireland can support 1.5 jobs per MW installed.  At the end of 2011, 17.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity was from renewable sources, with approximately 1900MW installed.<\/p><p>  At an EU level, the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) analysis found that there are 15 jobs created per MW - wind turbine and component manufacturing provide the majority of employment opportunities at circa 59% of direct employment.  These elements represent 12.5 of the 15.1 jobs created in the EU for every MW installed.  Ireland&rsquo;s ability to harness a high level of employment from renewable energy projects would depend, to a large extent, on related industry such as turbine and cable manufacturing industry relocating to Ireland.<\/p><p>  The development of renewable energy in Ireland is being pursued in line with our obligations under the Renewable Energy Directive, that 16% of all energy consumed in the State must be from renewable sources by 2020.<\/p><p>  This is a legally binding obligation introduced by the EU to ensure that our climate and energy goals of reducing CO2 emissions and increasing security of energy supply can be achieved by 2020.  In the event that Member States fall short of their national renewable targets, the Directive provides that they will be obliged to purchase renewable energy credits from other Member States that have exceeded their targets, at a price that is not yet known.  <\/p><p>  In the electricity sector, 17.6% of electricity consumed was from renewables in 2011, in the transport sector 3.6% of energy consumed was biofuels and in the heating sector 5% of energy consumed was from renewable sources (mainly biomass and shallow geothermal.)  The total of the renewable energy consumed in 2011 across the three sectors amounted to 6.5% of all energy.  The objective, in order to meet our 2020 binding targets are to increase renewable energy consumption in those sectors to 40% in the electricity sector, 10% in the transport sector and 12% in the heating sector, which together will mean the 16% overall target can be reached.<\/p><p>  Onshore wind rather than offshore wind will be the major mechanism towards the meeting of our 2020 target.  This is because the cost per MW for offshore wind is significantly higher than onshore wind and a higher feed in tariff (REFIT) for offshore wind would have had to be provided, funded through the PSO levy.<\/p><p>  The potential for export of renewable electricity was outlined in the Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012-2020 which I published earlier in the year.  The mechanisms by which renewable energy can be exported or traded with another country are provided for under the Renewable Energy Directive in Articles 6-12 on co-operation mechanisms.  Countries can agree statistical transfer, which involves the purchase of renewable credits by the importing country in order to meet their target or they can agree joint projects which involves identifying specific projects for the purpose of renewable trading and agreeing how the projects will be financed and how the renewable value will be counted towards each country&rsquo;s renewable target under the Directive.<\/p><p>  The use of these co-operation mechanisms under the Directive requires formal agreement between two or more Governments.  I have had a number of bilateral discussions with my UK counterpart in this regard as well as some discussion under the auspices of the British Irish Council.  We are actively exploring the possibility of trade in renewable energy between the two jurisdictions, with a view to reaching an agreement that would provide for that.<\/p><p>  It will be necessary to ensure that Irish consumers do not have to foot the bill for renewable electricity that is exported to the UK and that there are real benefits from renewable trade accruing to the Irish State and Irish consumers.  Renewable developers will only pursue an investment if they can finance the investment and usually this involves a guaranteed minimum price for 15 or 20 years over which time they can repay the loan for the capital outlay.<\/p><p>  In the event that renewable power was being exported to the UK, for example, it would be necessary to ensure that the costs associated with new transmission infrastructure to export the power and the cost of a support scheme for renewable developers is paid for by UK consumers, rather than Irish consumers who would not be benefitting from either the power or the renewable value of the electricity.<\/p><p>  The current market price for electricity in the SEM is approximately &euro;65MWh.  The capital costs of offshore wind are high.  Offshore wind developers would need a significantly higher guaranteed price more than the current market price for electricity in order to finance an offshore wind project and to finance new transmission infrastructure to transport the electricity generated by such a project to the marketplace.<\/p><p>  A loan to finance a project is only helpful insofar as the project has a reasonable prospect of earning sufficient revenue from the project to pay off the loan over time.  The current market prices in Ireland and the UK would be insufficient in the case of an offshore wind project. If the UK or another market wanted to import power from an offshore wind project under the cooperation mechanisms in the Directive, so that they could count some or all of the output towards their target, they would need to be willing to offer a sufficient support price to the project developer over a defined period to make the investment viable.  This is an area that the UK Government is currently examining as part of their market reform.<\/p><p>  If the Irish Government decides to enter an Inter-Governmental agreement under the Directive with the UK or another Government, it will have to ensure sufficient return to the State from such projects.  This might include a share of the renewable value or the imposition of a royalty of some type.<\/p><p>  The Irish State Companies, notably ESB and BGE already have a significant presence in the onshore wind energy sector.  Further investment in wind energy would be a matter for the companies themselves, taking full account of their commercial remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000079#WRT01300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":415,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[43802\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000079#WRT01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on whether the basis for the development of our renewable energy resource has been funded by the Irish State through the Sustainable Energy Ireland, the Department of the Marine, the Marine Institute, the HMRC in UCC and the ESB; his views on whether his Departments present plans for the development of the resources will enable multinational energy corporations including those based in Ireland to extract large profits from the development of this resource with no payback to the Irish taxpayer for their investment in this resource over decades.","asker":"954","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":416,"content":"<p>Energy use comprises electricity, heating and transport.

This consists of existing large hydro plants such as Ardnacrusha, as well as wind and biomass sourced generation.  Six tender competitions were run from the mid 1990s to the mid 2000s through a scheme known as AER (Alternative Energy Requirement) to incentivise renewable generation across different technologies.  This guaranteed the winning tenders 10 or 15 years of support at the winning price.  Under the AER schemes, 532MW of renewable generation was built out. <\/p><p>  In 2006 a new scheme known as REFIT was introduced.  REFIT operates by guaranteeing a minimum floor price for renewable energy generation over a 15 year period.  The original REFIT scheme was to cater for 1450MW of wind sourced generation, small hydro, landfill gas and biomass generated electricity.  Two new REFIT schemes were introduced in 2012 &ndash; one to encourage biomass sourced generation including anaerobic digestion and combined heat and power and one to encourage wind sourced generation, small hydro and landfill gas.  The REFIT and AER schemes are funded through the PSO levy that is funded by all electricity consumers.<\/p><p>  The above is the basis for our renewable energy development to date.  Separate to the above, there has been a certain level of public funding allocated to the wave and tidal energy sector in recent years.  Ocean Energy was recently identified as a priority area in the research prioritisation exercised undertaken by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, given its potential for the development of a future industrial sector here.  The development of ocean energy has been pursued in line with the 2006 Ocean Energy Strategy published by my Department.<\/p><p>  This wave and tidal sector is still at the research and development phase and is not yet commercially viable.  The Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre (HMRC) in Cork has a wave test tank where early stage devices can be tested and has developed a systematic protocol for the scaling up and testing of wave technology. Certain third level institutions are engaged in ocean energy research across the Irish university system. <\/p><p>  SEAI&rsquo;s ocean energy development unit has been engaged in a series of tasks to encourage the ocean energy sector, including through the administration of a prototype development fund of grants whereby up to 50% co-funding for scale testing and other research in the ocean area has been provided to industry.  ESB has been involved in the Westwave project, which has had as a goal to install and operate wave energy converters capable of generating 5MW of clean electricity by 2015. SEAI together with the Marine Institute has been involved in the development of a wave test site in Galway Bay, where quarter scale prototypes can be tested and the Marine Institute, together with IBM has been involved in the SmartBay project, creating ICT links with the development of ocean energy.<\/p><p>The public funding for ocean energy to date has been focussed on research, development and demonstration as technologies in this area are not commercially viable.  The public funding in this area is in anticipation of potential for a future ocean energy industrial sector and the maximisation of benefits to the Irish State and citizens in that regard in the event that the sector becomes commercially viable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000079#WRT01500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Conservation","counter":417,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000079#WRT01550"},{"type":"question","counter":418,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[43804\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000079#WRT01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will report on the progress of the better energy national upgrade programme in improving the energy efficiency of housing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":419,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[43805\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000079#WRT01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans for a retrofit programme to be targeted at public buildings here which would not only reduce energy costs and increase efficiency but would also provide employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":420,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 159 together.<\/p><p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers the Better Energy Programme, which includes Better Energy Homes, Warmer Homes and Workplaces.<\/p><p>  Exchequer funding of &euro;76.146 million has been allocated to the Better Energy Programme in 2012, which is projected to deliver 567GWh in energy savings this year, equivalent to energy spend of &euro;34 million.<\/p><p>  Better Energy Homes provides financial assistance to householders who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.

The scheme is managed by the SEAI and delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.  Since the commencement of the Programme in 2000 energy efficiency upgrades have been delivered to 86,302 homes amounting to &euro;87 million in Exchequer funding.<\/p><p>  Better Energy Workplaces evaluates new approaches for implementing sustainable energy upgrades to existing facilities in the public, commercial, industrial and community sectors.  By accelerating the scale and depth of retrofit across these sectors the programme aims to create energy efficiency exemplar projects. The scheme disbursed &euro;11 million in grants in 2011, co-financed 85 projects and supported 250 jobs.  This year the Better Energy Workplaces Fund has offered support to 145 projects &ndash; 44 of which are in the public sector.  This scheme has developed public sector and market competence and capacity for pay-as-you-save type models.<\/p><p>  My Department and the SEAI have also established a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system whereby all energy usage in the Public Sector will be accounted for and progress will be systematically recorded. Last month I wrote to the head of each of the public bodies, reminding them of their obligation to report annually their energy usage to SEAI. Enclosed with each letter was the SEAI report: &lsquo;Energy Use in the Public Sector&rsquo;, which outlines savings achieved to date across the public sector to end-2010 amount to 650 GWh.<\/p><p>  The public sector is estimated to spend more than &euro;500 million per annum on energy. Achieving our 33% savings target for the public sector would save &euro;150 million each year in expenditure.  This Government remains firmly committed to meeting this target. This year SEAI has targeted the top 135 public bodies, which account for over 95% of public sector energy consumption.  These organisations will submit detailed energy and activity data to SEAI.  From this data detailed progress scorecards will be produced for each organisation.  From 2013 on, an SEAI online energy data system will facilitate all public bodies and schools to report detailed energy data and allow SEAI to prepare detailed scorecards for all public bodies.<\/p><p>  Finally, the recently adopted Energy Efficiency Directive will translate elements of the European Efficiency Plan into binding measures on Member States, including an annual rate of renovation for central Government buildings of 3%; an inventory of central Government buildings with a total useful floor area over certain thresholds; and an obligation on public bodies to procure products, services and buildings with high energy efficient performance.  The 3% renovation target for central Government buildings represents a challenge for the Office of Public Works (OPW), however the energy savings will greatly outweigh the costs of renovation.  We will work closely with the OPW over the coming months to prepare a plan for the realisation of this target.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000079#WRT01800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Costs","counter":422,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000080#WRU00150"},{"type":"question","counter":423,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[44062\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000080#WRU00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the expected total legal costs to be incurred in his Department in 2012; his proposals to reduce these costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":424,"content":"<p>Provision of approximately &euro;200,000 is made in the administrative budget of my Department to cover legal costs in 2012.

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge . The household charge applies to residential property generally, including those properties that are liable to the &euro;200 charge on non-principal private residences.<\/p><p>  The payment date for payment of the household charge was 31 March 2012. The penalties for late payment are proportionate to the level of the household charge and are similar to the provisions that apply under Revenue legislation in respect of the late filing and payment of certain taxes. Failure to pay by the due date results in late payment interest and late payment fees.<\/p><p>  The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, introduced a charge on non-principal private residences.

However, the charge has been in place since 2009 and therefore substantial payment and late payment fees may be owed from previous years. Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect non-principal private residence charges and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority. <\/p><p>  It should be noted that failure to declare a liability in respect of, or to fail to pay, the household charge and\/or the charge on non-principal private residences, are offences.\u00a0I would urge all liable parties who have not paid the household change and\/or the charge on non-principal private residences   to contact their local authority as a matter of urgency.

It is not possible to predict the expected total outlay for the remainder of 2012 as legal costs have still to be decided by the courts or submitted for payment. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, a drive to reduce expenditure and increase efficiency across all government Departments is being led by my colleague Minister Brendan Howlin in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Government has decided to undertake a comprehensive review of the level of public spending on legal services, and the manner in which public bodies procure those services. This review covers both direct employment of solicitors, engaging solicitors or barristers for particular cases and other related items of expenditure that arise from time to time.  The review is currently underway and is being led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  <\/p><p>  The Legal Services Regulation Bill currently before the Oireachtas, makes provision, mainly in Part 9, for a new legal costs regime which will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged with greater balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those clients who avail of their services - including Government departments. The Bill also sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles. These are contained in Schedule 1 and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account if disputed costs are submitted for adjudication. For the first time, these cost transparency measures will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors. <\/p><p>  Under the Bill it will no longer be permissible to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business. It will no longer be permissible to charge Junior Counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees. Legal practitioners will now be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. This will be in the form of a Notice which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions. Among other things, it must disclose the costs involved, or, where this is not practicable, the basis upon which costs are to be calculated with a cooling-off period for consideration by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs the client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question.<\/p><p>  The Bill also provides that a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will deal with disputes about legal costs &ndash; at present these are dealt with by the Office of the Taxing-Master. The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated.  The Office will be empowered to prepare Legal Costs Guidelines for the guidance of Legal Costs Adjudicators, legal practitioners and the public and these will be published. It will establish and maintain a Register of Determinations which will include the outcomes and reasons for its determinations about disputed legal costs and these will be made public.<\/p><p>  I am confident that both the outcome of the comprehensive review of the level of public spending on legal service, currently underway in the Department of Expenditure and Reform, and the relevant provisions contained in the Legal Services Regulation Bill, will establish the general framework wherein legal services can be procured by the State at best value as well as the transparency required to facilitate the ongoing management and control of legal costs by my Department and, indeed, the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000083#WRX01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":511,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000083#WRX01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Operations","counter":510,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000083#WRX01125"},{"type":"question","counter":511,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[43519\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000083#WRX01200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the number of sniffer dogs the army has at their disposal.; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":512,"content":"<p>I am informed by the military authorities that  the Defence Forces do not have any sniffer dogs at their disposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000083#WRX01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel","counter":513,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000083#WRX01350"},{"type":"question","counter":514,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[43549\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000083#WRX01400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"his views on the fact that the PDFORRE, the representative association for soldiers, sailors, and aircrew, has recently outlined their opposition to further cuts to their members in view of the fact that their pay has already been reduced by 20 percent due to cuts in the past couple of years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":515,"content":"<p>Robust systems are in place within the Defence Organisation to ensure that issues of concern to members of the Defence Forces, including PDFORRA members, are brought to my attention, as appropriate.

I am conscious that farmers need money in their hands because of the poor summer and because of cash flow problems some of them are experiencing at the moment.  I am responding to these pressures within the funds available to me.  I recently announced the reopening of the Agri-Environment Options Scheme, AEOS, to new entrants.  I am providing &euro;20 million for AEOS, which will open shortly for applications.  The scheme will build on the success of the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and both AEOS 1 and 2 in delivering an annual income to farmers in return for farming to high environmental standards.  A maximum payment of &euro;4,000 per annum will apply to individual applicants under the reopened scheme.  As the average payment in the past has been lower than the maximum payment, I am confident that up to 6,000 new participants can be accepted into the scheme.  I have received EU approval for the advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment.  This will enable payment to issue immediately following 15 October and will represent the early payment of some &euro;600 million to farmers.<\/p><p>  I fully appreciate the value and importance of the other scheme payments to farmers.  I remain committed to ensuring the maximum numbers are paid at the earliest possible date, mindful of the overriding necessity to ensure compliance with the governing EU requirements.  Payments worth &euro;161 million under the Disadvantaged Area Scheme began on 26 September last.  This funding will provide a boost to the rural economy and will benefit all areas of the country.  It is too early to estimate at this stage the level of total payments which will be made under this scheme in 2012 because an issue relating to qualification criteria is working through the system.  REPS payments are up to date.  A total of &euro;64 million has been paid out to date.  I envisage that a further &euro;121 million will be spent by the end of 2012.  AEOS payments are well advanced and continue to issue as quickly as possible.  Some &euro;23 million has been paid to date.  I expect that a further &euro;34 million will be paid out before the end of 2012.  My intention is to ensure that payments in respect of 2012 are made on the earliest possible date.  Teagasc has been very active in providing advice and assistance for farmers affected by the bad weather.  All Teagasc offices are taking calls from concerned farmers.  A series of public meetings were held across the country in September to address fodder, financial and social aspects of weather crisis.  Weather clinics were also held in all Teagasc offices.  Newsletters and media articles were prepared to outline the options open to farmers who are facing difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000085#WRZ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":543,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[43657\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000085#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when disadvantaged payments and first instalment of single payment will be made to a person (details supplied) in County Cork","asker":"988","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":544,"content":"<p>An application under the 2012 Single Payment Scheme\/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 11 May 2012, processing of which is now complete.

The land must be suitable for and compatible with the farming enterprise;<\/p><p>-\tThere must be independent and suitable access for animals and\/or machinery.  Independent access means access by public or private roadway or by a defined right of way.  Access over adjoining landowners land, or over land which is subject to a lease or rental agreement to another person, is not acceptable;<\/p><p>-\tThere must be appropriate fencing for the farming enterprise.  Appropriate fencing means stockproof fencing that will control the applicant&rsquo;s animals and also the neighbouring farmer&rsquo;s animals. In mountain\/hill areas this generally means sheep fencing;<\/p><p>-\tThere must be defined external boundaries except in the case of commonage;<\/p><p>-\tIf at inspection the applicant claims to be farming the land with animals then the type of animals must be appropriate to the land and there must be appropriate handling facilities available to meet the animals&rsquo; welfare requirements.<\/p><p>-\tThe releasing of animals onto a parcel without conducting the normal husbandry and welfare practices throughout the year does not satisfy the requirement of an agricultural activity  and will be deemed to be in breach of Article 30 of Council Regulation 73\/2009<\/p><p>-\tThere must be evidence of an agricultural activity being conducted throughout the parcel, otherwise the unused part of the parcel may be found to be ineligible. This can arise where the stocking rate is too low.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000087#WRBB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Costs","counter":580,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000087#WRBB00350"},{"type":"question","counter":581,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[44059\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000087#WRBB00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the expected total legal costs to be incurred in his Department in 2012; his proposals to reduce these costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":582,"content":"<p>The provision in the Department&rsquo;s Vote for legal costs in 2012 is &euro;3.536 million.

This in turn reduces the number of bed days needed. This year, general AvLOS has been reduced from 7.2 days to the HSE Target Plan of 5.8 days. In particular, implementation of the HSE&rsquo;s Acute Medicine Clinical Care Programme has saved 121,000 bed days to date in 2012.   The HSE transitional care initiative is also instrumental in shortening unduly lengthy and inappropriate stays in acute beds for patients, by putting in place 190 transitional care beds and 150 rehabilitation beds this year to which patients can move when appropriate. In terms of surgery, the realignment of services away from in-patient and towards day-case services is in line with international best practice:  2012 has, for the first time, seen agreed targets with all specialties in relation to AvLOS and day case rates for surgical care.  The continued implementation of these Programmes and Initiatives is improving access to services, quality of care and the cost-effectiveness of the service provision.  <\/p><p>  The funding pressures now being experienced in the health services mean that the acute sector must reduce its costs in order to deliver the agreed level of activity within the resources available to it. This means that we must concentrate on maximising efficiency and getting the best possible services for patients from the budgets available to us. However, this on its own is not sufficient. Activity levels in our acute hospitals have been running ahead of the levels set in the approved HSE Service Plan and therefore it is inevitable that activity levels must also be reduced. This will be a significant challenge, and in meeting it we must be flexible and responsive to service needs, in order to ensure that essential services are protected and that patient safety and quality remain paramount. <\/p><p>  During 2012, as part of its performance improvement role, the SDU committed limited funds for short periods of time to facilitate the reduction of numbers waiting on trolleys in Emergency Departments, where these numbers were determined to be exceptionally high. Some of the  funding provided was directed towards measures for patients whose length of stay had been prolonged due to lack of immediately available assistance and\/or accommodation in order to facilitate an appropriate discharge.  The types of measures utilised include temporary funding of nursing home beds, purchase of temporary home care or assisted discharge packages, increased access to diagnostic facilities and additional staffing for weekend and holiday periods.  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE to ensure that the contingency plans are operating satisfactorily and that all critical front line services continue to be delivered across all regions.  This includes using the provision of the Public Service Agreement to bring about greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters, and maximising redeployment to achieve more efficient delivery of services.  Staff resources will continue to be allocated to areas of greatest priority.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000088#WRCC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Sick Leave","counter":633,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000089#WRDD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":634,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[43530\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101000089#WRDD00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the actions that are being taken in areas in the health service that have higher than normal sick leave; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":635,"content":"<p>The health sector, as with other public service employers, has sick leave schemes for staff when they are absent from work through illness.<\/p><p>  The HSE has strengthened its policies and procedures on attendance management in light of the 3.5% target in its 2012 National Service Plan, including:<\/p><p>- Action plans for all sites for the management of absence over 3.5%<\/p><p>- Analysis of certified and uncertified absence on each hospital site and community care area<\/p><p>- Monitoring adherence to Attendance Management Policies such as return to work interviews, counselling, referral to Occupational Health<\/p><p>- Use of disciplinary processes where appropriate<\/p><p>A greater focus has been placed on early intervention and attendance management training is being provided to line managers.
