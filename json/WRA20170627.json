The Government has responded to all of the Convention's Reports.  One of the Convention's recommendations, of particular importance, is in relation to amending the Constitution to give citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in Presidential elections.  In March of this year, Government approved, in principle, to the holding of this referendum and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is working on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Programme for a Partnership Government committed the Government to establish a Citizens' Assembly with a mandate to look at a limited number of key issues, including the Eighth Amendment.  In July 2016 the Houses of the Oireachtas approved establishment of the Assembly.  The Assembly is chaired by a former Supreme Court Judge, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy.  It operates independently of the Government and it will report direct to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Assembly has concluded its deliberations on its first topic, the Eighth Amendment.  The Assembly must now draft its report on the topic.  Ms Justice Laffoy has indicated that she intends to have this completed by the end of this month.  The Oireachtas will then refer it to the recently established Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment which in turn will bring its conclusions to the Houses for debate.  As I have already indicated, it is my intention to hold a referendum on this matter in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government also says that on foot of the recommendation of the Banking Inquiry, the Government will seek a review of the powers of Oireachtas Committees in conducting inquiries and, based on this review, will consider whether there should be a Constitutional referendum to strengthen Committees' powers.<\/p>  <p>  Aside from a referendum on the Eighth Amendment taking place next year, no decision has been made as yet as regards timings for any other planned referenda.  Before any referendum would be scheduled, I would of course bring a proposal to Government and hold discussions with Opposition Leaders. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700065#WRA04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":43,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 47 to 49, inclusive, resubmitted.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committees","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700065#WRA04300"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[28862\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700065#WRA04400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will consider establishing a Cabinet committee on education.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[29058\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700065#WRA04500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the Cabinet Committee which has responsibility for education.","asker":"1330","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 51 together.<\/p><p>The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform provides the basis for cross-Departmental co-ordination in delivery of Programme for Government commitments in areas of social policy and social inclusion, including commitments in the area of education. <\/p><p>As I have stated previously in the House, my intention is to reconfigure the Cabinet sub-committees with the aim of making them more focused.

This vision is further reinforced by the Programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  In March, I published a draft of Ireland's first National Mitigation Plan for public consultation and I intend to shortly publish the final version of the Plan.  The National Mitigation Plan will set out what Ireland is doing, and plans to do, to further our transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy, by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  While Government policy is to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on fossil fuels, it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will have a role in the energy transition.<\/p>  <p>  This is reflected in the draft National Mitigation Plan which notes the role of peat in power generation.  While it is recognised that Ireland&rsquo;s limited biomass resource would be more efficiently deployed in the heating sector long-term, the use of biomass in the peat stations will help to meet Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy target and reduce carbon emissions in the sector. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In keeping with this policy, the public service obligation (or PSO) support for producing electricity from peat has already ended for Edenderry power station and will end for the West Offaly and Lough Ree power stations by 2020.  A new PSO support under the REFIT 3 scheme was put in place to support all three peat fired power stations to transition to biomass co-firing.<\/p>  <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s power station in Edenderry is now in receipt of this support for up to 30% the size of the plant.

These power stations are technically capable of co-firing with biomass similar to Edenderry.  Therefore a similar transition path towards increasing levels of renewable energy could be followed.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Bord na M&oacute;na has stated that it intends to cease harvesting peat for electricity generation by 2030.  The company has committed to replace large-scale peat production with alternative indigenous energy sources such as biomass.  This was outlined in Bord na Mona&rsquo;s Sustainability 2030 report, published in October 2015.

The projections indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020, a deteriorating position in respect of the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s targets for 2020 when compared with previous projections.  Though not unexpected, given the welcome return to economic growth in Ireland, it nevertheless confirms that Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse emissions continue to track broader trends in the economy and serves to underline the difficult decisions ahead of us as we try to reduce emissions in line with our international commitments.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the targets for 2020, Ireland has an emissions reduction target for each year between 2013 and 2020 under the 2009 EU Effort Sharing Decision.  For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005.  This will be Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the overall EU objective to reduce its emissions by the order of 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.  Ireland&rsquo;s target is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated to EU Member States under this 2009 Decision, which is shared only with Denmark and Luxembourg.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself.  In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. <\/p>  <p>  In order to maximise Ireland's emissions reductions and address the gap to the 2020 target, it will also\u00a0be necessary to pursue other available options, in addition to the introduction of further policies and measures planned through the National Mitigation Plan. <\/p>  <p>  The legislative framework governing the EU&rsquo;s 2020 emissions reductions targets includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets, including provisions to bank any excess allowances to future years and to trade allowances between Member States.  Using our banked emissions from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emission reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2018.  However, our cumulative emissions are expected to exceed targets for 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances.  While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis will be required to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700065#WRA06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":70,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 68 to 70, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Generation","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700066#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[29798\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700066#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the degree to which the alternative energy sector continues to grow with particular reference to the maximisation of alternative renewable energy with consequent benefit to the environment in terms of reduced emissions and to the economy in terms of import substitution in addition to reducing reliance on imported fuels; the extent to which developments regarding a European energy grid continue to be a viable option; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.\u00a0 Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.\u00a0 Since 2012,\u00a0the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.\u00a0 As a result there has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.\u00a0 This footprint is continuing to expand.<\/p><p>In\u00a0April,\u00a0eir\u00a0signed an\u00a0agreement with me committing them to follow through on\u00a0their commercial plans to provide new high speed broadband infrastructure to 300,000 premises in rural areas.  Eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over\u00a0a 90 week period with an average of 500 premises passed per day.\u00a0 In line with the\u00a0published Agreement there are regular Review Meetings the purpose of which is\u00a0to monitor this rollout and ensure that eir\u00a0meets its\u00a0obligations under the Agreement.\u00a0\u00a0A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website .\u00a0 The decision by eir to invest in infrastructure to deploy high speed broadband services to an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland was taken\u00a0by eir\u00a0on commercial grounds.  Neither I nor the Department have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard. <\/p><p>Quarterly updates on progress of the eir 300k rollout will be published on the Departments website.\u00a0 The Q1 figures have been verified by my Department and the eir rollout\u00a0is in line with the Commitment Agreement.<\/p><p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie.\u00a0\u00a0This map finalises the\u00a0State Intervention Area for the procurement process and is an important milestone in the procurement process.  The Map\u00a0shows the extent of \u00a0the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.<\/p><p>-  The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,<\/p><p>-  The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. <\/p><p>The\u00a0following table details\u00a0the number of premises to be covered by the State Intervention and through commercial investment\u00a0in the areas\u00a0identified by the Deputies\u00a0and sets out the position at end 2016.\u00a0 <table><tr><th>County Name <\/th><th>Number of Premises <\/th><th>Number of Premises within the NBP Intervention Area <\/th><th>Number of \u00a0Premises within Commercial Operator&rsquo;s Area <\/th><th>Number of premises planned commercial rural deployment*<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>83,031<\/td><td>19,370<\/td><td>50,662<\/td><td>12,999<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>42,143<\/td><td>17,150<\/td><td>17,664<\/td><td>7,329<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>32,845<\/td><td>15,792<\/td><td>12,505<\/td><td>4,548<\/td><\/tr><\/table>* These figures will reduce as the rural\u00a0deployment is rolled out.<\/p><p>There are approximately 2.3m premises covering Ireland&rsquo;s 26 counties, of which approximately 542,000 (23%) premises are located in the AMBER area on the Map.\u00a0 These premises will require State intervention and are the focus for the State Intervention procurement process.\u00a0 The remaining 1.8m \u00a0premises are located in the BLUE areas and will be\/are\u00a0served by commercial operators. Of the 1.8m premises, 1.4m are already within a high speed broadband area and a further 300,000 premises\u00a0fall within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and\u00a0end\u00a02018 (Light BLUE on map).\u00a0 Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at\u00a0 http:\/\/fibrerollout.ie\/eircode-lookup\/.\u00a0<\/p><p>My Departments High Speed Broadband map www.broadband.gov.ie. provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county.\u00a0 Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE\u00a0or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.<\/p><p>My Department is running\u00a0a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers.\u00a0<\/p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.\u00a0 The \u00a0three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.<\/p><p>With the finalisation of the map and following extensive dialogue with bidders, the procurement is progressing to the next stage.\u00a0 On 20 June 2017, my\u00a0Department wrote to the three bidders in the NBP procurement process inviting them to submit their &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; by 26 September 2017.\u00a0 The 'Detailed Solutions' will then be reviewed\u00a0before the final tender is issued.\u00a0 The NBP procurement process will then move to the next stage where a preferred bidder will be appointed.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP, once contracts are in place. <\/p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.<\/p><p>The rate of demand for data services has increased\u00a0exponentially in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for\u00a0telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is available on both Departments' websites.<\/p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I, together with Minister Humphreys,\u00a0established an Implementation Group.  This group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.\u00a0 I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13th June 2017, which is available on my Department's website\u00a0at www.dccae.gov.ie\/documents\/Taskforce%20Q1%20Progress%20Report.pdf\u00a0and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017. <\/p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in\u00a0lots\u00a0covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.<\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.<\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p><p>There is\u00a0no universal service obligation (USO) for high speed broadband provision or mobile voice services in Ireland.\u00a0 The current EU and national regulatory framework for telecommunications relates solely to voice telephony and Functional Internet Access (28.8 kilobits per second) and is provided for under the current EU regulatory framework governing telecoms.\u00a0\u00a0In September 2016, the European Commission published an ambitious proposal for the regulation of the European telecoms sector, which aims to incentivise and encourage increased investment in high speed broadband networks.\u00a0 I have raised the issue of a USO for high speed broadband at EU level and\u00a0I am seeking inclusion of a specific provision in the new framework that would allow Member States to apply a USO for high speed broadband, where such networks are available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700066#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":94,"content":"<p>Question No. 75 answered with Question No. 67.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Transmission Network","counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700066#WRB02500"},{"type":"question","counter":96,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[29814\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700066#WRB02600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the process in place to support landowners in reaching a compensation agreement with a company (details supplied) in the event of power lines being brought through their property.","asker":"1284","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":97,"content":"<p>Under the Electricity Act 1927 (as amended), landowners are entitled to compensation for any electricity lines placed across their lands.\u00a0 The ESB\/IFA Code of Practice\u00a0(1985) sets out the basis on which\u00a0landowners are compensated for any\u00a0loss taking account of\u00a0crop loss, land damage, loss of development rights and disturbance.<\/p><p>The agreement between EirGrid\/ESB Networks and the IFA (2009)\u00a0provides for\u00a0payments to landowners who cooperate with the build programme to facilitate timely construction of infrastructure.

As I stated in my immediate reaction to the decision, we are all vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and we all have a responsibility to address climate change within our respective capabilities.  The withdrawal decision marks a regrettable shift away from the previously strong climate ambition shown by the United States, which\u00a0played a major role in mobilising global ambition and achieving the agreement reached by 195 Parties in Paris in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The Environment Council, which met on 19 June, was unanimous in its view that the Paris Agreement is fit for purpose and is not open to renegotiation.

In this regard, the European Union submitted an NDC committing to a reduction of at least 40% in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, which will be met through reductions of 43% in the Emission Trading System (ETS) and 30% in the non-ETS sector compared with 2005 levels.<\/p>  <p>  A proposal on the non-ETS targets for individual Member States, the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), was published by the European Commission in July 2016.

Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy.<\/p>  <p>\u00a0 My Department is currently developing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which is being designed to assist Ireland in meeting its 2020 renewable electricity targets and will support in delivering\u00a0Ireland's renewable energy contributions to the 2030\u00a0EU\u00a0renewable energy targets. <\/p>  <p>  The design of the new scheme is underway, and includes an extensive independent economic appraisal.  This economic appraisal involves comparing the cost of supporting Solar Photovoltaics (PV) - both rooftop and ground mounted, offshore wind, onshore wind and a range of other commercial renewable technologies, to ensure that\u00a0the\u00a0new scheme\u00a0delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment also includes analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will shortly publish a public consultation on key design elements\u00a0of the new support scheme.  Following the outcome of this public consultation, and before any new scheme is introduced, it will need to secure Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission.  Subject to this, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the level of interest in the solar and offshore wind sector in Ireland, by both state-owned and private-sector companies. \u00a0My position remains that while solar and offshore wind have a role to play in Ireland&rsquo;s energy future, particularly in relation to diversification of our renewable portfolio, we cannot have a situation where a new support scheme leads to a disproportionate increase in people&rsquo;s electricity bills through the Public Service Obligation levy.  In designing the new RESS, the cost implications for people and businesses will, therefore be a high priority and I will ensure that the new scheme is designed in a cost efficient manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700067#WRC03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":177,"content":"<p>Question No. 114 answered with Question No. 70.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postal Codes","counter":178,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700067#WRC04000"},{"type":"question","counter":179,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[29482\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700067#WRC04100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the status of the progress of the roll-out of Eircodes.","asker":"1259","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":180,"content":"<p>Capita Business Support Services Ireland, trading as Eircode, was awarded a 10 year contract in December 2013 to develop, implement, maintain and promote the use of the National Postcode System \"Eircode\".<\/p>  <p>  Since the launch in July 2015, Eircode usage, as part of an address, continues to grow and is used widely among the public, businesses and public sector.\u00a0 This, in part, can be seen by use of the free Eircode Finder app having to-date over 13million free lookups, with an average daily hit rate of 24,000.<\/p>  <p>  Eircodes are\u00a0available on Google Maps,\u00a0and other Sat Nav Providers, such as TomTom, facilitating better access\u00a0for consumers and businesses to\u00a0digital goods and services.<\/p>  <p>  Capita have\u00a0licenced over 30 approved Eircode Providers, many\u00a0of which are SME&rsquo;s developing Eircode applications for use by businesses across a\u00a0spectrum\u00a0of business categories.

The Authority&rsquo;s inspections relate to employers at their place of work.  The following tables give the figures for inspections and investigations of all workplaces and construction sites visited since 2014 and the enforcement actions taken by Authority inspectors.  The yearly tables give the numbers of inspections and investigations carried out in each NACE Sector since 2014.<\/p><p>In relation to ceasing work activities on any workplace including construction sites, the Authority&rsquo;s inspectors can use their powers under Section 67 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to serve a Prohibition Notice on a duty-holder (e.g. on the employer, sub-contractor etc.,) to stop a work activity.  The Prohibition Notice is issued where the inspector forms the opinion that an activity at that place of work poses a risk of serious personal injury.  The notice requires the activity to stop until appropriate controls are in place to minimise\/eliminate the risk of injury.  Once this has been done and the duty holder confirms to the inspector that they are in compliance, and this is verified by the inspector.<\/p><p>There are a range of other enforcement actions available to inspectors which require improvements to be made to safety and health standards at a place of work but which may not require the duty-holder to cease the work activity.  These include Improvement Notices and Reports of Inspection. <\/p><p>The Improvement Notice (Section 66) can be issued where the inspector observes a breach of the health and safety legislation.  This Notice must give the duty-holder a period of time to remedy the breach and become compliant.  For this Notice the work does not have to cease. <\/p><p>If the duty-holder is aggrieved by either the Prohibition or the Improvement Notice, he\/she can appeal it to the District Court. <\/p><p>Inspectors can also provide a Report of Inspection to the duty holder detailing actions needed to be taken to improve health and safety on site. <\/p><p>The inspectors will take actions including follow up visits to ensure Notices and Reports of Inspection are complied with.<\/p><p>In addition under Section 71 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 where the Authority or an inspector considers that the risk to the safety, health or welfare of persons is so serious that the use of a place of work or part of a place of work should be restricted or immediately prohibited until specified measures have been taken to reduce the risk to a reasonable level, the Authority can apply to the High Court for an order restricting or prohibiting the use of the place of work or part of a place of work accordingly.

The DBP was found to be &lsquo;broadly compliant&rsquo; by the European Commission.  This included an expected deviation under the EB of approximately &euro;200 million in relation to increased national contributions to the EU Budget. <\/p>  <p>  In January of this year the Commission published its updated version of the 2017 Vade Mecum which included a methodological change around the treatment of one-offs.  In the past one-offs were not included in the assessment of compliance with the EB whereas they will be taken systematically into account in the assessment process going forward.  However, the Commission appears to have retrospectively applied this change in its calculations to the EB assessment for 2016 and the combined EB assessment for 2016\/2017.  As I have previously stated for the Deputy in PQs number 143 of the 30th of May and number 296 of the 19th of June I do not accept retrospective application of methodological changes, particularly relating to 2016 and the 2016\/2017 average.  The Commission themselves have admitted that there may be legal uncertainty with the approach taken and the 2017 version of the Vade Mecum states that &ldquo;in order to preserve Member States&rsquo; legitimate expectations, compliance with already adopted Council recommendations will continue to be assessed on the basis of methodologies described in the 2016 version of the Vade Mecum.\"  My officials continue to engage bilaterally with the Commission on this point.<\/p>  <p>  Further, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) found Ireland to be &lsquo;strongly compliant&rsquo; with the EB in the 2016 Ex-post Assessment of compliance with the Domestic Budgetary Rule 2016.  Therefore there could not have been a significant deviation under the two-year assessment.  The next assessment of compliance with the EB will the DBP due to be submitted in October of this year. <\/p>  <p>  Based on the European Commission&rsquo;s final ex-post assessment of compliance with the balanced budget rule, Ireland is estimated to have reduced its structural deficit by 0.3 per cent in 2016.  This improvement is considered to be consistent with broad compliance with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.  For 2017, my Department forecasts a further structural improvement of 0.3 per cent, indicating continued broad compliance with the balanced budget rule.

The CCPC plans to conduct further research into PCPs in the second half of this year.<\/p>  <p>  If a consumer has concerns regarding the activities of credit intermediaries, they may wish to contact the CCPC.

Further schemes are currently underway at Kings Island in Limerick, Foynes, Athlone, Ennis Lower and Ennis South. <\/p>  <p>  The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding is the Office of Public Works (OPW) Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  The Programme is focussing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding.  It is the principal vehicle for implementing the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs). <\/p>  <p>  The Shannon CFRAM Study is one of six regional CFRAM Studies commissioned by the OPW to examine in detail the causes of significant potential flooding risk.  It is a significant project covering an area of 17,800 square kilometres with a population of 670,000 in 17 local authority areas.  66 of the 300 AFAs nationally are located within the Shannon CFRAM Study area.  The CFRAM is also addressing the management of the flood risk on the Shannon Callows as part of this programme.  The overall cost of the Shannon CFRAM Study to date is &euro;7.1m.<\/p>  <p>  There has been an extensive response to the recent public consultation on the draft FRMPs and has provided constructive and wide-ranging observations and comments.  The review and assessment of each of these, while taking longer than expected, is indicative of the nature of the value of the comments received and are informing the final Plans. <\/p>  <p>  Final Plans, taking account of the submissions received, are now being reviewed by the OPW.  They will then be submitted over the coming weeks to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the environmental assessments of the Plans prior to their formal submission to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for approval, scheduled for the Autumn.  <\/p>  <p>  Determining which option best addresses the flood risk for each area was decided against agreed Flood Risk Management Objectives.  The Objectives are aimed at considering potential benefits and impacts across a broad range of factors including economic, environmental and cultural, social and technical.  Prioritising schemes for investment in the future will be assessed against the respective costs and benefits each delivers against the Objectives.<\/p>  <p>  While the information in relation to the costs for each measure are not available at this time the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in September 2015 announced details of a &euro;430 million 6 year programme of capital investment on flood defence measures as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall Capital Investment Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021.  During this time, the annual allocation for flood defence schemes will more than double to &euro;100m. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to large-scale schemes, funding is available through the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme to Local Authorities to address localised flooding in the Shannon Catchment and throughout the country.  The recent review of the Scheme examined all the existing criteria with a view to strengthening and improving the operability of the Scheme.  As a result, the upper financial threshold has now been increased significantly from &euro;500,000 to &euro;750,000 per project and for the first time, farm yards\/buildings will be included as commercial premises in all categories.  Other improvements include lowering the benefit to costs ratio for smaller projects, improved benefit allowances for different property types and updated methodology for diverted journeys due to flooding.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2016, the Government took decisive action to support the existing plans in place to address flooding on the Shannon and established the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group to enhance ongoing co-operation of all State agencies involved with the River Shannon and to add value to the CFRAM Programme.<\/p>  <p>  The Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group has taken the decision to consider developing a plan for strategic maintenance works on the River Shannon that will complement the Group&rsquo;s Work Programme and the specific measures that are identified for the areas at risk in the CFRAM Shannon Flood Risk Management Plan.  The Group has established a sub-committee to explore all of the necessary legal, environmental, technical and other considerations that arise in bringing forward both short term and long term proposals that can benefit flood risk management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700070#WRF04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":353,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700070#WRF04100"},{"type":"question","counter":354,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[29787\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700070#WRF04200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the details and county location of capital projects announced by his Department in March, April, May and to date in June 2017.","asker":"1221","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":355,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will\u00a0be aware, the Government&rsquo;s overall Capital Plan was published\u00a0in\u00a0September 2015.\u00a0\u00a0The details and county location of capital projects announced under the Capital Plan since March 2017 can be provided by\u00a0the\u00a0relevant Ministers and I understand that the Deputy has put this question down to all Ministers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700070#WRF04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700070#WRF04400"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[29854\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700070#WRF04500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of Civil Service clerical officers in full-time employment in his Department as of 31 May 2017, by county, in tabular form.

Public Procurement is governed by EU and National rules.  The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers the\u00a0best value for money.\u00a0 It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour particular candidates on grounds such\u00a0as organisation size, locality, nationality etc., and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.<\/p><p>However, there is a recognition at EU Level of the need to promote and facilitate SME participation in public procurement.  The new EU Directives on Procurement, transposed into Irish law in May 2016, are intended to make it easier for businesses and SMEs to tender for public sector procurement contracts.\u00a0 Measures specifically designed to improve access for SMEs and start-ups include:<\/p><p>- financial capacity\u00a0criterion is generally\u00a0limited to twice contract value - there are no\u00a0centrally imposed\u00a0requirements for a minimum turnover.

This is because the contracting authority\u00a0is in the best\u00a0\u00a0position to gauge the appropriate levels of\u00a0financial capacity that are\u00a0appropriate to the needs of that specific\u00a0contract. <\/p><p>- discretion to divide\u00a0public contracts\u00a0\u00a0into lots, with the proviso that opting not to divide a\u00a0contract into\u00a0lots must be explained in the procurement documents or the\u00a0report on the procurement process. <\/p><p>- electronic methods of\u00a0communication are\u00a0mandated in parts of the tender process.<\/p><p>- the introduction of the\u00a0European Single\u00a0Procurement Document (ESPD), a self-declaration form aimed\u00a0at reducing red tape for suppliers <\/p><p>- provision for &ldquo;consortia\u00a0bidding&rdquo; may\u00a0assist SMEs to participate in procurement procedures where\u00a0they would\u00a0not have the relevant capability or scale if they were to bid\u00a0as sole tenderers <\/p><p>- explicit provision for\u00a0pre-market\u00a0discussion with suppliers and independent experts, subject\u00a0to\u00a0safeguards against distorting competition or violating\u00a0transparency and\u00a0non-discrimination principles <\/p><p>- reductions in the time\u00a0limits for receipt\u00a0of tenders by approximately 30% compared to the position under the 2006\u00a0Regulations <\/p><p>- Member States are\u00a0required to report back\u00a0to the Commission every 3 years on SME\u00a0participation in public\u00a0procurement <\/p><p>A number of these measures\u00a0had been\u00a0accelerated into policy in 2014 in advance of the transposition of the new Directives by Circular 10\/14 -\u00a0Initiatives to assist SMEs in Public Procurement - issued by the OGP.\u00a0<\/p><p>The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.\u00a0 The OGP works with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.  It does this by facilitating\u00a0quarterly meetings of an SME Advisory Group, which have been chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for public procurement, so that the voice of Irish SMEs (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF)\u00a0can be heard by Government.\u00a0 SMEs are also encouraged to register with the Government's eTenders portal so that they can be notified of upcoming tendering opportunities.<\/p><p>The OGP\u00a0works\u00a0with\u00a0the SME industry representative bodies as well as the Department of\u00a0 Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to promote the\u00a0engagement of SMEs in public procurement.\u00a0 Evidence of\u00a0the work and co-operation in the area can be seen in events such as\u00a0&quot;Go-2-Tender&quot;\u00a0workshops\u00a0and\u00a0&quot;Meet\u00a0the Buyer&quot;

Schools will be frontloaded with resources to provide additional\u00a0teaching support to all pupils who need such support.<\/p><p>Allocations based on the school profiles were issued to all schools, including the schools referred to my the Deputy\u00a0on 7th March.<\/p><p>The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children.<\/p><p>No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils\u00a0by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school.<\/p><p>An\u00a0additional 900 teaching posts\u00a0have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional\u00a0teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011.<\/p><p>The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government.<\/p><p>The NCSE\u00a0has published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: <i>www.ncse.ie.<\/i><\/p><p>Schools who wished to submit an appeal were asked to do so by March 31st 2017.<\/p><p>The NCSE has confirmed that an appeal has been received from the school referred to by the Deputy.<\/p><p>The appeals\u00a0are currently being processed\u00a0and it is intended that schools will shortly\u00a0be notified of the outcome.<\/p><p>Schools could appeal\u00a0whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017\/18 allocation.<\/p><p>DES Circulars 0013\/2017 and 0014\/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.<\/p><p>In advance of any\u00a0submission of an appeal, schools were asked to read carefully the DES Circulars and in particular the relevant sections, which relate to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.<\/p><p>The model\u00a0will\u00a0also allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances\u00a0or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very\u00a0substantially prior to the next review of the model.

Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very\u00a0significantly since the allocation was made to the school,\u00a0may\u00a0an additional allocation of hours be made to the school.<\/p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs have also now been published and are available on my Departments website.<\/p><p>The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700072#WRH03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teaching Contracts","counter":468,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700072#WRH03550"},{"type":"question","counter":469,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[29731\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700072#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of teachers at secondary level that are employed on contracts of less than ten hours per week; the number of secondary level teachers employed on temporary contracts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":470,"content":"<p>There are 278 teachers at secondary level that are employed on contracts of less than ten hours per week.\u00a0 There are 3,160 secondary level teachers employed on temporary contracts.<\/p>  <p>  Teachers employed by the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) are paid on their individual payrolls.

This does not diminish in any way our concerns regarding the negative developments on human rights, rule of law, freedom of expression including media freedom, and democracy in Turkey, particularly since the attempted coup last July, or our concerns regarding the implementation of the referendum passed on 16 April. Quite the contrary.  We have consistently raised these concerns, including about the scale of dismissals and detentions of public servants, academics and journalists at every appropriate opportunity, and will continue to do so.  I am particularly concerned about the arrest of Mr. Taner Kili&ccedil;, Chair of Amnesty International, Turkey on 6 June, and call on the Turkish authorities to ensure that full due process, including the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial is respected.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland believes that the lines of communication with Turkey must be kept open, bearing in mind the long-term future of all of the citizens of Turkey.  In that context, the EU will continue to work with Turkey to encourage a return to European values.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700074#WRK05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":578,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700074#WRK05300"},{"type":"question","counter":579,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[30203\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700074#WRK05400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the measures he plans to introduce to resolve the significant backlog of passport applications that has built up at the Passport Office; if he will allocate the necessary resources to help reduce this backlog; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":580,"content":"<p>Between 1 January and 23 June the Passport Service received over 499,000 passport applications, which represents a 12% increase over the same period last year.<\/p><p>The Passport Service is working very hard, and largely successfully, to manage the high volume of applications being received in recent months to meet the target delivery dates and avoid backlogs.<\/p><p>There are currently 61,000 applications in progress, which is a reduction on previous weeks.  These are applications that are going through the normal entitlement checking process rather than backlogs.  While the volume of applications in progress remains high, the target turnaround time for Passport Express renewal applications of 15 working days is being met, as it has been over the past six weeks.  The target turnaround time for first-time applications and applications for renewal of lost, stolen or damaged passports through Passport Express is 20 working days.  These categories of application take longer due to the extra security checks involved.  This target turnaround time is also currently being met (down from 24 working days as of 19 June). <\/p><p>In addition to the 300 full-time permanent staff already assigned within my Department to the Passport Service, almost 230 Temporary Clerical Officers have been assigned to the Passport Offices in Balbriggan, Mount Street and Cork to assist in managing high seasonal demand.  Targeted overtime for the Passport Service has also been sanctioned to increase processing capacity.  The allocation of resources and assignment of work across offices is reviewed continually to maximise efficiency. <\/p><p>The fact that target turnaround times for Passport Express renewal and first-time applications are being met despite the very significant increases in volumes of applications in recent months reflects the hard work and the professionalism of Passport Service staff. <\/p><p>Service improvements have also made a major contribution to the effective management of the exceptionally high volumes.  As the Deputy will be aware, the new Online Passport Application Service was launched at the end of March this year.  As take-up of the service increases, it will considerably enhance overall passport processing capacity and contribute to reducing turnaround times for all channels.  Since the launch over 38,000 passport applications were received through this channel which is well ahead of target.  The target turnaround for the service is ten working days plus postage and in the majority of cases this is exceeded comfortably.  I therefore urge all Deputies to encourage adults who are renewing their passports to do so online. <\/p><p>It is very important that applicants choose the most appropriate application channel for their individual circumstances.  Passport Express should only be used by those who are travelling in three weeks or more.  Anyone renewing a passport who needs to travel in under three weeks should either apply online or by appointment at the Passport Office in either Dublin or Cork.<\/p><p>Further, I urge all Deputies to encourage citizens to register for the free passport renewal reminder email service provided by my Department at the following web address:<i> <\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700074#WRK05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":582,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700074#WRK05700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":581,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700074#WRK05600"},{"type":"question","counter":582,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[29455\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700074#WRK05700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding a project (details supplied); his plans for the fully serviced site; the cost of maintaining the site in each of the past three years and to date in 2017; the cost of security of the site for the past three years to date; if he has requested a market valuation of the site; if the working group in his Department has produced a report on the site; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":583,"content":"<p>For extensive background information on the Thornton Hall project - how it arose, the related prison accommodation issues and other relevant factors - I would refer the Deputy to the Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General Annual Report 2005 which addressed this issue.<\/p><p>The issue was subsequently examined by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in October 2006.  The Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General also addressed this issue as part of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services in 2014 (No. 9 Development of Prison Accommodation in Dublin) and, again, the PAC subsequently examined this issue in November 2015.<\/p><p>The Thornton Hall site comprises 156 acres and was purchased for a proposed prison development to replace Mountjoy Prison campus.  Selection of the site began with advertisements in the national newspapers and over 30 potential sites were evaluated by a selection committee.  Thornton was selected as the least costly of the sites which met the relevant criteria.

The initial purchase price of the land at Thornton was &euro;29,900,000 in 2005 which was offset by the sale of surplus prison lands at Shanganagh Castle for &euro;29.6 million.  For accounting purposes, the value of the 150 acre site at Thornton continues to be recorded at the cost of &euro;29.9 million, plus investment in infrastructure and services, pending a review of its potential value and benefit to the State.<\/p><p>In January 2015, a Working Group was established by the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality to examine options for the future use of the Thornton Hall site.  This group, comprising of officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Office of Public Works and the Irish Prison Service, was asked to review potential options for the lands and house at Thornton and make recommendations on how best to maximise the value to the State.  The Working Group has been in contact with other state bodies to explore potential uses for the site, and that work is ongoing.<\/p><p>Regarding the market valuation of the site, it was felt that the most prudent and transparent way of reflecting the value of Thornton was to continue to incorporate the historic cost in the Statement of Capital Assets.  It is clear that the site has a potential medium or long term strategic value and it is not proposed to speculate on the current resale value of the site pending the outcome of the review.

All decisions by the Workplace Relations Commission are confidential to the parties involved until published by the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Clear statutory provisions are in place to address the issue of racist abuse.  The Irish Prison Service can and does address alleged racial abuse by prisoners within a statutory environment and having regard to the unique nature of the prison environment and the legal status of prisoners sent by the Courts.  Statutory Instrument 252 of 2007, Prison Rules 2007, identifies racist abuse as a serious breach of prison discipline and also makes provision for complaints about racist abuse.  \"A prisoner shall be guilty of a breach of prison discipline if he or she - treats with disrespect, through the use of any abusive, insolent, racist or threatening behaviour or language, the governor, any prison officer, any prisoner, any visitor to the prison or any other person\" [Paragraph 3  Schedule 1  Prison Rules 2007] &ldquo;displays, attaches, or draws on any part of a prison, or on any other property, threatening, abusive or insulting racist words, drawings, symbols or other material.&rdquo;  [Paragraph 31 Schedule 1 of the  Prison Rules 2007].  Racism is placed on the same level as threatening behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  As I am sure the Deputy will agree, a prison is a unique environment.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) in May 2015 acknowledged the special difficulties that a prison environment presented and noted: &ldquo;The Commission understands the difficulties that may arise in the context of eliminating racial harassment, or indeed any form of discriminatory harassment within the Prison system where the alleged perpetrator is a prisoner. In this regard, it is noted that disciplinary procedures are governed by primary legislation and statute.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The Prison Rules 2007 inform both staff and prisoners alike that engaging in racial abuse constitutes a significant breach of prison discipline which will merit severe sanction.  Any victim of racial abuse is made fully aware of the mechanisms available to him or her under the provisions, whereby they can seek redress by way of complaint for any racial abuse suffered.  Sanctions which can be imposed on prisoners for breaching prison discipline are contained in the Prisons Act 2007.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014 the Irish Prison Service conducted a survey of its staff on Experiences of Equality and Diversity within the Irish Prison Service.  The staff responses in the survey did not identify racism as  a significant issue within the service, however the Irish Prison Service remains firmly committed to raising racial awareness as well as highlighting other forms of discrimination and has initiated measures such as &ldquo;Show Racism the Red Card&rdquo; to promote racial awareness within the prison.<\/p>  <p>  A new prisoner complaints procedure was introduced  from 1 November 2012.  This allows for all complaints made by prisoners alleging serious ill treatment, use of excessive force, serious intimidation\/discrimination or threats by a member or staff of the Irish Prison Service to be investigated by an independent investigator.  The Inspector of Prisons Office has oversight of all investigations, has access to any material relevant to any such investigation and may investigate any aspects that is considered relevant.<\/p>  <p>  Complaints from prison staff regarding alleged harassment by other prison staff on any of the following nine grounds - gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race or membership of the Travelling community are dealt with under the Civil Service Dignity at Work policy which outlines procedures for dealing with such complaints.  All complaints or queries raised in relation to bullying, harassment or sexual harassment are treated seriously, fairly and in the strictest of confidence.

I am informed that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, on 13 June 2017 the Government agreed in principle to the reopening of Stepaside Garda station on a pilot basis as soon as any necessary preparatory works have been completed.  This is a matter to be progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.<\/p>  <p>  This plan is progressing  apace.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

These searches proved negative.<\/p>  <p>  A large portion of the Garda Western Region comprises of the exposed Atlantic coastline with Coast Watch Schemes, similar to Neighbourhood Watch Schemes, established in three Garda Divisions in the Region.  Divisional Drugs Units, established within the Region, are specifically tasked with enforcing the Misuse of Drugs Acts and related legislation, including the importation and sale\/supply of illicit drugs.  An Inspector in each Division is designated with responsibility for each Coast Watch Scheme and liaises with resident, community, business and local fishermen to ensure that any suspicious activity is reported, through local Garda personnel and Community Policing Units to the Divisional Drug Units.<\/p>  <p>  The Divisional Drug Units liaise closely with the Garda National Drugs &amp;amp; Organised Crime Bureau, the Revenue Commissioners and the Defence Forces (Navy).

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p>  <p>  This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that just under 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division.<\/p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.<\/p>  <p>  The Special Detective Unit (SDU) is responsible for the investigation of threats to the state security and the monitoring of persons who pose a threat to the security of the State on both national and international fronts.

One of the key measures in the legislation provides for Preliminary Drug Testing, which enables Garda&iacute; to test motorists at the roadside, whom they suspect of driving under the influence of drugs, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can now establish roadside checkpoints, known as Mandatory Impairment Checkpoints (MITs), to test drivers for the presence of both alcohol and drugs. <\/p>  <p>  The new drug testing devices (Dr&auml;ger DrugTest 5000) involve testing a sample of a driver&rsquo;s oral fluid (saliva) for the presence of cannabis, cocaine, opiates (e.g. heroin, morphine) and benzodiazepines (e.g. valium).  The new devices will also be available in Garda stations.  The MBRS has found that of the 3,020 specimens of blood and urine that it received in 2016, 24% confirmed positive for drugs other than alcohol.  Of these, 91% were specimens from male drivers, most of whom were in the 17-44 year age range. Cannabis was the most prevalent drug detected, followed by benzodiazepines.<\/p>  <p>  At the recent meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Road Safety in May this year, the MBRS informed the committee that a tender for new preliminary breath testing equipment is now live and it is hoped that all stages of the process will be completed by early 2018.  New equipment, which is available in the market place, has the capacity to record the time, GPS location and number of persons breath-tested, and has the capacity to download the information automatically, reducing the chances of errors occurring in the data.<\/p>  <p>  To support the introduction of Preliminary Drug Testing, I am advised that the Road Safety Authority is running a comprehensive online media campaign, targeting the use of illicit drugs in the 18 to 34 year old age bracket, to raise awareness of the new Garda drug-testing powers.  This campaign will primarily feature videos which demonstrate how the drug tests will be administered on the road side and the consequences should a driver be detected driving under the influence of drugs.  This awareness campaign will run on social media, radio and digital platforms.  The Road Safety Authority is also running a parallel campaign, aimed at allaying the concerns of those taking medicines and driving (over the counter and prescription drugs).  Specifically, the Road Safety Authority is putting information leaflets into pharmacies and doctors&rsquo; surgeries nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that drug driving is a factor in approximately one in ten fatal crashers.  Drug driving not only puts the driver at risk but also passengers and other road users.  The introduction of Preliminary Drug Testing strengthens the ability of Garda&iacute; to tackle drug driving and I welcome this important statutory enforcement provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700076#WRM02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":661,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700076#WRM02150"},{"type":"question","counter":662,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[29917\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700076#WRM02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of adults and children who have been granted a stamp 4 visa each month to date in 2017, in tabular form.","asker":"1215","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":663,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department that the total number of Stamp 4 registrations and renewals granted to date in 2017 is set out in the following table.

That review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation.

The Commissioner's second interim report was considered by Government on 13 June 2017 when it agreed in principle to the reopening of Stepaside Garda station on a pilot basis as soon as any necessary preparatory works have been completed.  The Government also agreed that a decision in relation to the proposed reopening of  Rush, Leighlinbridge and Donard stations will be taken when a final report is received from the Commissioner. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country.

The remaining &euro;30 million is available for schemes which will be delivered at a national level.  The allocated funding was not distributed to County Councils; rather it has been allocated to 28 LEADER sub-regional areas in Ireland, and will be delivered by the Local Action Groups (LAGs) selected in each respective area. <\/p><p>The sub-regional areas are, in the main, aligned with the county boundaries.  However, Co. Cork is divided into 3 sub-regional areas.  The allocation for each sub-regional area is provided for the duration of the Programme rather than on an annual basis.  This provides greater flexibility to the LAGs in managing their resources.  <\/p><p>Table 1 details the allocations to LAGs in each county and the expenditure incurred in each county each year to date under the LEADER 2014-2020 Programme.

That process is now concluded, with Funding Agreements signed with 29 LEADER Local Action Groups for the duration of the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme.  <\/p>  <p>  Following on from that selection process, two separate models have emerged for the delivery of the LEADER 2014-2020 Programme in Ireland.

The second model is where the Local Community Development Committees were selected as the Local Action Group, with the Local Development Companies from the 2007-2013 programme administering much of the programme on their behalf.  In both models, the Local Development Companies continue to be the primary point of engagement for potential applicants under the LEADER programme. <\/p>  <p>  I do not have the authority, under EU rules, to unilaterally remove one of the delivery models and appoint new Local Action Groups.

An Order requiring the defendants to make Discovery was made in the High Court on 28 November 2016 in the most advanced case.  Discovery is a legal process which must be carried out in accordance with Orders made by the Courts and both the Department of Health and the HSE are working to comply with the Order made in this case.  However, the size and complexity of the Discovery means that this is not a trivial or quick process and, to date, the HSE has identified 300,000 records and the Department over 465,000 records, all which must be examined and scheduled by Counsel.  Consequently, I am currently not in a position to release all the information requested by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it is important to remember the context in which vaccination against influenza type A (H1N1) was introduced.  On 11 June 2009, following consideration by its Emergency Committee, the WHO raised the Influenza type A (H1N1) alert to Pandemic level 6 which officially declares a pandemic.  My Department activated the National Plan for pandemic influenza and, based on the advices of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; groups were prioritised for vaccination.  Vaccination of children was prioritised as the rates of influenza were highest in those groups at that time.  The public pandemic vaccination campaign ended on 31 March 2010.  <\/p>  <p>  The first reports of a link between pandemic influenza vaccination and narcolepsy came in the second half of 2010.  In August 2010, the Swedish pharmacovigilance authority reported that it was investigating six cases of narcolepsy reported by health care professionals as a possible adverse event following the use of Pandemrix vaccine during the pandemic.  This was followed later that month by reports from the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare noting there had been a more than expected number of cases of narcolepsy in children and adolescents that year.  On 23 September 2010, the Committee on Human Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency concluded in its initial review of available data that the available evidence did not confirm a link but that more research was needed.  By the end of March 2011 the Irish Medicines Board, now the Health Products Regulatory Authority, had received reports of two confirmed cases of narcolepsy following vaccination with pandemic vaccines.  My Department and the HSE agreed that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre would work with the Irish Medicines Board and Irish clinical experts in narcolepsy to examine the Irish data and report back the findings.  The Final Report of National Narcolepsy Study Steering Committee was published on 19 April 2012.  It found a 13-fold higher risk of narcolepsy in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated individuals and the absolute increased risk associated with the vaccine was five narcolepsy cases per 100,000 vaccinated children and adolescents.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, since the 2010\/2011 influenza season H1N1 has been incorporated in the seasonal flu vaccine used in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700080#WRQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Community","counter":868,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700080#WRQ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":869,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[29695\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700080#WRQ02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding Traveller support and services provided by his Department in each county; the groups, agencies and voluntary bodies involved; the cost of same for each county for the past three years and to date in 2017; his plans to set up an advisory group to report on the minimum levels of support and services from his Department that should be available in each county to address the needs and the rights of Travellers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Accordingly, a patient suffering from either MS or MND will not have automatic eligibility for a medical card.<\/p><p>Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.  In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.<\/p><p>Within the application process, the HSE endeavours to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  The legislation allows the HSE, in certain circumstances, to exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. <\/p><p>The HSE is required to undertake reviews of eligibility in order to ensure that a person continues to meet the qualifying criteria required to continue holding eligibility.  Where a medical card is due to expire, these cards are reviewed and a renewal notice is sent out to the medical card holder three months in advance of the expiry date.  It is important to note that the person under review maintains eligibility for the card while the review is being conducted, including any period where additional information is requested.<\/p><p>I have asked the HSE to examine the particular case to which the Deputy has drawn attention.  I have also asked the HSE to supply the data requested on medical card reviews and to reply to the Deputy on these matters as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700081#WRR02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":917,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700081#WRR02050"},{"type":"question","counter":918,"qnumday":382,"qnumall":"[29754\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700081#WRR02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a transport service can be provided to a person (details supplied) attending a rehabilitative training centre; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":919,"content":"<p>The provision of transport services is not part of core services within disability services.

This was published last September.  It is one of the key developments arising from Healthy Ireland, the framework for improving health and wellbeing across the population. <\/p><p>The OPAP covers a ten year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy. <\/p><p>I wish to emphasise that every sector of our society has a role in reducing the burden of obesity and the OPAP clearly acknowledges this. <\/p><p>The OPAP firstly prescribes 'Ten Steps Forward' to deal with obesity.  Step 7 is: Develop a service model for specialist care for children and adults.  There are a number of actions under this step including:<\/p><p>1. Plan for and support the development of specialist, consultant-led multidisciplinary care, based on the chosen model of care and the RCPI report, for adults on an equitable geographic basis (one within each hospital group) and one for children at national level;<\/p><p>2. develop and implement integrated clinical care models for adults and children with appropriate clinical care pathways for all patients;<\/p><p>3. develop standards, clinical guidelines and quality assurance programmes for obesity and weight management services in the health sector.<\/p><p>The appointment of a National Clinical Lead for Obesity in the HSE is among the priority actions recommended.  The National Clinical Lead will be responsible for providing among other things, a model of care for children and adults and overseeing its implementation.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the HSE is in the process of appointing a National clinical Lead for Obesity.<\/p><p>The OPAP includes a number of other priority actions including:<\/p><p>- Implementing a 'whole of school' approach to healthy lifestyle programmes which includes nutrition, physical activity and exercise, smoking, alcohol and mental wellbeing;<\/p><p>- agreeing food reformulation targets with the food industry;<\/p><p>- developing a code of practice for food and drinks promotion, marketing, sponsorship and product placement;<\/p><p>- developing a communications strategy to increase knowledge among the public of being a healthy weight and to stimulate health behaviour change;<\/p><p>- developing proposals for a National Nutrition Policy and Action Plan;<\/p><p>- developing legislation for calorie posting to support people in making healthy choices;<\/p><p>- implementing the National Physical Activity Plan;<\/p><p>- developing proposals on evidence-based fiscal measures such as a levy on sugar-sweetened drinks;<\/p><p>- developing research in the area.<\/p><p>I am pleased to advise the deputy that The Healthy Eating\/Food Pyramid Guidelines have been revised and updated by a multi-stakeholder Working Group led by my Department.  These were launched in December 2016 as the Healthy Food for Life initiative.  A Food Reformulation Working Group is being established to reduce the sugar, fat and salt content of foods and beverages, in line with the EU Food Reformulation Project.  The development of legislation on calorie posting is also underway.  <\/p><p>A Working Group has been established to develop a voluntary Code of Practice on Food Advertising, Promotion and Marketing including retail product placement and sponsorship.  My Department has also worked with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) on the marketing of food and drink to children; this arises in the context of the revised Children&rsquo;s Code to restrict marketing of high fat, high salt and high sugar foods and drinks.  My Department will make a submission to the BAI in 2017 on the new code.<\/p><p>The HSE has advised that currently programmes for treatment of obesity include a Weight Management Service in St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital , Loughlinstown, Co. Dublin and a regional bariatric service for patients with severe and complicated obesity at the Saolta University Health Care Group.  There is also a  programme  for children carried  out in  Temple Street Hospital called W82GO.  It is a 12-month family-based obesity treatment programme for children and teenagers, which provides families with health, nutrition, self-esteem, family communication and activity guidance along with support in a safe environment so that families can achieve the healthiest lifestyle for them.  The treatment follows best practice and is multidisciplinary.  Before starting the programme, the child is reviewed by a paediatrician, paediatric dietician, paediatric physiotherapist and paediatric psychologist.  The child completes an exercise test to measure fitness and has baseline blood tests which assess their metabolic health and identifies how at risk they are for obesity-related conditions.  Following the initial appointment, families are then invited onto the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700081#WRR03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":932,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700081#WRR03050"},{"type":"question","counter":933,"qnumday":387,"qnumall":"[29784\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700081#WRR03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the details and county location of capital projects announced by his Department in March, April, May and to date in June 2017.","asker":"1221","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":934,"content":"<p>Your question has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply as the the HSE is responsible for the delivery of health care infrastructure projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700081#WRR03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":935,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700081#WRR03250"},{"type":"question","counter":936,"qnumday":388,"qnumall":"[29851\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700081#WRR03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of Civil Service clerical officers in full-time employment in his Department as of 31 May 2017 by county, in tabular form.","asker":"1355","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":937,"content":"<p>There were 50 clerical officers in full time employment in my Department in Dublin on 31 May 2017.

The first confirmed finding of the disease in Ireland was made on October 2012 at a forestry plantation site in Co. Leitrim which had been planted in 2009 with trees imported from continental Europe.<\/p><p>The Department introduced a Reconstitution Scheme (Chalara Ash Dieback) in 2013 to restore forests planted under the afforestation scheme which had suffered from or which were associated with plants affected by the disease.  The Department has continued to undertake systematic and targeted surveys annually for the disease.  In addition to the increase in findings in forest plantations, there is also an increasing diversity of sites where the disease is now being identified (i.e. in terms of provenance, age, area\/extent, topography and species mix etc.).  Over half the recent findings in forest plantations are in ash trees of native Irish origin.<\/p><p>The Department has also received considerable feedback from affected landowners, Registered Forester\/Forestry Companies, and other forest sector stakeholders, in relation to the increasing prevalence of the disease and aspects of the Reconstitution Scheme.<\/p><p>A comprehensive review of the overall policy objectives and options of the All-Ireland Chalara Control Strategy has been finalised.  As part of the review process the Department committed to revise certain aspects of its policies and procedures around the disease.  The outcome of this review does not include an increase in the grant rate for this scheme.  However, other changes to the scheme are as follows:<\/p><p>- The mechanisms and procedures by which infected ash plantations are reported, inspected, sampled, tested, and if confirmed positive progressed for clearance or other disease management works have been streamlined;<\/p><p>- The use of two different notification letters (one to the forest owner and the other to the Registered Forester on file) has been discontinued, with greater clarity given as to why the forest owners need to undertake the removal and destruction of infected ash trees or other disease control measures, as well as the financial supports available;<\/p><p>- The rules in relation to where a  second instalment afforestation grant is due for payment on a plantation where the disease has been confirmed have been clarified and made less burdensome for both the forest owner and his\/her Registered Forester\/Registered Forestry Company.<\/p><p>- The timeframe given in the notification letter, which currently requires a forest owner to remove and destroy the ash trees and undertake any related sanitation actions within 8 weeks of the date of the letter, has been revised to reflect the practicalities for both the forest owner and his\/her Registered Forester\/Registered Forestry Company.<\/p><p>A focused consultation with industry stakeholder representatives and other relevant bodies on proposed Scheme changes and related matters has been completed and the changes above have been incorporated into the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700084#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Afforestation Programme","counter":1053,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700084#WRU00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1054,"qnumday":431,"qnumall":"[29492\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700084#WRU00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the appeal process available to a person dissatisfied with the issuance of a contract (details supplied);

Neither I nor my\u00a0Department have a statutory authority to direct telecommunications operators in this regard.<\/p><p>The\u00a0Government's National Broadband Plan will provide high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.\u00a0\u00a0The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that to date approximately 1.4m or 61% of the 2.3m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second and this footprint is expanding.<\/p><p>In\u00a0April,\u00a0eir\u00a0signed a\u00a0agreement with me committing them to follow through on\u00a0their commercial plans to provide new high speed broadband infrastructure to 300,000 premises in rural areas.\u00a0 Eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over\u00a0a 90 week period with an average of 500 premises passed per day.\u00a0\u00a0A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website .\u00a0 The decision by eir to invest in infrastructure to deploy high speed broadband services to an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland was taken\u00a0by eir\u00a0on commercial grounds.  Neither I nor the Department have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard. <\/p><p>Quarterly updates on progress of the eir 300k rollout will be published on the Departments website.\u00a0 The Q1 figures have been verified by my Department and the eir rollout\u00a0is in line with the Commitment Agreement.<\/p><p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at .\u00a0\u00a0This map finalises the\u00a0State Intervention Area for the procurement process and is an important milestone in the procurement process.  The Map\u00a0shows the extent of \u00a0the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.<\/p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,\u00a0 <\/p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process.<\/p><p>The map shows that 97% of the townland of Derreen (Ed Caher) Co Kerry, 13% of the townland of Ballydunlea Co Kerry\u00a0\u00a0and the eircode referred to by the Deputy\u00a0in the townland of Clonee Co Meath falls within an AMBER area and will be part of the State led Intervention under the NBP.\u00a0 The remaining 3% of the townland of Derreen (Ed Caher) and 87% of the townland of Ballydunlea falls within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and\u00a0end\u00a02018 (Light BLUE on map).\u00a0 Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at\u00a0http:\/\/fibrerollout.ie\/eircode-lookup\/.\u00a0\u00a0Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE\u00a0or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at <\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.\u00a0 The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can\u00a0progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.\u00a0\u00a0The \u00a0three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.<\/p><p>The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers.  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP, once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>The procurement is progressing to the next stage.\u00a0 This week, the Department wrote to the three bidders in the NBP procurement process inviting them to submit their &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; by 26 September 2017.  This is a significant\u00a0milestone as the NBP procurement process moves to the next stage.  The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.<\/p><p>However, I am aware that the rate of demand for data services has increased\u00a0exponentially in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for\u00a0telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.<\/p><p>The report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is available on both Departments' websites.\u00a0 In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I, together with Minister Humphreys,\u00a0established an Implementation Group.  This group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.\u00a0 I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13th June 2017, which is available on my Department's website at and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017.  The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in\u00a0lots\u00a0covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.<\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.<\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700085#WRV03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":1143,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700085#WRV04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1144,"qnumday":461,"qnumall":"[29600\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700085#WRV04100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the staffing complement of his Department in whole-time equivalents as at the end of 2016.","asker":"1353","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1145,"content":"<p>The staffing complement\u00a0for my Department at the end of 2016 was 318 full-time equivalent employees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700085#WRV04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Community","counter":1146,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700085#WRV04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1147,"qnumday":462,"qnumall":"[29689\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700085#WRV04400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding Traveller support and services provided by his Department in each county; the groups, agencies and voluntary bodies involved; the cost of same for each county for the past three years and to date in 2017; his plans to set up an advisory group to report on the minimum levels of support and services from his Department that should be available in each county to address the needs and the rights of Travellers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1148,"content":"<p>My Department\u00a0does not have any specific schemes in place for support and services exclusive to the traveller or other communities.

The community and business supports leverage considerable additional private investment.

(NBP) aims to deliver high-speed broadband services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland.  The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Since 2012,\u00a0the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5 billion in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high-speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.\u00a0 As a result, there has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today approximately 1.4 million or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high-speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. \u00a0This footprint is continuing to expand. <\/p><p>In\u00a0April,\u00a0eir\u00a0signed an\u00a0agreement with me, committing them to follow through on\u00a0their commercial plans to provide new high-speed broadband infrastructure to 300,000 premises in rural areas.\u00a0 Eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over\u00a0a 90 week period, an average of 500 premises passed per day.\u00a0 In line with the\u00a0published Agreement there are regular Review Meetings, the purpose of which is to monitor this rollout and ensure that eir\u00a0meets its\u00a0obligations under the Agreement.\u00a0\u00a0A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website, <i>www.dccae.gov.ie<\/i>.\u00a0<\/p><p>Quarterly updates on progress of the eir 300k rollout will be published on the Department's website.\u00a0 The Q1 figures have been verified by my Department and the eir rollout\u00a0is in line with the Commitment Agreement.\u00a0\u00a0My Department has\u00a0informed me that in the period from 1 January to end\u00a0March 2017 30,064 premises have been passed.  As at Q1, 40,114 premises\u00a0have been passed since eir commenced work in late 2016.\u00a0 To date, some\u00a03,865 of those premises have been connected to high-speed broadband services under the terms of the Commitment Agreement.  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at\u00a0<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>In April I published an updated High-Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>.\u00a0\u00a0This map finalises the\u00a0State Intervention Area for the procurement process and is an important milestone in the procurement process.  The Map\u00a0shows the extent of the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.<\/p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high-speed broadband services,\u00a0 <\/p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High-Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. <\/p><p>The map shows that 2% of the townland of Abbeylara, County Longford \u00a0and 100% of Knockaville, County Westmeath falls within an AMBER area and will be part of the State-led Intervention under the NBP.\u00a0 The remaining 98% of the townland of Abbeylara\u00a0falls within the BLUE area and will be served by commercial operators. <\/p><p>There are circa 89,000 premises in County Kildare, approximately 13,000 (14%) of which are located in the Amber area on the Map, and will benefit from the NBP&rsquo;s State Intervention.\u00a0 The remaining circa 76,000 (75%) premises are located in the commercial BLUE area and will be served by commercial operators and includes approximately 9,000 (12%)\u00a0 where eir is planning to deliver high-speed broadband by 2018.<\/p><p>Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE\u00a0or an AMBER area by accessing the High-Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie.<\/i><\/p><p>My Department\u00a0monitors the rollout of services in the BLUE area.  I would encourage consumers who\u00a0cannot access high-speed broadband services to contact my Department directly at <i>broadband@dccae.gov.ie<\/i>, quoting their address and Eircode, and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services.\u00a0 This information will assist the Department in keeping track of progress in those areas and\u00a0following up if\u00a0necessary.<\/p><p>The Broadband Intervention strategy\u00a0sets out a detailed service specification including a requirement that the State-funded network must: <\/p><p>- be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of at least 30 megabits per second\u00a0download and 6 megabits per second\u00a0upload to all citizens; <\/p><p>- be capable of providing for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with consumer demand;<\/p><p>- ensure the availability of high quality wholesale services to allow retail competition to develop.<\/p><p>The Plan envisages public investment in the capital costs of building the necessary infrastructure to support high-quality affordable broadband services similar to those already available in cities and towns. <\/p><p>I am confident that the combination of existing commercial investment and the State intervention will make Ireland an exemplar in Europe and beyond, in terms of providing\u00a0high-speed services to all citizens regardless of where they live or work. <\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high-speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland for at least 25 years. \u00a0The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can\u00a0progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.\u00a0 The three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0<\/p><p>The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers.\u00a0<\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3 to 5 year timeline to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP once contracts are in place. <\/p><p>The procurement is progressing to the next stage.\u00a0 This week, the Department wrote to the three bidders in the NBP procurement process inviting them to submit their Detailed Solutions by 26 September 2017.  This is a significant\u00a0milestone as the NBP procurement process moves to the next stage.  The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.<\/p><p>However, I am aware that the rate of demand for data services has increased\u00a0exponentially in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for\u00a0telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. <\/p><p>The report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is available on both Departments' websites.\u00a0 In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I, together with Minister Humphreys,\u00a0established an Implementation Group.  This group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.\u00a0 I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13th June 2017, which is available on my Department's website\u00a0 at <i><\/i>and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017.  The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in\u00a0lots\u00a0covering nine urban and rural regions across the country.<\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances. <\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700086#WRW02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Policy","counter":1183,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700086#WRW02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1184,"qnumday":475,"qnumall":"[29998\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700086#WRW02100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he has submitted a national low carbon transition and mitigation plan to the Government for approval; and when the Government will approve the plan.","asker":"1242","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1185,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply\u00a0to Question No. 58 on today's Order Paper.

I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to roll out services to particular locations.  However, mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction in 2012.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  However, as mobile services are a radio-based technology, services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets and the capacity of the network, as well as by proximity to mobile telephone antennas.<\/p><p>Any customer across Ireland who experiences service difficulties, including in Abbeylara, County Longford and Ballymore, County Westmeath, should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance.

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has calculated that 25.3% of electricity, 6.5% of heat and 5.7% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2015.\u00a0 Overall, SEAI analysis shows that 9.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2015 were met from renewable sources.\u00a0<\/p><p>The total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid is 3,174 MW approximately, of which 2,851 MW is wind generation.  It is estimated that a total of between 3,900 MW and 4,300 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target.  Given that we have 3,174 MW in place, we will need approximately a further\u00a0700 MW to\u00a01,100 MW of additional renewable generation to meet our 2020 targets.\u00a0<\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes in place\u00a0 or under development designed to stimulate further progress in the domestic renewable energy sector.

This has mainly been undertaken by the private sector.  As a global industry, the level of exploration activity in Ireland reflects worldwide market trends, in particular prevailing metal prices.  Ireland is particularly dependent on the zinc market as this is the primary exploration target.  Whilst the main exploration focus is on zinc and lead, there is interest also in gold and other base metals.  My Department's strategy in this area aims to encourage further exploration, while maximising the value added to the economy.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of indigenous oil and gas resources, four commercial gas discoveries and no commercial oil discoveries have been made since exploration began in the Irish offshore.  The Irish Atlantic Margin remains substantively underexplored and its actual potential will not be known without a significant increase in the level of exploration.  Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon energy future will involve progressively moving to lower emission fuels, e.g. moving initially from peat and coal to natural gas, and ultimately towards an even greater reliance on renewable energy.  The 2015 White Paper on Energy recognises that oil and natural gas will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in the transition period.  Taking this into account my Department's efforts in this area have focussed on deepening scientific and technical knowledge of Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas potential, in particular through data acquisition and supporting key research projects; ensuring that the regulatory regime is fit for purpose; and offering innovative and attractive licensing opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) has statutory responsibility for the conservation, protection and management of Ireland&rsquo;s inland fisheries resource, including sea angling.  The angling sector is estimated to contribute &euro;836 million to the Irish economy every year supporting 11,000 Irish jobs, often in rural and peripheral communities where fewer job opportunities are available.  The National Strategy for Angling Development (NSAD) is the first comprehensive national framework for the development of our angling resource.  The NSAD aims to increase economic contribution of angling to &euro;932 million per year and increase employment by over 1,800 jobs.  IFI is already investigating the full array of potential funding sources.  I announced approval for the first &euro;500,000 of investment for 50 community-based projects nationwide in December last.  I have also secured an additional &euro;1.5 million for NSAD investment for 2017 and further tranches of project funding will be announced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700087#WRX00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1314"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Policy","counter":1218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700087#WRX00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1219,"qnumday":492,"qnumall":"[30157\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700087#WRX01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will set out the vision for the enhancement of the development of natural energy from solar, hydro, wind, wave or other sources over the next five years with particular reference to the need for a combination of energy sources to ensure continuity of supply; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1220,"content":"<p>The 2015 Energy White Paper and the 2016 Programme for Government recognise that Ireland&rsquo;s long-term interests are best supported by further decreasing our dependence on foreign fossil fuels through the continued development of indigenous renewable energy.<\/p>  <p>  At the national level, the 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.\u00a0 Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy.  Good progress has been made to date, but the\u00a0target remains challenging, particularly in light of economic growth and a growing demand for energy.\u00a0\u00a0Latest figures by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) for 2015\u00a0indicate that 9.1% of the overall 16% target was met by renewable sources.

This progress, while welcome, will need to accelerate in pace in the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has adopted a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy.\u00a0 The primary support mechanism is the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) schemes, which currently support the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to future policy initiatives, my Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS).  The design of the new scheme is underway, and includes an extensive independent economic appraisal of multiple renewable electricity technologies.  This economic appraisal involves comparing the cost of supporting solar, offshore wind, onshore wind, hydro, ocean energy (including wave) and a range of other commercial renewable technologies, to ensure that\u00a0the\u00a0new scheme\u00a0delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment also includes analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  A public consultation on the new scheme is due to be published next month, and following this it will need to secure Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission.  Subject to this, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has one of the best offshore renewable energy resources in the world and offshore renewable energy will have an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s future renewable energy mix.\u00a0 While offshore wind has had been developed successfully, globally, wave and tidal energy is still\u00a0at the\u00a0R&amp;D stage.

Whilst\u00a0there was strong growth from the North American market, up by over 25%, visitors from Britain were down 10.7% year\u00a0on year.  It is clear that the Sterling depreciation\u00a0following the Brexit referendum has made Ireland, and every other Eurozone country, more expensive for British travellers than was the case previously.  This has led some British holidaymakers to holiday at home this year.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, Irish hotels performed well with the number of bednights up 6.6%. Recent CSO data indicates that hotel\u00a0bednights in the first quarter of 2017 were in line with 2016. Whilst the number of visitors from Britain staying in hotels is\u00a0down, this has been offset by increases from other areas.

Tourism Ireland is responsible for marketing Ireland as a tourism destination overseas. In broad terms,\u00a0its strategy involves two main elements.  Firstly, it has taken steps to revise its marketing effort in Britain to make it more relevant in a Brexit environment.  As well as this, it is implementing a market diversification strategy.  This aims to attract more visitors from markets which deliver longer stays and, therefore, higher revenue returns.  The significant increase in visitors from North America in early 2017 is evidence of this. <\/p>  <p>  For its part, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also working on a number of fronts to assist the diversification and development of our tourism industry and the attractiveness of our tourism product offering.  Ongoing work to develop the main experience brands and enhance visitor experiences is aimed at boosting our appeal to key target markets and priority consumer segments.  With regard to training and business supports, F&aacute;ilte Ireland offers a suite of supports to enhance the competitiveness, enterprise capability and sustainability of the tourism sector.

526 together.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Child Care Act, 1991 and the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection, including children who are homeless without their parents.  The Agency is obliged to provide care for these children for as long as their welfare requires it.  There is always an underlying reason for a child to be homeless without their parent\/guardian.  Tusla carry out an assessment and will usually receive a child in such circumstances, into care.  Their care plan will address the underlying causes.  In a small number of cases they may provide accommodation and support to a 17 year old.<\/p>  <p>  All children received into care are the subject of an assessment.  While there is no specific plan for LGBT or migrant children received into care, the reasons for their homelessness forms an integral part of their assessment and care plan, through which appropriate services and supports will be identified.  When they leave care at 18 years of age, young people are offered a wide range of services from different sectors including income supports, health supports, accommodation and education.  While the provision of housing is a function of the housing or local authorities, Tusla co-operates with the housing authorities as part of aftercare planning.<\/p>  <p>  In cases where an unaccompanied minor arrives into the country, an assessment is undertaken and the child is either taken into care or provided with accommodation under Section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991.  My Department  has no role in housing for young migrants over the age  of 18, or for members of the LGBT community over the age of 18, unless they qualify as having been previously in care.<\/p>  <p>  At a national level, the Programme for Government committed to developing a LGBT Youth Strategy, and work has already commenced in my Department in this regard.  This is a key commitment for my Department which will a contribution towards the Government&rsquo;s broader commitment to continue to strive for full inclusion of LGBTI+ people in Ireland.  A specific focus on LGBTI+ Youth will aim to ensure that appropriate measures are taken so that young people identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender are not in any way prevented from achieving their full potential. <\/p>  <p>  I also understand that the Department of Justice and Equality will shortly commence work on a national LGBT Inclusion Strategy, a process which will include identifying specific areas of Irish society and policy in which difficulties are still seen as presenting for LGBT people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700089#WRZ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1319,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700089#WRZ00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1320,"qnumday":527,"qnumall":"[29777\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700089#WRZ01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the details and county location of capital projects announced by her Department in March, April, May and to date in June 2017.","asker":"1221","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1321,"content":"<p>The following grants were awarded under the Capital Grants Scheme for Play and Recreation 2017 in the period concerned:<table><tr><th>County \/ Local Authority<\/th><th>Amount <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>&euro;7,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>&euro;7,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork County<\/td><td>&euro;7,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>&euro;5,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City<\/td><td>&euro;14,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown<\/td><td>&euro;14,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway County<\/td><td>&euro;11,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>&euro;15,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>&euro;14,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>&euro;14,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>&euro;14,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>&euro;15,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>&euro;15,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td>&euro;7,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon <\/td><td>&euro;14,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>&euro;14,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Dublin <\/td><td>&euro;14,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>&euro;8,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>&euro;14,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford <\/td><td>&euro;14,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>&euro;13,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total:<\/td><td>&euro;250,000<\/td><\/tr><\/table>No other capital grant announcements have been made by my Department in the period specified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700089#WRZ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":1322,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700089#WRZ01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1323,"qnumday":528,"qnumall":"[29844\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700089#WRZ01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of Civil Service clerical officers in full-time employment in her Department as of 31 May 2017 by county, in tabular form.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff working in youth services and communities throughout the country. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that I have allocated an extra &euro;5.5 million in current funding to support the provision of youth services in 2017.  This will bring the total youth funding by my Department to &euro;57.4 million, an increase of 10% over last year's allocation.  The additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services. <\/p>  <p>  The Local Youth Club Grant Scheme supports youth work activities at a local level.  These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through the local Education and Training Boards.  The scheme is open is open to new entrants and is advertised locally.  Applications for funding are invited by the Education and Training Boards from local groups in their respective areas.  Each year, more than 600 local youth clubs benefit from the scheme.

The Committee had an advisory and consultative role to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in matters to do with youth work, including the coordination of youth work programmes and services.  In line with these provisions, a new National Youth Work Advisory Committee was appointed by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with a term of office of one year with effect from 28 January 2013.  The Committee continued to work with my Department and assisted with the development of the new National Youth Strategy, in particular in identifying in what ways the youth work sector can contribute to shared policy objectives for young people. <\/p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020 was published in, 2015.  The implementation structures established by my Department under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures (BOBF), the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People will oversee the roll out of the National Youth Strategy.  There is no doubt that the youth work services have a significant contribution to make to realise the goals of the National Youth Strategy as part of a cross sectoral, whole of society approach to supporting young people in their everyday lives.  For this reason, the key youth sector interests are represented on the structures established by my Department to support the implementation of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures.  At national level, representatives of the voluntary youth services have been appointed to the Advisory Council of BOBF.  At local level, youth sector representatives participate in the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees.  Key Government departments and agencies that have an interest in children and young people and that had served on the National Youth Work Advisory Committee are represented on the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium and on the Sponsors Group that have been established under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures to drive the effective implementation of the policy framework. <\/p>  <p>  There have been other significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services and the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee since the 2001 Act was passed.  These include the introduction of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 which, inter alia, provides for a statutory function for Education and Training Boards in supporting the provision and assessment of youth work services at local level.  The National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making 2015-2020, which was published by my Department in June, 2015 is particularly relevant.  I am deeply committed to ensuring that young people are involved in the preparation, planning and implementation of policies that impact on their lives. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is fully committed to the reform of the many youth funding schemes. The Deputy will be aware that a number of targeted funding schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review in 2014.  The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead. Work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the review.  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has commenced a review of the Youth Service Grant Scheme. This review is intended to enhance its accountability, transparency and outcome measurement.  It is also seeking to determine how best to meet the ever evolving needs of young people. <\/p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the youth work sector, the voluntary youth services, the Education and Training Boards, other government departments and agencies and consults with young people themselves in the development and delivery of policies and services for children and young people. <\/p>  <p>  For the above reasons, it is not my intention to reconvene the National Youth Work Advisory Committee while the reform process is ongoing. Given the seismic changes which have occurred over the past sixteen years, my Department may wish to revisit the Youth Work Act, 2001 on the conclusion of the reform process, to ensure that it fully articulates the needs of young people in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700089#WRZ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Services","counter":1342,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700089#WRZ03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1343,"qnumday":536,"qnumall":"[30079\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700089#WRZ03300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the average number of young persons assigned to each aftercare worker employed directly by TUSLA; the average number assigned to aftercare workers employed by external agencies; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1344,"content":"<p>My officials have requested the information from Tusla and I will forward the reply to the Deputy once I have been furnished with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700089#WRZ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":1345,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700089#WRZ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1346,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[30084\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700089#WRZ03600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"further to her appointment of a person (details supplied) to investigate the mother and baby home site at Tuam; the role that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has as part of this investigation; if criminal investigations are ongoing or to be opened; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1287","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1347,"content":"<p>I appointed a team of international experts to produce an advisory Report for Government to help inform the decisions which need to be taken in relation to the burial site associated with the former home in Tuam.

We are all keen to see the new system introduced as soon as possible, but the sheer complexity of the project means that it will take some time.  I do not want to introduce the new scheme before all elements &ndash; legislation, IT and business systems &ndash; are fully in place and fully tested.<\/p>  <p>  However, I do not want to delay the benefit of higher childcare subsidies for families.  For that reason, major improvements in childcare subsidies will come into effect this September, within the framework of the existing childcare schemes, pending the introduction of the ACS.  The improvements this September will include increases of up to 50% in targeted childcare subsidy rates.  In addition, the new universal childcare subsidy for children aged between 6 months and 36 months will be available from September, in line with the announcement I made following the Government&rsquo;s Budget decision in October 2016.  The &euro;19 million additional funding provided in Budget 2017 is being directed towards these changes that are being introduced in September, and which will mean significant reductions in childcare bills for tens of thousands of families.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the new measures commencing this September will honour the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering more affordable childcare to families.  Back-payments will not be made.  The level of universal subsidy available this September is the same as that proposed for the ACS subsidy, i.e. a maximum subsidy of &euro;20 per week for full-time childcare, with the subsidy for part-time childcare reduced pro rata.  The levels of targeted subsidy available this September, while not identical to the subsidy-rates that are proposed for the ACS, will be broadly similar to those rates, with some families receiving slightly more and some slightly less than they will receive when the ACS is introduced.  These differences are inevitable given the structure of the existing childcare schemes, which involve only a limited number of subsidy-bands, whereas the ACS will allow a smooth taper to be applied to subsidy-rates.  A further difference in the schemes lies in the basis of eligibility.  Whereas the subsidy-rate awarded under the ACS will be based directly on a family&rsquo;s income-level, the subsidy under the existing schemes is based on family income indirectly, e.g. via eligibility for a Medical Card or GP Visit Card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700089#WRZ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":1352,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700089#WRZ04200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing","counter":1351,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700089#WRZ04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1352,"qnumday":539,"qnumall":"[30119\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700089#WRZ04200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if consideration can be given to the proposal (details supplied) which could alleviate pressure on local council housing supply especially in the case of emergency accommodation requirements; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1268","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1353,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s strategy in relation to housing and homelessness, Rebuilding Ireland, is led by my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Mr Eoghan Murphy T.D and any changes to that strategy would be a matter for him in the first instance. <\/p>  <p>  There is no plan for my Department to introduce a payment for parents supporting their adult children and grandchildren in their own homes.

The scheme was discontinued to new entrants from 1st January 2014.  Customers availing of this support prior to 1st January 2014 have been able to retain entitlement to the scheme up to 1st January 2018.  There are currently approximately 1,700 people in receipt of the scheme, for which Government has provided over &euro;4 million in 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported is through on-going engagement with their lender to explore sustainable solutions.  The payment of this supplement on an indefinite basis does not address the longer term issues for people in serious mortgage arrears.  It is expected that the customers in receipt of this support will continue to exit the scheme through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders; securing employment; or exit strategies such as the Mortgage to Rent Scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments.  As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.  <\/p>  <p>  The role of MABS was expanded in 2015 with the establishment of a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS service (DMA MABS) across the MABS network, to help people specifically with home mortgage arrears.  There are 32 specialist DMA advisors working across 27 locations countrywide, assisting borrowers to assess the options available to them and, where required, negotiating with lenders on their behalf.  To date, the DMA service has helped almost 3,870 such borrowers.  <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, MABS provides a national network of court mentors who attend each listed repossession Court hearing countrywide.  The mentors provide support to distressed borrowers who are facing the loss of their home and signpost them to the appropriate services.  To date, over 1,400 borrowers have been referred onward to MABS advisors through the court mentor service.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2016, a further initiative was announced by Government, known as Abhaile.  This scheme further extends the free services already available to borrowers through the DMA MABS service and the court mentor service.  The new voucher based scheme, for which MABS is the gateway, provides access for people, who are insolvent and in home mortgage arrears, to access independent expert financial and\/or legal advice and assistance, free of charge.  To date, approximately 7,670 vouchers for services have been issued, in respect of over 4,500 principle private residences.  <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700092#WRCC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Free Travel Scheme Data","counter":1478,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700092#WRCC00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1479,"qnumday":583,"qnumall":"[30083\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700092#WRCC00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if her Department keeps an individual record of a person's use of the free travel scheme such as the journeys the person has taken and cost to the State thereof; if so, the purpose of same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1480,"content":"<p>There are currently in excess of 882,000 customers in receipt of free travel.

This is one of the issues I will be considering in the context of the recently announced review of Rebuilding Ireland, one year on from its publication, with an emphasis on building on the progress made, strengthening the measures already in place and identifying new initiatives that add value and raise ambition. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the review process, my Department will focus in particular on the broad issue of housing affordability, building on the measures already being advanced, for example through initiatives to use State lands to deliver mixed-tenure housing.  In this context, my Department intends to consult with local authorities and other key stakeholders in the coming weeks, as part of the broader review process.<\/p>  <p>  At a strategic level, under the new 20-year National Planning Framework, there will be an emphasis on managing and utilising State lands to deliver housing and to ensure an active and healthy market for development land.  In this regard, an important policy intervention in the delivery of new housing supply under Pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland is the development of State-owned lands for mixed-tenure housing, particularly in the major urban areas, where demand is greatest.  On 27 April 2017, details of some 2,000 hectares of land in public ownership were published, with the potential to deliver up to 50,000 homes nationally.  In practical terms, the development of sites such as these will mean accelerating social housing delivery and securing more homes for sale and rent at lower and more affordable price points.<\/p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland also commits to the introduction of an affordable rental scheme to enhance the provision of affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  As set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector, this commitment is now to be progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones.  Lands held by local authorities in such zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, and in particular targeting middle-income households, in mixed-tenure developments.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to cost rental, a range of measures to improve the supply of rental accommodation that meets the needs of ordinary households are being progressed under the Strategy for the Rental Sector including:<\/p>  <p>  -  build to rent models;<\/p>  <p>  -  use of State-owned lands to deliver affordable rental in areas of high demand;<\/p>  <p>  -  measures to increase the supply of dedicated student accommodation to free-up units in the general rental market;<\/p>  <p>  -  supports to bring vacant stock into use;<\/p>  <p>  -  consideration of tax and fiscal incentives to encourage additional supply.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, the Strategy for the Rental Sector noted that the Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to develop a \"cost rental\" option, taking account of work already completed in this area, including by NESC and others.<\/p>  <p>  In line with this commitment, Action 12 of the Strategy for the Rental Sector provides that my Department will lead an expert group to develop a cost rental model for the Irish rental sector, addressing issues such as funding mechanisms, the need to grow the necessary institutional capacity, particularly within the AHB and not for profit sector (whether through mergers, new entrants or strategic partnerships), the households to be targeted and the appropriate regulation mechanisms.  The expert group will assess the benefits that a larger and more developed not-for-profit segment would bring to the rental sector and the housing system, and examine the feasibility and effectiveness of different approaches to achieve the desired change.  A proposal to establish the Expert Group - including membership and terms of reference - is currently being prepared in my Department.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently two house purchase loan offerings available to lower income first-time buyers from local authorities.  The first is a standard annuity mortgage available from all local authorities. A first-time buyer unable to get adequate loan from a building society or a bank, may be eligible for a mortgage from the local authority concerned to purchase a new or second hand property or build their own home in cases where the gross income (before tax) is &euro;50,000 or less for a single income household or &euro;75,000 or less in the case of a double income household.  The loan can be up to 97% of the price of the house subject to a maximum loan of &euro;200,000.  <\/p>  <p>  The second option for first-time buyers unable to secure adequate loan finance from a bank or building society to purchase a new or second-hand property or build their own home is the Home Choice Loan.  Home Choice Loan provides up to 92% of the market value of a property purchased, subject to a maximum loan amount of &euro;285,000. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700092#WRCC04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund","counter":1518,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700092#WRCC04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1519,"qnumday":596,"qnumall":"[29540\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700092#WRCC04700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the requirements for affordable homes in developments in receipt of LIHAF funding; his plans to enforce the &euro;300,000 maximum price in Dublin; if not, the reason for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1520,"content":"<p>The aim of the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) is to relieve critical infrastructural blockages in order to enable the accelerated delivery of housing on key development sites in urban areas with high demand for housing.  These public infrastructure projects will be key to the early delivery of 23,000 housing units over the next four years.  There is further potential for approximately 46,000 additional homes on these 34 sites in the longer term, bringing the projected yield up to 69,000 homes once sites are fully built out.  LIHAF will facilitate additional social housing of 2,300 housing units in the short term through the 10% Part V social housing dividend, with a further potential of 4,600 housing units in the longer term.  Furthermore, a number of the projects, such as those which include lands in local authority ownership, will deliver more than the mandatory levels of social housing under Part V.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of the affordability requirements for developments in receipt of LIHAF funding, it is important to note that the funding under LIHAF goes to the local authorities rather than to individual developers, to enable them to deliver infrastructure, through a normal public procurement process, on sites that were not being developed due to lack of key public infrastructure.  The early delivery of the infrastructure will in turn enhance the ability of the developer to build on the site as the infrastructural blockage has been removed and the developer's viability is improved, particularly where multiple land owners are involved. <\/p>  <p>  In return, the State receives a dividend in the form of accelerated housing supply, land for the infrastructure, and much needed social housing under Part V.  In addition, developers are required to provide increased affordability on site for purchasers of private housing.  On the seven sites where State lands are involved, the local authorities are going to provide additional dividends in the form of either additional social housing, affordable rental housing or housing for the disabled or elderly, depending on the requirements in that particular local authority area.<\/p>  <p>  In seeking to secure improved affordability for the purchaser of private housing, it was initially proposed that a capped price point would be set on a percentage of the housing.  However setting a cap in 2016 for housing that would be developed up to 2021 is problematic and it could adversely impact the viability of the development of some sites, potentially stalling development, with consequential negative impacts on supply, including the Part V social housing element. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, a more proportionate way  to recognise the contribution of LIHAF that will encourage housing supply and also deliver an affordability  dividend has been put in place.  Essentially, two options are available to local authorities in seeking to reach agreements with developers, one which sets a minimum number of houses to be offered at 10% below market cost, including under &euro;300,000 in Dublin, and a second option where a reduction in cost related to the relative contribution of LIHAF to the project could be spread over the housing development as a whole.  The second option means a smaller reduction in price over a greater number of houses, giving more purchasers a potential saving but not affecting the viability of the development and more accurately reflecting the contribution of LIHAF.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has included the requirement for the local authorities to have secured the requisite affordability agreements in a grant agreement and the local authorities which were successful in receiving approval in principle for LIHAF funding in March 2017 are now putting local agreements in place with developers so they can sign up to that grant agreement.  No drawdown of funding can occur until those grant agreements have been signed and it is expected that all the agreements involved will be finalised by the end of July 2017. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700092#WRCC04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Social Housing Provision","counter":1521,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700092#WRCC04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1522,"qnumday":597,"qnumall":"[29541\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700092#WRCC05000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to discuss with the Minister for Finance a change to the mandate of NAMA to include a greater transfer of residential property and building land from NAMA to local authorities in view of the continuing and escalating housing crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1523,"content":"<p>NAMA was established as an independent commercial body to operate under the direction of its Board of Directors, in accordance with the NAMA Act.  Under Section 10 of the NAMA Act, NAMA is mandated to act in a commercial manner to obtain the best financial return for the State.  As such, NAMA's dealings with its debtors, as well as the management, funding and sale of assets are all commercial decisions taken with consideration to NAMA's commercial obligations.  It should be noted that NAMA acquired loans, not property, and control over the property securing its loans rests with its debtors and receivers.  NAMA does not have powers to transfer assets belonging to its debtors and receivers to other parties.  All transactions must be on a commercial and arm&rsquo;s length basis.<\/p>  <p>  Following proactive engagement between NAMA, the Housing Agency and my Department, a process was established to ascertain whether residential properties controlled by NAMA borrowers and receivers are suitable for social housing. <\/p>  <p>  The properties under consideration are part of the security for loans that NAMA has acquired.  In the majority of cases, properties remain in the ownership of the original borrowers.  The remaining properties are controlled by receivers appointed by NAMA.  Once a demand has been identified, NAMA makes contact with the relevant property owner\/receiver to determine if the properties are still available and to discuss how these properties can be best utilised. <\/p>  <p>  Properties that are deemed suitable may be leased or purchased by local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (housing associations and co-operatives) through engagement with the property owners or, on their behalf, appointed insolvency practitioners, facilitated by NAMA.  This is a continuous process and additional properties have been added and offered as they become available over the last number of years.  To end March 2017, 2,390 properties have been secured for social housing under this initiative.  A further 390 properties are at Terms Agreed\/Active Negotiation\/Pre-Appraisal stages.  While NAMA is consistently mindful of identifying properties which may be suitable for social housing, the pool of such properties is reducing in line with the reduction in the NAMA loan portfolio and at this stage it is unlikely that significant numbers of additional properties will be identified.  However, the Steering Group remains active and will continue to work through any potential units that may become available.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this Social Housing initiative, NAMA is making a very substantial contribution, on a commercial basis, to the increased supply of new homes through its residential delivery programme.  Against the background of major supply shortage in urban areas, NAMA has undertaken to fund, if commercially viable, the delivery of up to 20,000 residential units by 2020.  Residential developments funded by NAMA are subject to the same planning and regulatory requirements as all other developments.  This includes policies relating to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and as such, it is expected that a minimum of 10% of the anticipated output of this investment by NAMA, or about 2,000 units, will become available for social housing through this statutory mechanism over this period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700092#WRCC05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Persons Data","counter":1524,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700092#WRCC05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1525,"qnumday":598,"qnumall":"[29559\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700092#WRCC05300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of persons being housed in hotel rooms as emergency accommodation; and the progress made to bring to an end the use of hotels for emergency accommodation.","asker":"1259","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1526,"content":"<p>As of the end of April 2017, there were 695 homeless families in Dublin being accommodated in commercial hotels and B&amp;Bs.

Examples of such infrastructure and facilities include roads, footpaths, public lighting, open spaces etc. <\/p>  <p>  The basis for the determination of a development contribution is set out in a development contribution scheme adopted by the elected members of a local authority, and planning authorities may make one or more schemes in respect of different parts of its functional area.  In addition to the terms of the scheme, planning authorities may require the payment of a special contribution in respect of a particular development where specific exceptional costs not covered by a scheme are incurred by any local authority in respect of public infrastructure and facilities which benefit the proposed development.  The adoption of these schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority, and it is a matter for the members to determine - (i) the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply, and (ii) the expenditure of the contributions received within the confines of the scheme conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Development contributions can only be levied in respect of capital funding for public infrastructure and facilities and as such cannot be used to cover current expenditure costs.  Any development contributions accruing to the local authority under the provisions must be accounted for separately in the Capital account of the local authority.

Arising from the Government&rsquo;s effort to meet commitments in relation to the General Government Deficit limit, local authorities have been directed that, similar to the revenue account activity, capital expenditure should not exceed capital income within the reporting year.  The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities themselves.  However, within these overall limits, there is additional capacity for the expenditure of built-up capital balances and own resources funded by development contributions on hand by local authorities, which must be sanctioned by my Department.  In reviewing requests for sanction, consideration is given to ensuring that priority infrastructural investment can proceed, that contractual commitments and on-going projects can proceed and that development contributions already collected and aligned to specific capital projects can be utilised efficiently. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700093#WRDD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Data","counter":1537,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700093#WRDD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1538,"qnumday":602,"qnumall":"[29634\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700093#WRDD00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of second-hand dwellings purchased by all local authorities in the past three years to date by local authority and dwelling type; the amount spent per annum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1539,"content":"<p>Under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Investment Programme, funding is available to all local authorities, to deliver additional social housing stock through both new construction projects and through the acquisition of new and previously owned houses\/apartments. <\/p><p>Details on the number of properties purchased by all local authorities for letting to those on their social housing waiting lists are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<i><\/i>. <\/p><p>Information on quarter four of 2016 is currently being finalised and will be published shortly, with information on quarter one 2017 to follow thereafter.

An agreement was reached in March 2015, which resulted in the responsibility for support to Travellers and Roma groups becoming a key function of the DJE through the permanent transfer of some &euro;1.375 million to that Department.  <\/p><p>My Department also supports a number of Traveller projects under the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO).

SICAP is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State and is delivered locally by 46 Programme Implementers.  Its aim is to tackle poverty, social exclusion and long-term unemployment through local engagement and partnership between disadvantaged individuals, community organisations, public sector agencies and other stakeholders. The principles, approaches and mechanisms of the programme aim to offer local areas significant ability to tackle a very wide range of issues.  The SICAP target groups account for those most vulnerable in our communities and include Travellers.  <\/p><p>The SICAP funding allocations for front-line delivery for 2015, 2016 and 2017 nationally were &euro;28m, &euro;37.5m and &euro;37.5m, respectively.  Travellers are a specified target group of SICAP and benefit from a range of activities and supports under the programme.  SICAP Programme Implementers are required to report financial information at action level under each of the 3 programme goals.  As actions relate to work with more than one target group, it is not possible to provide a financial breakdown for a specific target group. <\/p><p>SICAP Programme Implementers ensure that Traveller participants availing of SICAP supports are made aware of the opportunities for local self-employment (which may include social entrepreneurship) and, where appropriate, receive training to enhance their skills to take up these opportunities.

Inspection and enforcement and\u00a0the maintenance of relevant registers are a matter for\u00a0\u00a0local authorities who, under the relevant legislation, are designated as Building Control and Fire Authorities in their respective functional areas and have extensive statutory powers of inspection and enforcement.  Section 8(4) of the Building Control Act 1990 provides that a Building Control Authority may serve an Enforcement Notice requiring that such steps as are necessary to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations, including Part B &ndash; Fire Safety, be taken within a specified period.  An Enforcement Notice may be served at any time up to five years from the completion of the Building Works.  Under the Building Control Regulations, Building Control Authorities are required to maintain a\u00a0register of any enforcement notices served by them, including brief particulars of the contents of the notice, which must be made available for public inspection.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Fire Services Acts of 1981 and 2003 local authorities are designated as fire authorities in their respective functional areas and have extensive statutory powers of inspection and enforcement.  Section 20 of the Act provides that the appropriate fire authority may serve a Fire Safety Notice on the owner or occupier of any building which appears to the authority to be a potentially dangerous building.  Section 20 of the Act provides that a Fire Safety Notice in relation to a building may prohibit the use of the building, or a specified part of the building, unless or until specified precautions are taken to the satisfaction of the fire authority.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the tragic\u00a0fire in Grenfell Tower, the immediate focus of attention has been on life safety issues.  In that context, I\u00a0requested that each local authority, as a matter of urgency, review their multi-storey social housing units to ensure that all early warning systems, including alarm and detection systems and means of escape including corridors, stairways and emergency exits are in place and fully functional.<\/p>  <p>  In order to raise awareness amongst private landlords, including landlords of households in receipt of social housing supports and rental assistance, the Residential Tenancies Board has been asked to\u00a0remind all landlords of their statutory responsibilities and obligations as landlords to ensure that their properties fully comply with fire safety requirements.  The RTB placed a notice to this effect on its website and will be writing\u00a0 individually to all registered landlords providing detailed information in the coming days.<\/p>  <p>  A Building Control Management System (BCMS) alert was issued to all\u00a0registered users of the BCMS to remind those involved in works to existing\u00a0or new buildings of the need to remain vigilant in relation to compliance\u00a0with the Building Regulations and in particular to Part B Fire Safety.  It\u00a0was issued to 57,000 registered users including builders, assigned\u00a0certifiers, designers and owners.<\/p>  <p>  I also met\u00a0with Dublin&rsquo;s Chief Fire Officer to discuss fire safety and life safety issues in light of the London tragedy.  I also requested that the management board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) convene and assess the readiness of the fire authorities to respond to emergencies.  In response to this request, the NDFEM Board has confirmed to me that the recent report of the Directorate&rsquo;s External Validation group found that the public are well served by the developed arrangements in place for fire services in Ireland, and concluded that the available evidence provides for confidence regarding the capability of fire services to respond to emergencies.  A further meeting with all of the national Chief Fire Officers will be convened shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Part D of the Building Regulations set out the requirements for the use of proper products and materials.  For claddings, such as may have been used in Grenfell Tower, third party certification, for example Agr&eacute;ment Certification is a means of demonstrating how they can meet the requirements of the Building Regulations.  These certificates provide guidance on the installation, suitability for use and the fire performance of the cladding, among other issues.<\/p>  <p>  While we\u00a0 await the report and conclusions of the promised statutory public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire, the United Kingdom Department of Communities and Local Government has confirmed that cladding using a composite aluminium panel with a polyethylene core would be non-compliant with current Building Regulations guidance as this material should not be used as cladding on buildings over 18m in height.  I can confirm that the same restrictions apply under Irish Building Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  I have\u00a0 tasked the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management with co-ordinating\u00a0a high-level Task Force to lead Ireland&rsquo;s re-appraisal of fire safety in the wake of the\u00a0 Grenfell Tower fire.  The\u00a0 further issues to be considered, in addition to those outlined above,\u00a0include:\u00a0<\/p>  <p> - The preliminary survey of the use of cladding products on residential buildings over 18m (6 storeys) being undertaken by fire services in Dublin is to be extended to the rest of the country and to cover buildings in all categories over 18m in height.  The results to be reported to\u00a0my Department by 19 July.<\/p>  <p> - My\u00a0Department is to meet with the local authority Chief Fire Officers in the coming weeks to review current activities and to plan for further fire safety initiatives in prioritised areas of action.<\/p>  <p> - Responsibility for fire safety in buildings of all kinds (other than dwellings) is placed by Section 18 (2) of the Fire Services Act 1981 on the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; of each building.  In order to assist those in both the public and private sector who hold this responsibility, consideration is being given to the publication of a guide on \u00a0undertaking Fire Safety Assessments as provided for in Section 18 (6)(a) of the Act.  This will facilitate persons having control of buildings to demonstrate that they are complying with their statutory responsibilities.<\/p>  <p> - I will be updating my\u00a0\u00a0Cabinet colleagues on the post Grenfell Tower\u00a0fire situation and highlighting the implications of fire safety responsibilities in buildings across all sectors, both public and private.<\/p>  <p> - A renewed focus is to be placed on the preparations of local authorities, working with the Principal Response Agencies and others, for large scale evacuation and operation of rest centres under the aegis of the Framework for Major Emergency Management.<\/p>  <p>- I will consider all issues emerging, including regulatory arrangements, in line with developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700094#WREE01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"question","counter":1599,"qnumday":625,"qnumall":"[29931\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700094#WREE01800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will arrange to have a full fire inspection carried out at a location (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1600,"content":"<p>Fire Services are a local government service and responsibility for statutory fire prevention and building control functions rests with the relevant local authority.

655 and 656 together. <\/p>  <p>  Primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence (2015) is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. <\/p>  <p>  The security environment is kept under constant review including the threat from international terrorism.  On-going coordination and liaison meetings take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, based on on-going threat assessments, the Garda&iacute; and the Defence Forces liaise with regard to possible Defence Forces supports required for a range of contingencies.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can request a broad range of supports from the Defence Forces including the Army Ranger Wing and in this context the Army Ranger Wing are trained and equipped to undertake a range of specialist roles. <\/p>  <p>  Details with regard to the precise training of the ARW are not released into the public domain for security and operational reasons. <\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence sets out the capability agenda for the Defence Forces for the next decade.  It contains a commitment to further enhance the capabilities of the ARW.  Work to identify a range of options in this regard is ongoing as part of the implementation of the White Paper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062700095#WRFF04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"}]
