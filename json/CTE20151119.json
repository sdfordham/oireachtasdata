Agreed.  Are there any matters arising from the minutes?  There are no matters arising.  The next item is correspondence received since our meeting on Thursday 12 November 2015.  Correspondence was received from accounting officers and or Ministers.  Correspondence received from the HSE dated 11 November 2015 is a follow-up from our meeting on 22 October 2015 and it is to be noted and published.  Correspondence was received from NAMA dated 11 November 2015 and is a follow-up to correspondence we received from representatives of families of 1916 regarding Moore Street.  This is to be noted, published and also circulated to Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan.  Correspondence, dated 11 November 2015 was received from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General, Department of Health.  This is a follow-up to the Committee of Public Accounts meeting with the HSE on 22 October 2015 and is to be noted and published.<\/p> <p>  Correspondence, dated 13 November 2015, received from Mr. Aidan O&rsquo;Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine refers to the special investigations unit, SIU.  This correspondence is to be noted and published.  I draw members' attention to this correspondence because this is the third letter the committee has received from the Secretary General since his appearance before the committee on the 18 June 2015, which is five months ago.  Mr. O'Driscoll has still not answered the committee's queries in respect of the more serious case of Mr. Douglas Fannin, to which I will return later.  The letter is a stout defence of the activities of the SIU and the committee could expect no less from a Secretary General.  However, there is a complete denial of the heavy-handed tactics which led to people being manhandled or treated without dignity.  Anyone who suggests that the SIU operates outside the codes of conduct for civil servants are simply saying that these things are untrue.  The committee met privately last May with seven individuals and listened to what they had to say.  All but one had seen at first hand the work of the SIU.  Some have had their livelihood's ruined as a result of huge legal bills which were run up in order to defend themselves.  Some were simply appalled at the behaviour of State employees.  The Department tells a different story and has rejected all of what was said by the individuals who have come before this committee.  It would appear that the Department is saying that these individuals have lied to the committee.  The truth is probably somewhere in between.<\/p> <p>  I will make one further point regarding the Committee of Public Accounts.  The committee is not advocating on behalf of anyone else here, that is not the job of the PAC, but to be fair to the seven individuals, only one of them has been in contact with the committee since. The others told their stories but did not ask that the committee would act on their behalf.  They were disturbed by their experience and they reported to us.  Some of their reports tally with what members hear in their constituencies.  It is right that a citizen can contact a public accounts committee to enable the PAC to question Departments about the ways in which they conduct business.  This is part of the job for the PAC and for the Oireachtas committee which has an oversight function.  Department officials are answerable, through their Ministers and through their Accounting Officers, to these committees.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Douglas Fannin has been in contact with some members of this committee and with the secretariat.  Mr. Fannin was prosecuted by the Department and the case against him was dismissed.  His integrity was exonerated two years ago by Judge Reynolds.  Since then Mr. Fannin has continued his fight for justice and it is in desperation that he has turned to this committee.  He should not have had to do that in the first place. The Department appears to be reluctant to recognise Mr. Fannin's innocence.  I understand that the Department has not engaged with Mr. Fannin and that he is owed money for cattle that were taken from his farm and slaughtered and which were then allowed to enter the food chain.  Given the outcome of the case, and out of respect for Judge Reynolds, Mr. Fannin should be paid for his losses.  Is it right that Mr. Fannin has to go the civil route to seek justice?  We know that going the legal route is extremely costly and the Department will know that Mr. Fannin may not have the financial muscle to take on the Department again.<\/p> <p>  Last week the issue was raised of a Department official apologising to the Judiciary for remarks made at this committee.  What the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine continues to do to Mr. Douglas Fannin, in ignoring the decision of Judge Reynolds, is far more serious.  The committee is coming towards the end of its term so it may not be able to fully follow up on this matter.  There is a need to find a resolution to the issues arising from the Fannin case so that Mr. Fannin can try to get on with his life.  The Department should engage with Mr. Fannin to seek a resolution, if necessary with the help of an independent third party.  This is the least that is owed to Mr. Fannin.  The committee awaits Mr. O'Driscoll's next letter but this matter is so serious that, in the light of the remarks made by Judge Reynolds and by this committee, the case should be highlighted again and the Department be asked to take note of what is being said.<\/p> <p>  Item No. 3A.5 is correspondence dated 13 November 2015 received from Mr. John Pollock, project director, National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  It is a follow up to a PAC meeting on 8 October 2015 and it will be noted.  As there is an inspector's report from An Bord Plean&aacute;la the committee should seek a note on the contents of that report and the committee could consider the issue again next week.  I ask that Deputy Joe Costello make that contact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015111900002#B00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1447927200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I have raised this issue before with regard to the National Paediatric Hospital.  It is one of the three major projects in my own constituency that incurred enormous expense of State money which was not recoverable.  One project was Thornton Hall which incurred &euro;50 million of costs and the other was the Docklands which incurred costs of &euro;52 million and that report has been published.  The third project was the National Paediatric Hospital which incurred costs of &euro;30.5 million.  Having read the inspector's report there are clearly some very serious issues around the deviation from and the disregard for the statutory Dublin City Development Plan and the Local Area Plan.  The inspector found that these plans had been breached and the inspector would effectively have no choice or alternative but to find against the planning application that was put before the planning authority.  That opinion was upheld by the senior planner.  These are very serious matters and the end result of this was that the children's hospital that should have been built by now, and which was to be a landmark building marking 1916 and how the Proclamation cherishes children of the nation equally, has still not had a sod turned on it.  We have a new location and the planning process is currently in train but we do not know how that is going to eventually work out.  The process and costs so far raise very serious matters for public concern.  We should have a full-scale report to look at all of the related elements and all the circumstances that gave rise to this debacle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015111900002#B00300","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1447927200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The committee will set it out in context and report for the next meeting.

Correspondence dated 11 November 2015 was received from the HSE, which is a follow-up from our meeting on 22 October 2015.  It relates to a payment to a bed and breakfast accommodation.  It is noted that I raised this with the HSE and I wish to reject their response entirely.  I could have obtained that information myself from the HSE.  I had asked for the situation to be investigated, not that the HSE was to report what it deemed to be the facts of the case.  The HSE has not addressed the matter.  The function of the Committee for Public Accounts is to obtain further information but in reality this correspondence is just a report on what happened; it does not address or investigate the case.  I reject the HSE's response to this committee and I intend to raise this again with the HSE.<\/p> <p>  The next item of individual correspondence was received from Ms Mary Farrell, dated 10 November 2015.  It regards the Report on the Wards of Court.  It is to be noted and the committee still awaits a reply to our report.

I believe that Ms Mary Farrell and the families were expecting that this matter might be addressed in that legislation.  From speaking with the Minister, I understand that it is not the appropriate legislation with which to address the matter of wards of court because the intent and purpose of this legislation is to discontinue the wards of court mechanism.  However, this underlines the need to have an independent review and to have the Comptroller and Auditor General conduct an audit.<\/p> <p>  Once the legislation is through then we would be entering into another round of dispensation, so I think there should be a sense of urgency with this matter to have it dealt with as quickly as possible.  People are in exposed situations regarding the investment process that took place, how it is going to operate and how the legislation is not retrospective.

I also draw attention to a chapter on the management of redundancy and insolvency scheme debts.  These are payments that emanate from the Social Insurance Fund and there are liabilities that could be collected.  I have a report on that.

As a result of the number of items on the schedule today, I propose to outline very briefly the results of the four 2014 appropriation accounts before summarising the key points of the four reports.  I should say at the outset that I have issued clear audit opinions for each of the accounts.<\/p> <p>  On Vote 11, the 2014 appropriation account for the Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform records gross expenditure totalling &euro;36.8 million divided across two programme areas.  The programme of activities relating to public service management and reform accounted for 54% of the expenditure, while the programme comprehending the management of the system of public expenditure accounted for 46%.  At the end of the year, the Department had underspent by &euro;3.8 million, or just under 10% of its gross Estimate provision.  That amount was accordingly liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  Vote 12 presents the expenditure on Civil Service and prison officer pensions.  Pension payments for other public servants are charged to other votes, including those for education, the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Army pensions.  The gross spend on Vote 12 in 2014 amounted to &euro;474 million, which was up 10.8% compared with 2013.  Appropriations-in-aid, mainly arising from employee pension contributions, amounted to &euro;105 million in 2014, which represented a year-on-year increase of almost 18%.  A Supplementary Estimate amounting to a net &euro;22.25 million was provided for the Vote in 2014.  At the end of the year, a surplus of &euro;16 million was liable for surrender.  The Department of Finance administers the pension payments charged to Vote 12.  The associated administration costs are borne in Vote 7 - Office of the Minister for Finance.  Costs of policy formulation relating to public service pensions are borne in Vote 11 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The absence of administration costs is reflected in the format of the appropriation account for Vote 12.<\/p><p>The 2014 appropriation account for shared services records gross expenditure totalling &euro;23.2 million.  This mainly comprises &euro;13.2 million spent on activities related to PeoplePoint which handles HR activities centrally; &euro;7.6 million spent on payroll shared services; and &euro;1.6 million on other shared services projects, including a shared financial management system project.  Vote expenditure in the year was significantly less than provided for in the Estimate mainly because of delays in recruitment and progressing projects.  Overall, there was a net underspend of &euro;10.3 million or approximately one third relative to the Estimate.<\/p><p> Vote 41, Office of Government Procurement, was a new Vote in 2014.  On its establishment, the office took over the activities of the former National Procurement Service in the OPW and those of the former national public procurement policy unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Vote Estimate provided for gross expenditure by the Office of Government Procurement totalling &euro;12.8 million in 2014.  The outturn was &euro;6.4 million.  After a deferred surrender of &euro;125,000, the amount due for surrender was &euro;6.1 million.  Note 3 explains that the underspend in the year arose from slower than anticipated recruitment of staff, with knock-on effects in other areas of planned expenditure, including certain planned projects.<\/p><p> Turning to the chapters, Chapter 4 is a standard report that aims to consolidate and summarise Vote expenditure for 2014 and to demonstrate medium to long-term trends.  Gross voted expenditure across all Votes in 2014 was &euro;46 billion.  This represents a cumulative reduction of almost 13% since 2010.  The report also compares net Vote expenditure with the original budget allocations and identifies those that were granted additional funding by way of Supplementary Estimates.  Figure 4.5 in the chapter indicates that three Votes each required Supplementary Estimates every year from 2010 to 2014, inclusive.  They were the Votes for the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Army pensions.  There were Supplementary Estimates for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in each of the last three years.<\/p><p> In 2014 grant funding issued from Votes amounted to a total of over &euro;11 billion.  Chapter 5 describes significant changes made by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the framework for the control and management of such grant funding.  Previous reports from my office and the committee identified certain weaknesses in these arrangements.  In particular, the special report on the national health and local authority levy fund made a number of recommendations for improvements in grant control and accountability arrangements.  The revised control framework was set out in Department Circular 13\/2014 and took effect from January 2015.  The revised arrangements introduce a number of additional requirements for both funding bodies and those in receipt of grant funds. These measures should increase the transparency and accountability arrangements for grants and address the identified weaknesses.  Meeting the new or extended requirements may present a significant challenge to both funding bodies and grant recipient bodies.  The exercise of judgment will be required to ensure the requirements are applied in a proportionate way, taking account of the size and capacity of the grant recipient and the scale of the grant involved.  Compliance with the new requirements will be examined during the course of the 2015 audits of Departments and agencies.<\/p><p> Chapter 6 is a technical report, prepared to meet a specific requirement of the CSO for audited accrual-based payroll information for national accounts purposes.  Members will be aware that appropriation accounts are prepared on a cash basis and record transactions when payment is made or income is received.  Accordingly, public service staff pay costs and payments to pensioners are recognised in the appropriation accounts at the point of payment.  Payments are made either weekly, fortnightly or monthly, as appropriate, and normally in arrears.  Most years there are 26 fortnightly payroll runs and 52 weekly runs.  However, because the number of days covered by pay periods does not exactly match the number of days in the calendar year, an accrual element builds up over time.  There is an additional pay period every ten to 11 years for fortnightly paid staff and every five to six years for weekly paid staff.  This results in spikes in pay expenditure in the appropriation accounts in years when there are extra pay days.  I should perhaps point out, to allay concerns, that no one receives any extra pay beyond his or her annual salary as a result.  This is purely an accounting and a timing issue.<\/p><p> Payroll accrual information submitted by Departments with the appropriation account was audited as part of the statutory audit of the accounts.  By agreement with the Department, we have presented the information in the annex to this report in the format specified by the CSO.  The table also includes information on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission which does not have a Vote.  Although the Commission is funded directly from the Exchequer, it prepares its financial statements in the appropriation account format used for voted expenditure.<\/p><p> Chapter 7 was undertaken in the light of the significant changes implemented as a result of the National Lottery Act 2013.  It aims to outline the process used to distribute the proceeds of the national lottery among the good causes specified in the Act.  It also explains how the application of the funding is accounted for in the appropriation accounts.  Annex 1 of the report summaries the funds flow.  Exchequer funds totalling &euro;217 million were provided to fund a range of designated national lottery supported programmes that fitted within the \"good causes\" categories.  The finance accounts show that a total of &euro;178 million was paid from the national lottery fund to the Exchequer in 2014.  For 2014, we can, therefore, establish that the national lottery provided 82% of the funding applied across national lottery supported programmes.  However, because national lottery funding is not formally allocated on a subhead or programme basis, the percentage national lottery funding level cannot be identified at a programme level.<\/p><p> The report also outlines the receipt into the Exchequer in 2014 of a licence fee totalling &euro;405 million for the operation of the national lottery over a 20 year period, following a competitive tendering process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015111900002#D03900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447927200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Watt, please, make his opening statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015111900002#E00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1447927200,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for giving me the opportunity to make a short opening statement.  I propose to set out the Department's strategic objectives and our performance in meeting these objectives in the past few years.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has two broad strategic objectives: to support economic and social progress by managing public expenditure on a long-term, sustainable basis; and to introduce and support reform of the civil and public service, ensuring public administration and governance structures are citizen-focused, efficient and cost-effective.  Linking these two objectives is an overarching focus on value for money for the taxpayer.  Achieving value for money in how public services are delivered is central to the work of the Department and a key concern for the committee.<\/p> <p>  The Department's key function, since it was established, has been the control of public expenditure.  As the committee will be aware, Ireland has met its deficit target in each of the years since the Department's inception and we are on track to do so again this year.  We have sought to do so by shifting resources to where they are needed most and protect the most vulnerable in society.  Much of our capacity to do this has arisen directly from the sacrifices made by public servants in their terms of employment.<\/p> <p>  As we return to more normal times, our function will not be to determine the level of spending other than to advise the Government on what we believe is appropriate but to ensure broad budgetary targets are met and that expenditure delivers the best possible value for money for the taxpayer.  Many of the reforms we have put in place during the recession years will continue to bear fruit as the economy continues to grow.  What are these reforms?  First, we are seeking to remove the duplication of services and apply common standards.  The provision of HR functionality by a myriad of Departments is more expensive and feeds into the silo-driven nature of government.  Shared services is an obvious example of our response to this challenge, as are public service-wide pay agreements, sick leave and annual leave reform and the single pension scheme.  The Civil Service Management Board and the Accountability Board are deliberate attempts to break down a culture that has evolved over many years.  One of its first tasks will be to see how Departments co-operate better on shared tasks.  This is ultimately not only about costs, although that is important, but also about improving the range of data available to the Government to enable it to make more effective decisions.<\/p> <p>  Second, we are seeking to encourage the development of policy-making on a more open and considered basis.  Examples on which I will touch include more measurement of outcomes, more varied commissioning models, more use of specialists, an aggressive attitude to open data and reform of the budgetary process.  Similarly, we are trying to broaden recruitment channels into the civil and public service.<\/p> <p>  We have enacted a series of Bills aimed at opening up our system.  Freedom of information legislation has been restored and is being used more extensively.  In the next year we will see the first impacts of the lobbying legislation.<\/p><p>The banking inquiry is operating under the terms of the Oireachtas inquiries Act.  The Ombudsman has increased powers and is set to see his powers extended further into the health arenas.  Whistleblowers now have a common framework under which to report and public bodies have been offered standardised procedures on how to proceed.  While we have come a long way, the Department recognises that we have further to go.<\/p><p> Finally, and I think this is important, we are opposed to inertia.  Through our reform and delivery office we act as the prodders of reform in other Departments and across the system.  Our system has been under extreme pressure in recent years.  In the private sector, activity slows when recession hits while in the public sector demand increases.  I think in time our response to the crisis will be seen to have been particularly effective but it has undoubtedly been difficult to endure.  We cannot go back to the old ways of doing things and must continue to innovate, change and reform.  These tasks will become particularly challenging as we exit the excessive deficit arm of the Stability and Growth Pact and move to the preventative arm in 2016.<\/p><p> I stress for the committee the broad budgetary context we have experienced in recent years as it is the appropriate backdrop to discuss the reforms we have introduced.  In 2014, gross voted expenditure was &euro;54 billion.  This is a reduction of more than &euro;9 billion from the peak in 2009.  Current expenditure over the period was reduced by almost 10% and capital expenditure was reduced by half.  By identifying savings, driving efficiencies and working with Departments to better manage their cost bases, the Department has made a very significant contribution to the improved fiscal environment and enhanced value for money.<\/p><p> One source of significant Exchequer savings was in the area of public sector pay.  As a result of financial emergency legislation, savings in the public sector pay and pensions bill amounted to &euro;2.2 billion annually.  Ms Oonagh Buckley, who is in attendance, was very involved in cutting the pay of her colleagues.  She is very popular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015111900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447927200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>She is very popular with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015111900002#F00200","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1447927200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Ms Buckley's team has been involved in a series of reforms over the period.  This year, the Government decided to begin to unwind some of these measures under the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The agreement will provide for a continuation of enhanced productivity measures while securing an industrial relations framework that will foster and support industrial peace.  Other reforms worth mentioning include the new public service sick leave scheme introduced to reduce the cost and incidence of sick leave for the public service.  I know the committee debated the scheme previously.  The scheme has had an immediate and positive impact.  Approximately 260,000 extra days were worked by public servants in 2014 in comparison with 2013, saving an estimated &euro;51.5 million.  We hope to see further savings from the implementation of the scheme over the next few years.<br\/><br\/>Between 2008 and the end of 2014, the number of staff working in the public service was reduced by 10%.  As a result our success on expenditure consolidation and driving public service reforms, we can now consider on a strategic basis the allocation of extra staff to critical public services.  Since 2014, there has been increased staffing in the following areas.  We have appointed an additional 3,000 teachers and more than 1,300 new special needs assistants.  The HSE has hired 1,000 nurses and there will be an increase in the number of garda&iacute;<b>.  <\/b>Without public service reform and the savings it produced, including those underpinned by agreements negotiated with staff, it would have been impossible to increase staff levels in these critical areas.<br\/><br\/>The Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has introduced a number of significant reforms to ensure taxpayer money is allocated to the maximum benefit of society.  The wide-ranging reforms to the budgetary architecture support the efficient use of public funds to deliver effective services for citizens.  The implementation of a medium-term budgetary framework and the introduction of comprehensive reviews of public expenditure allow for greater debate about key expenditure challenges.  The revised public spending code, which sets out the economic appraisal requirements for new current and capital expenditure proposals, brings together in one place all the elements of the value for money framework.  Departments and agencies proposing expenditure are responsible for undertaking the required appraisal for each new spending proposal or project.  The public spending code provides that appraisals and detailed assessments should be carried out before Exchequer resources are committed.  In July 2015, the Government agreed a new three-year value for money review programme for each Department.  Under the programme, Departments will review expenditure across a number of programme areas.  This programme, which is reviewing 40 topics, is aligned with the multi-annual budgetary cycle and the comprehensive review of expenditure process.<br\/><br\/>The Oireachtas and its committees play a central role in overseeing expenditure of State resources.  Last week the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission launched an OECD report, Review of Budget Oversight by Parliament: Ireland.  The report takes account of the parliamentary and budgetary environment within which we all operate.  Its recommendations have the potential to engender more meaningful and constructive dialogue around the efficient and effective use of public resources and the role of the Oireachtas in overseeing these issues.  This is a key concern of this committee.  While the OECD's report is of course a matter for the Oireachtas and the Executive, the Civil Service is ready to assist in any way we can in augmenting Oireachtas oversight of the Irish budgetary process.<br\/><br\/>Of critical importance to implementing budgetary and expenditure management reform is building the institutional capacity to do so.  Our Department has been enhancing capability within the public service and Civil Service to appraise, evaluate and monitor public expenditure effectively, ensuring the focus remains on value for money.  Of particular note is the establishment of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES.  IGEES is an integrated cross-Government service which enhances the role of economics and value for money analysis in public policy-making.  IGEES members have a particular skill set which has improved the analytical capacity of the Civil Service.  They operate in designated economic evaluation units and engage widely with other Departments.  Their expertise further strengthens the focus on evidence-based policy-making within the public service.<br\/><br\/>The effective use of data is also critical to a more integrated and efficient public service.  The publication of official non-personal data in open format has the potential for significant economic, social and political impact.  Our open data initiative aims to enhance the value and utility of public service data.  Such data can be shared within and between public bodies and with the public as a whole.  Open data can become the raw material to drive more effective decision-making and efficient service delivery within public and private bodies.  It can spur economic activity in the development of new products and services and empower citizens to take an active role in improving their communities.  This is an area where we will strive to do more over the next few years.  It has enormous potential to improve the operation of the system.<br\/><br\/>A better trained, more integrated and more effective Civil Service will support better delivery of services and a better return to the taxpayer.  Published in October 2014, the Civil Service renewal plan sets out a vision and three-year action plan to achieve it.  It outlines practical actions that will create a more unified, professional, responsive and accountable Civil Service.  Since its publication, significant progress has been made.  An accountability board has been established to oversee Civil Service performance and develop a better framework for holding senior civil servants to account for performance.  A Civil Service management board has been established to create a more integrated and cohesive whole-of-Government executive management team.  It is a great surprise that before now senior leaders across the Civil Service did not meet regularly to consider the strategic and delivery issues faced by the system.  There is now a performance review process for Secretaries General to ensure high standards are maintained.  Open recruitment campaigns have been held for positions across different grades for the first time.  This will ensure there is a consistent stream of talented professionals with different backgrounds, experiences and capacities entering the Civil Service at every level.  The new structures are helping to strengthen accountability and performance by introducing greater oversight of delivery across the Civil Service.<br\/><br\/>Progress has also being made in other actions in the plan.  This week we published a corporate governance standard for the Civil Service.  This is the first time that such a standard has been produced.  It will set out how each Department and office does its work and operates to deliver on its mandate and functions.  To bring greater individual accountability, we will also ensure the statutory official assignment of responsibilities in each Department down to the level of principal officer are publicly available.  Effective leadership is crucial to deliver Civil Service and public service reform.  The senior public service has been established, initially within the Civil Service, to support high performance and a more integrated approach to leadership development at senior levels.  It supports executive coaching and provides for mobility at senior levels in the Civil Service.<br\/><br\/>Shared services is one of the largest cross-cutting change programme the Civil Service has ever introduced.  The national shared services office, NSSO, in our Department is responsible for establishing and providing shared services to the Civil Service and, as part of its wider leadership role, for setting standards for shared services in other public service sectors.  Earlier this year, the Government approved the drafting of a Bill to establish the NSSO as a separate Civil Service office.  Work on the Bill is being advanced with the Office of the Attorney General.  I thank Ms Hilary Murphy Fagan and all her staff for their hard work in bringing this about.<br\/><br\/>Established in March 2013, PeoplePoint provides HR and pensions administration services for 35 organisations with approximately 30,000 employees.  By the end of next year, it will be fully established and serve 33,500 employees across 40 departments.  The payroll shared service centre is in three locations and administers payroll for 34 organisations and 43,000 employees and pensioners.<\/p><p>This will rise to 80,000 by the end of this year.  In addition, the evaluation of tenders for a single financial management solution for the Civil Service is now nearing completion, and we expect to return to the Government shortly to proceed to implementation.  Strong oversight and governance frameworks exist to oversee and monitor the performance of these centres against service level targets and customer satisfaction.  Cost savings and significant improvements in service delivery in PeoplePoint have been made throughout this year and we are striving to improve service delivery for all our clients.<\/p><p> ICT has a critical and increasing role in delivering better public services.  Earlier this year, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer published the new public service ICT strategy.  The strategy will create a new model for ICT delivery.  The central aim of the strategy is to deliver better value for money by creating efficiencies through integration, consolidation and data sharing.  The strategy will ensure ICT infrastructure and systems are shared across the Civil Service and public service, achieving greater efficiencies in the use of resources.<\/p><p> Progress has also continued on introducing more external delivery of services.  Examples include the use of private call centres for administration of the water conservation grant and local property tax.  These contracts leverage private sector expertise and innovation to deliver cost savings and better services for citizens.  JobPath, the new employment activation programme, also uses private sector expertise to assist the long-term unemployed back into the labour force.  There is much more scope to use the external delivery of service in other areas of administration and service.<\/p><p> The Department is working with other Departments on the issue of commissioning.  The commissioning model will embody a more strategic approach to the delivery of services by the community and voluntary sector than the traditional block grant funding model.  This model aims to assess and identify the needs of a population and release funding in return for achieving the identified outcomes on foot of evidence-based evaluations.<\/p><p> Another example of how the Department is driving a culture of value for money is the issue of Government grants, which I know is the subject of a separate chapter in the most recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In September 2014, the Department issued a new circular setting out a revised framework for management and accountability arrangements for grants.  The overarching principle of the new circular is that there should be transparency and accountability in the management of public money.  There is also a new statement of principles for grantees.  The statement outlines four principles that apply to those in receipt of grant funding, namely, clarity, fairness, governance and value for money.<\/p><p> A related initiative has been the establishment of Benefacts.  This will provide a single repository of regulatory data on the entire not-for-profit sector.  The sector is estimated to encompass 20,000 entities which receive &euro;4.4 billion in Government funding annually.  The objectives of Benefacts are to deliver a single view of all not-for-profit entities in Ireland, to facilitate better decision-making in the Government&rsquo;s funding of the sector and to rebuild donor confidence and provide for increased investment in the sector.<\/p><p> A key aspect of the reform agenda has been the area of public procurement.  Over many years concerns have been raised in reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General about weak procurement practices and we have sought to address them.  The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, now procures common goods and services across the sector.  The procurement reform programme is gaining increasing traction in delivering a more joined-up approach for procurement.  The OGP is progressively putting in place sectoral or whole-of-Government arrangements in areas such as professional services, ICT, facilities, travel and HR services.<\/p><p> Some expenditure areas, such as legal costs and insurance, have never been procured on a whole-of-Government basis.  For the first time, the OGP is looking at such services across the public service and is putting in place professional commercial arrangements that leverage scale, bring consistency and manage risk.  The OGP is also committed to ensuring SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement.  In March this year, the office produced a detailed analysis of non-pay expenditure in the public service, which was the first of its kind.  The findings indicated that 66% of the State's procurement was with the SME sector.  I commend Mr. Paul Quinn and his team on all their hard work in the delivery of this very extensive and ambitious programme of change.<\/p><p> Value for money is also important in our management of the State&rsquo;s property portfolio.  The OPW led the development and implementation of the property asset management delivery plan.  Significant progress has been achieved in areas such as intra-State property transactions, communications and the Civil Service estate.  More work is required, so we will continue to support the OPW in driving the implementation of the plan as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall reform programme.<\/p><p> I have set out some of the changes the Department has introduced to improve the effectiveness of public spending.  Of course, given total voted spend of more than &euro;55 billion, it is inevitable that there will be errors, omissions and inefficiencies which do not meet the high standards we are setting.  We are dealing in a world of uncertainty and increasing complexity.  However, it is critical that we continue with and improve on these reforms.  Specifically, we need to embed a very strong value for money culture which does not tolerate outdated practices or inertia.  Achieving this will require a significant improvement in our leadership capacity.  This is, to my mind, the single most important challenge we face.<\/p><p> I will now turn to some specific items on the agenda today.  With regard to chapter 4, vote accounting and budget management, since the Department was established, significant progress has been made in reducing the fiscal deficit and bringing stability to the public finances.  In 2011, the budget deficit stood at 12.5% of GDP.  This year it will be below 2.1%.  In 2016, it is forecast to reduce further to 1.2%.  The Department&rsquo;s two objectives of managing public expenditure and driving reform have made a major contribution to this improved fiscal environment.  In 2014, gross voted spend amounted to &euro;54.1 billion, which is &euro;1.1 billion or 2.1%, ahead of profile.  In net terms, net voted expenditure amounted to &euro;42.2 billion in 2014 and was &euro;1.1 billion or 2.6% ahead of profile.  It is worth noting that nine of the 16 ministerial Vote groups were at or below profile.  Ministerial Vote groups requiring Supplementary Estimates were in most instances able to obtain savings elsewhere from within the Vote groups to offset partially the Supplementary Estimate.<\/p><p> Turning to the Department's own Vote, the Estimate for 2014 was set at &euro;35.9 million, a slight increase on 2013 levels.  This reflects the addition of funds to provide for the establishment of the Office of the National Lottery Regulator and to provide for a widening of responsibilities in the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  The audited surplus to be surrendered in 2014 was &euro;3.8 million.  The surplus mainly arose due to lower than expected progress on recruitment as set out in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and spend on North-South projects.<\/p><p> On Vote 12, Superannuation and Retired Allowances, the 2014 appropriation accounts for the Vote show a net outturn of &euro;368.7 million compared with an Estimate plus Supplementary Estimate of &euro;384.8 million, giving a surplus of &euro;16.1 million.  The surplus arose due to the timing of receipts from the single public service pension scheme.<\/p><p> Turning to Vote 18, Shared Services, the 2014 Estimate of &euro;30.6 million represents a net increase of &euro;9.6 million compared with the 2013 Estimate.  This increase is largely driven by the migration of existing payroll functions from originating Departments to the centre.  The net outturn for 2014 was &euro;20.3 million, giving a surplus to surrender of approximately &euro;10 million.  The underspend primarily arose because of later than anticipated transitioning of staff to PeoplePoint and payroll.<\/p><p> With regard to Vote 41, Office of Government Procurement, the Estimate for 2014 was set at &euro;12.4 million.  The outturn was &euro;6.2 million, leaving a surplus to be surrendered of &euro;6.3 million.  This surplus arose mainly due to lower than anticipated recruitment, as only two thirds of expected staff were on board at the end of 2014, and knock-on savings in non-pay.<\/p><p> I take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the staff of the Department for all their hard work.  Since 2011, the Department has achieved much, none of which would have been possible without the commitment and expertise of the staff.  As the country enters the next phase of our recovery, the Department will continue to make a contribution to public policy, budgetary management and the management and reform of the public service.  I look forward to working with the committee on these issues in the future.  I am aware this is likely to be our last meeting before the general election and I wish the members all the best in the upcoming contest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015111900002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447927200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Watt.

This is the point Mr. Watt made in his opening statement.  We have a very recent example that belies and makes a mockery of what we already know about how long these things take and the type of the overruns we have dealt with historically in this committee.  We are still dealing with tribunals.  Every time the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government comes before the committee we ask how much the bill is now.

This does not sit well with me.  What Mr. Watt said in his opening statement is fine, but I caution against the decision to have what would seem to be an open cheque in both cases, because this is what we are looking at.  Those making policy should think twice about what they are doing.  I would certainly want to see set out the benefits of the spend of this type of taxpayers' money to achieve we do not know what.<\/p> <p>  It is a pity, when we reflect on the OECD report, that a system is not in place in the House to examine in a very detailed way the proposal and cost to determine if what will come out of the report is worth this type of money.  If it were a business this is the question that would dominate, but a cost-benefit analysis and information on what the public should know do not seem to be considered in this case.  Who will cry stop should all of this be a step too far?  As Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts I caution the Department and the policymakers on this, because it seems we are going down the same old road we have travelled before without learning anything.<\/p> <p>  This brings me to the OECD report.  I participated in the report and was there for its launch.  While I welcome the report, and it is the basis of debate and conversation for various committees, it is very disappointing that, in the same way as the budget is front-loaded to spend the money, it speaks about the budgetary process to examine the amounts of money to be spent, but there is no emphasis thereafter in the report on upskilling or empowering the Comptroller and Auditor General to have a much greater role in the examination of the spend of taxpayers' money to the point where it is being spent, unlike in other jurisdictions.  It excludes any commentary on an amalgamation of the local government audit team and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and empowering the committee to do the job the public believes it is doing.<\/p><p> Earlier, before the Secretary General and his team came in, Deputy Costello and others raised the question of the wards of court, the replies from the Department, where recommendations go and so on, as well as the delay in reverting to this committee.

On the Comptroller and Auditor General, local government and the relationship between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the local government auditor, I have expressed my views in the past that our Department has an open mind about whether both should be amalgamated.  I have stated this previously and I believe the Chairman and I are in broad agreement here.  Certainly, our Department would be supportive of that and have been in the past.  We know the Comptroller and Auditor General and this process have a strong impact in terms of value for money and ensuring that Departments account for money and are called to account before this committee.  This is very powerful and if we believe this could have an impact on local government expenditure, we certainly would not object to that.  I have supported it in the past and my view has not changed in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman raised some issues about responding to recommendations of reports.  He will remember that when our Department was established in 2011, one issue about which he approached me was that it took a great deal of time for us to respond to the recommendations in minutes of reports.  We have put great effort into ensuring we respond promptly and I think - Mr. Dermot Nolan can confirm - we now respond within 11 or 12 weeks.  We also put pressure on Departments to respond and while the Comptroller and Auditor General might confirm this, we put a lot of effort into this and there have been improvements in the timeliness of the response.  As for the wards of court report, I believe it arrived in our Department last week.  I had a chance to look at it last night and we will review it.  Inasmuch as it relates to our work, we will revert to the committee on that.  As we literally only received it last week, we have not had a chance to consider it in detail.

The Comptroller and Auditor General prepares reports after the event.

There was a recommendation from the Committee of Public Accounts that the funds held in trust for wards of court and any funds held in trust by the proposed office of public guardian should be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and that legislative amendments to facilitate this should be brought forward by the Ministers for Finance and Justice and Equality.  There is a certain urgency in this regard because new legislation is coming down the track.  From what I am told, the money may not be well invested.  This is a serious issue and it is important that it is tracked, in particular given the vulnerability of the people who ultimately would benefit.

There was an increase in hours worked, changes in overtime rates, premium payments and cuts in pay for those earning over &euro;65,000 so for a large number of the Haddington Road measures we have a very clear sight of the savings.  They were provisions which enabled us to deliver more services or make savings, hours worked being an example.  There were 15 million extra hours delivered in the system.  There is a cash value on that but that enabled us to sustain services as we continued to cut, and those additional hours were very valuable.  We can come back to the Deputy with our assessment of the savings.  We are very happy that, in the main, the Haddington Road agreement delivered.  We are very happy that at a particular time when we needed to make savings, and it was difficult to make savings on the budgets during that period - we had a long way to go in terms of cutting the deficit when we negotiated it - that agreement was the right thing to do for the Government and it delivered broadly in terms of where we are now.<\/p> <p>  We are in the process of unwinding and the Government has entered a new agreement with the unions which, over time, will unwind the provisions of FEMPI legislation but it will take a number of years to get back to where we were.

During the process of reform, contracts that have been in place for a long period of time may be re-examined and changed, and companies may lose contracts or feel they have lost out.

In other cases, Departments undertake the procurement themselves and we provide them with guidance, assistance and help.  There is always going to be an issue with compliance.  We cannot police every single contract that is entered into.  That is absolutely impossible and we do not wish to do that.  However, we must encourage Departments to stick with the circulars, to implement best practice and to make sure they are getting value for money.  That is what we strive to do and that is what Mr. Quinn and his team are working on.  There will always be non-compliance at some level.   A report from the Comptroller and Auditor General last year showed that there was a spend of approximately &euro;150 million to &euro;160 million that was not based on competitive tender processes.  There were various reasons for that.  In some cases the explanations were not adequate, in our view, and there should have been a competitive process.  However, the number of cases of non-compliance for which there was no justification represented a very small percentage of the overall procurement spend.  We will monitor it, and no doubt the Comptroller and Auditor General will revisit the issue at some stage.  We are happy to work with his office on this.

In 2014, for example, under the Garda Vote, there were 51 contracts, with a total value of &euro;6.7 million; under the Vote for the Prison Service there were 11 contracts, with a value &euro;2.8 million; under the Vote for the Courts Service there were contracts worth almost &euro;750,000 for which there was no competitive process; under the Vote for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, there were 14 such contracts, with a total value of &euro;1.5 million; in the Department of Social Protection, such contracts numbered ten, with a value of &euro;1 million; and in the HSE there were 299 cases, valued at &euro;56.5 million.

That sends out a very negative signal about procurement processes.  In the education sector, for example, UCD applies a threshold of &euro;60,000 for open tendering for contracts, rather than &euro;25,000.  It has simply taken the view that it can apply a threshold of &euro;60,000 rather than &euro;25,000.  All members of this committee have questioned this approach in recent times.

We need to figure out how we can do better across this vast system and determine whether there are sanctions or other mechanisms that can be put in place to improve the situation further.  We are striving all the time to ensure that Departments understand their obligations and are working with them in that regard.

I advised the committee that I would raise the issue of the tender for the contract for air services to the Aran Islands.  I am directing my question to Mr. Watt initially, because he referred to reforms within the system.  This was an example of a botched job that had to be reversed because due diligence was not done.  How could the system have awarded a contract to a company that was not in a position to deliver the service because it had never had a licence?  I have a conflict of interest, as my wife is from Inis M&oacute;r, but I am probably the only Deputy who uses that service regularly.  I have some experience of it.  When this situation occurred, it caught my attention.  When it was announced that the preferred tender was a helicopter service on the other side of Galway city, the immediate reaction of almost everyone, not just in Galway or on the islands but in the entire country, was \"For God's sake.\"  It was crazy.<\/p> <p>  In terms of delving into the nuts and bolts of how the process was constructed, what does Mr. Watt do as head of a Department that has direct jurisdiction over and oversight of the Departments involved and Mr. Quinn's office?  Does he intervene?  He stated that he did not want to intervene in every contract, which is fair enough, but people might ask whether he and his officials inquired into what was happening when he found out about this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015111900002#R01100","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1447927200,"counter":305,"content":"<p>We worked with the relevant office - that is, the Office of Government Procurement, OGP - on drawing up contracts.  A number of issues arise and I will ask Mr. Quinn to contribute after I have given my view on them.  I do not necessarily agree with the characterisation of this as a botched job.  It is not fair to say that due diligence was not carried out.  The issue was whether Galway Airport had a licence to provide the service over the period of the contract.  The airport was contacted for a check and confirmed that it had a licence.  It did not tell us at the time that the licence would expire at the end of this year.  The tender documentation that was submitted did not say the airport would not have a licence beyond the end of 2015.

An obligation was on the airport to ensure that it was compliant and in a position to provide us with the service.  It was asked and did not tell us.

Those concerned are starting with a number of regions or consolidating a number of regions and will then roll out the system.  It is certainly a matter we will pursue with the HSE.  In the absence of an integrated system, I agree that it is very difficult to monitor expenditure and for management to discharge its functions.  What is proposed is really needed.

Ever since committees of the Houses, mainly those concerned with financial matters, have made recommendations that the individual taxpayer be paid as per the Ombudsman's original recommendation.

Public scrutiny is critical and, as Deputies noted, this committee is at the centre of that.  The public has a right to know how its money is being spent and, to that end, these types of formats are vital.  However, we must bear in mind that while we have had a reasonable debate here for three and a half hours, only a small snippet of that will be covered in the media and it will not necessarily reflect the discussion that took place.  We might be used to all of this, but a lot of people out there just hear the noise and not necessarily all the discussion.  In a private organisation or even a large public company, the types of debates we might have around accountability and spending happen within a certain setting.  On the other hand, discussions here take place in a public setting.  All I am saying is that we need to be aware of what that actually means.  While it is the nature of the system, as the Chairman observed, people outside look at it in a different way from how we look at it.  For some people on the outside looking in, what goes on here is a very unattractive dimension of certain roles.  It does not bother me because I know about the nature of it, but for some people outside who may be thinking of a career in the public sector, it could be factor.  The Chairman may be right that there is nothing we can do about it, but we should keep in mind the tone of the engagement.  This is not a reflection of my own experience of engaging with the Chairman and members of this committee.  If I had a problem with the committee, I would have told the Chairman.  In fact, I have never had a problem.  However, there have been occasions where the tone of the debate - not necessarily here, but in other parliamentary fora - is such that it is a real turn-off for people.  The Chairman might discount it but it really can serve to put people off.

Even though we only covered a couple of amendments on the last day we covered most of the arguments around them.  Although there is a series amendments, they work their way in a logical order through the Bill and are connected.  A series of amendments provide that the ultimate power for managing and controlling the harbour should not be in the hands of the CEO.  I contend that it should be in the hands of elected members who are required to consult with a stakeholder group.  That theme has worked its way through a series of amendments which will be formally moved and then we can discuss them further on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  In terms of this amendment, the Bill gives a CEO the right to sell shares.  My amendment contends that the CEO should not have such a right because I do not believe that we should privatise our harbours.  I suspect that the Government's position is that one needs flexibility to bring in private capital to develop harbours.  When one looks at some of the proposals that have come forward, such as a cruise berth and the harbour master plan in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, then it become clear that it is not a very good idea to do so.  Part of D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour has already been put up for sale to finance these developments.  That is not the way to go with vital infrastructure.  I do not think that we should mortgage public assets in order to fund commercial speculative developments.  My amendment provides that there should be no circumstances in which a CEO can mortgage or sell off the assets of a harbour.  I wish to flag that a few sites in D&uacute;n Laoghaire have already been sold which is very much at odds with what the people want.  The amendment is very simple in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  As I will not be here later I wish to state that the only other substantial matter, beyond the ones that we have already debated, is the issue of worker directors.  In the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, the number of employees has been substantially reduced and means they would not have a worker director under the provisions of the legislation, as it stands.  I believe that any harbour, as part of the idea of having genuine stakeholders involved, should have a worker director.  I have referred to a different amendment in this respect.  All of my amendments share the same theme, that we need real involvement and participation by stakeholders and in this respect workers are a very important group of stakeholders.  My deepest knowledge about D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour has come from talking to the workers who know the harbour.  They are the front-line people and can tell what is going on, so one must have their input on the board.  If one has the threshold of employees required to have a worker director too high then one will not get such vital input.  I shall leave my comments at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015111900002#B01100","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1447941600,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Before I respond in more detail to the point made by Deputy Boyd Barrett I wish to emphasise the following in terms of the current text that he has proposed be deleted.  Section 9(1)(c)(i) clearly states that any disposal of shares cannot go ahead without \"the consent by resolution of the elected council concerned.\"  In a moment I shall outline my policy on some of the areas outlined by the Deputy.  I fundamentally believe that if a port is now part of a local authority unit, in whatever way, then I agree that a decision on shareholding should only happen with the consent of local members.  My belief flows from what I have said about a local authority structure being of benefit to some ports.  Section 9(1)(c)(ii) states there is a requirement for \"the approval of the Minister, given after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.\"  Furthermore, any disposal of any capital, for whatever reason, can only be up to a maximum of 49% of the issued capital for that port.<\/p> <p>  The reason for such a provision is that I view ports and airports as important in their own ways for the development of our country.  While the boards and offices of a port, at different points, may decide to raise capital or allow a minority stake to be disposed of to raise funding, I fundamentally believe that they should be in majority public ownership.  That is why we have the further requirement in place that if a local authority's chief executive is lucky enough to dispose of a minority stake, or a portion of a minority stake, that it requires both the consent via a resolution of the local authority's members and the relevant Ministers.  Overall, what we are looking to do here is to give flexibility to the ports in terms of how they might look to raise capital but we have been clear that the consent of both the local members and the Minister, for different reasons, are still required. <\/p> <p>  I understand where the Deputy is coming from but I believe that the safeguards that we have in place at the moment are robust.  It is for that reason that I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015111900002#B01200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447941600,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1447941600,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<\/p><blockquote>In page 8, to delete lines 23 to 38, and in page 9, to delete lines 1 to 30. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015111900002#C00100","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447941600,"counter":457,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447941600,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Section 9 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447941600,"counter":459,"content":"<p>SECTION 10<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1447941600,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p><blockquote>In page 9, line 33, to delete &ldquo;local authority chief executive&rdquo;

I believe that some of our ports are best managed by them and, therefore,  I would trust and enable them to make those decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015111900002#C05500","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447941600,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1447941600,"counter":512,"content":"<p>With the permission of the Chair, I must leave and Deputy Ellis will deal with the remaining amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015111900002#D00100","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447941600,"counter":513,"content":"<p>Section 21 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447941600,"counter":514,"content":"<p>SECTION 22<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1447941600,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 21 to 25, inclusive, and 31 are related and will be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015111900002#D00400","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1447941600,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 21:<\/p><blockquote>In page 18, line 9, to delete &ldquo;30&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;10&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>We want to substitute ten for 30.

With regard to employee representation on the boards of transferred companies, the section states that if a transferred company has more than 30 employees then an election is held and the winner is automatically appointed as a director.  If a transferred company has fewer than 30 employees, then the local authority chief executive is obliged to appoint a director to represent employee interests to the board, and prior to doing so, the local authority chief executive must consult the relevant trade unions.  This approach is identical to that found in section 39 in regard to ports of national significance and is, of course, identical to that which applies to date to all those port companies.<\/p> <p>  The amendments do not seem to align correctly with each other.  The main thrust is to reduce the statutory threshold for employee-director relations from 30 to ten employees and then, if the amendment were not to be successful, to introduce through amendment No. 25 a requirement that rather than consider any trade union recommendation for employee representation on the board, a local authority chief executive would be compelled to accept any recommendation.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 31 relates to section 39, which deals with the ports of national significance.  This amendment seeks again to reduce the threshold for employee elections from 30 to ten employees.  I assume that this amendment is drafted, unaware of the fact that employee-director elections are already held at each of our ports of national significance, that is Dublin, Cork, Shannon, Foynes and Waterford.  A reduction in the threshold from 30 to ten, would be inappropriate for a port company, and in particular for those ports of regional significance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52015111900002#D00600","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447941600,"counter":518,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1447941600,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 22:<\/p><blockquote>In page 18, line 30, to delete &ldquo;30&rdquo;
