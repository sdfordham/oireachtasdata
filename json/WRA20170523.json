This was the first visit to Canada by a serving Taoiseach in more than a decade, and provided an opportunity to develop and strengthen the important bilateral relationship between our two nations, who share deep historic ties, and enjoy strong trading relations.  Over the centuries, Canada has been an important destination for Irish immigrants.  Today, over four and a half million Canadians - more than 14% of the country's population - claim Irish ancestry.<\/p>  <p>  During my visit I had a series of engagements with political, business and civic society representatives in Montreal and Toronto, and met with a number of existing and potential new IDA and Enterprise Ireland client companies. <\/p>  <p>  These engagements provided very useful opportunities for me to promote Ireland as a location for trade and investment, as well as to emphasise our commitment to the EU and to outline Ireland's priorities in the context of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  While in Montreal, I met with Prime Minister Trudeau.  We discussed the trade relationship between Ireland and Canada and Ireland's strengths as a location for trade and investment.  We also considered ways to further strengthen the economic and trade relationship between our two countries, and agreed to prioritise the opportunities offered by the CETA trade agreement. <\/p>  <p>  I also updated the Prime Minister on Ireland's Brexit priorities and outlined to him the current position in Northern Ireland.  The Prime Minister reiterated to me the Canadian Government's continued support for the Northern Ireland peace process. <\/p>  <p>  Also in Montreal, I attended a business lunch with senior members of the Montreal business community, where I met with potential and current investors in Ireland.  I also visited the School of Irish studies at Concordia University where I met with members of the Irish Diaspora.<\/p>  <p>  In Toronto, I addressed an Enterprise Ireland event, and also an event hosted by the Ireland-Canada Chamber of Commerce, both of which provided me opportunities to meet with current and potential investors in Ireland.  I addressed a Tourism Ireland event and visited Ireland Park, the Irish Famine memorial park in Toronto.  I also paid a courtesy call on the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Elizabeth Dowdeswell.  My Programme concluded with a meeting with members of the Board of the Irish Canada Immigration Centre and other representatives of the Irish Diaspora, and an event with representatives of the Ireland Fund in Canada. <\/p>  <p>  This was a very successful visit which I believe will provide a platform to further strengthen the bilateral relations between Ireland and Canada - and I expect will be further enhanced during the trade mission to Canada that will be led by Minister Mitchell O'Connor later this month (30 May to 02 June).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300055#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":10,"content":"<p>Question No. 17 resubmitted.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[23021\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300055#WRB00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his meeting with Mr. Michel Barnier on 11 May 2017; the issues discussed relating to Brexit; and the other matters that were discussed and the responses he received.","asker":"1224","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>I met with Michel Barnier, the EU's Chief Negotiator for Brexit, in Government Buildings on Thursday 11 May.

Most of the Act was then commenced on the 27th of March, 2017 including the provisions contained in Part 4 of the Act.  As it has only been eight weeks since the commencement of Part 4, statistics for offences committed under this part are not yet available. <\/p><p>Part 4 of the Act provides for two new offences of purchasing sexual services, in the context of prostitution.  The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.  <\/p><p>The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, in the context of prostitution, and carries a potential penalty of up to 5<b><\/b>years&rsquo; imprisonment and\/or a fine.  <\/p><p>In both cases, the person selling or, in the case of a trafficked or exploited person being forced to sell, the sexual service will not commit an offence.  In doing so, the Act recognises the exploitation experienced by those involved in prostitution and decriminalises them.  <\/p><p>The purpose of the legislation is also to target the trafficking and exploitation of persons through prostitution.  Both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have recognised the effectiveness of the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services, as a tool in the fight against human trafficking.  Evidence from Sweden and Norway where the law has been changed indicate that both countries have become a less attractive destination for prostitution based trafficking.  Following an extensive public consultation on the future direction of prostitution law, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence also called for the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services in its report on the Review of Legislation on Prostitution.  <\/p><p>Aside from those trafficked, there is also evidence of the wider exploitation of persons involved in prostitution, such as those pimped by drug dealers or coerced or otherwise forced to engage in the activity.  It is considered reasonable that action is taken to reduce the demand for a service that leads to trafficking and other forms of forced prostitution.  That is what the new law does.<\/p><p>The purpose of these proposals is to send a clear message that addressing the exploitation associated with prostitution justifies adopting an approach which targets the demand for these services.  <\/p><p>That said, and given the purpose of the provisions which I have outlined, I agree with those who said the impact of the provisions should be subject to review.  Section 27 of Part 4 prescribes a review by the Minister of the implementation of that Part after a period of three years and the provision of a report to the Oireachtas.  That report shall include information on the number of arrests during that period in respect of the new offences as well as an assessment of the impact of the offences on those who provide sexual services for payment.<\/p><p>I believe that three years is the minimum period in which systems and practices  can be effectively bedded down and operated so that reliable conclusions can be drawn from the information gathered for the review.<\/p><p>I would envisage that any review would involve engaging with all relevant stakeholders in determining the impact and effect of this new offence, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, support services and all interested persons.<\/p><p>It is also worth noting that the review of the impact of the prohibition of paying for sexual services contained in the Northern Ireland Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Criminal Justice and Support for Victims) Act 2015 is due to be reported to the NI Assembly in 2018.<\/p><p>Finally, I should add that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Policing Plan for 2017 places a key emphasis on work to reduce sexual violence and trafficking with a targeted focus on increased reporting and detection of sexual offences as well as an increased number of trafficking victims identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300056#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":20,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300056#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[23966\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300056#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will request an update from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding the current number of personnel serving Edgeworthstown Garda station, in view of the deficit in staff due to long-term sick leave which is not being represented in official figures for the station and which is causing a dangerous situation due to lack of policing and an increase in crime in the area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":22,"content":"<p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

Indeed, the CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q4 of 2016, show a<b><\/b>30% decrease in burglary for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 - which parallels the implementation of Operation Thor and is reflected in the crime statistics for Edgeworthstown Station which show a 56% decrease in burglaries and related offences in 2016 when compare to 2014.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways - firstly some 200 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointment Service have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Deputy will be aware that the use of mechanically propelled vehicles, including quad bikes and scramblers, in a public place is subject to the relevant requirements of road traffic legislation.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that these vehicles, when used in a public place, must comply with the Road Traffic Acts, including in relation to motor tax, insurance and possession of a valid driver licence or learner permit.  Under the Road Traffic Acts, any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is allowed to stop a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place and demand production of a driver licence or learner permit.  In addition, Garda&iacute; may inspect the vehicle for compliance with vehicle standards legislation, which makes it an offence to drive without reasonable consideration, drive carelessly, or drive dangerously.  The Garda authorities also have powers of seizure, detention, storage and disposal of vehicles under road traffic legislation. <\/p>  <p>  I am further informed that the use of quad bikes and scramblers in public parks and open spaces is strictly prohibited by the local authorities under the Parks and Open Spaces Bye-Laws 2011. <\/p>  <p>  Despite the road traffic and other relevant legislation available in this area, the Garda authorities have indicated that the use of quad bikes and scramblers by minors and youths in public parks has proven difficult to deal with from an enforcement perspective.  Garda members are instructed not to pursue youths on quad bikes, scramblers, etc. owing to the inherent safety risk in pursuing these vehicles.  If such pursuits were to take place, there would be a high risk of these ending in collisions at speed resulting in serious injury or death, so the opportunity to actually bring these vehicles to a stop is rare. <\/p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have advised that the issue is one which is best addressed through a multi-agency approach.  In this regard, Garda&iacute; are working with local authorities, including park authorities, to examine other solutions, such as engineering solutions.

When appropriate, the work of the Division is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that just under 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 471 of whom have been assigned to the DMR Region.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Region, including the DMR Region in the coming years.  To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates a new recruitment drive was launched by the Commissioner earlier this month with a closing date of 1 June.  The competition is being undertaken by the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner and applications should be made to www.publicjobs.ie.<\/p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300056#WRC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300056#WRC02000"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[24343\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300056#WRC02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the provision of the new regional Garda headquarters in Sligo; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Office of Public Works has primary responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation and works closely with the Garda authorities in this regard.

Domestic violence has a wide currency and covers a broad spectrum of behaviours ranging from pushing, physical assaults and non-physical abuse.  In the arena of domestic violence, \"violence\" has been given a wider meaning and includes psychological abuse, intimidation, harassment, mental cruelty and sexual abuse.  Domestic violence can occur in heterosexual , same sex and transgender relationships.  It can involve violence against children. It is clear that this pernicious evil is a complex issue.<\/p>  <p>  My Department consulted with the relevant criminal justice agencies on making domestic violence a criminal offence in the Domestic Violence Bill.  The view expressed was that there is in general no gap in the range of offences that can be prosecuted in domestic violence cases.  A number of existing offences, primarily under the Non-Fatal Offences Act 1997, capture a range of behaviours associated with domestic violence.  Violence in a domestic setting is clearly a criminal act and is captured through offences such as assault.  Offences extend to non-physical violence where there is a threat of imminent violence.  Non-violent abuse is also captured by the harassment provisions of the Act of 1997.  Sexual offences including sexual assault and rape are also relevant in domestic violence situations.  Currently in criminal cases involving domestic violence that appear before the courts, the Court has discretion to give appropriate weight to the domestic context of the offence.<\/p>  <p>It is my intention to strengthen the offence of harassment under Section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 to include online activity and create a new offence of stalking.  In addition new offences will be created which will apply to digital communications to deal with so-called revenge pornography incidents.  This offences will apply where the victim and perpetrator are cohabiting and in other intimate partner contexts.

The level of threat from this source is kept under constant review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly in the light of ongoing developments and the current international situation.

To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<\/p><p>I have requested a breakdown of the number of newly attested Garda by station assigned to the Westmeath Division and Roscommon\/Longford Division since the reopening of the Garda College from the Commissioner.

As the Deputy may be aware, juveniles are not accepted in the Drug Treatment Court in Dublin and such persons charged with drug related offences are dealt with through the Children Court.  The Deputy may be interested in the legal framework applicable to young offenders and the activities and services funded by my Department which support the operation of the law in this area.  Statutory provision in relation to young offenders is set out in the Children Act 2001 (as amended).  Accordingly, where a young person under the age of 18 comes into conflict with the law, the principles of the Act apply.  A key principle in the Act is that detention should be a last resort. In support of this principle, the legislation facilitates the incremental application of a series of measures, ranging from diversion in the first instance through community based sanctions, to detention.<\/p>  <p>  The first main filter in the youth justice system is the Diversion Programme operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, involving at different stages and depending on the seriousness of the offence, the informal caution (without supervision) and the formal caution (with supervision), including possible involvement with a Garda Youth Diversion Project.  The second main filter is the range of non-custodial sanctions available to the courts including court orders for dismissal; conditional discharge; the payment of fines, costs or compensation; the binding over of parents; and orders imposing community sanctions supervised by the Probation Service.  In supervising community sanctions, the Probation Service utilises a number of community based organisations with dedicated resources to work with young offenders.<\/p>  <p>  Finally and as a last resort, detention in the Oberstown Children Detention Campus may be used.  In this regard, I should mention that my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Dr. Katherine Zappone recently announced the roll-out of a pilot Bail Supervision Scheme for young people which will assist them in complying with their bail conditions pending the hearing of their case.  International evidence suggests that this scheme should impact remand trends by offering the court a new option &lsquo;bail with supervision&rsquo; as an alternative to a remand in detention.  This alternative option should also help a young person to moderate their chaotic circumstances and promote greater stability in their life.<\/p>  <p>  It will be seen, therefore, that the focus under the law is to adopt a graduated approach which, in the main, serves to keep the vast majority of young offenders out of the criminal justice system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300057#WRD04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures Data","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300057#WRD05000"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[24270\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300057#WRD05100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who made protected disclosures and are off work on work-related stress; the steps she has taken to satisfy herself that they are not being subjected to bullying and harassment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":95,"content":"<p>Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may make protected disclosures to the Garda Commissioner, to GSOC or to me as Minister.  I am informed that eight Protected Disclosures have been made to the Garda Commissioner, and that GSOC have received seven disclosures with another four active from the previous two years.  There have been eight Protected Disclosures made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality since the 2014 Act came into force.  I have also received a number of other documents which cannot fall to be considered as Protected Disclosures but have had to be treated with similar confidentiality and sensitivity.  I should point out that it is possible that the same individual will have made a protected disclosure to more than one of the possible recipients under the Act, and that there may therefore be some overlap in the figures quoted.  I am not in a position to provide the Deputy with the number of whistleblowers who are currently absent from work on stress related leave.  Given the obligation to protect the identity of those who make protected disclosures, it would require a breach of this obligation to attempt to collate information on the number who may be off work for any reason.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Protected Disclosures Act came into operation on 15 July 2014. Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who wish to make a protected disclosure may do so in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  The Act replaced the previous system of making disclosures to a Confidential Recipient.  The 2014 Act put Garda&iacute; in the same position, including receiving the same statutory protections, as others who wish to make a protected disclosure about alleged wrongdoing.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or they may make a disclosure directly to GSOC.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC, the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda&iacute; who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the Act.  These protections include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from dismissal and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is no doubt aware of the measures taken by the Garda Commissioner in relation to protected disclosures outlined at her meeting in June 2016 with the Policing Authority.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published their Protected Disclosures Policy and all Garda members and civilians have been informed of this policy. In addition the Garda Commissioner has appointed a Protected Disclosures Manager who will be supported with a dedicated and properly trained team.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been working with Transparency International Ireland and other external providers to create an environment to ensure that whistleblowers are properly protected and supported.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the public interest in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having robust policies and procedures in place to support and protect whistleblowers and to ensure that their complaints or allegations are fully investigated, I asked the Policing Authority on 2 June 2016 to examine and report on the policies and procedures in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with whistleblowers\/whistleblowing.  I also asked that they make any recommendations that they consider appropriate in order to ensure that the policies and procedures in place are appropriate and can provide assurance that whistleblowers can make complaints or allegations in a safe environment where their complaints or allegations are properly investigated.<\/p>  <p>  The Policing Authority completed its review and reported to me on 11 November, 2016.  The Report was published on my Department's website and has been laid before both Houses in accordance with the Act.  The Garda Commissioner has since published a revised policy document as result of the Report.  The Commissioner is committed to providing an environment in which protected disclosures can be made in full knowledge that persons making such disclosures will be supported and protected in the workplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300057#WRD05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Levels","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300057#WRD05300"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[24352\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300057#WRD05400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on an ICSA, Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, report that suggests that two thirds of farming families have been affected by crime relating to their farming enterprise; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1346","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":98,"content":"<p>I am aware of the recent report commissioned by the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association (ICSA) and the recent commentary in the media on foot of its publication.

The ICSA report covers a period of 24 months, from the start of May 2014 to the end of May 2016 and this includes a period of 17 months before the launch, in November 2015, of the sustained drive against burglary and property crime which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has pursued under Operation Thor.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle organised crime gangs and other prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime.  This comprehensive operation is supported by the enhanced Government investment in Garda resources, including the recently announced additional allocation of &euro;88.5 million in 2017.  The additional investments in policing make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor.  There has been concentrated policing activity under Operation Thor and this is reflected in the implementation of over 67,000 targeted checkpoints nationwide, with in the region of 4,000 arrests being made.<\/p><p>It is encouraging to note that since the launch of the Operation, the burglary figures in particular have shown a significant downward trend.  Indeed, the CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q4 of 2016, which were released recently, show a<b><\/b>30% decrease in burglary for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 - which parallels the implementation of Operation Thor.<\/p><p>I have also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b><\/b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.

The Deputy will be aware that as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations.  There are a range of partnership initiatives which have been established between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and important rural-based organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na Tire and other rural community organisations, including the well established Community Alert Programme, the ongoing work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme.<\/p><p>Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300, and in this regard I was pleased to be able to launch a new recruitment campaign for Reserve members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na last week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300057#WRD05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":99,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300057#WRD05600"},{"type":"question","counter":100,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[24354\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300057#WRD05700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide an overview of the general scheme of the Data Protection Bill.","asker":"1323","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":101,"content":"<p>The General Scheme of the Data Protection Bill is available on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality: <i>www.justice.ie<\/i>.

Part 3 of the draft Bill seeks to give further effect to the GDPR in a limited number of areas, mainly affecting the public sector, in which flexibility is permitted.  In certain cases, this involves creation of a regulation-making power which will permit the making of detailed regulations.  Part 4 seeks to give effect to the Directive&rsquo;s provisions in national law.  Part 6 contains Heads which respond to requirements in both the GDPR and Directive that individuals be permitted to seek vindication of their data protection rights through the courts rather than the supervisory authority.<\/p><p>With regard to the Data Protection Commissioner, Part 2 of the draft Bill contains provisions which would establish the Data Protection Commission to replace the Data Protection Commissioner.  The primary function of the Commission would be to act as the supervisory authority for the purposes of the GDPR and the Directive.  Replacing the Data Protection Commissioner with a Data Protection Commission is a future-proofing mechanism which will permit the appointment of more than one Commissioner should the need arise in the future.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. <\/p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in decisions in this regard. Under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between valuation of rateable property and setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. <\/p><p>Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. This has been the policy of successive governments and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office. The Valuation Acts provide for revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment. The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted across the country,  as soon as possible, and on a phased basis. This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made to date. <\/p><p>Revaluation is an important instrument in addressing historical anomalies in relation to commercial rates for both urban and rural properties and between particular classes of property within a local authority area. The general outcome of revaluations conducted to date by the Valuation Office has been that about 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced following revaluation and about 40% had an increase, a pattern which is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the programme advances. The current phase of the national revaluation programme, &quot;REVAL 2017&quot;, covers revaluation of all rateable properties in counties Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Kildare, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny where a revaluation is being undertaken for the first time since the nineteenth century. It also includes the second revaluation of South Dublin County Council area. Revaluation in these counties will be completed in September 2017 and become effective for rating purposes from 2018 onwards.<\/p><p>Where the Valuation Office proposes to enter a new valuation or amend an existing valuation on a Valuation List, there is an extensive process available to cater for ratepayers who may be dissatisfied with the proposed valuation. A dissatisfied person can make representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days of the date of issue of the proposed valuation certificate. The Valuation Office will consider any such representations and may or may not change the proposed valuation depending on the circumstances of each individual property. If any ratepayer is still dissatisfied with the final valuation to be placed on their property following consideration of the representations, they have a right to lodge a formal appeal with the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent statutory body established for the purpose of hearing appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner of Valuation that there has been some apparent confusion as to the rateability of certain elements of the equine industry. The Valuation Act 2001 (Schedule 3, Sections 1(a) and (b)) provides that all buildings and lands used or developed for any purpose, are rateable. The basic premise under the Act is that all interests (including buildings) and all developed land are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4. <\/p><p>No re-classification of properties from rateable status to exempt status has occurred within the general equine industry since the Valuation Act 2001 came into force on 2 May 2002. The only element of the equine industry which satisfies the exemption provisions in Schedule 4 is the breeding of horses. Buildings used for breeding of horses are classified as being of agricultural use and are &quot;farm buildings&quot; as defined in the Act. Therefore these buildings are exempted from the payment of rates under paragraph 5 of Schedule 4. On the other hand, buildings used for the training of racehorses, recreational equestrian purposes or livery premises are rateable under the Act because they are considered to be part of a commercial enterprise. Such buildings would typically include stables for horses, covered riding arenas, tack rooms and ancillary buildings used to support the enterprise. <\/p><p>While acknowledging the important contribution which all elements of the equine industry make to the economy, I can advise the Deputy that there are no plans to reclassify these as exempt from rates. To do so would be at variance with the provisions in the Valuation Acts which maintains the long-standing position that all property occupied and used for commercial enterprises are liable for rates. Exceptions to this key principle would quickly be followed by demands for similar treatment from the providers of other equally important services and products, which would be difficult in equity to resist. This could thus substantially reduce local authority revenues, which would have to be made good by imposing corresponding increases on the remaining ratepayers.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":136,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE02300"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[24021\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she has met or liaised with local garda&iacute; regarding the new station in Bailieborough, County Cavan, in view of the announcement of a new site; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":138,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works, OPW,  which has the responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  I am, however, advised that contracts have been exchanged in relation to the site and that a planning application is expected to be made in the near future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Surveillance Operations","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE02600"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[24383\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"with regard to the designated judge under the 1993 and 2011 Acts and the interception of postal packages and retention of data, the detail of the most recent visit by the designated judge to the relevant authorities, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the time they spent at each location; the number of files the designated judge examined; if she has satisfied herself with the detail of the most recent report in 2016 by the designated judge; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>The operation of the provisions of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 and the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 are overseen by a serving judge of the High Court designated for that purpose by the Government.

To date, the Inspectorate has completed 11 reports, including the <i>2014 Crime Investigation<\/i>report  and the <i>2015 &quot;Changing Policing in <\/i>Ireland&quot; report<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>While the Garda Inspectorate has no statutory responsibility for the monitoring of the implementation of recommendations made in its reports, a process to do so was established with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2008 which resulted in the publication of status implementation update reports twice a year on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s website. The last such regular update was published in November 2013 when, I understand, the process was interrupted due to pressure of work. However, the Inspectorate and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are now working towards the production, in tabular form, of a document which will indicate the position regarding the implementation of recommendations contained in a number of Inspectorate reports up to and including the Crime Investigation report. Once completed, the results will be published on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the statutory position regarding the monitoring of the implementation of recommendations made in Inspectorate reports has changed.  Section 117(A) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act provides for a role for the Policing Authority in  monitoring the measures taken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement the recommendations contained in reports prepared by the  Inspectorate. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner published her Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 in June 2016.  This Programme includes recommendations from the various Garda Inspectorate Reports, including the two most recent Inspectorate Reports referred to above. Key reforms being implemented include the replacement of the current District model of policing with a Divisional model where responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis.  This will be subject to modifications to ensure the close relationship with communities is maintained in large rural Divisions.  In line with international norms, a medium term target of 20% civilians to be achieved by 2021 has been set. <\/p><p>The implementation of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme is primarily a matter for the Commissioner. However, the Government decided that the Policing Authority should be requested to monitor the implementation of the agreed recommendations in 'Changing Policing in Ireland' and to report to me at regular intervals. This process is underway. <\/p><p>In July, the Government approved a Five Year Reform and High Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This Plan marries the agreed recommendations in 'Changing Policing in Ireland' with a major investment programme that will increase the number of garda&iacute; to 15,000; double the number of civilians to 4,000; and more than double the number of reserves members to 2,000.  This investment in human capital is supported by a &euro;300 million capital plan that will deliver leading-edge technology and other capital infrastructure to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2017 Estimates reflect this commitment by providing the resources to recruit 800 garda&iacute;, 500 civilians and 300 reserves in 2017. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, I recently announced the terms of reference and members of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  I expect that the Commission will have regard to appropriate structures for oversight and accountability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE03200"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[24334\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will review the prices being charged in the shop in Mosney to persons in the direct provision system to determine if these are at a reasonable level compared to other shops; the reasons for differences; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":147,"content":"<p>Following from the McMahon report and in accordance with the Programme for a Partnership Government, improvements in facilities are being implemented across all family centres. One of the key recommendations in the McMahon report was in relation to the capacity of families to cook for themselves and it is to this end that the system in Mosney was introduced. <\/p><p>Rather than a simple, generic system of providing meals though a canteen which has been the subject of ongoing criticism, the Reception &amp;amp; Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department has worked with Mosney management to introduce a new system whereby residents are in a position to select produce and food products in a food hall and prepare meals for themselves and their families. It is important to note that there is no charge to the residents for this facility. The points in use in the system do not have a monetary equivalent and points cannot be purchased for cash.<\/p><p>This system is the culmination of a lengthy analysis process and included full consultation with a representative group of residents in Mosney. This system allows individual residents to choose those items they feel are right for their family.  There are 600 products available in the Mosney Food Hall and it is open to any resident to suggest new items, which will be added to the stock,  provided that a food source is identified that fulfils all food traceability and safety.  All basic food categories are available and RIA is satisfied sufficient choice is available, even before the addition of further products, to allow parents to make healthy choices for their families. <\/p><p>It is also important to note that the system is under constant review and is a work in progress. It is being monitored by RIA and feedback from this project along with other similar projects due to commence soon will continue to inform the operation of the entire system - in essence, issues arising from the roll-out in Mosney will inform the system elsewhere.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE03500"},{"type":"question","counter":149,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[24052\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding the case of a person (details supplied).","asker":"1291","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":150,"content":"<p>The applicant referred to by the Deputy received a formal offer to participate in the <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme in March this year, to which a reply is awaited.

The crucial point, however, is that every case has been reviewed by independent counsel who made an objective recommendation based on the details supplied by the complainants themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commissions of Investigation","counter":178,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE06500"},{"type":"question","counter":179,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[23998\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE06600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if commission of investigation reports and evidence gathered by commissions of investigation cannot be used as evidence in court; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":180,"content":"<p>Under section 19 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 none of the following is admissible as evidence against a person in any criminal or other proceedings:<\/p><p>- a statement or admission made by the person to a commission;<\/p><p>- a document given or sent to a commission pursuant to a direction or request of the commission to the person, or<\/p><p>- a document specified in an affidavit of documents made by the person and given to a commission pursuant to a direction or request of the commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Status","counter":181,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE06800"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[24003\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300058#WRE06900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will grant family citizenship to persons (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":183,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that there is no record of a current application for a certificate of naturalisation from persons with the family name referred to by the Deputy.<\/p><p>Section 15 of the Act provides that the Minister may, in her absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.

As the Deputy will also be aware, the Committee is examining the Garda Commissioner in relation to the Interim Audit Report and intends to resume that examination in the coming weeks, and will report subsequently.  The Garda Commissioner has been Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote since July 2006.  Very particular responsibilities lie with Accounting Officers under the law and you will appreciate that I must be careful not to interfere in any way with the work of that Committee. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the period prior to the Commissioner assuming the role of Accounting Officer, my officials have provided available information to the Committee in relation to that period.  The Deputy will appreciate that the period prior to the appointment of the Garda Commissioner as Accounting Officer relates to over 10 years ago, with consequent difficulties in establishing precise facts in relation to detailed aspects of this matter, particularly in the absence of relevant records.  As previously stated, the Department became aware of certain issues in relation to Templemore having received representations from local TDs in relation to the desire of people to continue to have access to Templemore Golf Club.  Subsequently, the Department received the interim Internal Audit report which highlighted the issues around the lack of proper financial controls in operation in Templemore which are now being examined by the Committee.<\/p>  <p>  In the circumstances, I believe that the best course at this stage is to allow the examination by the PAC continue unhindered and can assure the Deputy that I will pay very careful attention to the proceedings at the Committee and, in particular, any report that it may make.  If action is required on my part as a result, I will not hesitate to take it.<\/p>  <p>  While, of course, there has to be accountability in relation to what went on at the College, the immediate priority has to be ensuring the problems identified in the audit are resolved.  I have been assured that the Garda Authorities recognise the gravity of the issues raised and that they are taking comprehensive steps to progress the recommendations in the Report.  External governance expertise and auditors have been engaged.  A Steering Committee, chaired by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Chief Administrative Officer and including a representative from my Department, is overseeing the implementation of the recommendations. In addition, upon receipt of the report I referred it to the Policing Authority to oversee the implementation of the recommendations and to report back to me each quarter.  I expect the Authority to submit its first report to me in July.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I am advised that the Commissioner has requested an  Assistant Commissioner to examine the Report with a view to establishing if there are any matters of discipline or criminality that need to be addressed and, if so, how such matters should be progressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300059#WRF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting Applications","counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300059#WRF02200"},{"type":"question","counter":206,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[24153\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300059#WRF02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps she is taking to ease the backlog of Garda vetting applications for entrants into Templemore; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":207,"content":"<p>I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that there is at present no backlog in respect of Garda vetting applications for persons who are seeking recruitment into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  I am further informed that the vetting process for applicants to become Garda Trainees may vary depending on the circumstances of each individual application.

Section 9(10) of the Act provides the Commissioner is independent in the performance of his functions and decisions with regard to the selection of rating authority areas for revaluation is his sole prerogative. As Minister for Justice and Equality, I do not have any role in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  Revaluation is a process where all rateable properties in a Local Authority area are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date. Following the first revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area are then carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation (Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001). The revaluation provisions in the Valuation Acts provide for revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as changes in the business environment or infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property. The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability across businesses more equitably based on modern circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  The national revaluation programme currently underway is the first general revaluation of all commercial property in the State since the middle of the 19th century. It is a very significant undertaking involving the valuation of some 150,000 commercial rateable properties. Completing the first revaluation and getting properties in every Local Authority area onto the 5-10 year cycle of revaluations provided for in the legislation represents a sea-change for the rateable valuation system. The present position is that all rateable properties in the Dublin, Waterford and Limerick local authority areas are now re-valued. In addition, 13 public utilities representing some of the largest ratepayers in the State have been revalued on a global basis. In total, this represents approximately 57% of the national rateable valuation base in monetary value terms or 33% in numerical terms.  <\/p>  <p>  Significant progress is being made and the programme has established a momentum which is now being built upon as the current phase of work known as &ldquo;REVAL 2017&rdquo; is well underway which covers the following nine counties - Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Kildare, Offaly, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny where a revaluation is being undertaken for the first time since the nineteenth century. A second revaluation of commercial properties in South Dublin County Council area is also underway. I understand that the Commissioner intends to commence revaluation of County Laois over the coming months using new &ldquo;Occupier Assisted Valuation&rdquo; principles provided for in the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015. The Commissioner has also indicated that revaluation of a further seven Local Authorities (Cavan, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow) will commence later in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Proposed Valuation Certificates issued in January 2017 for counties Leitrim, Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath and in March 2017 for counties Kildare, Offaly and Sligo. Proposed Valuation Certificates for Carlow and Kilkenny issued this month.  Additionally, proposed certificates of valuation issued to all ratepayers in South Dublin County Council area on 13 April 2017.  While generally, most ratepayers are satisfied with the valuations proposed to be placed on their properties, there is an extensive system of redress available to ratepayers who are dissatisfied with the proposed valuations or with any particular on the certificate relating to their property. In this regard, a dissatisfied ratepayer can make representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days of the date of issue of the certificate. The Valuation Office will consider the representations and may or may not change the proposed valuation depending on the circumstances of each individual property.  A certificate of final valuation will issue to each ratepayer in the above counties in September 2017 and the valuation shown on the certificate will be used as the basis for the assessment of rates by the local authority with effect from 1 January 2018. If a ratepayer is still dissatisfied with the valuation on the final certificate which they will receive next September, they will have a right to lodge a formal appeal with the Valuation Tribunal, an independent statutory body established for the purpose of hearing appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation. <\/p>  <p>  The position in relation to the global valuation of public utility undertakings is that, as required under section 53(6) of the Valuation Act 2001 as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, the Commissioner carried out a valuation of two utilities in 2014, seven utilities in 2015 and two utilities in 2016.  Global valuations are carried out on a rolling five-yearly cycle as provided for in the Acts. The initial round of global valuations was carried out in the period 2004 to 2006 following the passage of the 2001 Act. The second round of global valuations was carried out in the period 2009 to 2011 and the most recent round was commenced in 2014 and concluded in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the global valuations cover all the networks and systems of  lines, cables, masts, posts, pylons, wires and other ancillary constructions which pertain to the use or development of the utility and which are necessary to get its  products or service, whether in the areas of electricity, telecommunications, transport or gas to the consumer. The global valuation process relates solely to the network occupied by the particular public utility undertaking and used by it for its principal objects or purposes such as the supply of electricity or gas or the provision of telecommunications or public transport. Other properties such as retail units offices or industrial space occupied by the undertaking but not used by it for its principal objects or purposes are not included in the global valuation. Such other properties operated by the utility are valued in the same manner as properties occupied by other businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The same right of appeal that exists for commercial ratepayers also has application in the case of public utilities that are dissatisfied with the valuation in the final valuation certificate. This right of appeal may be exercised by the utility, a rating authority and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to the Valuation Tribunal. There is a further right of appeal to the higher Courts on a point of law. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300059#WRF03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates Exemptions","counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300059#WRF03800"},{"type":"question","counter":222,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[24301\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300059#WRF03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if green waste facilities which compost green waste into fertiliser that is sold for commercial purposes is a rateable activity on which commercial rates should be charged by a local authority; if she will have the matter dealt with by the Valuation Office; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":223,"content":"<p>The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Acts, 2001-2015 and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility.

The Policing Authority represents one of the most significant developments in policing since the foundation of the State.  It constitutes a major element of the comprehensive programme of justice reform which is being delivered by the Government, aimed both at ensuring continuing confidence in the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and at supporting the women and men of the service in the work they do on our behalf every day.<\/p>  <p>  I strongly believe that the Authority has made a significant impact since its establishment in January 2016. I am informed that the Authority has been focusing, as a matter of priority, on its functions that have statutory deadlines and reform significance. This included agreeing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Strategy Statement July 2016-2018, establishing Policing Priorities and a Policing Plan for 2017, launching the new Garda Code of Ethics and reporting on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Protected Disclosures Policy. It has also met regularly with the Commissioner and her senior team to discuss the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to policing matters, as well as undertaking selection competitions for appointments to senior ranks within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) has a hugely important role in ensuring that public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is safeguarded.  I am committed to ensuring that we have in place the most effective possible mechanism for the investigation of complaints.  GSOC has been operating for 10 years now, and I believe it is time to examine the legislative provisions relating to the manner in which complaints are made to and dealt with by GSOC.  I recently sought and was granted Government approval to prepare Heads of a Bill to amend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to enable GSOC to carry out its functions more effectively and efficiently and help continue to ensure proper accountability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in providing a service to the public.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Inspectorate performs a very valuable service in seeking to ensure that the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is maintained.  The Garda Inspectorate report 'Changing Policing in Ireland', published in December 2015, is a comprehensive report into all aspects of the administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Last July the Government approved my proposals for a Five Year Reform and High Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which combines the Government&rsquo;s response to the report of the Garda Inspectorate and the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government to increase the visibility, effectiveness and responsiveness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In this regard it sets out an overall vision of a Garda workforce of 21,000 comprising 15,000 Garda&iacute;, 2,000 Reserves and 4,000 civilians to be achieved incrementally over five years in tandem with the delivery of reforms. The delivery of this overall vision is supported by the provision in Budget 2017 for the recruitment of 800 trainee Garda&iacute;, up to 500 additional civilian staff and 300 Reserves.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, published in June 2016, is the vehicle for the implementation of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s wide range of recommendations aimed at her organisation. I have asked the Policing Authority to monitor implementation of these agreed recommendations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to report to me on progress on a quarterly basis. I received the first report in January and have published it on my Department's website. I have recently received the second progress report and I am currently considering its contents. I will publish it and each future progress report in due course. <\/p>  <p>  The Modernisation and Renewal Programme will also address many of the detailed recommendations in the Garda Inspectorate's 2014 Report on Crime Investigation. Important strategic issues being addressed include, a new Performance Accountability and Learning Framework, (and IT system); a Control Room Strategy to provide for centralised handling of all requests for service from the public, linked to a modern Computer Aided Dispatch system; improved arrangements for Rosters and Duty Management; enhancements to Incident Management, Investigation Management and Victim Engagement. Taking account of the number and complexity of many of the recommendations, full implementation is being pursued on a phased basis. <\/p>  <p>  I believe the new Code of Ethics, prepared by the Policing Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in conjunction with a range of stakeholders, is an important milestone. I also welcome the commitments in the Policing Plan 2017 to embed this Code into the day to day thinking and actions of the organisation. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has recently approved the membership and final terms of reference for the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. The terms of reference encompass all functions carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including community safety, state security and immigration, and also the full range of bodies that have a role in providing oversight and accountability including the three statutory bodies, but also my Department and the Government. They provide for a comprehensive examination of all aspects of policing in Ireland. The individuals who make up the Commission have impressive track records in their respective fields. The membership seeks to strike the right balance between domestic and international perspectives and between academic, operational policing, community and victims&rsquo; perspectives, change management, governance and indeed Government experience. These are people of the highest calibre and will bring the necessary diversity of thought and expertise to the task. It is clear from recent events that systemic issues which have emerged require the establishment of this expert group on policing to report in a timely way on the further changes now necessary to meet the requirements of a modern police force. Crucially the Commission may bring forward immediate proposals and rolling recommendations for implementation, that it considers are required to be addressed in the short-term, in advance of its final report. The final report is due by September 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Both I and the Government are committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to provide a modern, efficient and accountable policing service and I have every confidence that the new structures which have been put in place are a significant contribution to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300059#WRF04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Data","counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300059#WRF04400"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[16719\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300059#WRF04500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on the latest CSO statistics on crime.","asker":"1224","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":229,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, is responsible for the publication of recorded crime statistics.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that the Blanchardstown Garda Station forms part of the Blanchardstown District in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West Division. The strength of the Blanchardstown District on 31 March 2017, the latest date for which figures are currently available was 308 members of whom 146 were assigned to Blanchardstown Station. There are 6 Garda Reserves and 15 civilians attached to the Blanchardstown District. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p><p>This plan is progressing apace. I am advised by the Commissioner, that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014,  just under 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide of whom 88 have been assigned to the DMR West Division. I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, in the coming years.  To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates a new recruitment drive was launched by the Commissioner earlier this month with a closing date of 1 June. The competition is being undertaken by the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner and applications should be made to www.publicjobs.ie.<\/p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will benefit all areas of Garda activity.<\/p><p>For the Deputy's information, I have set out in the following tabular the number of Garda assigned to Blanchardstown Garda Station from 2007 to 2016 and on 31 March 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, as provided by the Commissioner. <\/p><p><table><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Strength of Blanchardstown Garda Station 2007-2017<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>YEAR<\/td><td>STRENGTH<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>180<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>192<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>204<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>197<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>186<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>162<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>162<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>156<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>154<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>143<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017*<\/td><td>146<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*Up to 31 March 2017<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300060#WRG00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Correspondence","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300060#WRG00550"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[24528\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300060#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she has used a private email account (details supplied) for official business in her role as Minister for Justice and Equality; if she still uses the private email account for official business; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>The Deputy will wish to be aware that access for all staff to web based emails is restricted by security infrastructure deployed by the Department of Justice and Equality.

Data from the device is now used to verify the total number of breath tests conducted at each checkpoint.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that in addition to outlining the issues, how they had come to light, and the remedial steps taken so far, the Commissioner has: <\/p>  <p>  - announced the restructuring of traffic policing with the creation of a new Roads Policing Unit to be led by Assistant Commissioner Mick Finn; <\/p>  <p>  - announced the creation of a dedicated team under newly appointed Assistant Commissioner Michael O&rsquo;Sullivan to investigate in detail the MATs issue, including with a view to identifying and holding responsible for their actions any Garda members, whether at junior, supervisory or management level, who acted improperly; and<\/p>  <p>  - committed to forwarding the report of this investigation to the Policing Authority and Department of Justice and Equality when completed. An interim report was forwarded by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Policing Authority in advance of the Authority's recent public meeting on roads policing, which took place on 27 April 2017.   <\/p>  <p>  Assistant Commissioner Finn previously outlined new arrangements agreed with the Medical Bureau on Roads Safety (MBRS) to the effect that the MBRS would supply An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with its data on breath-testing devices on a quarterly basis, in order to ensure an independent benchmark against which Garda data can be measured. The MBRS informed me at this week's meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Road Safety that the tender for new preliminary breath testing equipment is now live and it is hoped that all stages of the process will be completed by early 2018.  New equipment which is available in the market place has the capacity to record the time, GPS location and number of persons breath-tested, and has the capacity to download the information automatically, reducing the chances of errors occurring in the data.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have written to the Chairperson of the Policing Authority in accordance with section 62O(6) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 (as amended) to report to me on its oversight of the issues which have arisen in relation to mandatory alcohol testing over the coming period.  In particular, I requested that an investigation should be conducted to examine all issues arising, addressing to the extent possible the reasons why the issues have arisen; the incidence and scale of the issues; and the solutions implemented to ensure there is no recurrence.  It is expected that the Authority will engage outside expertise to carry out this work and they Authority has informed me that they are in discussions with the Office of Government Procurement to do so. The Deputy will appreciate that I need to await the conclusion of the Authority's work in this area before I am in a position to comment further on this matter. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that there is ongoing engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority in relation to this matter, including in the context of the Authority's recent public meeting with the Garda Commissioner. <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, the Deputy will be aware that I received Government approval last month to establish a Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. The Commission is charged to undertake a comprehensive examination of all aspects of policing, including all functions currently carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Earlier this month, I was delighted to appoint Ms Kathleen O'Toole, a former Chief Inspector of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, among other positions, to the position of chair of the Commission. Only last week, I announced the full membership of the Commission and published the final terms of reference for the Commission following approval by Government. The new Commission will provide a critical focus on the accountability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and will complement and enhance the valuable and important work that is being spearheaded by the Policing Authority, the Inspectorate and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300060#WRG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Policy","counter":271,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300060#WRG02250"},{"type":"question","counter":272,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[24601\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300060#WRG02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the way in which immigration determinations are made; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1267","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":273,"content":"<p>The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department processes around 250,000 applications each year ranging across a wide range of avenues for immigration.

However, owing to a number of unique factors pertaining to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the fact that it is a single national police force which provides a security and intelligence service as well as a policing service, international policing models may require tailoring to our circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  Section 117(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 specifically requires the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to benchmark their recommendations by reference to the best standards of comparable police services.

The Commissioner&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 is the vehicle for implementation of the some 240 recommendations (including sub-recommendations) of the Inspectorate report aimed at An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I am committed to publishing all future reports. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maintains close liaison with other law enforcement agencies internationally and the work of Garda liaison officers who are permanently based in other jurisdictions and in international bodies such as Interpol and Europol, greatly facilitate the prompt exchange of information and intelligence on criminal activity.

This will be supplemented by funding of some &euro;4 million which is available for new vehicles in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is also being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300060#WRG03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Anti-Terrorism Measures","counter":293,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300060#WRG03750"},{"type":"question","counter":294,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[24694\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300060#WRG03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to be upgraded and supported to combat acts of terrorism; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":295,"content":"<p>The House should be aware that the primary security threat in the State is that posed by the so-called 'dissident' republican paramilitary groups who continue to oppose peace on this island.  Combatting these groups remains a priority for the Government and the Garda Authorities.  The Garda&iacute; continue to take actions to disrupt these groups and their activities, and they have had many successes in this regard.  The Garda&iacute; will continue to work closely with their police and security counterparts in Northern Ireland in tackling this threat.<\/p>  <p>  Attacks such as last night&rsquo;s bomb in Manchester are a reminder that no state can be considered immune from the threat from international terrorism.  There has been no change to the threat assessment for Ireland.  The threat assessment is that while an attack is possible, it is unlikely.  The level of threat is kept under constant review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly in the light of ongoing developments and the current international climate.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Authorities will continue to take all necessary security measures proportionate to security threats and all the relevant agencies here co-operate closely in respect of any threats identified.  Of their very nature, it would be unwise to disclose publicly the detail of security measures.  Where needed, the considerable skills and resources of the Defence Forces are available in support.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has considerable operational capacities in countering terrorism and in responding to critical incidents.  There is, in particular, a highly trained and well-equipped special intervention capability in the Emergency Response Unit that is supported by the regional Armed Support Units and the range of other resources across the Garda organisation.  The additional funding of &euro;55m I secured for the Garda Vote last year included dedicated additional resources for countering the threat from international terrorism.  As the Deputy will know, an additional dedicated Armed Response Unit for the Dublin area was established last year.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carries out dedicated, counter-terrorism exercises on a routine basis and works with the Defence Forces and other agencies and services in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Authorities continue to work closely with their EU and other international counterparts in responding to the shared threat of international terrorism, and information and intelligence-sharing is essential in this regard.  In this regard, I am committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to enhance their connectivity to a range of EU and other international resources.  A very significant programme of work is being brought forward in this regard, supported by dedicated funding.  This work includes connection to the EU Schengen Information System, IT mechanisms for exchanging criminal fingerprint and DNA data and in developing systems for processing travel-related data to support border security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300060#WRG03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":296,"content":"<p>Question No. 148 answered with Question No. 143.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Reorganisation","counter":297,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300060#WRG04050"},{"type":"question","counter":298,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[24696\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300060#WRG04100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the likely extent of reorganisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the aftermath of various inquiries, with a view to restoring confidence and support for the force; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":299,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that there is an extensive programme of reform underway arising from reports into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, some arising from inquiries into allegations of misconduct, others from reviews into aspects of the operation and administration of the organisation. While these have made, and continue to make, an invaluable contribution to ensuring that we have an effective police service, they were not tasked with examining policing in a &ldquo;root and branch&rdquo; manner.  In addition institutional arrangements for governance and oversight have evolved significantly in recent years in a piecemeal fashion. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is approaching its 100th anniversary. Its members have served with dedication and courage over the decades with some, sadly, having made the ultimate sacrifice, but Ireland is a very different country today than it was at its foundation. It is facing challenges rooted in the rapidly changing nature of society and of crime.<\/p>  <p>  In these circumstances, it is right that we take a step back to ask some fundamental questions about how our State should be policed in the future, what structures are appropriate - is a single police and security service still the best model, to whom should it be accountable, what sort of culture should it embody? I believe the decision taken by Government to establish an independent Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, to be chaired by Ms Kathleen O'Toole will prove to be a very important one capable of leaving a valuable legacy. The terms of reference and membership of the Commission were confirmed by Government last week. I know that Ms O'Toole wishes the work of the Commission to get underway without delay and I welcome her decision to hold its first meeting tomorrow 24 May. <\/p>  <p>  An important consideration in establishing the Commission was that it would not impede the existing reform programme. The Commission is to report by September 2018 and much can be done in the meantime to modernise the administration and operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I am determined that there will be no let-up in the reform drive. The work of the oversight bodies must continue and the Government's support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by providing the necessary resources for recruitment and investment must continue. <\/p>  <p>  Crucially, the Commission may bring forward immediate proposals and rolling recommendations for implementation, that it considers are required to be addressed in the short-term, and in advance of its final report.

Full details on the two primary strands of the programme are set out below for the information of the Deputy.<\/p><p>Of the 1,259 people who have arrived thus far under the IRPP (including unaccompanied minors), a total of 543 persons are now living in the community in various locations nationwide.  It is expected that in the region of another 100 people will be housed within the community by the end of June 2017.  IRPP officials are working closely with local authorities across the State and the Irish Red Cross to secure appropriate accommodation for those currently in emergency accommodation and all future arrivals.  <\/p><p>Resettlement strand of the programme<\/p><p>Taking account of the situation in the Middle East, and the plight of the refugees, the T&aacute;naiste announced that Ireland would accept 520 persons for resettlement over an 18-month period to the end of 2017.  This was almost double the figure proposed for Ireland by the European Commission and was delivered a year ahead of the Commission deadline.  <\/p><p>In addition, the Government announced last year that it was extending the resettlement programme to take in a further two groups of 260 refugees (520 in total) from Lebanon in 2017 , most of whom are expected to be of Syrian origin.  The first group of 260 have already arrived following a selection mission last October and a further mission to Beirut in late March\/early April this year selected sufficient numbers to ensure the overall total of 1,040 is reached by the end of 2017. <\/p><p>Relocation strand of the programme<\/p><p>Despite initial delays outside of Ireland's control in respect of the operation of the 'hotspots' on the ground in Greece, Ireland has to-date taken in a total of 459 people from Greece under relocation.  A monthly schedule has been agreed with the Greek authorities which will sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its initial commitments to Greece within the time frame envisaged by the Programme. <\/p><p>Ireland has agreed to take up to 20 unaccompanied minors (UAMs) under the relocation aspects of the IRPP.Fundamentally, Ireland's capacity to take UAMs is determined by Tusla, the child and family agency. 6 UAMs (by the Irish definition) have arrived in Ireland from Greece under the programme.  However, relatively few UAMs appear to be available within the cohort eligible for relocation and efforts continue to seek further transfers within this cohort.All UAMs that have arrived to-date are in the care of Tusla.<\/p><p>As regards Italy, the relocation mechanism from Italy to Ireland has yet to commence due to issues with the Italian authorities surrounding the security assessment of migrants assigned to other Member States.  Intensive efforts are ongoing to resolve this, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level, including through the European Commission.<\/p><p>The total target for relocation EU-wide in the two Council Decisions for relocation also includes an unallocated portion which in the case of Ireland amounts to \u00a0910 persons. These numbers have not yet been allocated as between Greece and Italy.It is understood that the European Commission are examining allocating this &quot;unassigned&quot; portion and if they do Ireland will immediately work towards relocating them.\u00a0<\/p><p>Calais Unaccompanied Minors<\/p><p>In a further gesture of humanitarian assistance towards the most vulnerable caught up in the migration crisis and following a debate in the D&aacute;il, the Government also committed to taking up to 200 additional unaccompanied minors (UAMs) from France who were previously resident in the migrant camp at Calais.  The Child and Family Agency, Tusla, which provides welfare and protection services for unaccompanied minors who enter the State, comes under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Dr. Katherine Zappone TD.  I understand that 21 young persons have been relocated to this jurisdiction to-date: 19 of whom are currently in the care of Tusla and 2 of whom have been reunited with family.  <\/p><p>Following the Dail resolution on unaccompanied minors who were previously in unofficial camps near Calais, Minister Zappone asked Tusla to put in place the supports needed to coordinate its role in this effort.  Tusla launched the Calais Special Project (CSP) and this is being led operationally by their separated children's team.  I would note that Tusla&rsquo;s separated children team also care for unaccompanied minors who arrive on their own and those that are being relocated under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. <\/p><p>The French authorities have provided assistance in meeting with young persons who were previously in unofficial camps near Calais and have an interest in relocating to Ireland.  Tusla officials and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carry out the interviews with the young persons to minimise the time required and any unnecessary duplication of effort.  Officials of my Department coordinate with colleagues in Tusla in relation to immigration matters, ensuring that the unaccompanied minors arriving in the State meet the terms of the D&aacute;il motion, transit seamlessly through their port of entry and receive refugee status. Further information on the operation of this initiative can be obtained from Tusla or my colleague,  the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Dr. Katherine Zappone TD.<\/p><p>The above initiatives therefore leave just a small residual balance to be allocated from the Government decision to take 4,000 persons.  <\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that there are many moving parts to such a programme given the large number of state bodies and non-governmental organisations and agencies involved at both national and international level and not all aspects are entirely within the control of my officials.  Overseeing a programme that touches on virtually all aspects of the lives of 4,000 vulnerable people is also a hugely labour intensive operation.In these circumstances, I am satisfied that everything that can be done within my Department to ensure the Government meets its humanitarian undertakings under the programme is being done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300061#WRH01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unaccompanied Minors and Separated Children","counter":323,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300061#WRH01250"},{"type":"question","counter":324,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[24706\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300061#WRH01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress that has been made to date in 2017 in accepting unaccompanied minors from the now dismantled Calais camp as agreed to in a motion passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":325,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government committed to taking up to 200 unaccompanied minors (UAMs) from France who were previously resident in the migrant camp at Calais.

Something had to be done to preserve and boost jobs and it is an unavoidable fact that difficult economic situations require hard and very often unpopular decisions.  All sectors of the economy had to contribute to the recovery plan and the levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the very generous tax reliefs that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefitted from over many years. <\/p>  <p>  The original 0.6% stamp duty levy on pension fund assets ended in 2014.  The additional levy of 0.15% which I introduced for 2014 and 2015, mainly to help continue to fund Jobs Initiative, also ended in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and to help create new jobs and the Initiative has been a success in this regard.  The measures introduced include expenditure measures such as the JobBridge and Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the temporary halving of the lower employer PRSI rate. <\/p>  <p>  The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State.

Principal among these was the consolidation of shares as well as the redemption and conversion of the State&rsquo;s Preference Shares. As you know, AIB had in excess of 523 billion Ordinary Shares in issue (increasing to around 678 billion as a result of the conversion) which was extraordinarily high for a public company. <\/p>  <p>  All shareholders on the register of members of AIB as at the &lsquo;Ordinary Share Consolidation Record Time&rsquo; received one New Ordinary Share for every 250 Ordinary Shares held, rounding up where the number of shares owned was not divisible by 250. The Ordinary Share Consolidation assisted in reducing AIB&rsquo;s share price volatility and brought the bank&rsquo;s share count back to levels more typical of a stable corporate entity. The Ordinary Share Consolidation was structured so that it did not result in the removal of any shareholder from the register of members of AIB and the rounding up process ensured that no shareholder was disadvantaged. <\/p>  <p>  The part conversion of Preference Shares into equity had the effect of diluting other holders of Ordinary Shares, such that their stake in AIB was reduced. The State acquired its new ordinary shares at the estimated fair market value of AIB at the time. The conversion price (pre-consolidation) was set at 1.7c per share which was agreed as fair and reasonable by the Board of AIB having consulted with their ESM advisor. All shareholders in the bank were asked to vote on the proposed transaction at the EGM on the 16th December 2015.

I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers. \u00a0The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.\u00a0 This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.\u00a0 Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all.\u00a0 It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.<\/p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system. Teachers are not paid equally. For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching. Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods. Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector. A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the recently published analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. <\/p>  <p>  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve. However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of public service pay talks.\u00a0 My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, invited the Public Services Committee of ICTU to discussions on public service pay and a continued approach to the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation and these discussions are now underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300063#WRKK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Educational Psychological Service","counter":440,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300063#WRKK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":441,"qnumday":199,"qnumall":"[24008\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300063#WRKK00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if NEPS, National Educational Psychological Service, has a policy with regard to assessing younger siblings if a child has been diagnosed with a learning difficulty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":442,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychology service to all primary and post primary schools through an assigned NEPS psychologist and in some cases receive assessment services through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers. <\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. <\/p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreement reached with TUI and INTO in September 2016 will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4,600 and &euro;6,700) for new entrant teachers.\u00a0 The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.\u00a0 The pay increases for new teachers were also available to ASTI members under the proposals which members recently balloted on.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.\u00a0 This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.\u00a0 Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  Further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector. A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay across the public service will be informed by the recently published analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. <\/p>  <p>  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve. However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of public service pay talks.\u00a0 My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, invited the Public Services Committee of ICTU to discussions on public service pay and a continued approach to the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation and these discussions are now underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300063#WRKK03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":472,"content":"<p>Questions

2013\/14 and 2013\/14 to 2014\/15. Data is not available for all of the years requested.<\/p><p>The Higher Education Authority (HEA) has recently published (April 2017) it's latest Study of Progression in Irish Higher Education, which provides an analysis of data relating to non-progression of 2013\/14 full-time undergraduate new entrants to HEA funded institutions.  The study shows that the proportion of new entrants in 2013\/14 who did not progress is 15% across all sectors and NFQ levels. This compares to 16% in 2012\/13.The rates of non-progression vary within and between sectors.<\/p><p>Below average progression rates continue in the fields of Construction and Related Services, Computer Science and Engineering, with again variation between sectors and institutions.However, there is some improvement reported in progression rates for Computer Science with rates increasing from 80% to 84%.  Institutes of Technology rates have increased from 74% to 80% compared to universities from 85% to 88%. This would indicate that the funding made available for retention measures is having a positive impact.<\/p><p>One of the key objectives which my Department has set for Higher Education is to improve equity of access and student pathways. The HEA works with the institutions to improve recruitment and to tackle early drop out. There are a wide range of initiatives which can contribute to better recruitment and retention. These include:<\/p><p>-  Access Programmes<\/p><p>-  Surveys of Student Experiences<\/p><p>-  Extra tuition in areas of known difficulty<\/p><p>-  Improvement in first year experience<\/p><p>The HEA is working to ensure that good practice in this area is disseminated and implemented across all institutions and disciplines.<\/p><p>The HEA have produced a discussion paper on the factors that contribute to &lsquo;student success&rsquo;.  A Working Group has also been established, chaired by the HEA, and which comprises representatives from across the higher education sector. The intention is to identify the type of strategies and measures that have been shown to be successful in different institutional contexts. The National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education is currently facilitating a focused scoping exercise to inform the activities of the Working Group.  The scoping exercise is being chaired by the Union of Students of Ireland. This will ensure that the student voice is central to this process. It is expected that the Working Group will produce its report by the end of 2017.<\/p><p>The research shows that there are certain factors consistently associated with non progression in courses. These include prior educational attainment and parental occupation. Colleges are encouraged to develop access and progress in their strategies. A role can also be played by broadening the choice of education and training paths available to students and my ambition is that 20% of pupils would have the option of apprenticeships or traineeships in the coming years.<table><tr><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2007\/08 to 2008\/09<\/td><td>2012\/13 to 2013\/14<\/td><td>2013\/14 to 2014\/15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Institute<\/b><\/td><td><b>Non-Progression* (%, Number)<\/b><\/td><td><b>Non-Progression* (%, Number)<\/b><\/td><td><b>Non-Progression* (%, Number)<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City University<\/td><td>11% (191)<\/td><td>12% (272)<\/td><td>13% (304)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>University College Dublin<\/td><td>9% (325)<\/td><td>11% (440)<\/td><td>10% (429)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>University College Cork<\/td><td>9% (296)<\/td><td>10% (303)<\/td><td>10% (333)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NUI, Galway<\/td><td>9% (236)<\/td><td>13% (385)<\/td><td>12% (363)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>University of Limerick<\/td><td>9% (179)<\/td><td>13% (294)<\/td><td>12% (271)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Maynooth University<\/td><td>10% (162)<\/td><td>9% (175)<\/td><td>9% (199)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Trinity College Dublin<\/td><td>8% (212)<\/td><td>7% (206)<\/td><td>9% (242)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Athlone IT<\/td><td>21% (175)<\/td><td>21% (250)<\/td><td>21% (224)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>IT Blanchardstown<\/td><td>24% (80)<\/td><td>29% (232)<\/td><td>29% (256)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork IT<\/td><td>21% (392)<\/td><td>20% (347)<\/td><td>22% (377)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>IT Carlow<\/td><td>24% (232)<\/td><td>21% (240)<\/td><td>17% (185)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dundalk IT<\/td><td>24% (297)<\/td><td>21% (246)<\/td><td>18% (219)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Deisgn and Technology<\/td><td>16% (82)<\/td><td>15% (83)<\/td><td>17% (92)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin Institute of Technology<\/td><td>16% (400)<\/td><td>20% (695)<\/td><td>17% (592)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway-Mayo IT<\/td><td>28% (482)<\/td><td>29% (445)<\/td><td>25% (398)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick IT<\/td><td>23% (220)<\/td><td>24% (330)<\/td><td>27% (401)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Letterkenny IT<\/td><td>22% (174)<\/td><td>24% (217)<\/td><td>25% (211)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>IT Sligo<\/td><td>23% (231)<\/td><td>25% (311)<\/td><td>25% (279)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>IT Tallaght<\/td><td>30% (183)<\/td><td>23% (186)<\/td><td>24% (197)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>IT Tralee<\/td><td>18% (93)<\/td><td>27% (200)<\/td><td>22% (155)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford IT<\/td><td>22% (384)<\/td><td>21% (414)<\/td><td>19% (363)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>St.Patrick's College Drumcondra<\/td><td>3% (16)<\/td><td>4% (25)<\/td><td>4% (25)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mary Immaculate College Limerick<\/td><td>5% (33)<\/td><td>5% (35)<\/td><td>4% (31)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mater Dei Institute of Education<\/td><td>4% (3)<\/td><td>12% (11)<\/td><td>9% (7)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National College of Art and Design<\/td><td>5% (7)<\/td><td>6% (11)<\/td><td>10% (7)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>St.Angela's College, Sligo<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>10% (15)<\/td><td>13% (22)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>#<\/td><td>#<\/td><td>#<\/td><td>#<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>*Note : Non-progression rates refer to all NQF levels (level 8 for Universities and Colleges and level 6,7 and 8 for Institutes of Technology)<\/td><td>#<\/td><td>#<\/td><td>#<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300063#WRKK04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Institutes of Technology Staff","counter":485,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300063#WRKK04800"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[24258\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300063#WRKK04900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the whole time equivalent positions at WIT, Waterford Institute of Technology, by category in each of the years 2007 to 2016 and to date in 2017, in tabular form;

The Circular also advises that schools should consult with parents on their views and suggestions on cost reduction initiatives. It is to be expected that in some schools there will be a divergence of opinions on what type of school uniform students should wear. To ensure that the views of all parents are catered for, the Circular is requesting that schools provide parents with the option to purchase all elements of a school uniform from various stores.<\/p><p>Each of the main education partners where consulted during the preparation of this Circular. As part of their submission, the National Parents Council &ndash; Primary included the findings of a survey they had conducted in 2016 with almost 5,000 parents.

The Charter is an initiative of the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, working in association with the Arts Council.  Good progress has been made on collaboration and implementation of the Charter objectives to date by my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.<\/p><p>The Creative Ireland programme provides a new platform and new opportunities to continue and build on the work done to date with the Charter objectives.  Over the course of the programme the Charter and its objectives will be embraced, fast-tracked, and resourced as a core element of the <i>Creative Ireland<\/i>agenda.<\/p><p><b>Creative Ireland Programme\/Cl&aacute;r &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach 2017 - 2022<\/b><\/p><p>'Creative Ireland' is the Government&rsquo;s legacy programme following on from the successful 'Ireland 2016' initiative.  It is a five-year programme, from 2017 to 2022, which places creativity at the centre of public policy.  Devising an integrated implementation plan for Arts-in-Education is a priority under Pillar 1 of the programme, whose aim is to enable the creative potential of every child to be realised.  This includes the objective that by 2022 every child in Ireland will have access to tuition and participation in art, music, drama and coding.  The plan &ndash; &lsquo;Creative Children&rsquo; &ndash; is proposed to be launched this Autumn. <\/p><p>Work on the &lsquo;Creative Children&rsquo; plan is currently being progressed by my Department in close collaboration with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Arts Council.  While detailed planning is continuing it is currently envisaged that the Creative Children plan will comprise three key strands.  These connected strands will have overlapping concepts and themes, and it will be important to ensure there is co-operation and synergy across activities.  This will ensure that the overarching goal of Pillar 1 can be achieved, providing successful experiences relating to arts, creativity and innovation, for our children and young people, and for our society as a whole. <\/p><p>It is proposed that these 3 strands will be:<\/p><p>1.  Creative Schools\/Scoileanna Ild&aacute;nacha - which will see special teams of teachers and artists working together in schools to help make the arts a key part of school life. <\/p><p>2.  Professional Development Strategies, for teachers and artists.<\/p><p>3.  Further Arts Education Initiatives - under a plan that will encourage, highlight and recognise the non-formal and non-mainstream initiatives in arts education and creativity.<\/p><p>My Department is working closely with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Arts Council in developing the plan for Pillar 1 of the programme.  The overall Creative Ireland programme will shortly be considered by Government, following which the issue of programme funding will be progressed through the estimates and budgetary process. <\/p><p><b>School Policies <\/b><\/p><p>The Charter envisaged that schools, in their school policies and plans, should incorporate arts in education opportunities as an important aspect of enriching the curriculum and the wider life of the school.  The Charter Implementation Group has the agreement of my Department's Inspectorate to assist schools in this aspect of their school planning and self-evaluation.  <\/p><p><b>Capital Provision<\/b><\/p><p>The Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills has agreed that provision for arts-in-education practice and for the wider education agenda will be reflected in the design and equipping of school buildings and the parallel need for the design of new schools and other education buildings to take account of the particular needs &ndash; both directly educational and more widely community-based &ndash; of the arts, in the context of available resources. <\/p><p>The Artists-Schools Guidelines were first published in 2006.  A number of changes have occurred in the arts in education landscape in Ireland since the Guidelines were first published.  A significant change arising from the Charter was the launch of the national Arts in Education Portal for the arts in education: www.artsineducation.ie.  Given this changing landscape, the Arts Council, on behalf of the Implementation Group of the Arts in Education Charter, has reviewed the Artists-Schools Guidelines to update the guidelines to act as a useful resource for all schools.  They are presented as a dynamic resource, integrated with the Arts in Education Portal website www.artsineducation.ie. <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s first Arts in Education Portal (www.artsineducation.ie), the key national digital recourse for arts in education in Ireland, was launched in May 2015.  Already, it is proving to be a great success.  The Arts in Education Portal was developed in partnership with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and is a major resource for schools in the integration of the arts in education. <\/p><p><b>Professional Artists in Schools<\/b><\/p><p>'Exploring Teacher-Artist Partnership as a Model of CPD for Supporting &amp;amp; Enhancing Arts Education in Ireland' is an initiative led by my Department which was first piloted in 2014\/2015.  Teacher-artist partnerships offer the potential to create exciting opportunities for teachers, artists and children.  In the partnership, teachers are afforded the chance to challenge, develop, and potentially transform their practices for the benefit of the children they teach and the school communities in which they work.  The initiative is an arts-in-education initiative in which artists, from a range of disciplines, have the opportunity to have input into the domain of formal education through residency opportunities in schools.  This initiative will be delivered in Teacher Education Centres commencing 3rd July 2017 as an element of the Creative Ireland programme.<\/p><p>Further to this, a number of artist residencies in primary school teacher education colleges have recently concluded, with further residencies now being advertised.  In allowing professional artist participation in initial teacher education, teachers are better equipped to deliver arts education in classrooms.  These residencies are funded by the Arts Council. <\/p><p><b>Local Arts Education Partnership (LAEPs)<\/b><\/p><p>An objective of the Arts in Education Charter which, as it evolves, will make a major contribution to rooting arts in education at local and regional level as normative provision, is the Local Arts Education Partnerships (LAEPs).  Cavan &ndash; Monaghan LAEP has been a very successful pioneer in this arena, but other Education and Training Boards and Local Authorities are also planning initiatives along these lines.  The impact of co-operative efforts by the statutory agencies, the local authorities and the ETBs, in conjunction with the regional Teacher Education Centres and other agencies, have the potential to re-shape the landscape of arts in education provision in Ireland to the great benefit of young people throughout the country.<\/p><p><b>AR&Iacute;S &ndash; Arts Rich Schools\/Creative Schools <\/b><\/p><p>The Charter outlined that a national scheme, which would give expression to the Charter's commitment in respect of school policies and plans for 'enriching the curriculum and the wider life of the school', will be led by the Arts Council in co-operation with my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  This scheme is planned to be adopted under Pillar 1 of &lsquo;Creative Ireland&rsquo;. <\/p><p>The scheme sets out to understand, develop and celebrate arts in early years settings, primary and post-primary schools and further education and Youthreach centres.  By fully affirming the enriching power of the arts and by supporting early years settings and both school and further education communities to develop and celebrate the arts, Creative Schools will raise the profile and importance of the arts in educational settings in the medium to long term. <\/p><p>It is proposed that the initiative will begin with a pilot programme targeting a representative cohort of 150 schools, further education centres and early years settings throughout the 2017\/18 and 2018\/19 school years.<\/p><p>It will incentivise and recognise those schools (primary and post-primary) which in a range of ways make the arts a key part of school life and place the arts centrally within the life of the school community affecting pupils primarily but also teachers, parents, other staff and school community. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300064#WRL02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":522,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[24417\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300064#WRL02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps he has taken to increase out-of-hours use of school facilities to give children and young persons access to arts activities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":523,"content":"<p>As the use of school buildings is included in my Departments Action Plan for Education, I can confirm that meetings have been held between officials from my Department and the relevant stakeholder groups.

Previous searches for additional prospective school sites in this area in co-operation with Chief Valuer&rsquo;s Office and Dublin City Council focused on sites which were on the market, potential sites within Dublin City Council&rsquo;s portfolio and also substantial land holdings of other bodies within the area.  It was noted that there was a very limited number of potential sites with the South Dublin City area.  My Department also consulted with NAMA in relation to any potential site options available.<\/p>  <p>  It was in the context of such limited school site availability in south Dublin City that officials in my Department approached the Irish Greyhound Board in February 2016 with a view to considering the feasibility of providing school accommodation on the Harold&rsquo;s Cross site.  Subsequently, in July 2016, in the course of my Department&rsquo;s engagement with the Irish Greyhound Board regarding the Harold&rsquo;s Cross site, it was made clear to my officials that while Savills real estate agency had been retained by the Board to advise on the asset in question, they were not actively seeking to sell it at that time.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, in the context of ongoing school site requirements, a detailed site analysis and feasibility study of the Harold&rsquo;s Cross site was carried out in order to assess the potential of the site.  This technical assessment of the property concluded that the property is suitable for the provision of a significant level of school accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Having considered the uncertainty in relation to timeframe for acquisition and zoning, it was decided that the potential acquisition of the Harold&rsquo;s Cross stadium would not be pursued at that time.  However, while the site was not available at that time, the suitability of the site had been established relative to other options identified as part of an overall site search in the area.  My Department was not aware of, and did not discuss with IGB, timeframes for closure of the stadium.<\/p>  <p>  My Department became aware of the decision to close the Harold&rsquo;s Cross property in February of this year, when the Irish Greyhound Board made its announcement to that effect.  My Department was not aware, in advance of that time, that a decision had been taken to close the greyhound stadium.  My Department was contacted subsequently by Savills to indicate that the Harold&rsquo;s Cross site would be on the market and the Department could be given access to value it if required.  Contact was also made by the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, since my Department had previously made that Department aware of potential interest in the site.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the information that the Harold&rsquo;s Cross site was about to go on the open market, officials in the Site Acquisition section of my Department consulted with the Forward Planning section in relation to proposed future growth and school needs in the area.  The Forward Planning section of my Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.  The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.<\/p>  <p>  Harold&rsquo;s Cross Greyhound Stadium is situated in the Department&rsquo;s school planning area of Dublin 6\/Clonskeagh and is immediately adjacent to the school planning areas of Dolphin&rsquo;s Barn\/Dublin 12; Dublin 8; Dublin 2 \/Dublin 4; and Dublin 6W.  An initial review of demographics in relevant school planning areas adjacent to the site indicate significant increases at both primary and post-primary levels likely to require provision for additional school sites in the area, beyond those currently in the ownership of the Department.  Initial projections indicate additional demand of up to 5,000 places at post-primary level across the Dublin 6\/Clonskeagh school planning area (in which the property is located) and the adjoining school planning areas in the South Dublin City area.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the previous analysis of options to provide the expected school places required, my Department is acutely aware that existing schools in the area do not have the capacity to provide the accommodation that will be necessary for such a huge increase in student numbers.  Furthermore, a diversity of provision is also required to allow for parental choice.  Accommodation to meet the demand for additional school places anticipated in the south Dublin City school planning areas would, therefore, require multiple sites or property, each of significant capacity, in an area where land availability is known to be very limited.<\/p>  <p>  The announced sale of this property by the IGB represented an invaluable opportunity for my Department to acquire a site which was known to be suitable for school provision in the context of extremely limited alternative accommodation solutions.  The decision taken by my Department to acquire the Harold&rsquo;s Cross Greyhound Stadium was, therefore, taken in the context of the requirements identified in the demographic analysis and of the impending disposal of the property on the open market.<\/p>  <p>  In order to advance the proposed acquisition my Department specifically requested of the IGB that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 11\/15: Protocols for the Transfer and Sharing of State Property Assets be followed.  These protocols provide for the Valuation Office to furnish a binding estimate of value in accordance with international standards issued by the International Valuation Standards Council.  The report compiled by the Valuations Office indicated that the property had a value of &euro;23 million.  This report took into account, inter alia, zoning and the requirement to clear the site of existing structures.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the current trend in land values has been that land prices are increasing.  Given that this asset was about to go on the open market, my Department assessed the potential of acquiring this site relative to the potential of acquiring alternative sites.  From a school&rsquo;s perspective this site is ideally located to serve South Dublin City needs and it provides certainty in respect of suitability and availability.  It had already been established that land-banks of sufficient size are scarce and where such sites have the potential for residential or commercial development, they would be valued accordingly.  The proposed acquisition costs were appraised in this context.<\/p>  <p>  While the current zoning of the site does not permit the development of a school on the site, it could be facilitated by means of a variation to the City Development Plan.  Department officials have discussed the zoning of the property with Dublin City Council officials and have agreed with the Irish Greyhound Board that the proposed acquisition would be subject to the necessary change in zoning for the property.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed acquisition is, in the first instance, subject to the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Draft contracts have not yet been received but my Department has been informed that these are being prepared.  By agreement with the Irish Greyhound Board, the contracts will reflect phasing of the payment of the purchase price in respect of the proposed acquisition with a view to spreading the cost to my Department across two years&rsquo; financial allocation.  This cost will be met within the Department&rsquo;s overall capital budget as sanctioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300064#WRL05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":552,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[24504\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300064#WRL05200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the processes and procedures that are undertaken by the principal officer in his Department's site acquisition and property management section in terms of identifying and acquiring sites for his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":553,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[24505\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300064#WRL05300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the site acquisitions by his Department in each of the years 2006 to 2016 inclusive; the amount paid by his Department for each of those sites; the previous use and type of rezoning associated with the sites at the time of purchase; the current use of each of those sites, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":554,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[24499\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300064#WRL05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the processes and procedures undertaken by the assistant secretary of the school planning and building unit with regard to the approval of a site acquisition decision made by the principal officer of his Department's acquisition and property management section; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":555,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[24506\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300064#WRL05500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the annual allocation provided to his Department's site acquisition and property management section for site acquisition in each of the years 2006 to 2016 inclusive, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":556,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 242 to 245, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Where additional demographic demands exist, in determining the requirement for a new school site an assessment of possible accommodation provision by means of extension of existing schools is carried out.

including planning permissions, commencement notices, ESB connections and several others - from various sources, each of which measures different aspects of housing market activity.\u00a0 Each dataset presents part of the overall housing activity picture but none of the datasets were specifically designed to count new houses.  In respect of commencements, this activity is tracked through the Building Control Management System (BCMS).  It is important to note that the BCMS was introduced with effect from 1 March 2014 to facilitate building control authorities, building owners, builders and construction professionals in discharging their responsibilities under the Building Control Act 1990, as amended.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to completions, my Department has published ESB data on residential properties connected to the ESB grid for many years, as a proxy for house completions, as it represents the best available indicator that a residential unit is becoming available for occupation. \u00a0This dataset includes recently completed once-off homes, multi-unit scheme developments and apartments as well as some re-connections to the grid, where properties that have been unoccupied for over two years are being brought back into use.<\/p>  <p>  ESB data is collected at\u00a0a point in time\u00a0when the home is connected to the grid, rather than being related to the period of its construction.\u00a0\u00a0My Department has regularly drawn attention to this fact in the context of the recent economic and construction collapse where many homes which were commenced a number of years ago but\u00a0remained unfinished for several years\u00a0 have\u00a0gradually been finished out and brought to the market place as recovery took\u00a0hold.\u00a0 Indeed, for a number of years my Department has published the results of annual surveys undertaken in relation to unfinished housing developments, including details in relation to the progress on completion of such developments. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the ESB figures are by no means the only dataset used to measure housing activity.\u00a0For example, detailed information on residential construction activity is available from certain local authorities\u00a0- at the end of 2016, the four Dublin local authorities reported 144 active construction sites, encompassing the construction of some 5,200 new dwellings. This is a really important source of information in terms of informing policies aimed at increasing supply in the Dublin housing market.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Census of Population and Housing collected and published by the Central Statistics Office, yields a wide range of different statistics, none of which maps precisely to the measures which are disseminated by\u00a0my Department.  Amongst the most important of those measures are the net change to the total housing stock, the net change to the occupied housing stock and the numbers of units occupied which the residents report were constructed since 2011.  All measures of stock are subject to additions as well as removals and there is no accepted measure at this time of the level of removals between Census waves, whereas my Department has provided an estimate of the additions to the stock for many years.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department is working with colleagues in the Central Statistics Office and across other interested Government Departments and Agencies, along with the continuing assistance of the ESB,\u00a0to develop methodologies to refine and improve these measures.\u00a0 In this context my Department recently convened the Housing Analytics Group to monitor and review the various sources of housing data collected nationally to provide a comprehensive and coherent suite of statistics relating to housing matters.\u00a0 In collaboration with data owners and stakeholders, the Group will work to refine and improve existing data sources, and identify potential data gaps and new data sources, with a view to ensuring that public policy is informed by the best possible housing data.

This was the case in some 35% of favourable appeal outcomes in 2015, some 37% of favourable appeal outcomes in 2016 and some 39% to date in 2017.  Where the decision is not revised in the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds.  In addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at oral hearing which may also influence the outcome of the appeal.<\/p><p>Statistics are not maintained separately in respect of those appeals where the decision of an Appeals Officer to disallow an appeal is subsequently revised by an Appeals Officer under Section 317 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 where new facts or evidence have been provided which were not before the Appeals Officer when the original decision was made.

A table detailing the outcome of reviews by the Chief Appeals Officer under Section 318 is also included below.

This is the second successive year the rate reduced &ndash; representing a 9.7 percentage point reduction on the 2013 rate of 32.3%.  The Irish rate compares to the EU average of 17.1% in 2015 (see Table 1 attached).<\/p><p>The full impact of the recovery is not reflected in these figures, which relate to 2015.  Macro-economic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth since then.  Unemployment has fallen from 9.4% in mid-2015 to 6.2% now.  The number of people in receipt of working-age income and employment supports has also continued to fall.<\/p><p>With these improvements, the Government was in a position to introduce a range of welfare increases from 2016 onwards.  This includes a package of measures to support lone parents, encouraging them into the workplace and into education and helping to reduce their childcare costs.  In Budget 2017 all lone parents on the one-parent family payment, the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have benefitted from the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment from March.  A new &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance will be made available to Back to Education Allowance participants with children from the next academic year in September.  In addition, the income disregards for the one-parent family payment and the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment increased by &euro;20 from January, from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, reversing in part previous reductions, to encourage one parent families to stay in, and return to, work.<\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s social impact assessment of Budget 2017 showed that average household incomes increase by 1%.  Non-earning lone parents were the biggest beneficiary of Budget 2017 with gains of 4.5%.  Working lone parents also experienced above average gains at almost 1.2%.<\/p><p>The improvement in the economy, together with the welfare measures referred to, are likely to have supported a further reduction in severe material deprivation in the period since 2015.  This improvement is expected to continue with further rises in incomes and living standards.<\/p><p><b>Table 1: Severe Material Deprivation rate in lone parent households 2010 to 2015<\/b><table><tr><th><\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Ireland<\/td><td>12.8%<\/td><td>23.3%<\/td><td>27.4%<\/td><td>32.3%<\/td><td>25.1%<\/td><td>22.6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EU-28<\/td><td>17.1%<\/td><td>18.4%<\/td><td>21.5%<\/td><td>20.7%<\/td><td>19.2%<\/td><td>17.1%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Source: Eurostat EU-SILC, various years.

However, where the break in eligibility is of a longer duration, it may be necessary to fully reassess eligibility before payment is restored in order to confirm that the conditions are still met.<\/p>  <p>  Through the Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES), the Government is committed to increasing the share of people with disabilities working in the open labour market, given that employment plays a key role in helping to ensure economic independence and offering the best protection against poverty.  As part of delivering the CES, an interdepartmental group was set up to identify any significant disincentives for people with disabilities in taking up or returning to work.  The findings and recommendations of this group are set out in the &ldquo;Make Work Pay for People with Disabilities&rdquo; report, which was recently published.  One focus of the report is on appropriate support to be provided for people on a long-term disability payment who move off the payment to get a job.  The report notes some level of concern among people with disabilities about what could happen if they take up a job which subsequently does not work out because of, say, the individual&rsquo;s impairment or stamina levels, or as a result of a health relapse.  In response, the report recommends that there should be a fast-tracked reinstatement of social welfare payments for people with disabilities who have returned to work, and who have subsequently had to leave their job within one year.<\/p>  <p>  At the launch of the report, it was announced that protocols would be put in place by the Department of Social Protection to allow people to return seamlessly to a long-term disability payment, including disability allowance, if work doesn&rsquo;t work out within a year.

Nevertheless, my Department recognises that abuse of the welfare system is an ongoing reality and must be tackled.  Anti-fraud measures are set out in the Department&rsquo;s Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018 and are designed to prevent, deter and detect fraud and to ensure effective oversight of schemes and recovery of any sums overpaid.<\/p>  <p>  Nearly 950,000 entitlement reviews and investigations were conducted across the Department&rsquo;s schemes in 2016.  These reviews yielded &euro;506 million in control savings for the year.  My Department recorded overpayment of entitlements of some &euro;110 million in 2016 of which &euro;41 million related to fraud in 16,225 cases.<\/p>  <p>  A number of measures are used to prevent fraud from entering the social welfare system, allied to actions to deter fraudulent behaviour.  The continued roll-out of the Public Services Card has considerably reduced the potential for identity fraud.  Additional developments have seen the introduction of data analytics software and techniques, improved data-matching capacity and data-sharing arrangements, both internally and with the Revenue Commissioners and with other state agencies.  A new debt management system became operational at the end of 2014 and has supported the roll-out of improved debt management capacity.  Staff who are engaged in claim reviews and investigations receive training to identify instances of fraudulent claiming.  The Department continues to improve its technical ability to identify risks, to ensure cross-referencing of information held in respect of claimants, to reinforce its fraud prevention work and to use the statutory powers granted by the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the public also play an important role in supporting anti-fraud activities.  Some 19,000 reports from concerned members of the public were received during 2016.  The recent fraud awareness campaign has helped to highlight the positive role that members of the public can play in supporting the Department to protect the social welfare system.  Since the launch of the campaign on 18 April, the recorded number of reports received has exceeded 3,000 when account is taken of vexatious and frivolous reports.<\/p>  <p>  Additional control work undertaken includes an annual programme of fraud and error surveys which are agreed with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  During 2016, the Department published surveys on Farm Assist, on the Household Benefits package where no other social welfare payment is made and on Family Income Supplement.  A further three surveys will be completed and published during 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I recently published legislative proposals to introduce sanctions on persons who have been convicted by the courts of social welfare fraud.  At present, no social welfare sanctions exist for persons who are convicted other than a requirement to repay the sums defrauded.  The measures I have included in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017 will see the names of persons who are convicted of social welfare fraud being published on a quarterly basis and a disqualification from part of a person&rsquo;s weekly social welfare payment imposed for a period of nine weeks following conviction.<\/p>  <p>  Some 350 social welfare inspectors are specially assigned with powers to investigate claims and inspect employers.  In addition, there are 110 trained investigators in the Special Investigations Unit.  Additionally, the Deputy should note that control work forms a central part of the work of all staff across the Department, including those who work in support roles such as systems development, IT, financial and corporate management, as well as front-line staff in Intreo Centres and centralised scheme areas.  Separately, 40 staff work in the central control area, 22 staff deal with identity services and a further 44 staff are assigned to overpayment administration and recovery.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has no information on the number of licensed investigators that are operating within the jurisdiction and does not contract such external expertise for social welfare investigation work.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300068#WRP04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Payments","counter":759,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300068#WRP04400"},{"type":"question","counter":760,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[24232\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300068#WRP04500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive a decision regarding disability allowance arrears; and the reason for the delay.","asker":"1334","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":761,"content":"<p>The person concerned is repaying a debt he incurred while on disability allowance and supplementary welfare payments and which he owes the Department.

The Department has contracts in place with in excess of 60 companies for the provision of these services. This includes two contracts with JobPath service providers.<\/p>  <p>  The JobPath providers are subject to regular on-site checks and inspections to ensure that JobPath is delivered in accordance with contractual obligations. To date, 33 on-site inspections have been carried out at provider locations around the country.  The inspections cover a variety of subjects including service delivery, suitability and standard of accommodation, staffing, signage, Irish language compliance and complaints procedures.  Regular inspections will be conducted for the duration of the JobPath contract. <\/p>  <p>  With regards to employer satisfaction both JobPath providers seek to monitor employer satisfaction on an on-going basis by gathering feedback from employers through a variety of means including: regular contact with employers (to see for example if clients placed into employment  require further support and assistance), providing employers with dedicated contact points, early engagement with employers to facilitate the recruitment of staff (which may involve the pre-screening of candidates, facilitating recruitment days, in centre interviews, facilitating clients to complete on line applications, training for clients to access specific routes to employment, the funding of work wear and equipment). Both companies will also be undertaking a survey of employers later this year to seek additional feedback to further enhance the services they are providing.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the fees payable to providers, the department has as part of its contract management approach built in various safeguards relating to the cost of the service - these include mechanisms linked to economic performance and the possible retention of fees should contractor performance not meet the expectations of the department with regards to, for example, the quality of the service being delivered.  My Department has reserved the right, at its sole discretion, to discount registration and sustainment fees if employment levels in the economy exceed the reference employment levels asset out in the request for tender: as reported in the results of the quarterly national household survey (QNHS) for the last quarter of each calendar year. The discount is applicable to the fees to be paid in the subsequent calendar year. I can advise the deputy that, in the context of the increase numbers of people in employment in recent years, discounts have been applied to the fees payable to the JobPath providers.<\/p>  <p>  The JobPath request for tender also specified that the successful companies would be required to ensure that no less than 10% of employees recruited to administer the service would be persons who in the period immediately prior to their recruitment had been registered on a national unemployment register within the EU or EEA for a continuous period of at least 12 months.  Both JobPath providers have confirmed that at least 10% of their employees were on the live register for at least twelve months prior to being recruited.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the number of clients engaged with the service who have had a penalty rate applied to their jobseekers payment, failure of a jobseeker to engage, without good cause, with the  Department&rsquo;s employment services can have consequences for the jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.  However it is important to note that the rules and processes for the application of a reduced rate of payment are the same across all of the Department&rsquo;s employment services whether they are delivered directly by the Department&rsquo;s own Intreo service or through its contracted services.  It should also be noted that only a departmental official (not contractor&rsquo;s staff) can make such a decision. <\/p>  <p>  The process with regards to such decisions includes written \/ verbal warnings and an opportunity for the jobseeker to re-engage with the services prior to the application of a reduced payment rate.  Of the approximately 95,000 clients who started their engagement period with the service since its inception in July 2015, approximately 19,000 non-engagement cases have arisen. However a reduction in jobseekers related payments has only occurred in circa 4,000 cases.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the econometric evaluation of JobPath, it is important to note that jobseekers may be supported through the service for up to 30 months - under the service jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment. The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months. In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months.<\/p>  <p>  It will therefore take time to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period with the service) for complete and robust outcome data to be available. With this in mind, it is intended that the econometric evaluation of the service will commence at the end of 2017. The Department has however commenced publishing initial cohort reports on the performance of the service, with the first such report having been published on the Department&rsquo;s website in January. The next such report will be published on the department&rsquo;s website shortly. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300069#WRQ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":795,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300069#WRQ00850"},{"type":"question","counter":796,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[24485\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300069#WRQ00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"his plans to reinstate the State transition pension; his further plans to prevent persons forced to retire at 65 years of age having to apply for jobseeker's allowance for one year until they reach the State pensionable of 66 years of age; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":797,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition), which had been available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  This is the current State pension age.  It will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  <\/p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to the new State pension age.  Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  <\/p>  <p>  Reversing the abolition of State pension (transition) would have a significant Exchequer cost.  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension.  However, it is estimated that well over half of the gross cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been two Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2018 is likely to be in the region of &euro;84 million, and this is expected to increase over time.  The cost of reversing this decision would depend, therefore, on the effective date of such a measure, and also on any resultant changes in behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision, and demographic change alone is expected to increase spending on pensions by over &euro;220 million this year, not including the impact of rate increases.  <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI on a Pay-As-You-Go basis, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  Rowing back on these changes, which have already been legislated for, would undermine that sustainability, to the detriment of current workers.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be borne in mind that these changes are modest in the context of increasing longevity among older people, and the duration of the average pension is still expected to increase based on current trends.  <\/p>  <p>  There is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.<\/p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300069#WRQ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Eligibility","counter":798,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300069#WRQ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":799,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[24489\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300069#WRQ01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the alternative income available for a person (details supplied) following loss of their one-parent family allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":800,"content":"<p>I confirm that my department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) from the person concerned on 7 February 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  It is a condition for receipt of CA that the carer must provide full-time care and attention to a person who has a disability such that they require that level of care.  Social welfare legislation defines a person as requiring full time care and attention where the person has such a disability that s\/he requires<\/p>  <p>  a) continual supervision and frequent assistance in connection with normal bodily functions, or<\/p>  <p>  b) continual supervision in order to avoid danger to himself\/herself.<\/p>  <p>  The exact amount of hours or days for which care must be provided is not defined. However, one of the tests to decide if full-time care and attention is being provided is whether the care given addresses the above issues. <\/p>  <p>  My Department takes the view that full-time care and attention does not necessarily mean 24 hours in each day. Full-time care and attention can be considered to apply where there is an ongoing and daily commitment by the carer and which also generally results in the carer not being able to support him\/herself through normal full-time employment.<\/p>  <p>  The person concerned was refused carer&rsquo;s allowance on the grounds that she was not providing full-time care and attention as required. The person concerned was notified on 2 May 2017 of this decision, the reason for it and of her right of review and appeal.  To date, no request for a review or appeal has been received from the person concerned.<\/p>  <p>  I note that although the one-parent family payment (OFP) has ceased to be paid to the person concerned due to her youngest child reaching the OFP age threshold, she is now in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance transitional payment from her local Intreo office.<\/p>  <p>  If she does return to employment of at least 38 hours per fortnight, she may have an entitlement to the back-to-work family dividend as well as family income supplement. The person concerned should make an appointment with the case officer in her local Intreo centre to discuss her entitlements, should she return to employment.<\/p>  <p>  The care recipient may have an entitlement to a Home Care Package.  A Home Care Package is a set of services provided by the HSE to help an older person to be cared for in their own home. The services, for example additional home help hours, nursing services, therapy services, might be needed due to illness, disability or after a stay in hospital or following rehabilitation in a nursing home. A Home Care Package includes extra services and supports that are over and above the normal community services that the HSE provides directly or through a HSE funded service. <\/p>  <p>  To apply a person must fill in a Home Care Package application form and send it to the Home Care Package Manager at their local health office.

Firstly, the State pension (non-contributory) is a means tested pension and is funded by general taxation.  Secondly, the State pension (contributory) is not means tested and is paid from the Social Insurance Fund. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to ensure that those qualifying for a contributory pension have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension (contributory), all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. <\/p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This may have the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension. <\/p>  <p>  This scheme was not introduced retrospectively.  My Department has estimated that the annual cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost some &euro;290m in 2017, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the rate of the overall cost of State pensions.  This is a very significant cost, and the main beneficiaries would be people who already have significant household means, and who do not therefore qualify for an alternative means-tested payment.<\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a State pension (non-contributory), which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  While this payment is subject to a household means-test, there are very significant disregards which mean that over 70% of such pensioners qualify at the full rate.<\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year. This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform.<\/p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300069#WRQ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":804,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300069#WRQ01450"},{"type":"question","counter":805,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[24515\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300069#WRQ01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the expected date for submitting the file relating to a disability allowance claim by a person (details supplied) to the social welfare appeals office.","asker":"1334","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":806,"content":"<p>The application for disability allowance (DA) from this gentleman was disallowed by a deciding officer (DO) who decided that he did not satisfy the medical conditions for the scheme. <\/p><p>This gentleman lodged an appeal with the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).

From 1 January to the end of April almost 350,000 applications had been received, representing an increase of over 20% over the same period last year.  This exceptional level of demand is likely to be sustained into the summer months and my Department has put a number of measures in place to handle the exceptional volumes of applications, including increased staffing and targeted overtime.  The Passport Service has recruited almost 230 temporary clerical officers in response to the seasonal demand and the more general increase in passport applications.  Staff have been assigned to the Passport Office in Balbriggan, Cork and to Mount Street, Dublin.  The Passport Service has also been assigned a number of permanent clerical officers over recent months.  Workloads are continually re-allocated between the three Passport Offices to optimise efficiency.  We will continue to keep these measures under careful review to ensure that the impact of any further increase in demand on turnaround times and service is minimised.  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is currently implementing a comprehensive passport reform programme.  This encompasses a renewed and more flexible technology suite, new business processes and improved services to our applicants both at home and abroad. <\/p>  <p>  The launch of the online passport application service for adult renewals on 30 March was a major milestone in the programme.

Applicants can renew their passports from anywhere in the world via a personal computer or mobile device.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of online services allows the Passport Service to streamline the processing of adult renewal applications and removes a number of manual mechanisms including scanning and the physical transfer of paper-based passport application files.

My Department works closely with the Department of the Taoiseach in regard to NSMC matters and the Taoiseach co-chairs the NSMC Plenary meetings with the Northern Ireland First Minister and deputy First Minister.  The NSMC is supported by a standing Joint Secretariat in Armagh, staffed by members of the Irish and Northern Ireland Civil Services, with staff costs met separately.  There are nine officers from my Department currently working there.  In addition to servicing the Council which meets in Plenary, Institutional and Sectorial formats, my officials in the Joint Secretariat also perform other important functions focussed on advocacy for North-South co-operation.  They are involved in developing networks of contacts, actively pursuing our priorities for advancing cooperation, as well as analysing and reporting on the progress of such cooperation, including the work of the North-South Implementation Bodies.  My officials in Armagh also play a co-ordinating role in Government activity on North-South issues, attending and chairing meetings of the North-South Interdepartmental Coordinators, and encouraging and advancing cross-border co-operation at official level.  As the formal means for bilateral discussions between the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, the NSMC has a crucial role to play in the Brexit discussions and the negotiations ahead. The most recent NSMC Plenary meetings in July and November 2016 saw the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive agree on a number of important common principles for dealing with Brexit on an all-island basis, scoping out the sectorial implications of Brexit for Ireland, North and South, and agreeing to work together to optimise North-South planning in the phases preceding and following Brexit. For this reason especially, I hope that a new Executive can be formed soon and that the NSMC discussions can resume quickly thereafter so that the Executive can represent Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests, including in relation to the upcoming EU-UK negotiations.  the Government provides support in a number of ways, with lead responsibilities for the BIC held by the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. <\/p>  <p>In terms of practical support, my Department seconds an experienced diplomat to the permanent secretariat of the BIC, based in Edinburgh.  This officer jointly heads the secretariat along with an official nominated by the UK government in London.  As well as funding the salary and related costs for this official, my Department also makes a financial contribution towards the secretariat&rsquo;s running costs. <\/p>  <p>At the Department&rsquo;s headquarters at Iveagh House in Dublin, responsibility for the British Irish Council is placed with the Ireland, UK and Americas (IUKA) Division.  This is supported further through engagement as appropriate by our diplomatic missions and offices in London, Edinburgh and Belfast,  given that the BIC&rsquo;s membership consists of Ireland, the UK, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. <\/p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the Department of the Taoiseach, which provides Ireland&rsquo;s representatives to the BIC&rsquo;s central co-ordination group and leads on preparations for BIC Summit meetings, at which Ireland is represented by the Taoiseach.  At these summit meetings, the Taoiseach is always accompanied by a minister or ministers responsible for the policy areas being discussed, along with officials from his Department and my own.  Throughout the year, ministers and officials also participate in meetings related to the BIC&rsquo;s twelve policy work streams, which involve direct engagement by a number of different Government Departments.<\/p>  <p>  Established in the context of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the British Irish Council provides Ireland and all member administrations with valuable opportunities to engage with each other and make progress on the various policy work streams.  The summit meetings since the UK referendum of June 2016 have also included specific and valuable sessions on the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU, thereby reflecting a clear capacity for discussion of key strategic issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300070#WRR02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Data","counter":880,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300070#WRR02450"},{"type":"question","counter":881,"qnumday":372,"qnumall":"[24714\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300070#WRR02500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of persons resident in the North of Ireland who currently hold Irish passports.","asker":"1309","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":882,"content":"<p>The Passport Service does not collate issuance data based on place of residence, but rather on place of birth.

This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on these completed schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  Insurance Ireland members have committed to take into account all information provided by OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these protected areas. <\/p>  <p>  To date OPW has provided details to Insurance Ireland on 17 completed schemes nationally and Insurance Ireland has advised that flood insurance cover is included in 83% of policies in these defended areas.

NPWS also meets and liaises with the Fire Officer directly as appropriate and necessary (e.g.to review arrangements and practical details e.g. re access point, codes, etc.). In the event of a fire, my staff have also worked closely with Fire Service responders on the ground.  I would also note that in the event of a fire, Killarney National Park and the Fire Service have access to the Air Corps if deemed necessary, as was fortunately the case in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to firebreaks, obviously there are ecological concerns.  The Department explored how best to utilise natural features within the Park landscape &ndash; e.g. streams, rivers, tracks and trails &ndash; to act as &ldquo;natural fire breaks&rdquo; in helping to control the spread of wild fires within the Park.\u00a0 Targeted and minimal on site work has taken place &ndash; including the cutting back of combustible material, (furze, heathers, over-grown grassland areas) &ndash; to create these &ldquo;natural fire breaks&rdquo; which should help to control the spread of wild fires, without impacting significantly of habitats (including &ldquo;qualifying interests&rdquo; in the Special Area of Conservation).\u00a0 As the Deputy will appreciate, a balance has\u00a0 to be achieved between works necessary\/desirable to assist in the control of wild fires within designated areas (SACs, SPAs, NHAs, etc.) on the one hand and the sustainable conservation and protection of the qualifying interests within such designated sites.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300071#WRS02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wildlife Regulations","counter":949,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300071#WRS02850"},{"type":"question","counter":950,"qnumday":396,"qnumall":"[24130\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300071#WRS02900","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if his Department plans to issue authorisation for persons to enter onto private land in County Donegal or on islands off the coast of County Donegal to carry out the corncrake census; if her attention has been drawn to complaints that contractors to date in 2017 have broken the law in the construction of fences and so on without planning permission from Donegal County Council or permission from the NPWS and in contravention of the Wildlife Act which prohibits such work during the bird nesting season; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":951,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[24131\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300071#WRS03000","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the way in which grants for persons to provide protection for corncrakes was dispersed by county in 2016 and to date in 2017; the reason most of these grants were allocated to counties Mayo and Donegal, in which most of these birds nest without adequate funding; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":952,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 396 and 397 together.<\/p>  <p>  The corncrake is confined to a few areas of Ireland, particularly in Donegal and Mayo.  Once widespread, its range has greatly contracted, due mostly to changes in farming methods over the past 50 years, and in particular the switch from hay to silage.<\/p>  <p>  My Department carries out annual surveys of calling corncrakes in the key areas.  Insofar as possible, surveyors work from public roads and tracks, and permission is sought from landowners in advance of any surveys carried out by or on behalf of the Department.<\/p>  <p>  Regulation 5 (1)(f) of the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 477\/2011) allows authorised officers of my Department to enter and inspect any land or premises for the purposes of performing functions under these Regulations or of obtaining any information which is required for such purposes.<\/p>  <p>  I am not aware that any contractors were engaged in construction of fencing on islands.  Staff of my Department have been in discussions with a land owner in regard to erecting a small amount of fencing for the purpose of meeting the conservation objective of providing vegetation cover for corncrakes.  This work is necessary to meet the conservation objectives of the designated site and will only be done in a manner consistent with the Wildlife Acts and planning legislation.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to grants, a calling corncrake is a very good indicator of a nest nearby.  If corncrakes are located in farmed meadows, landowners who are likely to have a nesting corncrake are offered the corncrake grant scheme that pays them to mow the meadows later than they might otherwise, so the young may be reared in safety, and in a specified manner, to give the nesting birds and offspring an opportunity to avoid the harvesting machinery.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, the corncrake grant scheme paid out &euro;33,840.00 in Co. Donegal, &euro;91,694.99 in Co. Mayo and &euro;7,724.41 in Co. Galway. This reflects the farming practices on lands occupied by corncrakes and the numbers of birds present.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also has a small number of 5-year contracts with farmers in Special Protection Areas in these counties, which provide a longer-term arrangement for both landowners and this threatened species.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300071#WRS03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":954,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[24132\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300071#WRS03200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the pending fines or possible prosecutions against the State for breaches of EU wildlife protection law and destruction of protected habitats; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":955,"content":"<p>No such fines are pending and while there are some infringement cases open against Ireland (&ldquo;Birds Case&rdquo; C-418\/04 and Reasoned Opinions from the European Commission on Bogs\/Turf Cutting and on SAC Designations) there are no cases before the Court of Justice of the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300071#WRS03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":956,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300071#WRS03350"},{"type":"question","counter":957,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[24173\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300071#WRS03400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will provide a breakdown of the capital underspend in her Department; the capital underspend per Department scheme and per local authority, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1235","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":958,"content":"<p>Provisional expenditure figures in respect of my Department at Vote level as of 30 April 2017 indicate that there is a capital underspend of approximately &euro;7 million.

It was set up in a bid to bring together the full range of views on the matter and it held its inaugural meeting in September 2016.  In the meantime, it has reviewed numerous presentations and submissions from a range of interests, looked at a variety of official and other reports, interviewed relevant public officials and other experts and examined a large body of work from within its own membership.  This extensive programme of work has culminated in the series of recommendations contained in the report that was presented to me in the last few weeks. \u00a0\u00a0   <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the report is seeking a way forward based on consensus.  I believe that its recommendations can help breathe new life into the area, while at the same time retaining its sense of history and tradition.  In addition to its particular association with the 1916 Rising, there are other relevant aspects of the street and surrounding area that also need to be taken into account, including the range of State, public and private property holdings and ownership and, of course, the presence of the street traders themselves who do so much to give the area its unique ambience and place in the life of our capital city. <\/p>  <p>  The report has looked carefully at all these elements and I am pleased that it signals the potential for a mutually successful outcome to be agreed between the relevant parties, balancing the perspectives of all the key stakeholders.

I understand she has since been in touch with them. As this is an on-going concern I cannot make any statement on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  On a more general point, I should also add that the involuntary admission of persons to a psychiatric hospital or unit in the 1950s and 1960s was governed by the 1945 Mental Treatment Act.  The 1945 Act allowed for the admission and detention without their consent, of a person as a  'temporary patient' or a 'person of unsound mind' following an application received and accompanied by a medical certificate, signed by a doctor and on foot of a reception order signed by a consultant psychiatrist. <\/p>  <p>  I would acknowledge that there were no specific provisions in the 1945 Act for an automatic right of appeal to an independent judicial body against a person's involuntary detention in a psychiatric hospital.  However, the Act did provide patients with the right to write a letter to the Minister for Health, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals or the President of the High Court.  It also required the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, in the course of his inspections, to visit any patient \"the propriety of whose detention he had reason to doubt\".<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Mental Health Act 2001 significantly modernised procedures relating to involuntary admission by establishing for the first time independent Mental Health Tribunals which review, and affirm or revoke detention orders.

The World Health Organisation estimates that up to 3 million lives are saved each year as a result of vaccination and the scientific evidence is clear that benefits of vaccines outweigh the known side effects.<\/p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).  NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  All relevant and appropriate information is taken into account when deciding to make changes to the State's immunisation programmes. <\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines that are licensed in Ireland.  While no medicine is entirely without risk, the safety of vaccines, as with all medicines, is carefully monitored and any new evidence concerning side-effects is taken into account.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  <\/p>  <p>  Unfounded, false claims have been made of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that they first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine and a false connection is being made between the HPV vaccine and the onset of these symptoms.  This false connection has been seized upon by individuals and groups opposed to vaccination to mislead parents about the safety of vaccines and to scare them into refusing the vaccines on behalf of their daughters.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the causes of their symptoms.  The diverse natures of these symptoms, which can have both physical and psychological causes, are shared by many conditions which have implications for both diagnostic and treatment services.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the HSE is working to put in place clinical care pathways appropriate to their differing medical needs.   <\/p>  <p>  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses.  However, this misinformation has led to a significant drop in uptake rates of the HPV vaccine.  This means that a large cohort of girls is now at risk of developing cervical cancer later in their lives.<\/p>  <p>  This misinformation is causing real harm to those unvaccinated children and adults who develop vaccine preventable diseases, and to people who seek inappropriate treatments for real conditions that are not caused by vaccines.  Any parent who has doubts or questions about vaccination should talk to their family doctor, or alternatively to visit the National Immunisation office website.  These sources of information are clear and accurate and will answer any queries you may have about the benefits or risks of vaccination.  Vaccination is the best way for parents to make sure their children are healthy and protected from preventable diseases.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is committed to providing accurate information for parents about diseases, the vaccines to prevent them and side effects to allow them to choose whether to give consent to vaccination.  All the information provided to parents about vaccination is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics (SPC) and Patient Information Leaflet (PIL).  The information is presented in clear simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA) so that it can be understood by all adults. <\/p>  <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) Guide &lsquo;Communicating in plain English&rsquo; (2015) developed in partnership with NALA states that &ldquo;One in six people find reading and understanding everyday texts difficult: for example, reading a health leaflet, bus timetable or medicine instructions.  One in four has difficulties in real world maths from simple addition and subtraction to the calculation of averages&rdquo;.  Therefore, like other countries providing school immunisation programmes, the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) is replaced by this information leaflet and like other countries the HSE information leaflet provides the same information on side effects of the vaccine.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to all school immunisation parents receive an information pack in a sealed package with an information leaflet, consent form and cover letter.  The information packs for all immunisation are standardised nationally.  The information booklets include information on all the known side effects that can occur after each vaccination.  All the known side effects of the HPV vaccine Gardasil are outlined in the information booklet given to parents.  Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions.<\/p>  <p>  Parents are not being denied the information on the Patient Information Leaflet.  The HSE parent information leaflet refers parents to the national immunisation website www.immunisation.ie where links to additional information including the licensing documentation, the SPC and the PIL for each vaccine can be found at:www.hse.ie\/eng\/health\/immunisation\/pubinfo\/schoolprog\/HPV\/HPV\/.<\/p>  <p>  The website allows members of the public to contact the National Immunisation Office (NIO) to ask a question if they require further information.  These questions, when possible, are answered by the staff of the NIO within one working day. The NIO website has been accredited by the World Health Organisation (WHO) credibility and content good information practices criteria. <\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to set up an expert group along the lines suggested in the PQ as the safety and efficacy of these vaccines continues to be monitored by regulatory agencies at both national and European level.  <\/p>  <p>  I am aware from media reports that a union representing members in the educational sector passed a motion concerning the HPV vaccine at their conference recently.  However, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any motion passed at a union conference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300073#WRU05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1091,"content":"<p>Question No. 445 answered with Question No. 443.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1092,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300073#WRU05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1093,"qnumday":446,"qnumall":"[24150\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300073#WRU05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Donegal will have a procedure in Letterkenny University Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1094,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE has extensive information concerning Lyme disease on its website <i>www.hpsc.ie\/a-z\/vectorborne\/lymedisease\/<\/i>. <\/p><p>Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other similar bacteria, and certain other viral infections, including glandular fever.  In addition, blood samples from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  Samples giving positive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests.  Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme. <\/p><p>All clinical (and other) laboratories in Ireland must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics.  Some laboratories abroad do not use antibody tests like the EIA (screening ELISA test) and Western Blot and instead will use other types of tests, for example, testing for levels of a specific white blood cell (CD-57) or lymphocyte transformation tests (tests to measure how specific cells in a person's immune system respond when exposed to antigens against Borrelia burgdorferi - the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease).  These types of tests are not currently recommended by international groups such as the CDC, Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) or BIA for a number of reasons:<\/p><p>I. There is not enough scientific evidence that they are suitable tests to diagnose Lyme disease;<\/p><p>II. There is no standard method to perform and interpret these kind of tests; and<\/p><p>III. Positive results in these kinds of tests may be due to other illnesses or conditions and not just Borrelia infection.<\/p><p>Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.<\/p><p>In Ireland, treatment by most clinicians is based on that laid out in evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and babesiosis published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2006.  This pharmacological regime can be summarised thus:<\/p><p>- Doxycycline, amoxicillin or cefuroxime for the treatment of adults with early localised or early disseminated Lyme disease associated with erythema migrans, in the absence of specific neurologic manifestations (ceftriaxone in early Lyme disease for adults with acute neurologic disease manifested by meningitis or radiculopathy);<\/p><p>- Doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime for adults with Lyme arthritis but without clinical evidence of neurologic disease;<\/p><p>- For late neurological disease in adults - intravenous ceftriaxone, cefotaxime or Penicillin G.<\/p><p>There is significant support and information for health professionals on the HPSC website.

They can also provide respite to carers and support them in their caring role.  The HSE provides Home Care Packages which are enhanced supports, over and above existing mainstream Home Help service and can include additional home help hours, nursing services, therapy services that might be needed due to illness, disability or after a stay in hospital or following rehabilitation in a nursing home.  Access to HCPs is provided on the basis of assessed care need, carried out by health care professionals and there is no means test.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014, the HSE introduced Intensive Home Care Packages to facilitate timely discharge home from acute hospitals of people who require very significant interventions to an extent not previously provided as part of the Home Care Package Scheme or current community services.   This year the HSE will provide 190 such packages.<\/p>  <p>  If a younger person&rsquo;s assessed needs can be best met by services designed for older people then occasionally such an application may be considered, however access to home care packages by reference to illness type is not provided. <\/p>  <p>  I would like to remind the Deputy that the Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to design a new system of regulation for these important services.  This process will also determine the type of scheme that will apply to home care.  As an initial step, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake an evidence review of the home care systems that are in place in four other European countries. This review was published on 11 April. The Review will help us to learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and will inform the debate and future consideration of approaches to formal home care financing and regulation here in Ireland.  Another important step in this process is a public consultation process which I will be launching at the end of May. The purpose of this consultation is to allow all those who have views on this topic to have their say, including older people themselves, their families, and healthcare workers. <\/p>  <p>  The National Clinical Programme for Stroke has been in place since early 2010. The vision of the programme is to design standardised models of integrated care pathways for the delivery of clinical care.  Early Supported Discharge is a rehabilitation programme that aims to accelerate discharge home from hospital and provide rehabilitation and support in the home setting in order to maximise independence as quickly as possible after stroke. Pilot Early Supported Discharge programmes in three sites in Ireland have proved to be effective, with up to 35% of stroke patients being discharged successfully.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has advised the Department that its Integrated Care Programme for Patient Flow has identified the need to strengthen the integrated patient-centred approach. Improving discharge processes is not only necessary to deliver safe and truly person-centred care but also to optimise bed utilisation. <\/p>  <p>  Funding has been allocated by the Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division to the Integrated Care Programme for Patient Flow to support the National Clinical Programme for Stroke to expand the Early Support Discharge Stroke Programme in 2017. This involves increasing staffing in three existing Early Supported Discharge Stroke teams and developing two new teams at a full year  cost of &euro;460,051.<\/p>  <p>  Early supported discharge complements the range of measures to improve stroke care including 24\/7 access to thrombolysis and increasing the number of stroke units to twenty-two.  These measures have reduced stroke mortality, reduced average length of stay in hospital and enabled more stroke patients to be discharged directly to home.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to address the operational matters of the Deputy&rsquo;s Question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300075#WRW03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Stroke Programme Implementation","counter":1198,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300075#WRW03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1199,"qnumday":483,"qnumall":"[24315\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300075#WRW03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1071 of 2 May 2017, the cost of increasing the number of stroke unit beds to meet the predicted increase of stroke numbers;

Dr. Herity also recommended that the current 9 to 5 provision of these emergency services should cease in order to allow the hospital to focus on the much larger volume of planned cath lab work.  In addition, investment was recommended to enable the hospital to provide additional cath lab capacity.  In that regard, additional funding of &euro;0.5m has been provided to UHW in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the cessation of PPCI services at the hospital, as Minister for Health, I want to be sure that any service changes which we implement, will result in improved services for patients using that service.  Therefore, I have asked my Department to address the implications of this recommendation by undertaking a national review of all PPCI services with the aim to ensure that as many patients as possible have access, on a 24\/7 basis, to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack.  Terms of Reference for that review have not yet been drafted.  In the meantime, patients in the South East will continue to have access to out of hours PPCI services at Cork University Hospital (CUH) or St James's Hospital, Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  Given the emergency nature of PPCI services, there are no waiting lists for such treatment.  In respect of scheduled cardiology services at UHW, the HSE has advised that, following a targeted initiative, all patients who, in December 2016, were waiting over 3 months for an in-patient\/day case cardiology procedure at UHW will have been seen in CUH\/UHW by the end of June 2017.  According to April 2017 NTPF data, a total of 380 patients are waiting for a cardiology in-patient\/day case procedure at UHW, with 224 of those waiting less than 3 months.  To continue this excellent progress, I have asked the HSE to maximise the benefit for patients from the additional &euro;0.5m funding provided to UHW this year, in respect of both additional sessions at the existing cath lab and the temporary use of a mobile cath lab for a specific period.

Full implementation of the Strategy will, of necessity, be a longer term project.  The Department of Health has agreed with the HSE that the focus initially will be on implementation of the Strategy in the community, which is in keeping with the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government <\/i>commitment. The HSE has committed to undertake a mapping and gap identification exercise for the country as a whole, in order to establish a clear picture of where specialist rehabilitation services are currently being delivered and where the demands are for these services.  The HSE's Social Care Division and the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinical Programme will work together to form an action plan, under the HSE's Clinical Strategy and Programme Division.  A National Steering Group made up of stakeholders representing all interested parties will be responsible for the governance and implementation of the action plan.<\/p><p>With regard to Home Support, in 2017 the HSE is committed to the provision of 2.75 million Home Support Hours to people with disabilities, which is an increase of 150,000 hours over the target for 2016 of 2.6 million hours.<\/p><p>I am conscious of the impact of long waiting times on people's lives.  Reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients is one of this Government's key priorities.

The programme also proposed implementation of these recommendations over a period of 5 years.  This will significantly improve access for all Neurology patients.  The Model of Care was launched by the Director General of the Health Service Executive (HSE) on the 27 September 2016 and the HSE is now working towards its implementation.<\/p><p>With regard to the Deputy's question regarding employment supports, the Department of Social Protection operates a number of specific schemes to promote employment of people with disabilities, including the Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Employability Service and the Workplace Equipment and Adaptation Grant.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.<\/p>  <p>  The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;<\/p>  <p>  - Bed and board;<\/p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and<\/p>  <p>  - Laundry service.<\/p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining  the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.<\/p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and the private or voluntary nursing home.<\/p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300077#WRY00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1310,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300077#WRY00700"},{"type":"question","counter":1311,"qnumday":525,"qnumall":"[24586\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300077#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive an appointment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1312,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>In April,\u00a0I\u00a0published\u00a0an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. which\u00a0shows the extent of \u00a0the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.<\/p><p>-  The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,<\/p><p>-  The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. <\/p><p>There are c.2.3m premises in Ireland, of which approximately 23% (542,000) premises are located in the AMBER area on the Map.\u00a0 Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE\u00a0or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at www.broadband.gov.ie.<\/p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The map shows that the\u00a0school in Upperchurch Co Tipperary falls within an AMBER area and will be part of the State Intervention procurement process. <\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.\u00a0 The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can\u00a0progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement. \u00a0The three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State Intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Since\u00a0the publication of the NBP in 2012, commercial investment has been considerable.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.\u00a0 <\/p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband roll-out so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>In\u00a0April, I\u00a0signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to its\u00a0plans to provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.\u00a0 Eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over\u00a0a 90 week period, with an average of 500 premises passed per day.\u00a0 My Department will be monitoring this roll-out to ensure that eir\u00a0meets its\u00a0obligations under the Agreement.\u00a0 A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website .\u00a0 <\/p><p>On the same day I\u00a0published\u00a0 an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie which\u00a0finalises the\u00a0State Intervention area for the procurement process.\u00a0 The\u00a0updated Map shows\u00a0the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:<\/p><p>-  The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,<\/p><p>-  The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. <\/p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The map shows that 46.5% of the townland of Ballyhide is in the AMBER area and will require State Intervention, 12.5%\u00a0is served by commercial service providers\u00a0and 41% of premises are within an area where eir is planning to deliver high speed broadband by 2018. \u00a0The map also shows that 91% of the townland of Glascarn, Co.Westmeath is in the AMBER area and will require State intervention, with the remaining 9% is in the BLUE (commercial) area.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE\u00a0or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at www.broadband.gov.ie. <\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.\u00a0 The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can\u00a0progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.  The three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.

In that regard, the management of radio spectrum is a statutory function of ComReg.  I understand that licences issued by ComReg impose terms and conditions on mobile network operators which include minimum population coverage obligations, however given ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I have no statutory function in this matter.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding ComReg's independence, I am critically aware of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  Recognising this frustration, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the NBP State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on my Department's website. <\/p>  <p>  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p>  <p>  Implementation of the actions identified by the Taskforce will allow the business opportunities and benefits that the growth in the digital economy is bringing, to be felt across the entire country.  It will also assist in the creation of a digital infrastructure that can support this growth, and that can provide nationwide coverage with sufficient capacity to ensure that data can flow at the volume, speed and reliability required to meet the demands of modern life.  Implementation of these actions will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of Action 40, my Department - in conjunction with Minister Humphreys&rsquo; Department, local authorities and mobile operators - is considering the issue of blackspots with a view to including recommendations on appropriate initiatives.  At this stage of the work, I am not in a position to comment on potential recommendations. <\/p>  <p>  In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I, together with Minister Humphreys, have established an Implementation Group.

Export growth to the UK, however, which accounts for &euro;7.5bn of exports, slowed from 12% in 2015 to 2% in 2016.  The slowdown in growth occurred against the backdrop of a 13% devaluation of Sterling over the course of 2016 which impacted on Irish exporters&rsquo; ability to compete in the UK market.  From a sectorial perspective, the Food sector reported the largest decline, with the value of Food exports to the UK falling by 2.8% while non-food sectors saw exports increase by 6.4%. <\/p>  <p>  A key role of Enterprise Ireland is to help companies to win new business in international markets. \u00a0Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s 2016 results show strong growth in North America in particular, where exports grew by 19% to &euro;3.74bn and Asia Pacific where exports increased by 16% reaching &euro;1.82bn.  However, the fact remains that the UK is, and will continue to be, the largest single market for Enterprise Ireland client companies. <\/p>  <p>  It is imperative that companies respond now to the challenges Brexit will bring.\u00a0 This will include maximising opportunities to not only sustain and grow their exports to the UK but also to continue to diversify their export base.  To maintain market share and grow exports, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Market Advisers in the UK are actively providing clients with market knowledge on a sectorial basis, making introductions to buyers, suppliers and partners in-market and providing market intelligence such as competitor analysis, identification of professional services etc.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2017, Enterprise Ireland published its strategy for the period 2017-2020.  The strategy was developed in the context of Brexit and focuses on supporting clients to both Build Scale and Expand Reach. <\/p>  <p>  To coincide with the announcement of its ABR in May, Enterprise Ireland launched a new Eurozone Strategy to assist Irish exporters increase exports in Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020.  This strategy will be accompanied by a new &lsquo;Irish Advantage&rsquo; campaign which will target Eurozone buyers to promote Irish innovation in key Brexit impacted sectors.<\/p>  <p>  In order to encourage companies to start preparing and planning for Brexit now, Enterprise Ireland is rolling out a &ldquo;Prepare For Brexit&rdquo; communications campaign.\u00a0 To this end, on March 31 Enterprise Ireland launched its &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo;, a new interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars - Business Strategy, Operations, Innovation, Sales and Marketing, Finance and People Management.  The tool is a starting point for SME management teams looking to develop an action plan to help mitigate risks and leverage opportunities which may arise from Brexit.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland will also provide funding up to the value of &euro;5,000 to exporting clients to support the development of a Brexit Action Plan.  Enterprise Ireland will then work with these companies on a one-to-one basis to support the implementation of the plan.\u00a0 The roll-out and marketing of this initiative is being complemented by a schedule of regional events.<\/p>  <p>  This has been accompanied by a nationwide series of &lsquo;Prepare for Brexit&rsquo; workshops which commenced in Cork on 3 May and will also be held in Waterford (May 23) and Monaghan (May 25) and are scheduled for Galway (May 30) and Limerick (June 8).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300082#WRDD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement","counter":1627,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300082#WRDD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1628,"qnumday":641,"qnumall":"[24736\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300082#WRDD02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the position regarding the CETA, comprehensive economic and trade agreement, between Canada and the European Union; if same is being deferred pending a court determination by the European Court of Justice in view of the investor-state dispute provisions and their applicability pursuant to European law, in particular their compatibility with Irish constitutional law; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1629,"content":"<p>On the 30th October 2016, the EU &ndash; Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) was signed by representatives from Canada, the EU and its Member States.\u00a0 On the 15th February 2017, the European Parliament voted in support of the provisional application of CETA.<\/p>  <p>  The process of ratification can now commence in some 43 national parliaments and regional assemblies across the EU according to their constitutional requirements.\u00a0 In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the D&aacute;il will be part of the final decision to ratify the Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  I fully support provisional application of the Agreement.\u00a0 I am of the view that there should be no impediment to Irish companies immediately taking advantage of the provisions of CETA including eliminating tariffs on almost all of key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, easing regulatory barriers and ensuring more transparent rules for market access.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Canada is currently finalising its internal implementation procedures to allow for its ratification of the Agreement, therefore CETA is yet to be provisionally applied.

This will be achieved through the recruitment and retention of social workers and the ongoing reform of Tusla&rsquo;s structures and delivery through its standard business processes.  I secured additional funding for the purpose of addressing this issue in 2017, with Tusla receiving significant additional funding over 2016 and 2017.  Some &euro;6 million has been set aside to enable the 3 year recruitment drive that Tulsa is currently engaged in.  <\/p>  <p>  The area of child protection and welfare social work is one of the most challenging areas of work for any professional and involves working closely with some of the most vulnerable and marginalised individuals and groups in society.  Up to the end of February 2017, Tusla had recruited 56 new social workers since the start of the year, which equates to a net increase of 28 whole time equivalent (WTE) social workers in, when attrition and flexible working arrangements are taken into account.  To date, Tusla is on track to achieve its recruitment target of 62 additional social workers, which will require a gross recruitment of 180 social workers in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  It must also be noted that each year there are only 200-250 social work graduates in Ireland and Tusla is competing with areas such as  disability, mental health, probation, hospital, and primary care for this limited pool.  It is likely that the recruitment of social workers will continue to be challenging and for this reason Tusla launched an on-going recruitment campaign for social workers on its website and it will also be expanding its 2017 graduate recruitment drive to England, Scotland and Wales.  I am satisfied that Tusla is doing everything within its power to compete for and recruit social workers, including prioritising the recruitment of complementary staff in social care and clerical grades during 2017 to allow social workers to focus on their core professional duties.<\/p>  <p>  I am mindful of the need to link recruitment with decisions on Tusla's operational side to effect improvements.  As part of my regular engagement with the Board, I have requested that the Agency provide me with an assessment of recruitment for the remainder of 2017, linked to specific targets to reduce the number of cases awaiting allocation of a dedicated social worker. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to retention, in the twelve months to February 2017, Tusla had a national social work turnover rate of 8.4%. with some areas exceeding this.  The national figure, however, compares favourably with other jurisdictions, such as England, where the 2016 turnover rate was approximately 15%.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s 2017 Business Plan identifies activities to improve retention and build on initiatives commenced in 2016 such as the introduction and the implementation of Tusla&rsquo;s Continuous Professional Development Strategy and National Transfer Policy, which will facilitate social workers wishing to relocate to another part of the country.  It is anticipated that this will assist with retention and increase the attractiveness of Tusla as an employer.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of Senior Social Worker Practitioner posts designated to Social Work teams around the country will further assist with retention by providing enhanced professional support to social work staff.  Tusla Recruit will also be undertaking a recruitment drive during 2017 to assist with the implementation of this initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300082#WRDD05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Staff","counter":1664,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300082#WRDD05700"},{"type":"question","counter":1665,"qnumday":655,"qnumall":"[24120\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300082#WRDD05800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if recommendations in her Department's sustainability audits of community services recommend that services cut pay to child care staff; and if so, the capacity in which, the amount involved and the circumstances in which this was decided.","asker":"1266","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1666,"content":"<p>The Deputy refers to sustainability audits of community services and recommendations.  I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is unaware of the sustainability audits to which the Deputy refers.  Perhaps the Deputy is referring to the initiative taken by the sector of commissioning and completing research highlighting the challenges that they face.  This is a complex issue; and in 2017 I have instructed my officials to move to tackle the most urgent issues first, designing a new model of eligibility for families - the Affordable Childcare Scheme, tackling the CE scheme issue, and providing funding for &lsquo;non-contact time&rsquo; for the first time. \u00a0I remain committed to tackling sustainability issues in the sector and my officials, together with Pobal and CCCs, are working with community services to understand the sustainability challenges that the sector faces.<\/p><p>Community childcare facilities are important partners in the delivery of affordable, accessible, high quality childcare.  The majority of community childcare services are operating well and have been able to manage issues they face within the structures available, including by availing<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>of support from County and City Childcare Committees, Pobal and my Department.<\/p><p>Most recently, I announced a substantial increase and expansion of the Community Childcare Subvention programme from September 2017, which will provide significant additional funding to families but also to services.  In addition, Strand Two of the 2017 Early Years Capital programme, which closed for application on April 27th, made &euro;500,000 available in grants of up to &euro;20,000 to community services who are seeking to make building improvements or undertake maintenance or refurbishment.  These applications are currently being assessed, and I anticipate recommendations on funding in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>I have also taken steps to provide payment to community services for &lsquo;non-contact time&rsquo; for the first time, and this will be available in summer 2017.  A total of &euro;14.5 million is available across community and private services.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the challenges faced by a small number of community services who have been facilitating the training of Community Employment participants.  I made &euro;1m in funding available to services that identified themselves as having difficulties in this regard.  The funding will ensure that regulatory changes do not hinder service delivery or the availability of childcare places.  I will also be considering how this funding can best be deployed in 2018 to address the most urgent challenges facing childcare services.<\/p><p>In the longer term, the Independent Review of the Cost of Quality Childcare, which will be commissioned later this year, will include consideration of factors that affect the financial viability of the childcare sector.  The review is likely to examine issues such as the total average cost of provision; costs and revenues for services operating in disadvantaged communities; and sustainability issues.  The review will inform future policy development and the Estimates process.<\/p><p>My priority is to ensure we provide access to high quality and affordable childcare.

The universal element of the ACS provides a &euro;0.50 per hour subsidy for children aged 6-36 months, for up to a maximum of 40 hours per week.

The figures in the table also assume no change in the targeted subsidy rates within the ACS.  In practice, however, a significant increase in the universal subsidy rate is likely to lead to an increase in the number of beneficiaries, as the reduction in childcare fees paid by parents would lead to an increase in demand for childcare, and the targeted subsidy rates would also be adjusted to reflect changes in the universal subsidy rate.<table><tr><th>Maximum Universal Subsidy Rate (40 hours per week)<\/th><th>Increase in Subsidy<\/th><th>Subsidy per hour<\/th><th>No. of Children Availing of Universal Subsidy<\/th><th>Annual Cost <br \/><br \/>(full year)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;80<\/td><td><\/td><td>&euro;0.50<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;17 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;100<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;0.63<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;21 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;120<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;0.75<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;25 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;140<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;0.88<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;29 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;160<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;1.00<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;33 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;180<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;1.13<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;38 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;200<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;1.25<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;42 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;220<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;1.38<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;46 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;240<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;1.50<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;50 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;260<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;1.63<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;54 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;280<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;1.75<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;58 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;300<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;1.88<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;62 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;320<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;2.00<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;66 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;340<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;2.13<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;71 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;360<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;2.25<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;76 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;380<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;2.38<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;80 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;400<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;2.50<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;84 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;420<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;2.63<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;88 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;440<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;2.75<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;92 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;460<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;2.88<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;96 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;480<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;3.00<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;100 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;500<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;3.13<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;104 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;520<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;3.25<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;108 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;540<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;3.38<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;112 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;560<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;3.50<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;116 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;580<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;3.63<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;120 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;600<\/td><td>&euro;20<\/td><td>&euro;3.75<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>&euro;124 million<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300082#WRDD06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education Programmes","counter":1670,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300082#WRDD06300"},{"type":"question","counter":1671,"qnumday":657,"qnumall":"[24166\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300082#WRDD06400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the funding for every level provided within the AIM programme in tabular form.","asker":"1266","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1672,"content":"<p>AIM is a model of supports designed to ensure that children with disabilities can access the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.

The degree of support provided depends on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting they are attending.<\/p><p>A pre-school provider, in partnership with a parent, can apply for AIM Level 7 - additional capitation. Where the AIM Early Years Specialist (a support provided under AIM Level 4) considers that a Level 7 support is critical to a child's participation in the ECCE programme, they will further consider the degree of Level 7 support required having regard to whether the child has complex or highly complex needs. Where a child is deemed to have complex needs, payment of Level 7 capitation at the lower rate will enable the setting to supplement their staffing by 10 additional staff hours per week. Where a child is deemed to have highly complex needs, payment of Level 7 capitation at the higher rate will enable the setting to supplement their staffing by 15 additional staff hours per week. This can be used to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or can be used to buy in additional assistance.<\/p><p>Pobal has provided the following breakdown of the value of contracts to date between Pobal and pre-school providers for AIM Level 7 capitation. This relates to the 2016\/ 2017 ECCE programme year:<table><tr><th>AIM Level 7 approvals <\/th><th>Value of contracts<\/th><th>No. of applications<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Lower Capitation rate <\/td><td>&euro;1,054,505.50<\/td><td>404<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Higher Capitation rate<\/td><td>&euro;2,377,082.81<\/td><td>848<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>&euro;3,431,588.31<\/td><td>1,252<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>AIM was launched in June 2016.

My Department is not an employer of childcare workers but it is a significant funder of childcare services.

I am pleased to confirm that major improvements in childcare subsidies will therefore come into effect this September, including increases of up to 50% in targeted childcare subsidy rates and a new universal childcare subsidy for children aged between 6 months and 36 months. September&rsquo;s changes will be delivered through existing childcare schemes, pending the introduction of the ACS.<\/p>  <p>  The take-up of childcare subsidies depends not just on eligibility, but on parental demand for childcare, and on the availability of childcare places in local childcare settings that are taking part in the relevant subsidy schemes.

In addition, it is estimated that 40,000 children may benefit from subsidies from this September who did not previously benefit from subsidies.

While people will qualify for a subsidy based purely on income, parents&rsquo; participation in work or training will determine the number of hours of subsidy available. When parents are engaged in work (including part-time work and labour market activation programmes) or in education or training, they will be eligible for an enhanced subsidy of up to 40 hours per week. When parents are not in work or training, childcare will be subsidised on a standard basis of up to 15 hours per week. I believe that this is a reasonable approach.<\/p>  <p>  It will mean that this Scheme is open &ndash; albeit for standard hours rather than enhanced hours &ndash; to parents who are not taking part in work or training, but who choose to avail of up to 15 hours of childcare per week. In the case of school going children, the child development objectives are met through school-going hours and, as such, the 15 standard hours of childcare applies to non-term time.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that, where a parent is at home and not engaged in work or study, the family will not benefit from subsidised after-school childcare. However, I believe it is important that the Scheme should actively support labour market participation through linking the number of hours of subsidy to a family&rsquo;s need for childcare for the purpose of work, education or training.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a small but important group of families for whom childcare is needed on child welfare grounds or for whom childcare is a necessary early intervention support and where there is a referral to the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme by Tusla. For the Affordable Childcare Scheme, it is proposed that, where such a referral is made, families would automatically qualify for a subsidy without having to satisfy any income or work\/study test. Tusla would recommend the hours of childcare needed, i.e. whether an enhanced or standard subsidy is required.

With the greater size of the new vessels in the Naval Service fleet, the presence of <i>LE Aisling <\/i>in the Basin added to congestion and complication of movements.  <i>LE Aisling<\/i>had to be moved 14 times within the Naval Basin, with each move representing a major logistical undertaking as it required the hiring of tugs and the diversion of Naval Service personnel from other duties for the move.<\/p><p>There was no expenditure involved in the decommissioning of the vessel, with no painting works or repairs carried out to prepare it for sale as it would not have been economically efficient. However, I am informed by the Military Authorities that the retention of the vessel led to increased personnel costs in respect of the skeleton crew of between 13-16 personnel assigned to the vessel on maintenance and security duties at an estimated pay and allowances cost of &euro;370,000 for the ten months the vessel was tied up at the Naval Basin.  While this crew was posted to <i>LE Aisling<\/i>they could not be deployed to other operational units. <\/p><p>In addition to the pay costs involved in manning the vessel while in the Naval Basin, costs were also incurred in relation to rations and ship services such as electricity.  There were also fuel costs involved running the engines and in moving the vessel to and from her berthage, together with tug hire costs of approximately &euro;10,000.  Although the ship was being maintained while at berthage in the Naval Basin, the vessel would also have seen deterioration in condition and consequent reduction in value as time went by. <\/p><p>In this context and in keeping with my Department&rsquo;s standing policy for the disposal of surplus equipment, the former <i>LE Aisling<\/i>was offered for sale by public auction in Cork on Thursday 23 March 2017.  Due to the berthage constraints at Haulbowline and the associated costs on the State of retaining the vessel, it was imperative that the vessel was sold at an early date.  Therefore, a reserve price was not set as if the vessel remained unsold, further costs of retention and disposal would have been incurred.<\/p><p>The public auction was attended by a number of parties, including a scrap dealer, who declined to bid on the day.  The vessel was sold for the sum of &euro;110,000 to a Dutch shipbroker, and following the completion of the necessary paperwork the vessel was removed from the Naval Base in Haulbowline on 23 April 2017. <\/p><p>The sale by way of public auction was handled by Mr Dominic Daly, a ship sales broker, auctioneer and valuer with almost 40 years experience who had previously handled the sale by public auction of the decommissioned<i>LE Emer<\/i>in 2013 and the sale of<i>LE D&eacute;irdre<\/i>in 2001.  The auction was widely advertised in specialist national and international maritime publications, including Trade Winds, a global shipping and maritime news publication and Lloyds List, a leading news and information source for the maritime industry covering all sectors of the shipping world. <\/p><p>My Department is aware from media reports that the vessel has now been advertised for sale by the buyer for USD $750,000 or &euro;648,000.  In this context it is important to note that this is a hoped for resale price and it is mere speculation what the vessel will actually realise should it be sold.  My Department has no information with regard to any level of work undertaken on the ship or which it is proposed to undertake prior to sale.<\/p><p>The suggestion that the ship was sold at undervalue is unsupported.  A ship valuation is normally based on the market value of the vessel at the time of sale.  The definition of Market Value as per the International Value Standards is the estimated amount for which property should exchange between a willing buyer and a willing seller in arm&rsquo;s length after proper marketing wherein the parties had acted knowledgably, prudently and without compulsion. <\/p><p>I am satisfied that the sale of the decommissioned <i>LE Aisling <\/i>was carried out in a highly publicised and transparent manner, by a suitably qualified expert and was effected upon the most favourable terms reasonably obtainable given the age and condition at the time of sale and the international market conditions for end of life ships. The disposal of the ship by way of public auction, which was widely advertised in advance by the auctioneer handling the sale, was fully transparent and was open to all interested parties to attend. The public auction process used in the sale of the vessel was appropriate, and in all such situations the prevailing market determines the price achievable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300084#WRFF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Travel","counter":1753,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300084#WRFF01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1754,"qnumday":690,"qnumall":"[24230\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300084#WRFF01400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the 44 locations to which the Government Learjet travelled to and from in 2016 and to date in 2017, in tabular form.","asker":"1305","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":1755,"content":"<p>The information in relation to Ministerial Air Transport is available publically via a link entitled Ministerial Air Transport Service (MATS) on the Department of Defence homepage at <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300084#WRFF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Policy","counter":1756,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300084#WRFF01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1757,"qnumday":691,"qnumall":"[24242\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300084#WRFF01600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if Ireland was one of the 27 EU member states that agreed a legal mandate in preparation for an EU military headquarters; the nature of the proposed legal mandate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1305","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":1758,"content":"<p>There are no plans at EU level to establish an EU military headquarters.  The proposal, currently being advanced is the development of civil\/military planning and conduct capabilities, coordinated through a joint support coordination cell (JSCC), to improve the EU's capacity to react in a faster, more effective and more seamless manner.  The proposal is to build on existing structures with a view to enhancing civilian-military synergies to support the effective planning and operation of civilian and non-executive military CSDP missions, as part of the EU's Comprehensive Approach. <\/p><p>  In effect this means the creation of a Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC), within the existing EU Military Staff structures in Brussels, which will be responsible at the strategic level for the operational planning and conduct of non-executive military missions working under the political control and strategic guidance direction of the Political and Security Committee.  Once created, the MPCC will work in parallel and in a coordinated way with the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC) supported by the JSCC which brings together the civilian and military expertise in key mission support areas.  The Director of the MPCC, a responsibility to be taken up by the Director General of the EU Military Staff, will carry out the same role, tasks and command authority as those attributed to an EU Military Operation Commander, for non-executive military missions only, including the current three EU Training Missions deployed in the Central African Republic, Mali and Somalia.  Non-executive military missions are capacity building, training and advisory missions.  This will further strengthen and enable effective civilian\/military coordination and cooperation in the operational planning and conduct of CSDP civilian and non-executive military missions. <\/p><p>The new Council Decision required to establish the MPCC and also amend the existing Council Decisions of the three current non-executive military missions remain under discussion.  No legal mandate can be agreed until a unanimous decision is agreed by all member States. Such an agreement is not currently in place. <\/p><p>I do not believe that it represents an increase in or a move towards militarisation of the EU.  The Lisbon Treaty provides that the Common Security and Defence Policy &ldquo;shall provide the Union with an operational capacity drawing on assets, civil and military.  The Union may use them on missions outside the Union for peace-keeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.  The performance of these tasks shall be undertaken using the capabilities provided by the Member States.&rdquo;<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the issue of having an effective joint planning and operational capacity to support civilian and non-executive military CSDP missions is one which is reasonable, particularly having regard to the EU&rsquo;s comprehensive approach to international crises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300084#WRFF01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1759,"content":"<p>Question No. 692 answered with Question No. 685.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Records","counter":1760,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300084#WRFF01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1761,"qnumday":693,"qnumall":"[24407\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300084#WRFF01900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"his views on claims in a newspaper (details supplied) that his Department is unable to locate copies of technical reports from the 1990s which raise concerns regarding health and safety conditions at Casement Aerodrome; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1305","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":1762,"content":"<p>I have corresponded with the Deputy recently by way of follow up response to Parliamentary Question No. 36 of 15 February 2017 and the position is as set out in my letter of 17 May 2017. <font color=\"#FFFFFF\"><\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300084#WRFF02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel Data","counter":1763,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300084#WRFF02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1764,"qnumday":694,"qnumall":"[24442\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300084#WRFF02100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of persons that have left the Defence Forces in each of the years 2010 to 2016 and to date in 2017, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":1765,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the table below:  <table><tr><th><div>\u200b <\/div><\/th><th><div>\u200b2010 <\/div><\/th><th><div>\u200b2011 <\/div><\/th><th><div>\u200b2012 <\/div><\/th><th><div>\u200b2013 <\/div><\/th><th><div>\u200b2014 <\/div><\/th><th><div>\u200b2015 <\/div><\/th><th><div>\u200b2016 <\/div><\/th><th><div>\u200b2017 <br \/><br \/>(30\/04\/17) <\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>\u200bOfficers <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b53 <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b72 <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b70 <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b59 <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b82 <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b75 <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b80 <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b22 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>\u200bOther Ranks <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b481 <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b657 <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b733 <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b386 <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b387 <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b481 <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b575 <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b201 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>\u200bTotal <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b534 <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b729 <\/div><\/td><td><div>\u200b803 <\/div><\/td><td><div>445\u200b <\/div><\/td><td><div>469\u200b <\/div><\/td><td><div>556\u200b <\/div><\/td><td><div>655\u200b <\/div><\/td><td><div>223 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The Government is committed to maintaining the establishment of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel, comprising of 7,520 Army, 886 Air Corps and 1,094 Naval Service as stated in the 2015 White Paper on Defence.

The manpower requirements of the Permanent Defence Force are monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of the three services.

Maximum retirement benefits accrue after 31 years.  The 21-year pension, which varies according to retiring rank and other factors, is payable for the person&rsquo;s lifetime.  Where qualifying service is more than 21 years, an &lsquo;additional increment&rsquo; is payable at a flat rate for each year of service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years.  However, under the pension scheme rules, this ceases to be payable when the pensioner reaches the qualifying age for the social welfare State Pension Contributory, that is, at age 66 to 68 depending on when the insured person was born. <sup><\/sup><\/p><p>I am advised that these arrangements are in accordance with the long established principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits of employees who are in full PRSI class.  This includes NCOs and Privates, who are fully insured for the range of social insurance benefits under the Social Welfare Acts such as the State Pension. <\/p><p><i>Integration <\/i>means that a person&rsquo;s entitlement to social insurance benefits is taken into account when calculating the rate of occupational pension payable.  The State Pension etc. is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual.  The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries. <\/p><p>I am also advised that the method of integration for these military pensioners is more favourable than in other areas of the public service.  The maximum personal rate of the State Pension is considerably greater than any reduction that could arise under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces pension arrangements by virtue of the loss of the additional increment on qualification for the State Pension. <\/p><p>The general issue of integration of occupational pensions in the public service was examined by the <i>Commission on Public Service Pensions<\/i>.  Its Final Report, published in November 2000, was considered and broadly accepted by Government.  The Commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component in the public service pension framework and was strongly of the view that it should be continued.  It did not make any recommendations that would affect the current integration arrangements applicable to retired NCOs and Privates covered by the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces pensions schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300084#WRFF03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1790,"content":"<p>Question No. 702 answered with Question No. 680.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Recruitment","counter":1791,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300084#WRFF03750"},{"type":"question","counter":1792,"qnumday":703,"qnumall":"[24589\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052300084#WRFF03800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if staff shortages can be alleviated by hiring qualified air traffic controllers as direct entry officers in line with precedent in view of the recent acknowledgment of staffing shortages within the\u00a0Air Corps, particularly within the air traffic control division.","asker":"1276","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":1793,"content":"<p>Actions are underway to return a full level of air traffic control services to the Air Corps.
