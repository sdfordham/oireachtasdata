The context also includes: low returns to upland farming from the market; poor demographics, for example, lack of succession is a concern; issues of collective farming; importance and sensitivity of the environment of the uplands; and substantial risk of land abandonment.  The habitats and the landscape in the uplands have been created through farming and require farming and will ensure the viability of rural communities.<\/p><p>  The current payments to farmers with commonage include the single payment scheme, disadvantaged area scheme, REPS and AEOS.  Payment is based on individual commonage share and is paid on a per hectare basis similar to non-commonage land.  Overgrazing of sites, pictures of which we have seen in the past, has arisen in response to coupled payments, sheep premium and disadvantaged area.  Undergrazing, which is a potential issue for the future, has arisen in response to the decoupling of payments, social change and low market prices.  <\/p><p>  When I look at a commonage I have a vision of appropriate conditions but do farmers have the same vision?  We must be clear on what we want to see if we are to have any chance of succeeding.  It goes back to Teagasc advisers being involved with dairy farmers talking about grass budgeting and grass measurement.  However, it is only when farmers go out in a group and visit each other's farms and assess fields, that they understand that it begins to make sense - similarly for the use of commonage lands.  We talk a good deal but is everybody clear on what we want to see?  <\/p><p>  Commonage milestones include the introduction of REPS in 1994, designation of degraded commonages and poor uptake by shareholders between 1994 and 1998.  In November 1998 the national commonage plan insisted on 30% destocking for farmers in six relevant counties with large amounts of commonage as an interim measure until the individual commonage framework plans were prepared in 1999 to 2003.  In October 2002, farmers received letters notifying them of preliminary calculations of permitted sheep numbers in 2003.  That was the beginning of destocking.  <\/p><p>  The commonage framework plans focused on destocking.  The plan had variable outcomes such as a reduction in overgrazing - recovery takes time to get to the favourable conservation status and in the meantime undergrazing has emerged as an issue.  The review of the commonage framework plans mentions a sustainable stocking rate.  From experience of blanket bogs in similar conditions, there is an average sustainable stocking rate for undamaged wet heaths and dry heaths and undamaged grasslands.  The way the sustainable stocking rate works is that a commonage will have a mixture of those habitat types within the same townland.  If it is half blanket bog, half wet heath or whatever the stocking rate is averaged out.  It is a paper figure and is a good start.   For each LPIS parcel basis there is a minimum and a maximum stocking rate.  Teagasc is supportive of this principle as a start.  The challenges include local circumstances.  Grazing patterns in every townland will vary on the commonage, some will graze four weeks, some will graze for 52 weeks of the year.  There will be different stock types - sheep and cattle of various ages.  It is difficult to get the grazing pattern right.<\/p><p>  Another challenge is the lead-in time for increasing stock.  It is difficult for a hill sheep farmer to keep more than 10% of his or her own breeding ewes in a year and it is difficult to bring in outside sheep as they have to be bred on the mountain.  Forcing usage can cause more harm than good.  It will probably not be done right if farmers are forced to put up a small number of sheep.  I spoke to some farmers recently who told me it is not worth chasing 20 or 30 sheep around a commonage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021200003#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Keena","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360683600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Keena.

I thank Ms Keena for her presentation.  There is a great deal of debate yet to take place before we resolve this issue.<\/p><p>  Until there was interference with farmers through the schemes and by the Department and everybody else, farmers kept the land in good farming order.  Before payments such as the ewe premiums were introduced, there were no major problems on the hills.  Therefore, the farmers are educated.  The farmers know exactly what to do on the hill if the incentive is correct.  That has been a major flaw in all of the approaches to dealing with the issue of hill land.<\/p><p>  The question the Department never answered for me when I was Minister, and nobody else has answered it, is what is the definition of a commonage.  I do not believe that most hill land in Ireland that we call commonage is commonage in the true sense.  It is undivided shares in a mountain, and the number sharing can range from two persons.  If two brothers or cousins, or a husband and wife, hold undivided shares of land, I am not saying that is a commonage.  In some cases there are five, in others it is 500.  In other situations, such as in Wicklow, I understand, there are collops where one has a right to put out a certain number of sheep.  It is totally different.  Therefore, I do not see this as a commonage issue, which is what the Department has persisted with for 20 years.  Some of the most over-grazed commonages were not commonages at all but were owned by one individual.  The person farmed it badly because the ewe premium provided the same incentive.<\/p><p>  I believe that much of what is considered good and has been advised, such as the off-wintering of sheep, taking cattle off the hill, and feeding sheep on the hill, has had the effect of under-grazing parts of the hills, over-grazing other parts and what I call the \"cat at the back door\" syndrome, that is, the sheep will keep coming back where they think the feed will be and will trample over part of the hill.  Therefore, we need to sit down with the farmers and find out what they have to say.<\/p><p>  In that regard, does Teagasc have a hill farm research station any more?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021200004#F00300","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360684200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  The experience in England and Scotland was mentioned and how it is possible to achieve a collective approach.  I assume a collective approach would be on a co-operative basis.  How does the co-operative approach work in Scotland and England with regard to the fear of collective responsibility?  If the issue can be solved on a co-operative collective basis, things can only get better.  Incentives were mentioned.  I do not live too far from an area with sandhills which is worked on a co-operative basis with collective responsibility.  It has been very badly damaged over the years and when one or two people stepped out of line, they faced consequences.  How does one get people to buy into this and see the benefits of working together for the common good?  By working for the common good in a collective way, they also improve themselves individually.  Ms Keena stated achieving a co-operative approach is not trivial and that it will require time and professional input with associated transaction costs as well as incentives for farmers.

I have a particular interest in this as a former chair of the IFA's hill committee from 2002 to 2005 when there was significant debate on this issue.  I was involved from 1998 when destocking first took place.  During this time some of these commonages have recovered to the degree that they are now undergrazed.  In some cases some of the better commonages were abused by farmers and I have been lobbied by farmers on both sides of the argument in recent months since the debate started again.  Much damage has been done and continues to be done on some commonages and work must be done on this.<\/p><p>  I know of a particular commonage where each farmer has 30 acres.  Some farmers will put between 300 and 500 sheep in the area for a short term during the summer months, but this destroys the commonage which is very unfair to other farmers who want to manage it.  When I was young a management committee was in place among the farmers to manage the commonage and one of our favourite Sunday pastimes was when, once a month, we gathered up all the stock to check them out.  If any farmer was found to be abusing stocking levels, he or she was penalised and fined.  It was a great incentive.  This will not work now because massive rows would take place among the farmers.  We need somebody from Teagasc or the Department to discuss the best way to go forward because something must be done.  We must encourage our young people to get involved in commonages which have been allowed to become overgrown and encourage them to get stock back on them.  The older farmers will not be able to manage the stock.  We must encourage the local breeding of stock to be established on the hill.  This must be done by younger people with breeding stock.  We all have a major job to do and much debate must take place.<\/p><p>  With regard to rural development, we want to see species and wildlife returning.  I am involved with local groups in the grouse project in north Leitrim and we would love to see it happening in more of the commonages.  We all have work to do in the coming months to get this right once and for all so we do not find ourselves with another problem in a few years where some commonages will be overgrazed while others will not.  We must establish a template now which will help farmers manage stock and help wildlife to get back on the commonage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021200005#G00300","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1360684200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives from Teagasc for coming before the committee.  The background to this comes from the National Parks and Wildlife Service which has drawn up the plans.  I have a number of concerns about what is being done, particularly with regard to the total lack of consultation with the people who farm these lands.  No consultation was done with the registered farmers in my constituency and other parts of west Donegal.  The manner in which the National Parks and Wildlife Service has dealt with farmers and landowners in recent years is quite disgraceful, particularly the manner in which special areas of conservation and special protection areas have been designated and with regard to the co-operation required on commonage lands.<\/p><p>  The commonage framework plans were working quite effectively and farmers were co-operating, albeit they were restricted with regard to grazing.  To come forward with a plan without any consultation shows nothing has been learned from the mistakes of the past.  We need to go back to the drawing board because what is expected of farmers is wholly unfair.  Provision is made for farmers who are away and not farming, but farmers may not be on good terms and may not get on with each other.  This is a practical difficulty which, from reading the documentation, has not been considered.  A farm planner, REPS planner or agricultural consultant is to carry out a plan for all farmers on the land which might work on paper but will not work in reality.  Beside where I live in Donegal are five or six commonages where the farmers will be the first to say it will not work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021200005#G00400","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360684800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  The main issue is that we have a collective responsibility approach rather than a co-operative one, which is a big bone of contention.  The Senator also mentioned four things that we need to do such as learn from others and take our time bringing farmers on board.  I forget the other two suggestions.<\/p><p>  The difference between a minimum and maximum must be examined.  The tolerance level, going by the two slides shown, for under and over-grazing is quite significant.  It does not have to be a very narrow prescriptive level.  By doing so, one allows a certain level so that where a large number of people are involved in a commonage and some do not want to participate in the scheme, one does not have to force others to up the level or, on the other hand, one does not have force people to reduce their existing numbers because the overall stocking rate is between the minimum and maximum margins.<\/p><p>  Another point, which is not relevant in one sense but is overall, is that the proposal does not apply to national parklands because it only covers defined commonages.  However, the nature of the land that forms Natura sites is such that a significant percentage - I would say it is in excess of 60% - of national parklands and, to a lesser extent, Coillte lands is Natura sites.  In my opinion, this relates to the type of land as opposed to whether it is commonage or State owned, so the same rules should apply.  I say this because with regard to vegetation management, the management of the deer population, which is particularly relevant to where I am from, and stocking rates are intertwined.  Unless we have a general discussion on the development of a framework plan we will have missed the boat.  While we can do it with commonages, if we leave the significant amount of lands that are in the ownership of the State outside of the control measures, to me that would be a futile exercise.  I call on the delegation to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021200006#H00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360684800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>A number of issues have been raised.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's first question was on the number of Teagasc facilities.  Up to a number of years ago Teagasc had a hill farm at Leenane but no longer.  Teagasc has changed its approach to working with farmers in this area and has adopted the BETTER farm approach.  It has worked extraordinarily well for beef farming.  We are putting in place real life research on farms and work with farmers in order to get results.  There has also been a series of sheep farms that have adopted the BETTER farm programme, or have been developed over a period of years, and a couple of those are hill farms.  That is our approach.  The farms are being extensively studied in co-operation with the farmers who operate them.  This means that the farmers have a much greater chance of giving us guidance on the best way to work and there is a greater capacity to convey that knowledge to farmers.  It is a change in approach and a more effective and efficient use of resources from a Teagasc perspective, but it can be equally effective.<\/p><p>  I shall deal with the issue of a co-operative approach versus collective responsibility, which Members view as being a significant issue.  The point was made that commonages are managed by groups of farmers in different ways.  Therefore, it is hard to put in place a single approach that will work in all cases.  The forcing of collective responsibility is likely, in my view, to exacerbate an existing problem.<\/p><p>  If we look at the British examples, in terms of where they operate with the co-operative approach in relation to the agri-environment schemes, as it were, the more optional end of the payments that are coming to farmers, they do not interfere to any extent with the single farm payment but are looking at the extra outcomes that exist for farmers to deliver.  They are encouraging farmers to work together but it is not a simple job.  They have had to take an approach where they have required professional people to get involved with the farmers to encourage them to work together, to show them the potential benefits, and to educate them to try to achieve some of the outcomes.  At the moment, if one tried to introduce collective responsibility here, one would end up with a battle and outcomes that do not get close to what one is trying to achieve.<\/p><p>  On the notion of agri-environment schemes looking at outcomes rather than inputs, one of the issues with that is it will require greater manpower to work with farmers to look at those outcomes, to look at the current status of those individual commonages, to look at what they can do to achieve a higher status and to work with them to acquire a higher status.  That goes beyond a prescriptive approach based on a set of figures written on a piece of paper.  In fairness to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, it would like to move to the approach that was outlined to the committee by the Burren people, where they are in a position to examine and assess outcomes.  If we are serious about achieving improvements, we must design a scheme that comes out of the combination of commonage frameworks and Common Agricultural Policy reform.  We must move in that direction.  We must be a lot more flexible in the design of those schemes.<\/p><p>  A member suggested that Teagasc and the Department should come together on this, but he forgot to mention the most important group, the farmers.  We cannot do it on our own.  The committee could invite other groups to attend, and a lot of groups have attended here together but, crucially, farmers need to be involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021200006#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360685400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Deputy Ferris asked about transaction costs and collective responsibility in the UK.  The UK has such a complex and interesting scheme, it is difficult to explain and I will not attempt to do so.  It has collective responsibility and a penalty can be imposed on all.  It has not ended up being as big an issue over there and the fear is not as significant.  Perhaps it is a fear more than it is a reality.<\/p><p>  With regard to the big transaction costs, somebody from the outside - such as a land agent - would visit the farmers, asking each what he or she wants from the commonage and if it is being used.  One farmer may want to place a small number of cows on it for two months and another may have sheep on it all year.  Others may not want any stock on it.  The farmers may not be speaking to one another.  The land agent we met was fascinating and spent a minimum of one year in discussions and drawing up an agreement where everybody could be happy.  It is a totally different process to here.  Safeguards are written within it and it is a legal agreement in the end; money is paid to the group, and that group may or may not pay the members who do not want to use the commonage.  The approach is completely different and the transaction cost is very obvious, with much input by professionals in drawing it up.  There is much money involved.<\/p><p>  There is a penalty issue but safeguards can be written into the agreement on how the money is divvied up.  It is a different world altogether, and we can learn some lessons from it.  We must respect history and people, including how farmers here may not have a close affinity with others on the commonage.  There is not a mad rush here for people to say that the farmer who does not put up animals should not get anything.  It may be obvious to argue that if a farmer is not using the commonage for grazing, he or she should not get any money.  There may be much respect here for an elderly neighbour who was a good farmer for all his life.

Following the presentation, I agree with my colleagues that Teagasc's role is absolutely crucial.  As a Deputy for Kildare South, the Curragh is a very large commonage in my constituency.  It poses challenges for farmers, the Department of Defence and numerous horse trainers and other bloodstock interests.  There are many challenges as well as benefits that can accrue from pulling these aspects together.  Nonetheless a lot of detail needs to be worked out in heading this up.

I have worked with farmers in County Donegal for the past 12 years and prior to that I worked for nine years with farmers in the Scottish Highlands.<\/p><p>  I will elaborate on the context of the interaction between upland farming and wildlife before Mr. Scallan makes his presentation.  I will then look at the potential economic benefits from the relationship, which at times are overlooked and, third, I will look at a good example of co-operation between sheep farmers and wildlife, namely, the golden eagle project in Donegal.<\/p><p>  On my return to Ireland, I worked as a D&uacute;chas conservation ranger and I was surprised to find the people whom I met on the ground perceived nature conservation as a foreign concept.  Whether we like it, perception is very important, but I would draw attention to the fact that Ireland has one of the oldest sets of sustainable landscape laws in Europe, the Brehon laws.  Sometimes we may overlook that ancient respect and interaction with the landscape.<\/p><p>  I think most of us would have enjoyed the films of the late &Eacute;amon de Buitl&eacute;ar in the 1970s and 1980s.  Everybody was captivated by his film making and the way he told the story.  However, in the past decade or two there is more fear of nature and fear for nature as well.  Let us touch on aspects of fear - fear of designations, of outside interference, of the European Commission's rulings and over access.  Fear leads to distrust and disharmony and as a consequence we must be mindful of the terminology we use.  Words such as \"directives\", \"descriptions\" and \"biodiversity\" with which I am comfortable may have negative associations elsewhere.  That is a twofold approach.  I often hear farm leaders say they are the custodians of the landscape.  I know they intend to be very positive about it, but in my view we should not try to be keepers or guardians of wildlife because the golden eagle should fly anywhere.  The key concept is whether farmers can play a key role in healing the landscape in a way they did in the past but have been led away from as the focus has been placed entirely on food production, premia and incentives.<\/p><p>  One can argue that emotions will not put money in the bank but at times, and we have heard some points today, there is a need for common sense between the pure economics and the science of the argument.  The real question facing members in the next couple of months whether on commonage or disadvantaged area schemes or the future of upland areas, is whether the current system is delivering its potential in rural areas.<\/p><p>  Rural Ireland is very complex and as members will see from the map, it has all different types of habitats.  Different farmers will face different constraints and challenges.  We are aware that we are lagging behind other European countries in some of the payments, and populations are falling in some areas.  This map is based on census information collected by NUI Maynooth and the purple areas show a decline in human population.  The decline may be very small but it is fair to say that something is happening in hillside areas.  I suggest that members consider whether the current situation is working effectively for the wider public.  This type of sensitivity leads us to believe that we need better communication, greater liaison and to instill a sense of pride and ownership so the attitude is much better.<\/p><p>  There are arguments on the direction we should take.  The Department, in conjunction with Bord Bia, set very ambitious targets for Harvest 2020.  It is challenging to get the food production aspect right but it is extremely challenging to maintain that market position because we are aiming at the higher end of the retail trade.  Other countries will be actively competing with us.  Bord Bia states in its report published in January 2011 that its primary proposition is that Irish food is natural and we can prove it.  In 2012, that evolved into the concept that the agrifood sector in Ireland is sustainable.  These are key propositions.  We cannot underestimate the expertise of Bord Bia.  Naturalness and sustainability are key.  We may think we are already there, however we must be mindful that in the next ten to 15 years the branding will be under pressure from other countries who will not sit back but will attack our market share.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021200009#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorc&aacute;n O'Toole","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360686900,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Toole.  He has set the tone well against a backdrop for the need for an upland agri-environment scheme.<\/p><p>  I shall quickly outline the background.  The interest of the National Association of Regional Game Councils has emerged mainly at grassroot level with our gun clubs getting involved in red grouse management in partnership with commonage owners.  Since then we have built fruitful partnerships with a range of NGOs.  It is from that platform that we have become interested in ways to deal with the uplands and we can see a real unique opportunity with CAP reform.<\/p><p>  I shall outline where the scheme should fit.  It would be ideal in Pillar II and in the next rural development programme post-2013.  A scheme would target mainly extensive farming and directed at farmers with a significant proportion of semi-natural habitat on their farms.  My organisation likes to use the better term of \"high nature value farmland\".   <\/p><p>  It is essential that we have an outputs driven scheme and move completely away from proscriptions and penalties.  Such a move would simplify the administrative process and I shall talk a little about that later.  It would also be above and beyond what is currently available in agri-environment schemes such as REPS, AEOS and the greening measure proposed in Pillar 1 of CAP reform.  Our main objective is to encourage farmers to manage their land in a way that will improve the ecological conditions of the habitats.  The NARGC has put together a range of options for this and some of them have gained a lot of energy because we are also a part of the national uplands working group which comprises 21 organisations.  That has set the tone for a unified vision for the uplands. <\/p><p>  We need to introduce a targeted output payment scheme.  It is essential because the uplands are farmed landscapes and living landscapes which have been farmed for centuries.  The most important compiler of knowledge is the farmer.  We should design a simplified scoring scheme that rewards the farmer based on his or her management.  Therefore, he or she will be rewarded for good agricultural practice that improves the condition of the habitats.  This is a bottom-up approach and it will give the farmer more ownership of his or her farming methods.  It would use the farmer as a resource.  The scheme could be a lot simpler than the current agri-environment scheme and it could be adapted to suit various habitat types.  Obviously sustainable grazing management will be key.  <\/p><p>  At present there are a range of issues concerning the commonage minimum and maximum grazing levels.  My organisation would see this scheme as being a good way to examine site specific ways to develop sustainable grazing patterns.  We want the scheme based more on the carrying capacity of the habitats in comparison with what some would argue is a blind approach in terms of identifying grazing rights.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021200010#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Scallan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360687500,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Scallan and Mr. O'Toole for their very interesting proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021200011#P00200","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speech","time":1360687500,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I welcome the informative presentation.  The witnesses have put a lot of work into the research, and the proposal that has been put before us this evening.  Mr. Lorc&aacute;n O'Toole covered the role of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the population falling in the west and rising in the east.  That has been happening over time, partly due to the decline in manufacturing industries, but more importantly the decline in agricultural activity and the supports being generated to encourage more intensive farming rather than actual farming activity.  That is an issue for debate under the Common Agricultural Policy, under which historical payments are issued to people who may not be farming as intensively as they were ten years ago but yet are in receipt of the same amount because of the manner in which payments under CAP are divided.  The Commission proposes that payments be divided based on hectarage that would allow younger farmers to come back to the west and to take up employment on the family farm.<\/p><p>  The witnesses are correct that Food Harvest 2020 is driving the agri-food industry which is worth about &euro;24 billion to the economy.  We all subscribed to the fact that we wished to play a major role in the economic recovery of the country.  Bord Bia, Teagasc and the other agencies are playing their part, but I do not subscribe to the fact that one can only and exclusively develop the Food Harvest 2020 model through intensive farming.  I believe that farmers with smaller farms in peripheral areas play a big role, whether they are in Connemara, west Donegal or Kerry, the farmer who produces small numbers of lambs, calves or young bulls are feeding into the food chain as well.  We need to protect the green natural environment if we are to sell the Food Harvest 2020 model abroad, particularly in light of what has happened in the past number of months in the food industry in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021200011#P00300","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360688100,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations, which were very informative.

I assume we are talking about the Kerry Blue and Shorthorn breeds.  Has anything been done to initiate it?  A big part of what all of us hope can be achieved is down to incentives, co-operation and the collective approach.  Apart from monetary incentives, what other incentives have the witnesses in mind?   The damage being done to wildlife, in particular by the North American mink and foxes, was mentioned.  The mink does more damage to the habitat than any other species.  They are predators and kill for the sake of killing.  If they are anywhere near a river, they clean out the whole area for the sake of killing.  I understand a bounty applies for getting rid of them.  In my county and in County Donegal they were allowed go free and have done huge damage to wildlife.<\/p><p>  I am supportive of both presentations which offer huge incentives for rural areas at this time.

Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill asked whether we had views on the interaction between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  As a field worker on the periphery I feel that for the past 20 or 30 years, probably for very good reasons, both have had different constituencies and their focus has not been aligned.  Perhaps if they brought their focuses more into alignment they would realise they have much more in common.  I will not be drawn on whether it is right or wrong, but I am sure there is a perception of a lack of communication from the conservationist side.  One receives a letter which uses what is perceived as authoritarian language.  We need better communication from the wildlife people.<\/p><p>  My view is that at times the agrifood sector believes the wildlife sector is a constraint.  It is poor wildlife management and conservation if this is the case.  Farmers and foresters own 70% of the land and it is a fallacy that conservationists will improve wildlife.  One must work with the people who own and work on the land and this is a real challenge.  At times we do not find enough common ground.  The Burren and Boleybrack project are great examples of communities and all sectors coming together.  At the rural development conference in Croke Park in 2009, Dr. Ciaran Lynch from LIT, Thurles stated there was a noticeable lack of co-operation between environmentalists and farmers.  This is happening throughout Europe so we do not need to beat ourselves up about it.  This is due to historical and financial reasons and it is a challenge.  If we have more prescriptions without the underlying issues being tackled it will be a lost opportunity.<\/p><p>  Some people's blood pressure might rise at the suggestion, but in 20 or 30 years time could the National Parks and Wildlife Service be within a department of lands which would not be concerned with food production but with landscape management?  During the presentation on the Burren the Chairman mentioned this would be a wider concept.  Bord Bia states it is what the consumer expects and we must stay ahead of our competitors, whether they are in Scotland, Belgium or Germany, because if they feel people want green produce they will go after the market.  We must act now.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also states it is important.  Landscape management should not be separate from wildlife management and food production.  We must have more synergy or cohesion.<\/p><p>  Deputy Ferris mentioned incentives and I believe they are crucial.  One can see how the landscape has changed in Donegal.  Those in Teagasc and others are better placed than I am to advise the committee on this.  Above and beyond incentives, I know a large number of small farmers in the north west, and I am sure committee members have met them, who I am sure even if they had no money would still be farming.  Sligo Institute of Technology has conducted research on this connection between these people and the land.  Farmers should be given more of a role.  I have not seen any published references to this, but I imagine that at times some small farmers and those in their early 20s and 30s who are considering whether to take over the farm will say not only financial issues arise.  At present in some areas it is not very cool to be a small farmer.  Perhaps we should be telling them they have a really big role to play in producing food, and looking after the landscape and our heritage.  Approximately 100 years ago we had a rebirth of our cultural heritage.  We probably need a rebirth of our natural heritage.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked whether we are out on our own.  I do not feel we are and that there is growing support among the public.  Going back to conflict and bad communication, why is there an urban rural divide?  Why do we discuss what one can do on one's private property and society's needs?  Golden eagles are in big trouble from poisoning because we brought in fewer birds.  Despite all the poisoning I believe white-tailed eagles will get a foothold.  I invite the committee to see a nest along Lough Derg or in Kerry and to see the reaction of the general public.  The vast majority of landowners and schoolchildren in County Kerry are very supportive of the white tailed eagle project.  We got off to a rocky start, which I could spend the day discussing with the committee, but the majority of people in Kerry are supportive of the project.  To see young children in Mountshannon in County Clare looking at the white tailed eagle nest was fantastic.  It is encouraging to see normal people, instead of the green welly brigade, enjoying their rural area.<\/p><p>  The final challenge is to find ways of meeting when there is no conflict.  All too often wildlife people and farmers meet during a conflict or at a point of stress.  Going back to the rural development conference at Croke Park, it was suggested we should find opportunities to speak more often, such as at this meeting.  I believe there is a certain amount of entrenched positions in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the National Parks and Wildlife Service and these must be understood.  Many of these are driven by a lack of resources.  Perhaps the National Parks and Wildlife Service could have more agricultural experts and the Department could have more wildlife experts.  I would like to hear the views of Teagasc on this.  Perhaps that organisation could try to bring them together, because the challenge is to try to get everything working together in rural Ireland to benefit everybody.<\/p><p>  Small farmers have a huge role to play.  From a wildlife point of view the golden eagle population will be in serious trouble without sheep farmers in Donegal.  It is a predatory animal but communication is very important.  Some people will say we are too focused.  I do not state I have all the answers because I am sure I do not and there is much expertise here.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine attended the initial steering group meeting held at the Mountaineering Council of Ireland's offices and made a presentation.  It is not driving the matter as it, along with other sectors with varying points of view, made a presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013021200013#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorc&aacute;n O'Toole"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360688700,"counter":47,"content":"<p>To return to the question on implementation, in its joint submission the national uplands working group advocates a tiered system for the scheme.

It would have a voluntary component targeted at farmers to maintain the high nature value of their farms.  Much of this is based on what the committee heard several weeks ago on the Burren farming conservation programme, which is a very successful cost-effective programme.  It is recognised nationally and internationally as being a good outputs-driven way to incentivise farmers to do work.

We obtained money through the NPWS and the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The scheme is 12 months old and we have submitted figure returns to the Minister, Deputy Deenihan.  We have a budget to make a bounty payment for the invasive species known as mink.  Our gun clubs at grassroots level have targeted mink for over 30 years which is when they first became a visible presence on the landscape.  Thankfully, after years of trying, we have a bounty scheme that works well and we have the figures to prove it.  The association welcomes the scheme.<\/p><p>  The incentive may be small but it is still an incentive and Deputy Ferris touched on incentives.  He wondered how does one progress anything without incentives.  Progress can be made using incentives but they are not the be-all and end-all.  Good co-operation already exists between the farming community and the NARGC's gun club structure because it reaches parish level.  There is a gun club in virtually every parish in the Republic and they work.  The ethos of any gun club is that it must work with the farmer.  If a gun club did not work with a farmer it would be left without a place to hunt, shoot or conserve.  Gun clubs are conservationists first because if we do not look after the habitats we will not have any quarry species to hunt.  In addition, the pest control of all of the invasive species must be controlled, and is controlled, at gun club level.  All of that involves the co-operation of farmers.  Before one puts a magpie cage or conducts a day's hunting on someone's land one must first have the permission of the landowner.  The scheme works well but there has been a breakdown in communication at national level.  The NARGC, as a national organisation, would welcome the opportunity to sit down with national organisations like the IFA, etc.  On the ground people in the NARGC and the IFA work together.  If that co-operation is not shared the whole way upwards then there is a break in the chain and my organisation would welcome an improvement.

This year there is about &euro;185 million in the pot for the disadvantaged area scheme.  The new agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, is being launched with an expected uptake by between 3,000 to 6,000 with &euro;6,000 in the pot.  The AEOS scheme opened in 2011 with &euro;10 million available with a maximum individual payment capped at &euro;4,000 and it was made available to up to 5,000 farmers.  It is small enough money in the overall scheme of things.  The Department has a big pot of money.  There is money available under the rural development programme.  A lot of the rural development fund allocated to Ireland under the current scheme might be returned to Europe and it will not be used.  We have a real opportunity here if we devise a proper scheme.  We must give the people who live in a rural area a proper scheme.  Let us have a proper scheme.  The Vice Chairman lives on arable land in the south.  What if one lives in marginal areas like myself and Senator &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v?  I am referring to places in Leitrim, Donegal and Sligo where there are small farms to whom a few thousand euro would make a huge difference.

I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to talk about the issues facing rural Ireland now and in the future.  Community issues must be central for those of us engaged in serving the public.  The Department is committed to doing what is best for all our communities.  I acknowledge the time and effort the authors have put into their report, The Rural Challenge.  A key principle underlying my Department's activities is to enable communities to identify and address social and economic needs and problems in their own areas and it is always positive to see a community taking a proactive approach in this regard, using the bottom-up approach at its best.  I also subscribe to the principle of assisting communities to become independent rather than totally dependent.<\/p><p>  There are a number of recommendations in this report in regard to establishing a rural forum, thereby bringing shared interests together to develop policies and engage with communities.  The establishment of the commission for the economic development of rural areas, or CEDRA, which I launched last December along with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, has begun this process in earnest.  At my request, Mr. Pat Spillane has agreed to be chairman and his enthusiasm and belief in empowering rural areas to help themselves is driving the work of the commission.  This Government remains committed to getting people back into employment and creating vibrant communities for our citizens to live in.  Over the coming nine months CEDRA will build on the action plan for jobs and the initiatives I announced in the action programme for effective local government, Putting People First, which empowers local government to drive economic development and create jobs at local level.<\/p><p>  I established the commission on rural development to look at the differential degree of economic development and the variable impacts of the economic downturn between urban and rural areas.  This will be examined in detail by the commission in order to ensure that appropriate measures are identified to inform the development of strategies that will support rural Ireland into the future.  The commission is particularly relevant now given that levels of unemployment have increased more in rural areas, particularly in small towns, since the economic crisis began.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013021200003#D01100","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360677300,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation on the two important topics of rural channels and the local employment offices.

Small towns have borne a huge brunt of the economic downturn.  Does the Minister have in mind any specific initiatives to address this issue?  He might also say what ideas have been proposed at the first batch of CEDRA meetings.  I am interested in particular in a project in the Minister's constituency which is being run by the Kilkenny Leader company and relates to a food town.  <\/p><p>  On local government reform and the Minister's wish to ensure local government remains connected to local communities, how does he propose to ensure this link remains given the proposed substantial reduction in the number of elected councillors in rural areas in particular?  How does he propose to ensure that wider electoral areas, and towns and villages on the periphery of these areas, will be at the heart of local government and will continue to have a say in the new set up?  <\/p><p>  On Leader going forward and the bottom-up approach, which has been the foundation of its approach, given that many of the local development companies are to come within the remit of the local authorities, how does the Minister intend to ring-fence that bottom-up approach to ensure it is not sucked into the local authority and lost within?  The Minister mentioned local employment offices.  The concern in this regard is how, given the enterprise function is being brought within the remit of local authorities, the Department proposes to ensure that they protect the enterprise ethos of the county enterprise boards and serve the enterprise client given they are not renowned as enterprise friendly organisations?  The concern from all of the feedback from the various groups is that this will be lost.  <\/p><p>  On the national spatial strategy, will it be reviewed in terms of CEDRA and the overall local government review?

Those outside the area will have an equal opportunity to vote for people, irrespective of whether they are from urban or rural areas.  There is no quota for an area outside a particular municipal area.<\/p><p>  I want to align the community sector with local government, as there is too much duplication and administrative overlap.  I want to maintain front-line services and they will get the bulk of money in preference to administrative structures.  The socioeconomic committees have been put in place in the local government sector and people in the community sector will have representation and be part of the decision-making process with local elected members.  The details have not yet been finalised but we are engaged with the community sector in order to conclude the matter.  I hope that will happen in the next few weeks.<\/p><p>  We have a chequered history with some of the Leader areas, including that of the Deputy, and there have been difficulties in resolving some outstanding issues and irregularities.  Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta had to be liquidated and there was a difficulty in getting files subsequently.  That is not acceptable practice in terms of accountability.  We also ran into some difficulties with the European Commission with regard to those issues of accountability, and we are working through them with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure the rural development programme did not collapse.  It has motivated me even more in developing new administrative structures.<\/p><p>  Protecting the client base on local enterprise offices, LEOs, is important and I expect the city and county enterprise boards would be a horizontal move into local government, with local government's contributing to development through planning and advice going through a local authority to assist people in setting up a new business.  That would be in one location in local government.  It is amazing to see the number of difficulties arising in State agencies when they feel something is slipping away and into local government, and I did not believe there would be such hassle about devolution of responsibility.  It is not easily done.  The social partners are getting in on the action as well.  Although there is good representation at a national level with Enterprise Ireland, there is no wish to let go of the issues.<\/p><p>  I am disappointed by some of the representative bodies at national level, such as the Small Firms Association and the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, because of the negative approach they have taken to local government.  If local government is not given more power and responsibility, it will be painted as an entity that is unable to deliver.  I am trying to ensure it has more power and responsibility, along with funding possibilities.  At a local level, people should be able to go to an office and get a full suite of advice and necessary support.  That is only available now in a very disjointed way.  Whether people are on enterprise boards or community development in local government, everything should be in one place and people should have access to all that information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013021200005#F00300","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1360677900,"counter":81,"content":"<p>Rural development is very important and as the Minister knows, rural areas have probably suffered more from the downturn than many of the urban areas.  The top ten counties in terms of unemployment are rural, with Donegal having the highest rate at approximately 26% unemployed.

The A5 was a good way of getting transport to the rural north-west region, and we are disappointed that some funds for it have been cut.<\/p><p>  We should get IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to promote more rural areas.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta does not come under the Minister's remit but it had a net loss of jobs in comparison with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, which showed a net gain of jobs last year.  The spatial plan is very important, and it goes hand in hand with the state aid issue discussed just before the Minister came in.  The spatial plan would probably help the state aid initiative.<\/p><p>  The Minister mentioned some of the difficulties with the local enterprise offices, and this are major problems.  There is approximately 20 years of experience in some of the county enterprise boards and there is a danger that this will be dissolved within the new LEOs.  Will the Minister speak to what savings are expected with the development of LEOs and what additionality is assumed?<\/p><p>  Some county enterprise boards feel local authorities will be downsized.  The Minister mentioned in the Seanad that 500 staff would be downsized in local authorities.

How are the sub-groups within the implementation working groups getting along?  My understanding is that they have ceased deliberations and have not come to an agreement.  That may highlight some of the difficulties with regard to the development of the new LEOs.  There are also a couple of questions relating to human resources and the secondment of staff into the new LEOs.  Will that place a new pension cost on local authorities?

I hope the Deputy supports me in that, as his party is doing in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>  The employees of the county enterprise boards will be employees of Enterprise Ireland and seconded to authorities at local levels.  The question of pension rights and pay and conditions does not arise.  I am surprised the Deputy is not as well informed as he should be with regard to the deliberations on the working groups having ceased.  That is not the case and I got a full report this morning.  The working groups continue to work through the issues and are very close to agreement.  On the local government side we must decide what staff to place in the new local employment offices, and that is now part and parcel of the discussions.  No staff is being lost in any sense from county enterprise boards or local government in concentrating what we want to do in supplying good quality advice and support to people who wish to start at local level.

I acknowledge the level of reform the Minister has initiated across a range of sectors, much of which is positive.  Having read the rural challenge group's report, I realise it is difficult to consider rural areas in isolation from urban ones because there is a huge interconnection between both.  My own constituency of Galway West includes Galway city, Connemara to the west and east Galway on the other side.  There is a major interconnection between these areas, with many people travelling from rural areas to work in Galway city.  During the Celtic tiger years, there were vibrant rural communities but that is not to say that there was local employment in those areas.  There was employment in cities, however, and movement of labour, but that has obviously changed now so it is very difficult.  I welcome many of the initiatives and comments in the report, but we must accept that there is a big connection between rural and urban areas.<\/p><p>  Agritourism is mentioned widely in the report and it was referred to by the Minister also.  I accept the work that has been done concerning Mayo.  The Minister will be aware of the ongoing work on the Connemara greenway, which has gone through the An Bord Plean&aacute;la hearing.  We are awaiting a decision on that and hopefully it will be positive.  That initiative will help places like Clifden and others, as will a strong outcome for the Common Agricultural Policy.  Hopefully the Minister will come up with an agreeable structure for distributing those CAP moneys. <\/p><p>  The Minister will be aware of the concern in some rural areas regarding changes to Leader programme structures.  I have already brought to the Minister's attention the Leader company in Connemara, which is called Forum Connemara.  It has a long history going back to 1989.  That company is very concerned about the changes because it is in a peripheral location which is one hour and ten minutes from Galway city.  The company feels therefore that the structural changes would lead to a certain amount of isolation, notwithstanding the Minister's support for a bottom-up approach in any new structures.<\/p><p>  How will the Minister address that company's concerns that any new structures would lead to more peripherality for a place like Letterfrack?  In some isolated, peripheral rural locations, State jobs - including ones provided through the Leader programme - are hugely important to the local economy.  Seven, ten or 12 jobs in a small community like that can have a major impact.  Where those services are being drawn into Galway city, albeit in county buildings, the local community is concerned.<\/p><p>  I appreciate the Minister has pointed out that, despite the administrative burden, including cheque writing, that will be taken over, there will still be a bottom-up approach.  Nonetheless, there is still some concern that once Galway city and the county council take control, it will lead to a reduction in the role of Forum Connemara. <\/p><p>  Some time ago, I attended a crafts show in the RDS.

On the last occasion, we were able to give a 5% national top-up above the 5% that came through the rural development programme.  Therefore, we do not have the luxury of all the structures that we have become accustomed to under social partnership in the good days.  We must thus rationalise structures and see how we can use other existing structures, such as local government, to pay for heating, light and offices, as well as developing a one-stop-shop approach towards the economic and community development of those areas.  It should be about what we are going to do for the people of the area, rather than long-established structures that are protecting people in jobs that are too highly paid.  <\/p><p>  I would point out that Forum Connemara was established in 2009.

I have learned much both from the report and from listening to the Minister.  Allow me to tell the Minister about something that happened to me some years ago.  I was asked to participate in a partnership near to the location of one of our supermarkets.  It was because there was a jobs crisis, they were looking for work and I did some thinking before attending the first meeting.  However, before I got a chance to open my mouth, I discovered that everyone else was expecting the Government to do something for them.  Having listened to the Minister in the last few minutes and having heard of the duplication and multiplicity of organisations that are set up to do this, it is precisely what I listened to at that meeting.  At the time, I said the supermarket we had in the area found it necessary to get someone from outside the area to clean its windows and that there was an opportunity for a window cleaner.  A young man who was involved in the partnership set up a window-cleaning business and subsequently sold it on at the end of the year.  He only had a bicycle, a bucket and a ladder but it was a joy to see someone setting up his own business, rather than being obliged to bring a window cleaner from another area.  Someone else heard me make the point that even were the supermarket to run out, we would love to be able to provide fresh lettuce at 4 p.m.  Consequently, someone else then set up a lettuce and cucumber growing business.  Deputy Kyne mentioned the Showcase craft fair, which I also attended and it was a joy.  I was so impressed by the number of individuals nationwide who are doing things.<\/p><p>  The reason I mention this is there is almost a danger of the State telling people it is there to do something for them.  I acknowledge this is neither the point being made by the Minister nor the intention.  While the intention is to hold people's hands while they do things, everyone at the aforementioned meeting - until I spoke - originally had been suggesting the partnership should call on the Government and different agencies to come down and do things for them.  How can one manage to sell the concept that people should do it themselves?  There must be a way to do this and with this proliferation of different organisations, I wonder whether there is a danger that there almost is an expectation the Government will do it for people, rather than the other way around.<\/p><p>  One other area for which I believe much can be done, is one the Minister also has mentioned, namely, agri-tourism.  Many years ago, I was involved with a co-operative group called An Comhar Taisteal.  It made a deal with CIE for a special rate whereby one could bring families to holiday on farms.  These people generally were city dwellers who did not have the experience of living on a farm and they got a special deal to the nearest railway station, where the local farmer picked them up.  Sometimes this was with horse and cart, sometimes with a tractor or whatever he or she had.  In respect of the entire concept of people doing things for themselves, rather than having someone do it for them, the help of an organisation like CIE to transport those people to those areas was very helpful.  In business, we used to joke about the number of things one should never believe.  They included the cheque being in the post, assurances of love the morning after or whatever, but one was, \"I am from head office and am here to help you\".  I would love to think there will be even greater pressure in the years ahead to avoid the selling of the concept, \"I am from the Government and I am here to help you\".  I urge the Minister to find some way of having people able to say, \"We can and must do it ourselves\".  While the Government will hold people's hands, will help them and will provide seed capital if needed, it should not give the impression that it is going to do it and there is some danger of this.<\/p><p>  For the past three years, I have been involved with a programme on television which helps retailers around the country and it has brought me to places to which I had not been previously.  One of the towns - it is really a crossroads - is called Rathcabbin in north County Tipperary, which really is in County Offaly because it is just north of the river, but it only has one shop and one pub - it is all the one - and it is run by one family.  They were losing business to Portumna on one side and to Birr on the other side.  All we did was to get the local people in the area to come to a meeting at which we told them they would not have this pub and shop unless they supported it.  They had to do it themselves, even if all they did was to buy their cigarettes or newspapers there, as well as other items.  While I do not encourage people to smoke, cigarettes and newspapers are the same price wherever one buys them and are not susceptible to price cuts.  We told them to make sure they supported their local shop and pub.  We also went down to Borrisokane and got local growers there to give local products to that shop in Rathcabbin.  I believe the way it will succeed is through local people deciding they can do it themselves.  It is when they recognise they will not survive if they call on someone else to do it for them but will survive if they can do it for themselves.  I would have great hopes, were it possible to get across that message.  The message coming from the different organisations should be they are not there to do things for people and while they can steer people in the right direction, people should not rely on the organisations to do it for them as they must do things for themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013021200007#H00500","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1360679100,"counter":111,"content":"<p>In response to Senator Quinn and as I noted in my opening remarks, I am trying to create a culture of independence rather than dependence and all the State can do is to facilitate this.  It is doing so through a plethora of organisations, of which there are too many.  While organisations such as Enterprise Ireland often extol the virtues of enterprise boards, they do not have the requisite resources to invest to assist people, to mentor and to monitor.  I consider mentoring to be a hugely important aspect of work at local level which all local government bodies and State agencies have failed to do.  While there are many people with good ideas, they do not know where to go and even if they do, they find bureaucracy at local or national level to be alien to them.  Financial institutions also play an important part in this programme of creating the culture of entrepreneurship at local or any level and as people are quite shy about how one might prepare and present a business proposal to a financial institution, mentoring in that sense is equally important.  The Government has put in place a range of structures, as near as possible to the citizen in order that they are as informal as possible, through which it is trying to provide a helping hand to those who have ideas and at least are given a fair run at the various financial institutions and State agencies to get some support.  Obviously, however, it will not be done unless they get up in the morning and do it themselves.  I think the days of believing that government can do everything for one went out a good while ago.  Equally, the idea that one can depend on an organised community group to do everything for one will be difficult because they will not have the same level of resources as heretofore.  Consequently, we need all structures to be in place in a rationalised sense and to come together in a one-stop-shop way to help someone with an idea.  My philosophy is if we can achieve this, we will have done a lot to make sure that whatever funds are available are going towards providing a little assistance to people to give them initial support to get their projects off the ground.  Ultimately, they hopefully will become independent entities thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013021200007#H00600","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1360679100,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I urge the Minister to continue on that path.

They should be part of the decision-making process because they have gone through the pain barrier of actually eliciting support for the values and projects that are coming through the local authority or local community sectors.  We can harness people together.  The bottom-up approach will be retained, the democratic input through the local government sector will be present and hopefully, all the co-ordination that is lacking at present will come into play through the democratic process and through local government, which ultimately is the vehicle at local level that is accountable, through the national audit service, to the taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013021200007#H00800","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1360679100,"counter":114,"content":"<p>As I am conscious of people's time, we will take Senator Cullinane and Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013021200007#H00900","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1360679700,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding any concerns I have on the Government's action plan for jobs and the Minister's plan for putting people first, I welcome the establishment of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA.  I hope it will be able to examine failures in the system and also to consider how we can tweak the action plan for jobs and build on some of its successes as well.<\/p><p>  The success of the Minister&rsquo;s reform agenda and the linking of local government and the enterprise agencies will be based on getting buy-in from as many agencies as possible.  Multi-agency buy-in is of considerable importance.  We must ensure the education providers, enterprise agencies and local government but also local development and community development form part of an overarching plan and buy into the process.  In the past the city and county development boards tried to bring together such stakeholders but the Minister appears to envisage the socio-economic committees taking over the role and driving it on.  We must ensure we have buy-in from all the agencies across the board at a senior level if they are to be as successful as we want them to be.<\/p><p>  Reference has been made to tying in the work of CEDRA with the Government&rsquo;s jobs action strategy.  The point has been made that rural areas have suffered disproportionately because of the downturn and have high levels of unemployment.  Regional disparities are also evident.  The Minister and I are both familiar with the south east where unemployment is 25% above the national average.  Part of the problem is that the region itself does not work as an entity in the way it should, but also because the enterprise agencies have not delivered for the region.  It is important that the new commission would examine rural areas and that we acknowledge the regional disparities.  Recent Government policy in the national action plan for jobs places a high level of concentration on jobs in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  That has been proven by IDA Ireland's  figures.  However, outside of the cities, many areas have suffered.  I can give a quick example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013021200008#J00100","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1360679700,"counter":116,"content":"<p>We will not get into a discussion on the action plan for jobs.

People have been giving out about local government structures but I welcome the fact that we will have a one-stop-shop and that people will know once and for all where to go to get information.  I seek clarity on their role.  In particular I would like to see more activity on the ground with a bottom-up approach in LEOs, as opposed to people having to go to them.

It will fall to communities and local authorities to develop local tourism.  That could be considered by the Minister in his remit.

That is the principle behind what we are trying to do.  Some believe that when one seeks buy-in from agencies, someone must give way.  I do not look at it that way.  I see it as collaboration where everyone is around the table making a contribution.  One does not need the same level of duplication, overlap and administrative duplication in particular that exists currently.  A stronger sense of involvement on a particular objective to be delivered is required whether it relates to an individual project or a community policy.<\/p><p>  The membership of the socio-economic committees will be determined and agreed in consultation with the agencies and those involved in the community sector.

They all engaged in a silo mentality and conducted turf wars in order to hold on to whatever money they had and they would not give way.  That is the reason the previous approach did not work.

The Chairman and a few of the rest of us went round those areas and wrote a report on them.  Much of the apparent prosperity in rural areas was primarily related to the construction boom, which was only fleeting and it left only bodies in its wake.  Nothing happened afterwards and these towns are now decimated.<\/p><p>  Rural shops are now just social centres for people.  Not one rural shop is making a penny.  Every one of them is being cross-subsidised.  Unless we get a rates relief scheme in place for those shops, or social centres as I call them, they will close.  Between Mullingar and Longford there will not be a single rural shop in five years.  That includes petrol stations.  The only ones that might survive are the post offices that are now linked to the banks to provide financial services.  It is important they continue with that.  The credit unions should also be linked to the post office system at this stage.  That would overcome many of the difficulties of elderly people worrying about their finances in the current climate, where the Garda station has been closed.  It is important to promote the post office.  It is the one viable measure that can be undertaken.<\/p><p>  The Minister is involved in planning.  If someone wants to set up a small cottage industry baking bread or making jam, he has to go through the full gamut of planning permission, costing thousands.  Why not have a licence system where people could make a submission to the local authority, which would then grant a licence for a year or two and which could be re-examined?  The environmental health officers would check on the outlets to ensure they operate properly.  We recommended that.<\/p><p>  Many rural areas are trying to get back on their feet.  There are Tidy Towns committees and community development groups, Irish Rural Link groups and Young at Heart clubs.  They are fighting back but when there is a plethora of organisations, no one knows which to go to for help.  That is the problem.  If they were brought together within a overarching structure, people would know where to go.<\/p><p>  Pat Spillane is starting his consultations tomorrow night and I welcome that.  Send him down to my own area, Ballynacargy, which is a microcosm of the struggle to survive.  We must maintain villages, and I said this to officials in the Minister's Department who vilified me for looking for rural housing that helped to sustain and maintain rural areas.  That might not mean a lot to many people.  The schools, post offices, Garda stations and the sports clubs will all be wiped out unless the report the Minister is working on comes to fruition.  God speed to him on his way.  It is great to see someone taking an interest at Government level.  I wish the Minister, Pat Spillane and his committee well.

We identified that very early on and in line with the Planning Development Act, we got on with the work of developing the core strategy areas in every town to stop this nonsense of denigrating the town centres by moving everything to the periphery.  We can give plenty of examples but perhaps the best is Naas, where Tesco and 36 other shops are 1.5 kilometres from the town centre.  That might have been fine when times were good but we can see the damage it did by pulling the heart out of the centre.<\/p><p>  If the town centre looks well, and there are plenty of shops open, it makes a great impression.  We have initiated a proposal asking local authorities to reduce development levies, particularly for town centres.

Much of what we value in this country is located in rural communities.  We must address issues that make such communities sustainable or otherwise.  I agree in principle with the Minister's proposal to streamline some of the work undertaken by the companies delivering the rural development programme and local community development programme.  However, while I accept there may be some degree of duplication with the work of local authorities, I am also concerned about the proposals.  Some of the Leader companies which deliver the programmes do excellent work for which they have secured buy-in from voluntary and community groups, for example, in areas such as village enhancement, alternative microenterprises and many other success stories.<\/p><p>  Concerns have been raised in response to the Minister's proposals to amalgamate and streamline the Leader companies.  I am concerned, for example, about the prospect of local authorities becoming involved in delivering programmes on the ground.

I cannot foresee a local authority becoming involved in the community to the same extent.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins used the word \"nurturing\".  I am gravely concerned that something will be destroyed in the proposed amalgamation process.  The current programmes deliver great benefits to people in rural areas.

We also have in place the local community development programme.  There is, therefore, a large degree of support in place for communities.  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, if we did not have these programmes, Mayo Abbey and many similar bodies in other areas would not be as strong as they are.  We are not asking local authorities to get involved in the Mayo Abbeys of this world but to streamline existing structures to allow scarce resources to be deployed to assist Mayo Abbey and similar organisations with their current expenditure costs, for example, by providing a new minibus for community activities.  This is to ensure funding is not tied up in administration.  There are sufficient administrative structures in place in the local government system under current budgets to deal successfully with the programmes that are on offer.<\/p><p>  It is possible that funding for the new rural development programme will be only half what was made available under the previous six year programme.  Surely the Deputy is not advocating providing the same level of administrative support to deliver a programme that will be less than half the size of the current programme.  I can understand the reason community groups are worried about this issue.  They became accustomed to a particular structure and support base when times were good.  The big issue is to ensure a high level of participation on the ground rather than in offices, and that will be our focus.  We intend to streamline this process to avoid duplication.<\/p><p>  We must also have an accountable structure in place for the European Commission.  We do not have clear blue water on such issues, as the Deputy will be aware from her own area, and we are trying to solve them.  Unfortunately, this has been going on for too long.  We are trying to find a way to enable north-east County Mayo to apply successfully through the system before the end of this year.  We are working with the community to try to achieve this objective.<\/p><p>  The number of local government staff nationally has declined by 9,000, yet we expect local authorities to deliver the same level of service.  They will not be able to do this without the support of the community sector.  It is in our interests to ensure synergies between the community and local government sectors.

The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government did not cause the problems in Mayo North-East Leader.  They were caused by the company, whereby irregularities in procedure and practice were discovered and are now subject to investigation by the fraud squad.  This is not a nice thing to be obliged to say about any company but under the rules from the European Commission and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, one must comply with certain regulations for the rural development programme with which Mayo North-East Leader has not complied.  The company is completely responsible for that.  Over the past year and a half, the Department has been very patient and due process has been given.  The fact that the document has been referred to the Garda for investigation for fraud purposes does not indicate a clean bill of health, far from it, but work is under way to try to resolve some of the issues.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the auditors for the European Commission have made progress in recent weeks on some of the issues that were raised.<\/p><p>  I subscribe to the Deputy's remarks on the need for important projects to be brought forward as quickly as possible.  I remind her that even though one must get approval for a project this year, one has until 31 December 2015 to spend the money and to complete the project.  Consequently, a little time still remains but the most important thing in respect of the project promoters that are coming to the Deputy with ideas is to set up a system to allow them to get in for consideration and approval.  Perhaps one way in which this can be done is to use County Mayo as an area in which the socioeconomic committee of the local government sector could be piloted.  Hopefully, the Department will come to conclusions with the various community organisations with which it has been discussing these issues within the next couple of weeks.  Were County Mayo to be prioritised, it would allow this structure to utilise itself as a local action group to be able to take applications and submit them to the Department for approval.

People on the ground have suffered extensively and they are concerned about how insurance companies have discharged their duties.

In early June 2012 the most serious summer flooding that has ever been witnessed in the Shannon catchment area began.  This flooding had a devastating effect on the farming community, irrespective of one's county of origin.  The horrifying reality was that thousands of hectares of grasslands and meadow lands which farmers would have used to graze their stock and to harvest and conserve for their winter fodder requirements was totally destroyed.  This forced farmers to house their stock in early summer, at huge financial cost to themselves.  Today farmers in these areas are facing total financial ruin as a result of the flooding.  The only response from official Ireland was the standard response that this was an act of God.  There was no consideration of issues such as damage to the environment, the public good or the level of human suffering and the social and economic effects that farmers were enduring.<\/p><p>  In recent years, all-party Oireachtas committees had come up with proposals and recommendations which would have some beneficial effect as regards summer flooding.  Sadly none of these has ever been acted upon.  Today politicians are putting their faith in CFRAMS, the cartchment flood risk management and assessment study, which is taking place in respect of the Shannon but will not be finalised until 2015 at least.  It is a long way down the line and we will still only have a proposal, a study, a survey, or whatever one wishes to call it.  In the interim we have a major problem.<\/p><p>  Early indications would suggest that farmers are losing confidence in the process, largely because of what I have said, as it was envisaged that there would be a lead agency, namely, the OPW which would dictate what works would be put in place to alleviate flooding.  While all the agencies have a role, such as the OPW, the ESB, Waterways Ireland, National Parks and Wildlife Service, Inland Fisheries Ireland and Bord na M&oacute;na to some extent as well as local authorities, political responsibility must be taken by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes.  None of these people are taking responsibility.  It is unacceptable that agencies can have a veto when proposals are made for the alleviation of flooding and actions are urgently required.  No one agency should have a veto particularly when it comes to protecting the public good which includes the livelihoods of farmers, dwellers in towns and villages along the river. <\/p><p>  In the case of Waterways Ireland, whose remit on the waterways is solely for navigation and recreational purposes, it has consistently allowed artificially high levels to be maintained in our lakes, which has contributed massively to serious summer flooding in recent years.  However, Waterways Ireland has suggested that it is working within a parameter with the ESB through a so-called \"gentleman's agreement\"  to maintain the river and the lakes at a certain level.  This is totally unacceptable.  <\/p><p>  The aim should be to reduce the water levels to the lowest level for navigation purposes so that the river is able to take additional water at critical times such as times of excessively heavy rainfall.  Why were not Met Office forecasting procedures not used in anticipation of the high rainfall that arose last June?  <\/p><p>  In the case of the ESB, it is clear that the holding back of water at critical times has led to a situation where it has contributed massively to serious summer flooding.  There is no doubt that water levels in Lough Ree, Lough Allen and Lough Derg are maintained at an artificially high level.<\/p><p>  Farmers want to know why the water levels in Lough Ree were tampered with in the 1970s and have risen by 0.6 m, which is exactly 2 feet.  These levels were given statutory effect in 1979.  As farmers, we contend that this has been a major issue in respect of flooding since that particular time.  This was done without consultation.  We would like to know who was this facilitating?  Was this to facilitate a wider navigation course all over Lough Ree?  Members of the committee need to address this issue.<\/p><p>  The current system, which is underpinned by protocols dating back to the 1970s, disregards landowners' interests.  It is outdated and needs to be overhauled urgently to address the concerns of farmers whose lands are submerged in water frequently during the summer months.  Surely it is wrong that these agencies can destroy people livelihoods and inflict massive dollops of human suffering along with financial ruin and still not be held responsible.  <\/p><p>  Essential maintenance work has not taken place despite the fact that various reports over many decades indicated that remedial works in key areas along the river Shannon would have a massive beneficial effect for farmers, the wider community and also the protection of our globally threatened wildlife species.  As I have alluded to, it is contended by two groups in the House that certain works would have massive beneficial effects.  We have only to look at the corncrake population which has been wiped out as a direct consequence of summer flooding, particularly in the past ten years.  The figures for same are not supplied in the handout.  In 2002 there were 59 calling males in the Shannon catchment area, that is, between Athlone, Portumna and Meelick, a stretch of about 27.5 miles.  For every calling male bird there is at least one female and two females in many cases.  Today, there is none.  They are gone.  Their nests and their young have been washed away.  I do not think we will ever see a corncrake in that region again.  This is a globally threatened species.  The same will happen to the wader bird population which is decimated to a large extent.  I am talking about the lapwing, the redshank, the curlew and the snipe which are also globally threatened.  They will be washed away like the corncrake if something is not done.<\/p><p>  The consequences of the failure to maintain the Shannon River system, with tributaries such as the river Suck and river Little Brosna since the foundation of the State has also had a major impact on the failure of foreign fishermen to return to our country, largely because they cannot access the river due to major situation and high water levels.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, who has responsibility for OPW, must take a lead and insist on implementing a strategy.  This must include an early warning system for extreme weather patterns and allow water to move on when heavy rainfall is forecast and occurs.  We also need to see essential maintenance work carried out.  All of these measures have to be given legislative effect.  An issue which we as farmers have is that while OPW is the lead agency it has no power to empower the ESB, Waterways Ireland or the National Parks and Wildlife Service to do what needs to be done.  It can cajole them but that is all it can do. <\/p><p>  The promise of a lead agency with proper legislative powers must be delivered upon.  That was promised by the two previous Governments and it still has not happened.  The current situation whereby more than half a dozen agencies have a say in water levels, with some having a veto on whether remedial works go ahead, is untenable and must be changed.  The failures of the past must not be allowed continue and it is up to the Government to address the issue once and for all.<\/p><p>  In his opening address the Chairman raised the issue of insurance.  We should not get hung up on that issue.  I have 100 acres of land which has been flooded since 7 June 2012 and it is still flooded.  I do not mind it being flooded now.  I got nothing out of it during the whole summer and I do not know if I will get anything out of it next summer.  I do not have money.  Even if I could afford to insure it, why would I insure it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013021200004#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Silke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360680000,"counter":177,"content":"<p>On the lead agency issue, has Mr. Silke met directly the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, or has he made submissions to OPW on how that lead agency should be formed and the kind of role and functions it would have?

In some cases, as in the situation as it pertains, it might be the ability to tell them not to do something or to cease a practice that is contributing to the difficulty.

The OPW tells us clearly that it cannot effectively command ESB, Waterways Ireland, the National Parks and Wildlife Service or any such body to carry out any process that needs to be carried out.  For instance, last year when there was a minuscule amount of maintenance work done in an area below the gates in Mellick, the National Parks and Wildlife Service vetoed the work.  I, myself, would have had contact with the National Parks and Wildlife Service over the past ten or 15 years since I started my involvement in IFA and it was the senior staff in the National Parks and Wildlife Service, not the OPW, who got that through for us.  The OPW had no power to do it and its officials themselves told me so.  That, to me, flies in the face of everything that is right.  When there is a person who knows what needs to be done or what would be of some help, and people are suffering seriously because it is not done, it is wrong that an agency such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service can veto it because it raises questions related to the Habitats Directive.<\/p><p>  The habitats directive is a rough tool.  Where I live, for instance, tiny islands have accumulated on the River Shannon which are on no map.  Most of them have accumulated in my time and I am not yet 100 years of age.  What happens is they accumulate from silt from Bord na M&oacute;na and natural run-off and then a bird drops a seed and a little twig grows, as in a sally bush, an ash bush or whatever, and 20 years down the line there would be a tree and then it is alluvial woodland.  This is what has happened.  It comes under Annex I of the habitats directive when one wants do something to take it out of there.  It is a major problem.  We need to look at that issue.  It is critical for the likes of the OPW, which has its own environmentalists, to take on the likes of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and tell them that the public good is at risk, that people's liveihoods and human health are at stake and this must be stopped.<\/p><p>  We are not looking for the River Shannon to be drained.  We never did.  After a summer like last year, we would accept flooding if every procedure were followed, the impediments were cleaned out of the river and the levels in the lakes were appropriate, but we cannot accept it on the back of what is there at the minute.  That is why it is so critical to us that there would be a lead agency such as the OPW that would have the power to command other agencies to do what needs to be done.  That is not the way it is at present.<\/p><p>  In the time of then Minister of State, Dr. Martin Mansergh, when he appointed the OPW as the lead agency, Mr. Gerry Gunning and I met him to discuss the matter.  We put a great deal of pressure on him that there was a need to put legislation in place to strengthen OPW's hand.  Dr. Mansergh told us - he was clear on it and Mr. Gunning remembers this the same as I do - that if the statutory instrument was put in place and found to be wanting, then he would go back and strengthen it.  It is in place two years.  That was after the flooding of November-December 2009 and it has not been strengthened.  The OPW staff are walking around like lame sheep.  They have no power. <\/p><p>  I watched the misery of people last summer.  There are farmers today who are bankrupt.  It is as simple as that.  I do not know how they will pay their bills to the merchants and others.  We are facing into an awful crisis.  I do not think anybody realises it, but we are.  I am living and farming in the middle of it.  I can tell the committee there is real despair and we need to tackle it.  The only hope we have today is to come in to the likes of this committee.  If the committee cannot do something for us, we all must throw our hats at it and say the game is over.  There is no future for us, and I can say that clearly.<\/p><p>  I, myself, am involved in the suckler cow sector.  We got a large cut in the budget.  I lost &euro;3,500 or more in the budget as a consequence of the farm cuts, not to mention any other cuts.  That is significant in a year like this to the likes of us down along the river.  Most of the farmers down along the river are involved in the suckler cow sector and sheep because their land is not good enough for dairying.  I do not see a future unless the committee can do something for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013021200005#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Silke"},{"type":"speech","time":1360680000,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Mr. Silke outlined fairly well the case of those who are affected in that part of the country.

I had a field of fodder beet and a field of turnips that were covered over and I could get nothing for them.  They rotted.  One must ask oneself whether, if one was insured, one would have got something.  Possibly, one could have.  The question is whether one could continue paying the premium.  I gave the genuine example of the young girls in Derrymullen in Ballinasloe.<\/p><p>  I do not see that as being where farmers want to go.  As farmers, we see that one insures one's house and one can insure one's stock, etc.  On insuring one's land against flooding, a farmer who loses his or her land loses every ability to feed his or her cattle for that year.  We lost every bit of our ability to feed our cattle last year.  The feed we used was bought feed.  Everyone is in the same boat.  It is a matter of how long one can stay at it and take this.<\/p><p>  Let us say I was insured last year.

It is not the first time they have come before the committee to discuss this issue.  The lack of progress since it was last discussed makes this an opportune time to raise it, which is the purpose of the committee meeting, and the Chairman laid out the matters for discussion.  The response given by Mr. Silke is very stark and shocking to those unaware of the situation.  Most committee members are aware of it.<\/p><p>  It is obvious that no insurance company would touch the region as it stands because it would not be at all profitable.  It is only when a mechanism is put in place to rectify the situation or seek to rectify it that one may consider the possibility of insurance.  Listening to the presentation, what jumps out at us is that many farmers are ruined, bankrupt, in crisis and despairing.  Insurance is not an issue for these people.  There has been no compensation and no Government fodder scheme to deal with the crisis and the despair being felt.<\/p><p>  We raised this issue as far back as last June on Leaders' Questions and as Topical Issue matters.  This led to an Oireachtas joint committee consulting a wide variety of bodies and making recommendations.  We believed legislation might flow from the report.  The progressive recommendations made are similar to and in agreement with those of the delegation with regard to the OPW taking the lead in managing the Shannon, the introduction of early flood warning systems and utilising boglands as flood plains.  We had hoped the next stage would be to debate the report on the floor of the House and have a response issued by the Ministers with responsibility in this regard, including the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes.  This may have allowed the Government to put in train a series of measures to seek to address the issue.<\/p><p>  I do not wish to be party political, and I acknowledge what was said about successive Governments, but in recent years it has become very much a summer flooding issue.  It is a regular occurrence.  What happened in 2009 was thought to be an exception but it also happened last year.  Unless a concerted effort is made on foot of the recommendations from the delegation and the Oireachtas joint committee, we will see a wasteland developing, and those who wish to do so can preserve it all they like afterwards because there will be no interference with it.  This is with regard to what Mr. Silke stated about islands emerging in the floods.<\/p><p>  With the best will in the world the committee and its Chairman saw fit to address an issue pertaining to the insurance industry and its response to flooding.  The IFA in its wisdom saw fit to bring a group which represents an area with a huge amount of flooding.  I do not necessarily want to look at this from a national perspective.  The immediate pressure and significance of the Shannon callows is what is paramount.  I have sought to impress publicly the need for the report, the recommendations of which I support, to be brought to the floor of the House, for a formal response to be made by the Government and for efforts to be made to have the report's recommendations implemented, or at least a working committee put in place to report back to the committee thereafter to acknowledge what progress, if any, can be made on the recommendations.  I know it has the full support of and commitment from all committee members, having produced the report under the chairmanship of Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.<\/p><p>  As far as the committee is concerned, Mr. Silke is pushing an open door.  I hope it will be reciprocated by the Government and the Ministers with responsibility in the area showing a willingness to bring about change and recognise the gravity of the situation, which is absolutely and despairingly ridiculous at this stage.  I ask the Chairman to use his influence in so far as he can, whether through the Whips or his association with the Government, to bring this to the floor of the House.  Perhaps a Friday sitting could be used for a response to be put on the record and for a process to be put in place by which we can seek to effect change and put in place the recommendations which have universal approval.  It would be different if we were all coming at this from different angles and with different ideas.  I know financing will be put forward as an issue and an impediment, as will the vested interests of the ESB, but a protocol can be agreed in the public interest and public good to protect not only the livelihoods of those affected but also the commercial viability of the entire region.  I look forward to progress in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013021200006#G00200","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1360680600,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Silke, Mr. Parlon, Mr. McHugh and Mr. Gunning for coming before the committee and making their presentation.

Like Deputy Cowen I have been involved in meetings with the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, and have tried to impress on him the urgency of the situation.<\/p><p>  While the Shannon is the major concern, in the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly there are problems with drainage works on the rivers Goul, Erkina, Nore, Whitehorse and Barrow.

In my couple of years in the D&aacute;il dealing with this matter this matter has been the most disappointing experience for me because we have debated the topic so many times.  Last year the IFA approached me about the issue and that was the first time that I had to deal with it.  I have never been a Deputy before but even as a county councillor the subject of flooding did not come at us that big.  Last year was the first time that I had to deal with the matter.<\/p><p>  As I am sure the IFA is aware, it organised a meeting on the River Shannon.  I attended and was well educated by the people there who explained the situation to me.  One could not miss the frustration felt by all of the farmers.  There was talk of some man who said in desperation that he would blow up the dam rather than let flooding return for another summer.  The meeting appeared to generate a little momentum.  This is where my political naivety comes in because I thought that there was some political momentum.  I spoke to Mr. Silke in detail, as did my parliamentary assistant who is an engineer and has a good understanding of the area.  We examined to him how we could push the topic.  A meeting then took place between Department officials and the Minister responsible, Deputy Hayes, was present.  My understanding of the meeting was that we needed to do a PR job and get the information out that a study was going to be done and nothing could happen until then.  It was an emergency situation with farmers on the verge of suicide in some cases so something had to be done.  I decided to kick up a row about it in order that something might be done.  Subsequently, a meeting took place in the AV room at Leinster House which Deputy Hayes openly said he had been bumped into.  I wish that he had not said that but he did.  This is where the IFA's problem lies.  Earlier today it asked if the committee cannot do anything then who can.  The IFA will throw its hat at the problem.  The committee is the only game in town for the IFA because we are the only people who can do anything.<\/p><p>  The IFA is aware of how the parliamentary system works but I shall explain it.  The Minister is the boss and one must try to influence him.  It is a question of where there is a will, there is a way.  Is there a will?  It is quite clear what needs to be done.  There have been umpteen reports.  This good report was put together by Deputy Corcoran Kennedy and the rest of the people involved so it is clear what needs to be done.  We know what needs to be done.  We have a problem with silting needs to be cleared.  We need one body to control the silt removal which was recommended but it did not happen.<\/p><p>  One of the big things that come to my mind is that the job of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which seems to be the blocker on an awful lot of these things is to preserve rare wildlife.  It is extraordinary what Mr. Silke told us, and we heard it before, that the actions of the NPWS has destroyed the future for the corncrake in the area.  It is bad enough that there is no action but its is worse that the body who is meant to preserve creatures has created a situation where they will not be around any more.  A lot more needs to be done.  Unfortunately, Leinster House will always be a talking shop unless the man with the power to pull the lever does so.  The Minister knows what must be done and he must do it.  There is no point compiling more reports because if we do we will have to cut down more trees which in turn will lead to more flooding.<\/p><p>  The delegation is probably aware that I have had my differences with the IFA on other matters.  I have dealt with a lot of people since I came here two years ago.  Having had dealings with the delegation I can vouch that they are a credit to the IFA.  I wish that people would listen to Mr. Silke.  We met him and one was left in no doubt that he wanted a solution and works really hard.  Unfortunately, he does not seem to have got anything back.  Perhaps my saying it will put some pressure on the Minister.  I hope that it will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013021200007#H00300","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1360681200,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Before I call the Government representative I must inquire whether Deputy Stanley wishes to ask a question on the OPW and the NPWS?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013021200007#H00400","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1360681200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Yes, on the issue of climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013021200007#H00500","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1360681200,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Okay.

Maintenance work has been ongoing on the Little Brosna for three years.  When I talk about maintenance work, the same as Mr. Silke, it is not taking out silt because one would not be allowed do that, but it is cutting the bushes and trees that are hanging down into the river and blocking it.  The problem with doing that type of work is that one is not allowed on to the river until after 1 September because one cannot do anything while the trees are in bloom.  Anyone who knows the area knows how difficult it is to get a dry spell in September and October.  Work was carried out in 2011 and I was working with Vincent Hussey of the OPW.  In order to get work done, one must apply to the OPW through Mr. Hussey and then he must apply for a licence from the National Parks and Wildlife Service to do that work.  It was difficult to get that licence in the first couple of years so in the first year it was 25 September before we got the digger in.  During the second year, we got them in on 20 September.  In that second year, we had agreed to take out 12 trees that was hanging down into the river.  We only managed to get half the work done before the weather broke and the diggers had to be removed after a week.<\/p><p>  In the year 2012, we had a bit of dry weather in September and we moved again to try to get the work done.  I had applied to do so in June and July through Mr. Vincent Hussey and around the middle of September we got the diggers in but when the diggers arrived, the local ranger decided that an environmental impact study on otters was required before they would allow any more trees to be taken out, even though they had taken out half of them the year before.  That is the type of stupidity goes on.  I lost the head with the ranger on this issue, to the extent that on a Friday evening he telephoned a man to come and look at the river first thing on the Monday morning and see whether the work could go ahead.  It was passed and the diggers were able to take out the rest of the trees on the Monday.  That is just an example of the difficulty of getting work done.<\/p><p>  We have a major difficulty with maintenance work on the River Shannon.  We dealt with two people, Mr. Vincent Hussey and Mr. John Curtin.  I worked with Vincent Hussey for three years and he has been moved on.  John Curtin, who had put in a big effort in doing things, has been transferred to the monuments section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013021200008#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Parlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360682400,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives of the Irish Farmers' Association for their presentation.

I know the farmers have an issue with the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, system and also that they have participated in the research being done by the company concerned.  Are they concerned by the delay, or do they lack confidence that anything of value will come out of it?  <\/p><p>  We all acknowledge the need for maintenance works.

Neither had they dealt with the issue of the feasibility of using cutaway bogs north of Lough Ree.  There are thousands of acres of bog in that area.  CFRAM should have been involved in looking into that.  If Jacobs were to deal with the problem in a comprehensive way, which we were led to believe they would, they should have done that.  We were disappointed by a number of other issues, but by that in particular.<\/p><p>  A second thing disappointed me personally.  I spent considerable time on the River Shannon and on other rivers identifying critical areas.  We gave that information, which took a long time to prepare, to the OPW.  That report was a layman's perception of what needs to be done, but it was reality none the less.  Senior people in the OPW agreed that every area we identified was a critical area.  There are a number of critical areas between Athlone and Meelick, and particularly between Banagher and Meelick.  We identified them to Jacobs and the OPW.<\/p><p>  We could address the problems of those areas and do something with them before Jacobs come up with their proposals.  I do not see a lot happening with Jacob's proposals.  In the current economic situation we do not have the funds to do what it is hoped they will propose.  We will go down the road for at least ten years before we have money to do that.  In the interim, however, we could carry out minor alleviation works that would not cost an arm and a leg, with the proper agreement with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and possibly with the involvement of Bord na M&oacute;na.  Bord na M&oacute;na must come back into the process.  It put the stuff into the Shannon in the first place and it must be involved.  If everything could be married together, we could address the problem and stop at least some of the suffering being caused by flooding at present.<\/p><p>  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy mentioned abatement works.  I would be worried about that.  In the River Suck, for example, there is fall of about 60 ft. between Castlerea and Ballinasloe and only 5 ft. from Ballinasloe to the River Shannon.  When the Shannon rose 7 ft., the water flooded the houses in Ballinasloe.  How do we stop the Shannon coming back up to Ballinasloe?  We might stop the Suck going down into the Shannon but we will not stop the Shannon coming back up into Ballinasloe.  That is what is happening.<\/p><p>  The only way to address this issue is to get the water flowing and managed properly. That has not happened.  It is a matter we must address.

I do not want to rehearse some points, but Bord na M&oacute;na has tabled a proposal.  That company has a significant responsibility in this regard, given what it has got away with.  Actually, I should say \"what it has done\", as getting away with it is no good to anyone.  It has damaged the River Shannon and other rivers in the area.  I have first-hand experience of that damage in Templetuohy.  After the mines moved into the area, we saw the depth of the problem in the rivers, which Bord na M&oacute;na had flooded and blocked.  The company is indecisive and is unwilling to clean those rivers or relieve flooding in the area.<\/p><p>  The company proposes to extract water from the River Shannon close to the bridge of Portumna in Carrigahorig.  I mentioned this, as Mr. Silke stated that summer flooding rather than winter flooding was his prime concern.  However, all of the stakeholders in the area - tourism, boating, etc. - are against the proposal.  Where does he stand on this proposal?  Would it be of benefit to the callows, particularly during the summer?<\/p><p>  What is necessary among the stakeholders, particularly the ESB, OPW, Bord na M&oacute;na and National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, is a bit of common sense and common purpose, none of which is apparent.  Given our experience of flooding, no one has the common sense to plan ahead and relieve water levels before a deluge of rain by setting aside water storage areas.  The storage areas of the bodies I mentioned are always full before a flood.  The heavy rains exacerbate the situation.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge that this critical problem is a large one.

The OPW facilitated a briefing by Jacobs Engineering to the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, on 24 October, which members will recall, and to the joint Oireachtas committee on 28 November regarding the report prepared by the committee reviewing the operating regulations and procedures of the control structures along the River Shannon with the purpose of identifying potential improvements with respect to flood risk management that could be introduced in the short term.<\/p><p>  Relevant to Mr. Parlon's query, it was agreed arising from those consultations that the OPW would explore with the ESB and Waterways Ireland the possibility of conducting a water level monitoring exercise involving the controlled raising and lowering of weir boards, subject to favourable hydrological conditions.

They do not need to make notes.<\/p><p>  The results of such an exercise would inform consideration by the ESB and Waterways Ireland of a possible voluntary change to the management regime at Athlone weir.

In January of this year, the OPW met the ESB and Waterways Ireland to discuss the matter and review the scheduling of such an exercise.  It was agreed to involve Jacobs Engineering to advance the water monitoring proposal that is to take place shortly, but this cannot be done unless conditions are favourable.  The question of responsibility for river maintenance is also being examined.  Something is being done.  This issue has not been forgotten.

That is an extremely critical area.  It is approximately a mile from the bridge in Banagher down towards Meelick.  We have identified that area.  The OPW has the printout on these areas and I have given it all the details on this.  I can give the details of what we have identified to the committee if it would like that information.  Minor remedial works need to be done but that is one of the most critical areas.  There is also an area north of Banagher, a place called Derryholmes, which desperately needs to be looked at.  If we could tackle small areas like these, particularly the stretch between Banagher and Meelick and then move on towards Shannonbridge, there is no doubt it would have a massive beneficial effect.  I do not want to give a big rigmarole about the areas because there is no point in setting out ten sites that need works carried out and for works not to be carried out on any of them.  If we were to concentrate on two sites and carry out the necessary works, we could see if they would have a beneficial effect.  I have no doubt about saying that it would have a beneficial effect because I know that area intimately as I live in that general area.<\/p><p>  Regarding the issue of water going to Dublin, I have said from the word go, long before flooding was an issue and in terms of doing something about this issue, that if we had an abundance of water and the people on the east coast wanted it that they should not be refused it.  That was my gut feeling, irrespective of a perception about flooding.  There are three aspects about the issue of water going to Dublin, the first is that it should go to Dublin, the second is that it is being taken from the wrong place, and third is that it will make no significant difference to flooding of any description.<\/p><p>  I gave the water levels for Lough Ree on the morning of 7 June last, namely, 36.88 m and 37.7 m.  There was more than enough water held back in Lough Ree over and before the minimum navigation level not only to serve the Dublin area but the whole of the east coast for 15 months.  That is the amount of water that was held back in Lough Ree.  For anybody to say that taking water from there will decimate the Shannon and do this, that and the other, is telling blatant untruths.  It is as simple and straightforward as that.  It will have no appreciable effect.  That is the reason I was a little fed up with the people from Jacobs Engineering when they had not investigated the possibility of moving water into the cutaway bogs north of Lough Ree.  If water is needed in Dublin, there is a ready-made source as it were and it need not interfere with the River Shannon.  If there is a dry summer, the water is available if it is needed for Dublin and, if it is not, it can be released whenever it is considered right to do so through the Shannon.  It is safe to do that.  <\/p><p>  The water is going to Dublin now and the Shannon is going to be raped again.  It was raped by Bord na M&oacute;na and down through the years by the local authorities.  I have been told by old people in the area that one of the reasons the levels were raised in Athlone was the need for the sewage from the town to be decimated.  The level of water that came over the weir wall was strong enough to shove it down and push it out over callows, which it did.  The callows are not as fertile now as they were and that is the reason.  I am pulling no punches here, this is the reality.  With the water that is going to Dublin now, the Shannon is going to be raped again and that is wrong.  We should have a programme for the water going to Dublin.  We have a resource that is destroying our livelihoods and the east coast needs that resource, but it should involve a cost.  The money derived from it should be invested in restoring the Shannon to where it was when the British left and in that way we could have better fishing, better boating activity and people could live in harmony.  As a farmer, I am not against the people engaged in boating activity on Lough Ree who want the levels high all the time, as do anglers.  Let us call a spade a spade.  We could marry this together and live in harmony if this was properly approached.  The water is being given too cheaply at present.  It should not be an issue in terms of it going from Terryglass and I believe it is going from there. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013021200011#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Silke"},{"type":"speech","time":1360683600,"counter":222,"content":"<p>No, it is going from Carrigahorig.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013021200011#M00400","speaker":"1087"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1360683600,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Okay, Carrigahorig.
