Work on this activity was carried out by my Department in consultation with the Department of Finance and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, despite a high level of engagement with a wide range of potential providers and financiers of social housing, no new model of provision and\/or financing of social housing on an off-balance sheet basis could be identified.<\/p>  <p>In response to this outcome, it was decided instead to commit &euro;10 million per annum from the Bord G&aacute;is proceeds, over a longer period, which could be used to secure the development of a pilot affordable rental scheme.  Action 4.6 of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan   provided for the introduction of an affordable rental scheme to enhance the capacity of the private rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  Provision was made for &euro;10 million to be allocated through my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the recently published Strategy for the Rental Sector, the commitment on affordable rental is now to be progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones.  Lands held by local authorities in rent pressure zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, targeting middle income households, in mixed tenure developments.

I note that there is\u00a0considerable common ground between the NERI report and the Government&rsquo;s Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan\u00a0and Strategy for the Rental Sector.  For example, and in line with Rebuilding Ireland, the NERI report concludes that: supply is the most significant challenge at present; there is a need to increase public investment in new permanent social housing stock; traditional patterns of demand are changing: increased labour market mobility and wider economic factors are encouraging a lesser reliance on home ownership; a significant proportion of the required new stock needs to be provided specifically for rental; the State needs to create the right conditions for investment in the delivery of rental accommodation; and that local authorities, approved housing bodies and the Housing Finance Agency all have a key role to play in the delivery of housing.<\/p>  <p>  Through Rebuilding Ireland, the Government is progressing a range of actions to meet these challenges. Over the lifetime of the plan, the overall social housing stock will be increased\u00a0by providing\u00a047,000 social housing units\u00a0through local authorities and approved housing bodies using &euro;5.3billion in capital funding and Housing Finance Agency loan finance.  In addition, under the strategy for the rental sector,\u00a0a range of supply side measures are\u00a0being progressed\u00a0including: build to rent models; use of State-owned lands to deliver affordable rental in areas of\u00a0high demand; measures to increase the supply of dedicated student accommodation\u00a0to free-up units in the general rental market; supports to bring vacant stock into use; consideration of tax and fiscal incentives to encourage additional supply. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to\u00a0the commitment to advancing projects\u00a0to deliver\u00a0additional rental accommodation, the strategy for the rental sector noted that the\u00a0Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to develop a \"cost rental\" option, taking account of work already completed in this area, including by NESC and others.  This is also\u00a0the central recommendation in the report by NERI.<\/p>  <p>  In line with this commitment,\u00a0action 12 of the strategy for the rental sector provides that\u00a0my Department will lead an expert group to develop a cost rental model for the Irish rental sector, addressing issues such as funding mechanisms, the need to grow the necessary institutional capacity, particularly within the AHB sector - whether through mergers, new entrants or strategic partnerships - the households to be targeted and the appropriate regulation mechanisms. \u00a0The expert group will consider the proposals put forward by\u00a0NERI -\u00a0including the proposal to establish a semi-State company to progress the cost rental model - in the course of its work, which is scheduled to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600055#WRD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Repair and Leasing Scheme","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600055#WRD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[17120\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600055#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if approval will be provided to owners of vacant properties for refurbishment scheme to apply directly to local authorities rather than AHBs to avail of the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>The repair and leasing scheme, RLS, has been developed, under pillar 5 of Rebuilding Ireland, to assist private property owners and local authorities or approved housing bodies, AHBs, to harness the accommodation potential that exists in certain vacant properties across Ireland.

The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.  The scope and cost of the works required, and the recoupment of the works cost through the lease payments, will be agreed between the property owner and the local authority or AHB.  The maximum cost of repairs allowable under the scheme is &euro;40,000.<\/p>  <p>  A property owner can either choose to arrange for a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.

Last year, &euro;935 million was\u00a0invested in providing\u00a0some 19,000 social housing supports. \u00a0Almost 5,300 homes were built, refurbished or acquired and some 12,000 housing assistance payment tenancies were established.\u00a0In 2017, some 21,000 households will have\u00a0their social housing needs\u00a0met.\u00a0 <\/p><p>With regard to\u00a0the wider housing market, the ambition under Rebuilding Ireland is also\u00a0to increase and accelerate the supply of homes for those who do not qualify for social housing support.\u00a0 Under pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland, I am working across Government and\u00a0with other stakeholders,\u00a0using all the levers available, to\u00a0activate idle sites, particularly in urban areas where demand is greatest, so as to deliver affordable, mixed tenure housing at scale.<\/p><p>While I am fully aware of the considerable further progress required to activate housing development sites and to increase and\u00a0accelerate delivery to\u00a0the scale required, the indicators\u00a0are positive and\u00a0the latest residential commencements and completions data show that house-building activity is continuing to grow. <\/p><p>Completions for the 12 month period to end January 2017 stood at 15,256 homes, an 18% increase year on year.

The Review Group made recommendations in areas such as culture; leadership and structure; audit and risk management; corporate functions and IT systems; and benchmarks. Significant progress has been made in implementing these recommendations as outlined below and the work of embedding and sustaining the changes continues to be prioritised in my Department.  <\/p><p>The following recommendations, which mirror many of the actions set out in the Civil Service Renewal Plan, have been implemented in the Department: <\/p><p>-  The Department&rsquo;s Management Advisory Committee was reconstituted as a Management Board, new personnel were appointed, both from within the Department and externally, and lateral mobility put into effect.  A new Deputy Secretary post was created in April 2015 to provide more cohesive leadership across the criminal justice portfolio and following a competition, a Secretary General was permanently appointed in October 2016.  Both I and the Minister of State for Equality, Immigration and integration meet on a monthly basis with the full Management Board;<\/p><p>-  Following consultation, a Culture and Values Charter was published in 2016 with the objective of fostering a more outward facing, listening organisational culture. These values have been signed off by the Department's leadership team and are fed into all induction and leadership training with a view to informing the way in which the Department communicates with staff and stakeholders.  It is recognised that changes to organisational culture takes sustained effort over time and a cross grade team, led by the Secretary General, is working to ensure that this continues to be embedded in the organisation;<\/p><p>-  Robust supporting processes have been put in place to enhance leadership and oversight of the Department and wider sector and to facilitate more effective management and governance of the strategic objectives. A Corporate Governance Framework for the Department was published in April 2016.  Since 2015 an annual Strategic Plan has been published, which draws together in one single plan all the strategic priorities across the Department. To support the Management Board in its oversight of this programme, a programme management reporting system has been implemented, progress is monitored monthly by the Management Board and twice yearly progress reports are published on the website;<\/p><p>-Risk management processes have been significantly strengthened and the Department's Audit Committee which has a majority of external members has reviewed its processes in line with the recommendations;<\/p><p>-  Since March 2014, the Department has also put in place revised systems and procedures to ensure that<b><\/b>all correspondence is handled appropriately which specifies that high priority correspondence is brought to the attention of both myself and relevant officials and followed up in a timely manner;<\/p><p>-  The Report made several recommendations regarding relationship management and oversight of Agencies, all of which have been implemented. Agency performance and governance arrangements have been formalised and strengthened through formal Performance\/Service Delivery Agreements and Frameworks<b><\/b>agreed with 24 key agencies including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as mentioned above. In addition, as the Deputy is aware, the Policing Authority was established in January 2016 to bring a new and dedicated layer of public accountability to the administration of policing services and provide additional impetus to drive necessary changes in the policing system and its practices.<\/p><p>-  Formal structures have been put in place to support communication and collaboration with the agencies in the Justice and Equality sector: the Civil Agencies Network covers a range of diverse agencies and meets quarterly to share information and best practise while the Criminal Justice Strategic Committee comprising the heads of all the relevant agencies was established in 2015.  The Strategic Committee also meets quarterly and is driving effective collaboration through a detailed work-plan on a range of shared interests from international cooperation, data needs and interoperability to leadership development and victims services.<\/p><p>-  A programme of work in regard to Data and Information has been developed and is being taken forward in cooperation with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, including a system providing real time support to the front-line Joint Agency Response to Crime (JARC) programme, the roll-out of an e-Submissions system and the development of the Justice and Equality Hub, to facilitate better collaboration and information sharing between the Department and its stakeholders and the provision of data and management information to support the development of more evidence based policy;<\/p><p>-  Many of the Review Group's recommendations related to Human Resources management and the Department held an open competition last year to appoint a professional Head of Strategic Human Resources.  Following this appointment, a three year workforce plan has been developed which directly supports the Department&rsquo;s 2016-2019 Strategy and informs recruitment and deployment of available resources to effectively deliver on the Department's business objectives as well as identifying training needs.  The 2017 training plan includes risk management, customer service, leadership development and performance management.  The Department is also developing its HR capacity, including the recent implementation of a business partner model to try to ensure that the business needs, including managed mobility and succession planning, are being met by HR.  A HR strategy is being prepared which will reflect the changes being implemented since the Toland Report and which will reflect the internal Change Programme, the forthcoming Civil Service HR strategy and public service reform.<\/p><p>-  A Head of Communications was appointed and a strategy covering internal and external communications in support of the change programme was published in 2016.<\/p><p>New structured governance arrangements with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have also been introduced.  A Governance Framework Document is in place which makes provision, amongst other things, for regular Governance meetings including tripartite meetings involving my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority.  In that context, senior officials meet monthly with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a senior management level to oversee progress on  strategic and resource matters such as the Modernisation and Renewal Programme, IR issues, Garda recruitment, civilianisation, ICT, and Garda buildings.  The Department also participates in the Garda ICT Oversight Board monitoring the ongoing ICT Programme which forms an integral part of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme.  In addition, arrangements are in place for quarterly meetings involving the Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority in the context of the Authority's statutory functions in relation to advising the Minister with regard to Garda resources.<\/p><p>In addition to the ongoing reforms in the policing area, achieving better collaborative practice and parallel to implementing the major change programme, the Deputy will be aware of the volume of work delivered over the past 3 years on the Department's business agenda across very significant areas of public life. Major achievements include the Children and Family Relationship Act 2015, the Marriage Equality Referendum, International Protection Act 2015 incorporating a single applications procedure and implementation of the McMahon report recommendations, progressing the implementation of the EU Victims Directive, establishment of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) to meet Ireland&rsquo;s international humanitarian obligations, amongst many others.<\/p><p>In terms of recommendations not yet implemented, the Review Group recommended the development of a HR strategy which is in preparation in parallel with the Civil Service HR Strategy as mentioned above.  It also recommended changes to the Department&rsquo;s structure but was not definitive on the detail of this.  The Department&rsquo;s structure has been reviewed in recent months and a number of options for structural changes are under consideration.  Given the workload on hand, it is envisaged that structural change will be implemented on a phased basis.It should be noted, however, that despite concerns expressed by the Review Group about the breadth of its responsibilities, my Department's remit has continued to expand significantly in recent years with responsibility assigned in 2015 for additional agencies including the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland.  In addition, since the Review Group reported, the Charities Regulator, the Policing Authority and the Legal Services Regulatory Authority have been all been established.  Clearly all of these are necessary bodies but it remains the case that my Department has an expanding remit with associated risks.  <\/p><p>Finally, I should add that over the next few months the Department will be taking stock of the changes implemented to date with a view to ensuring that the measures outlined above are embedded, sustained and further developed, continuing to take account of the wider process of Civil Service Renewal.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b>This process will also examine priorities for the next phase of reform with a view to driving continuous improvement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600057#WRF04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Inspectorate Reports","counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600058#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[17218\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600058#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the recommendations of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate in its Changing Policing in Ireland report, in tabular form; the actions which have been taken on each recommendation to date; the planned actions on each recommendation; the anticipated timeframe for implementation of each recommendation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":209,"content":"<p>Last July, the Government approved my proposals for a Five Year Reform and High Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which combines the Government&rsquo;s response to the report of the Garda Inspectorate report 'Changing Policing in Ireland' and the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government to increase the visibility, effectiveness and responsiveness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Of the 81 recommendations in the Inspectorate report 74 were directed to the Garda Commissioner.  Of these, 71 were accepted or accepted subject to modifications.  The vehicle for the implementation of the agreed recommendations is the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation &amp;amp; Renewal Programme 2016-2021, the overall aim of which is to modernise and professionalise An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the 21st century.  Key agreed reforms include the roll-out of a Divisional model of policing and further civilianisation.<\/p>  <p>  Government has agreed that the current District model of policing will be replaced on a phased basis with a Divisional one where responsibilities are allocated on a functional rather than a geographical basis subject to appropriate modifications to meet the needs of large rural Divisions and ensure that the close relationship with communities is maintained.  Four pilots are in train and are due to be evaluated later this year.  The number of regions and Divisions will be maintained at six and 28 respectively for the time being but will be reviewed as the Divisional model is rolled out.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to civilianisation, the Government, in line with international experience, agreed a medium term goal of 20% civilians to be adopted for the overall Garda workforce to be achieved through (i) a 'civilian by default policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and (ii) redeployment of Garda&iacute; and backfilling by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.  Garda management is developing a workforce plan to achieve this. <\/p>  <p>  I have referred the agreed recommendations of the Inspectorate report to the Policing Authority in accordance with section 117A(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to monitor and assess their implementation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to report progress to me on a quarterly basis.  I received the first progress report from the Authority in January.  The second is due later this month.  Given the scale and five-year time frame of the reform plan, the Authority reported that its initial attention had been focussed on understanding the agreed recommendations and the MRP, establishing robust structures to ensure a focus is created and maintained on this priority area of work and on identifying a number of priority areas for attention including to ensure that the benefits of investment are realised.  In particular, it has established a dedicated committee to undertake this work area.  While the report acknowledges that substantive reform will take time and persistence by the Commissioner, it notes a very welcome start on further civilianisation.  I expect that reports in due course will include more detailed assessments of the progress, including actions taken and timelines, on the implementation of the  agreed recommendations.  I have asked my officials to consult with the Authority in relation to how its future progress reports in relation to the implementation could be put into the public domain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600058#WRG00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[17219\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600058#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when revised implementation updates for all Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate reports will be made available; the reason no such updates have been published since 2013; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":212,"content":"<p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate was established in July, 2006 under Part 5 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  The role of the Inspectorate is to promote efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Inspectorate undertakes analysis of policies and procedures in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and benchmarks them against the best practices and standards of comparable police services.  To date, the Inspectorate has completed 11 reports.  Their two most recent reports were the <i>Crime Investigation<\/i>report (2014) and the<i>&quot;Changing Policing in Ireland&quot;<\/i>report<i>(2015).<\/i><\/p><p>The Garda Inspectorate has no statutory responsibility for the monitoring of the implementation of recommendations made in its reports.  However, a process to do so was established with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2008 which resulted in the publication of status implementation update reports twice a year on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s website.  The last such regular update was published in November 2013 when, I understand, the process was interrupted due to pressure of work. <\/p><p>However, the Inspectorate and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are now working towards the production, in tabular form, of a document which will indicate the position regarding the implementation of recommendations contained in a number of Inspectorate reports up to and including the Crime Investigation report.  Once completed, the results will be published on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s website.  As the time frame for the conclusion of this work is not clear, my Department has asked for quarterly updates as to the progress in relation to this matter. <\/p><p>It should be noted that the statutory position regarding the monitoring of the implementation of recommendations made in Inspectorate reports has changed.  Section 117(A) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act provides for a role for the Policing Authority in monitoring the measures taken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement the recommendations contained in reports prepared by the Inspectorate. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner published her Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 in June 2016.  This Programme includes recommendations from the various Garda Inspectorate Reports, including the two most recent Inspectorate Reports referred to above.  Key reforms being implemented include the replacement of the current District model of policing with a Divisional model where responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis.  This will be subject to modifications to ensure the close relationship with communities is maintained in large rural Divisions.  In line with international norms, a medium term target of 20% civilians to be achieved by 2021 has been set. <\/p><p>The implementation of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme is primarily a matter for the Commissioner.  However, the Government decided that the Policing Authority should be requested to monitor the implementation of the agreed recommendations in 'Changing Policing in Ireland' and to report to me at regular intervals.  I have received the first such progress report from the Policing Authority.  Their next progress report is due by the end of April.<\/p><p>In July, the Government approved a Five Year Reform and High Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This Plan marries the agreed recommendations in 'Changing Policing in Ireland' with a major investment programme that will increase the number of garda&iacute; to 15,000; double the number of civilians to 4,000; and more than double the number of reserves members to 2,000.  This investment in human capital is supported by a &euro;300 million capital plan that will deliver leading-edge technology and other capital infrastructure to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2017 Estimates reflect this commitment by providing the resources to recruit 800 garda&iacute;, 500 civilians and 300 reserves in 2017. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that at the Government meeting earlier this week I received approval to begin the process of establishing a Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.

My Department received a copy of the draft report from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Head of the Internal Audit on 16 September 2016.  I understand that the draft report was sent to all interested parties for their observations before being finalised.  This was in accordance with standard practice on reports of this nature.  My Department has been in ongoing communication with Garda management in relation to the Report since receipt of the draft.<\/p>  <p>  A copy of the final Report was received by my Department from the Garda Commissioner on 27 March 2017 and was forwarded for my attention by way of submission from my officials on 28 March 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The Report raises serious issues in relation to accounting practices and procedures in the Garda College that must be addressed comprehensively.  Some of the main issues of concern highlighted by the Report include the manner in which the College was run, the existence of a large number of bank accounts and investment accounts linked to the College, staffing issues and issues relating to the ownership and use of certain lands.  These are serious issues in relation to governance and accountability in the College that must be addressed comprehensively and the Garda Commissioner, as the Accounting Officer for the purposes of the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts, must take the lead role in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  I have been assured that the Garda authorities recognise the gravity of the issues raised and that they are taking proactive steps to progress the recommendations in the Report.

The questionnaire, therefore, does not and cannot indicate any time-frame for its return.  The indicated time-frame for return is detailed with the accompanying documentation.<\/p><p>Applicants have a duty to cooperate, as set out in Section 27 of the International Protection Act 2015 (the 2015 Act), and there are consequences for failing to cooperate set out in Section 38.  It is entirely appropriate and necessary, therefore, to include a warning to that effect in the questionnaire.  It should also be noted that Section 38 of the 2015 Act, which deals with the consequences of non-cooperation, sets out specifically the procedure to be followed in these cases and gives applicants ample opportunities to address any potential non-cooperation issues.<\/p><p>The paragraph referred to in the Deputy's question points out that applicants <i>may<\/i>be found not to be cooperating if the form is not returned on time and applies where no explanation or request for additional time to complete it has been received.  The warning will be valid as part of the ongoing work of the organisation.  The CIPO informs me that adherence to time frames helps to ensure that the work of the office is conducted efficiently and that applicants get timely decisions, particularly those in prioritised categories.  For those applications made since the commencement of the 2015 Act, the IPO is asking applicants to adhere to the time-frames indicated.<\/p><p>Regarding the information sent to transition applicants (i.e. those applicants who commenced proceedings under the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) and are now being processed under the 2015 International Protection Act), Paragraph 7.3 clearly states that the IPO 2 Questionnaire should be returned 'if possible, no later than 20 working days from the date of the covering letter'.  The next paragraph 7.4 goes on to state clearly that opportunities to add to the information supplied exist up to two weeks, 'if you are in a position to do so', before the scheduled interview in order to <i>'facilitate the translation of documents if required and ensure that the IPO interviewer has all your papers available and considered  in advance of the interview date'<\/i>.  The word deadline or statutory deadline does not appear in this correspondence and no negative consequences for failing to meet an 'if possible' time frame were included or implied.<\/p><p>Flexibility is being provided by the IPO in recognition of the complexity of the process for applicants affected by the transition provisions and the demands placed on their legal advisors by the transitional arrangements - the wisdom of accessing legal advice is stressed in the Questionnaire.  A call centre is available to answer any queries and extra time is available if required for the completion of the  IPO 2 Questionnaire.

This plan contains a significant volume of\u00a0responses to the current housing crisis, of which the HTB incentive is just one. \u00a0The comprehensive Action Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector.  While the primary focus of the Action Plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time-bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector.<\/p>  <p>  It is in this context that the Help-to-Buy (HTB) scheme should be considered. Its role is to complement the other measures in the Action Plan.  The extent to which the scheme could lead to an increase in residential property prices will very much depend on the speed and efficiency with which structural supply constraints are eliminated and residential building activity increases.  Therefore, the impact of the HTB\u00a0incentive on property prices should not\u00a0be considered in isolation from the impact of other measures contained in the Action Plan, which are primarily designed to increase supply.  In my view, it is the lack of supply that is primarily responsible for driving house prices higher and I would point out that increases in\u00a0house prices\u00a0prevailed long before the introduction of the\u00a0Help to Buy incentive.  I would also point out that the HTB is targeted towards new build homes only, and to first-time buyers only, and it would be simplistic to designate this\u00a0incentive as being the sole or\u00a0the major contributor to\u00a0house price increases.\u00a0 Furthermore, the incentive is designed to help first-time buyers obtain the deposit required to facilitate the purchase of a home.  Therefore it helps first-time buyers to meet the loan to value requirements of the\u00a0Central Bank's macro-prudential rules.  However, the loan to income requirements\u00a0of those rules must also\u00a0be satisfied and the HTB pays no role in relation to that aspect. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the property market including movements in property prices. In this regard, the Deputy may be aware that I have already committed to commissioning an independent economic impact assessment of the\u00a0incentive which will look at, among other issues, its potential\u00a0impact on property prices.\u00a0 The contract for this\u00a0assessment, following the completion of a competitive tendering process, will be awarded shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600059#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Interest Directors Data","counter":267,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600059#WRH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":268,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[17168\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600059#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the name of the public interest directors in State backed banks in each year since the posts were created in tabular form; the total remuneration per director per annum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":269,"content":"<p>The date of appointment and date of resignation\/cessation of office for each of the public interest directors appointed at AIB, BOI and PTSB are as follows:<table><tr><th>Bank<\/th><th>Appointed<\/th><th>Resignation\/cessation<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Allied Irish Banks<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dick Spring<\/td><td>Jan-09<\/td><td>Dec-14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Declan Collier<\/td><td>Jan-09<\/td><td>Jun-12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bank of Ireland<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tom Considine<\/td><td>Jan-09<\/td><td>Still in office.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Joe Walsh*<\/td><td>Jan-09<\/td><td>Nov-14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Permanent TSB<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Margaret Hayes<\/td><td>Dec-08<\/td><td>May-13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ray Mac Sharry<\/td><td>Dec-08<\/td><td>May-13<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*Joe Walsh ceased to be a director following his death in November 2014.<\/p><p>Information in relation to fees paid to each of these directors is publically available in the banks' annual reports\u00a0which can be accessed via the Investor Relations section of respective bank's website\u00a0found at the following links:<\/p><p>AIB: <\/p><p>BOI: <\/p><p>PTSB: <\/p><p>For EBS, prior to its merger with AIB, and the institutions no longer trading, the information requested by the Deputy is\u00a0as follows:<table><tr><th>Bank<\/th><th>Appointed<\/th><th>Resigned<\/th><th>Fees - 2009<\/th><th>Fees - 2010<\/th><th>Fees - 2011<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Anglo Irish Bank*<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Frank Daly<\/td><td>Dec-08<\/td><td>Dec-09<\/td><td>&euro;98,000<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Alan Dukes*<\/td><td>Dec-08<\/td><td>Jun-10<\/td><td>&euro;102,000<\/td><td>&euro;52,000<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EBS<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Anthony Spollen<\/td><td>Jan-09<\/td><td>Jun-11<\/td><td>&euro;37,500<\/td><td>&euro;29,000<\/td><td>&euro;14,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ann Riordan<\/td><td>Jan-09<\/td><td>Jun-11<\/td><td>&euro;37,500<\/td><td>&euro;29,000<\/td><td>&euro;15,600<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>INBS<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Adrian Kearns<\/td><td>Jan-09<\/td><td>Jun-11<\/td><td>&euro;55,000<\/td><td>&euro;36,000<\/td><td>&euro;18,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Rory O'Ferrall<\/td><td>Jan-09<\/td><td>Jun-11<\/td><td>&euro;55,000<\/td><td>&euro;36,000<\/td><td>&euro;18,000<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*IBRC did not appoint any public interest directors under the terms of the Government Guarantee Scheme since 2011.

In accordance with this, ISIF's investment strategy and its activities are closely aligned with and support Government policy across a wide range of areas, including: housing, the agri-sector, communications and energy.<\/p>  <p>  ISIF has already committed &euro;2.7 billion and it acts as a catalyst for other investors to invest in Irish projects.\u00a0 This includes a commitment of &euro;361m to Infrastructure investment essential to the future competitiveness of the Irish economy.  In addition, ISIF's ability to attract co-investment from the private sector means that &euro;7 billion of total investment has been committed up to end December 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Only a certain amount of any capital investment programme can be deliverable via either direct Government expenditure or traditional, proven sources of commercial investment such as PPPs.  Therefore, in the course of implementing its investment strategy and conducting its activities, ISIF has been playing an important role, as both an investor and as a catalyst for private investment, in respect of the capital plan, Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment, 2016-2021. <\/p>  <p>  As a public fund, it is important to the ISIF's success that the commercial investment decisions taken under its mandate are consistent with Government policy.\u00a0 In this regard, ISIF's investment policy dovetails with Government policy while also, critically, maintaining the commercial mandate which is at ISIF's core.<\/p>  <p>  ISIF has made a number of investments which support the objectives and principles of the Capital\u00a0Plan, including investments in student accommodation, enabling infrastructure for residential development and innovative energy investments.  There are strong two-way working relationships between ISIF and the relevant Government Departments and bodies, in order to ensure that ISIF investments are coherent, consistent and co-ordinated with Government policy.  Some noteworthy outcomes arising from such engagement include:<\/p>  <p>  - ISIF's investments under the Connectivity Fund, with a combined value of &euro;57 million, in the areas of telecommunications connectivity with both our European and US neighbours, as well as in transport connectivity through investment in Dublin airport.<\/p>  <p>  - Energy commitments of &euro;44 million to the Dublin Waste to Energy project, &euro;35 million to NTR's onshore wind fund and &euro;76 million investment in Greencoat Renewables DAC.<\/p>  <p>  - Commitments to housing investment of &euro;325 million\u00a0in Activate Capital, &euro;25 million\u00a0in the Ardstone Residential Partnership and &euro;54 million\u00a0in student accommodation in DCU.<\/p>  <p>  - Cornerstone investor in the Irish Infrastructure Fund (IIF) managed by AMP Capital. <\/p>  <p>  In this way, ISIF plays an important role as a key link between Government, semi-State bodies and the private sector.  Such a strategic position is important for the continued investment in Ireland's infrastructure and, indeed our future economic growth and expansion. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, given ISIF's new and unique mandate as a sovereign development fund, and because of the uncertainty regarding the investment opportunities in Ireland, it was agreed that a formal review of the ISIF investment strategy would take place after 18 months.  This was to allow for a sufficient period of time having elapsed before considering the operations and impact of the Fund. <\/p>  <p>  The investment strategy review is ongoing and is examining the performance and impact of ISIF. \u00a0The review includes an appraisal of the success of ISIF's mandate to end\u00a0December 2016 and involves interactions with both my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the process.

Ireland has a successful track record of competing for, and winning, global foreign direct investment.  One of the key pillars of that success is the growth of the International Financial Services (IFS) sector, in particular\u00a0over the past 30 years.  Ireland is now recognised internationally as a leading global centre for internationally traded financial services.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2015, the Government launched the lFS2020 Strategy, a whole-of-government approach to further driving the growth and development of the IFS sector in Ireland.  Implementation\u00a0of the IFS2020 Strategy and the annual Action Plans is driven by a public sector High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC).  The HLIC, meeting on a quarterly basis,\u00a0is chaired by Minister of State for Financial Services Eoghan Murphy TD.  Minister of State Murphy also chairs quarterly meetings of the IFS2020 Joint Committee, comprising of members of the public sector HLIC and senior IFS industry representatives.  Brexit is a standing agenda item at these quarterly meetings.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government is keen to maximise on opportunities that arise from Brexit where possible.  The\u00a0IFS2020 Strategy, the long-term vision for international financial services,\u00a0was developed and put in place long before the UK decision to leave the EU.  However, it provides\u00a0a clear framework to maximise any opportunities that might arise from that decision particularly through the annual Action Plans.  The annual Action Plans enable a tailored\u00a0response to deal with these challenges and opportunities as they arise.  The IFS2020 Strategy combines long-term strategic thinking with the flexible tools to react to any domestic and international developments occurring over the period.  <\/p>  <p>  In January Minister of State Murphy launched the IFS2020 Action Plan for 2017, the Action Plan has two sections, the first is a contextual piece in respect of Brexit, and the second section outlines the 40 specific measures to be actioned under the plan and the lead government departments, agencies or industry bodies who lead on each measure.  <\/p>  <p>  Also in January,\u00a0the second annual European Financial Forum was held in Dublin Castle.  The forum, which was hosted by Minister of State Murphy is designed to showcase Ireland's financial services offering to an international audience and highlight the Government's commitment to the development of international financial services in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  Since his appointment Minister of State Murphy has undertaken a significant number of overseas visits to promote Ireland as a destination for financial services investment and launch the IFS Ireland banner brand.  <\/p>  <p>  In respect of the role of the Central Bank of Ireland, the Central Bank does not have a promotional mandate and legally cannot promote Ireland for financial services investment.  The clear mandate of the bank is to protect consumers and ensure the financial stability of the state.  A key component of a successful and attractive jurisdiction for the location of financial service firms is a strong and independent regulator, with international credibility.  <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is well resourced to meet the current level of demand and enquiries that are being presented.  The Central Bank Commission has recently approved additional complement of 170 staff for 2017 to bring the Central Bank's total staffing to 1,800 full-time equivalents.  The 2017 expansion includes dedicated resources of additional staff to address specific Brexit-related new business needs.  The Central Bank also plans to assess on a regular basis the need for contingency-based extra Brexit related hiring in response to additional business volumes.  <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is already engaging with a significant number of firms across all sectors, and is committed to providing a high quality, fair and transparent authorisation process for all applicants.  The Central Bank will expect a substantive presence in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600060#WRJ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts Data","counter":324,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600060#WRJ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[17444\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600060#WRJ01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total allocated budget per annum for hiring external consultancy firms for his Department's campaign for the relocation of the European Banking Authority; the costs to date; the name of the firms involved to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This has\u00a0included\u00a0meetings with the European Commission\u00a0in order to highlight the benefits of relocating the Authority to Ireland.  The meetings with the EBA have\u00a0in addition sought to determine the needs\u00a0of the\u00a0Authority and its staff,\u00a0after they are\u00a0relocated from London.  <\/p>  <p>  Also, Minister Murphy met with Vice President Dombrovskis (Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue, also in charge of Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union) in March.  The issue of the EBA was raised by the Minister who outlined the benefits of Dublin as a location for the Authority.  <\/p>  <p>  I would point out, that\u00a0the European Commission launched a public consultation on the operations of the\u00a0European Supervisory Authorities (European Banking Authority, European Securities and Markets Authority and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) on the 21st of March.  It is expected a legislative proposal from the Commission\u00a0will follow in due course.  <\/p>  <p>  In the consultation the\u00a0Commission\u00a0challenges the structure of the European Supervisory Authorities, which currently mirrors the traditional tripartite nature of the financial industry.  It has raised the question of whether there\u00a0are potential benefits from merging the EBA with EIOPA, which is based in Frankfurt.  <\/p>  <p>  Due to this uncertainty surrounding the future of the EBA, it is unlikely a final decision on its location will be made in the near future.

A further 650 rapid build homes will be advanced in 2017, with another 500 units to be delivered in 2018.  Sites for rapid build schemes are currently being identified in Louth, Wicklow, Kildare, Meath, Cork, Waterford, Galway and Limerick.<\/p><p>There has been significant pressure to ramp-up rapid build delivery, which local authorities have been responding to positively.  Of particular note is the establishment of a framework of rapid build contractors by the Office of Government Procurement, which means that local authorities across the country will be able to run quicker procurement competitions and advance rapid build projects to site more efficiently and effectively.<\/p><p>My Department has published a comprehensive status list of all social housing construction schemes that are advancing nationwide, as at end-Quarter 4 of 2016. Over 500 approved schemes were listed that, when completed, will deliver some 8,500 new social homes.  The schemes listed range from those that are being designed, through to\u00a0those currently on site and those completed in 2016.  It showed that just over 650 new social houses were built in 2016 and a further 90 schemes, delivering over 1,800 newly built social houses, went on site last year.  I have also continued to approve further schemes which will add to the already strong pipeline.

These include targeted acquisitions,\u00a0the new Repair and Leasing initiative and the range of\u00a0current funded programmes, such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme, Housing Assistance Payment and various leasing arrangements under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme.  Again, properties sourced under these programmes are used to accommodate persons on the local authority housing waiting lists, including those in emergency accommodation or at risk of homelessness.<\/p><p>While the construction programme is being advanced, I have also strongly supported local authorities in the acquisition of new and previously owned houses\/apartments.  In 2016, I provided over &euro;175 million to local authorities for such acquisitions and these approaches are delivering early solutions for people in need of social housing.<\/p><p>Details on the number of properties constructed and purchased by all local authorities for letting to those on their social housing waiting lists are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <\/p><p>.<\/p><p>Information on the full year of 2016 is currently being finalised and will be published shortly.<\/p><p>The results of the statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments carried out in 2016 show that there were 91,600 households on local authority housing waiting lists as at 21 September 2016.  This figure represents an increase of 1,728 households, or 1.9%, on the 89,872 households recorded in the last summary which was carried out in May 2013.  The results of the 2016 Summary are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<\/p><p>.<\/p><p>In line with the commitment under Social Housing Strategy 2020, statutory summaries of social housing assessments are now being carried out on an annual basis, rather than every three years as was\u00a0the case\u00a0in the past.  These regular summaries will provide up-to-date and comprehensive data on the numbers of households qualified for social housing support on an on-going basis and will ensure that social housing supports delivered continue to match the variable profile of those in need.<\/p><p>While a very significant amount of work has been carried out since the publication of Rebuilding Ireland in July 2016, I recognise the significant further progress required to activate additional\u00a0housing development sites and accelerate delivery,\u00a0increasing supply to the scale required, i.e. 25,000 homes per annum by 2021.  The indicators, however, are positive and the latest residential commencements and completions data show that house-building activity is continuing to grow.  Completions for the 12 month-period to end January 2017 stood at 15,256 homes, an 18% increase year on year.  Likewise, commencement notices for 13,334 new homes were submitted in the 12-month period to end January 2017, an increase of 44% year on year.  Importantly, multi-unit developments (i.e. developments other than one-off houses) currently represent 69% of all housing commencements (up from 60% in 2015).  My expectation is that some 18,000 homes will be completed nationally this year.<\/p><p>Building on the early actions taken to make affordable housing more viable through re-affirming apartment guidelines and reforming the development contribution regime, a number of other\u00a0actions are\u00a0underway to make residential property delivery viable, at a far greater scale, and at more generally affordable prices and rents.  For example, the\u00a0announcement,\u00a0on 28 March 2017, of &euro;226 million funding for housing infrastructure on 34\u00a0high-impact sites, through the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation\u00a0Fund (LIHAF),\u00a0will act at the catalyst for the delivery of\u00a0\u00a0some 23,000 homes by 2021 and an overall figure of up to 70,000 homes in\u00a0the next ten to fifteen years in areas of greatest supply constraints.

The Guidelines also aim to ensure that sites being developed for rural housing are suitable with regard to access and wastewater disposal, and also from landscape and design perspectives.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for individual planning authorities to prepare their development plans and the policies contained within such plans, taking account of local and varying geographical and landscape circumstances, as well as the approaches set out under the Guidelines in relation to rural-generated housing.

One scheme facilitates a local authority\u00a0in acquiring ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.  The second scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.

A first-time buyer unable to get a loan from a building society or a bank, may be eligible for a mortgage from the local authority concerned to\u00a0purchase a new or second hand property or build their own home.  The loan can be up to 97% of the price of the house subject to a maximum loan of &euro;200,000.  A local authority mortgage is an annuity mortgage with variable interest rates, so repayments will\u00a0go up and down\u00a0in line with interest rate changes.  The relevant terms and\u00a0conditions applying to local authority housing loans are set out in the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012.<\/p><p>Key eligibility criteria provide that a loan applicant must be a first-time buyer and must be able to show their local authority that they cannot get a loan\u00a0from a bank or building society.  Also, the gross income (before tax) of a single-income household in the previous year must be &euro;50,000 or less and the combined gross income (before tax) of a two-income household in the previous year must be &euro;75,000 or less.  Prospective applicants should contact their relevant local authority for further information.<\/p><p>The second option is the Home Choice Loan, which is available\u00a0for first-time buyers to purchase a new or second-hand property or build their own home and will be of interest to those earning above the income limits for the standard annuity loan.  The relevant terms and\u00a0conditions applying to the\u00a0Home Choice Loan are set out in the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009.  Home Choice provides a loan of up to 92% of the market value of a property purchased, subject to a maximum loan amount of &euro;285,000.  The loan is a normal capital and interest bearing mortgage which is repaid on a monthly basis.  Home Choice Loan offers one variable interest rate.  The rate is currently set at 3.25% variable, APR 3.3%.  Further information is available at<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>To support local authorities in operating their housing loan schemes in a consistent and efficient manner, the Housing Agency provides a central underwriting service to local authorities.  The final decision on loan approval is a matter for the relevant local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis and in accordance\u00a0with the relevant statutory Credit Policy that underpins the scheme\u00a0to ensure prudent lending.<\/p><p>The Credit Policy that underpins both house purchase loan schemes was introduced in 2009 and adherence to the requirements of the Credit Policy\u00a0since then has ensured that\u00a0the\u00a0risk of borrowers defaulting on mortgages has been reduced.

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition), which had been available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  <\/p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to the new State pension age.  Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  <\/p>  <p>  Reversing this measure would have a significant Exchequer cost.  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension.  However, it is anticipated that well over half of the gross cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been two Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2018 is likely to be in the region of &euro;84 million, and this is expected to increase over time.  The cost of reversing this decision would depend, therefore, on the effective date of such a measure, and also on any resultant changes in behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.<\/p>  <p>  There is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.

Customers availing of this support prior to 1st January 2014 have been able to retain entitlement to the scheme up to 1st January 2018.  There are currently approximately 1,880 people in receipt of the scheme, for which Government has provided over &euro;4 million in 2017.  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported is through on-going engagement with their lender to explore sustainable solutions.<\/p><p>It is expected that over the remaining period MIS customers will continue to exit the scheme through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders; securing employment; or exit strategies including the Mortgage to Rent Scheme.  In line with all schemes administered by my Department, any further extension of the MIS scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context. <\/p><p>I want to advise the Deputy that the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments.  As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.  <\/p><p>The role of MABS was expanded in 2015 with the establishment of a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS service (DMA MABS) across the MABS network, to help people specifically with home mortgage arrears.  There are now 32 specialist DMA advisors working across 27 locations countrywide, assisting borrowers to assess the options available to them and, where required, negotiating with lenders on their behalf.  To date, the DMA service has helped almost 3,400 such borrowers.  <\/p><p>Additionally, MABS provides a national network of court mentors who attend each listed repossession Court hearing countrywide.  The mentors provide support to distressed borrowers who are facing the loss of their home and signpost them to the appropriate services.  To date, over 1,400 borrowers have been referred onward to MABS advisors through the court mentor service.<\/p><p>In 2016, a further initiative was announced by Government, known as <i>Abhaile<\/i>.  This scheme further extends the free services already available to borrowers through the DMA MABS service and the court mentor service.  The new voucher based scheme, for which MABS is the gateway, provides access for people, who are insolvent and in home mortgage arrears, to access independent expert financial and\/or legal advice and assistance, free of charge.  To date, approximately 5,600 vouchers for services have been issued, in respect of over 3,460 principle private residences.  <\/p><p>I am continuing to monitor the supports and services which the Department has put in place to assist homeowners in serious mortgage arrears.

However, the long-term nature of the financial\u00a0commitments arising under PPPs require that the use of such arrangements must be carefully planned in order to ensure that they are used to address infrastructural needs in a manner that is sustainable in the long term and which the public finances can afford.<\/p>  <p>  It was for this reason that the Government introduced an Investment Policy Framework for PPPs in 2015.  The purpose of the framework was to set a limit on\u00a0the extent to which the annual costs of PPPs would\u00a0pre-commit\u00a0capital funding available to future Governments for\u00a0investment purposes,\u00a0in terms of\u00a0the overall aggregate Exchequer capital allocation projected to be available in any individual year.<\/p>  <p>  The framework applies to the future cost of unitary payment charges in respect of both existing PPPs already in place and new PPPs currently in procurement or planning, together with the up-front Exchequer costs associated with procuring the planned new PPPs.

A senior level group has been established, comprising\u00a0relevant officials from the Departments with experience of procuring projects by PPP, together with the Department of Finance, the National Development Finance Agency and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, to review past experience of\u00a0PPPs\u00a0and to provide an evidence based analysis of the potential for further use of PPPs\u00a0(and concessions) as a procurement\u00a0option for\u00a0the delivery of capital infrastructure.

One of the priorities that I highlighted was the need to strengthen incentives for providers to effectively respond to unmet health care needs by ramping up Activity Based Funding (ABF).<\/p>  <p>  An ABF system is currently being introduced in public acute hospitals on a phased basis.  The introduction of ABF represents a fundamental change in how healthcare is funded in Ireland.  Implementation of the funding model involves moving away from inefficient block grant budgets to a new system where hospitals are paid for the actual level of activity undertaken, subject to budgetary limits.  As such, there will be a fundamental shift from funding facilities and settings to instead funding episodes of care.  Other key benefits from the introduction of ABF include increased fairness in resource allocation, improved efficiency and increased transparency.    <\/p>  <p>  January 2016 represented a major milestone in the implementation process because the ABF system was introduced for inpatient and daycase activity in the 38 largest public hospitals.  This means that hospitals are now being incentivised to pursue the most cost-effective means of achieving their performance targets while remaining within their overall budgetary ceilings.  By operating more efficiently, hospitals will have the opportunity to maximise the delivery of activity within their overall budgetary ceilings, thereby helping to tackle waiting lists and address unmet need.  <\/p>  <p>  While the implementation of ABF is currently focused on inpatient and daycase activity, the Government is clear that journey must not end there.  Instead, it is vital that the funding model continually evolves so as to create the correct incentives for the delivery of optimal care for the Irish population while avoiding the introduction of perverse incentives.  For this reason, the ABF model will continue to evolve on a phased basis over the coming years to encompass other aspects of hospital services, such as outpatient activity, before extending into community services.  This is being done in order to incentivise the delivery of care in the most appropriate settings.  As part of the process of achieving this objective, my Department is engaging with the HSE in relation to the development of a framework for costing community care services.  <\/p>  <p>  I am also committed to using the ABF model to incentivise other health system objectives such as improving the quality of care and integration of care across different settings.  During the implementation process, my Department and the HSE will continue to learn from the experiences both of our own system and other jurisdictions in order to ensure the effective implementation of this important reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600065#WRO04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":618,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600066#WRP00200"},{"type":"question","counter":619,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[17174\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600066#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the detail of the incident which led to the death of a person (details supplied) in the psychiatric unit of Roscommon University Hospital in June 2013.","asker":"1342","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":620,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600066#WRP00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":621,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600066#WRP00500"},{"type":"question","counter":622,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[17178\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600066#WRP00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the freestyle libre sensor for measuring blood sugars will be made available on the GMS and long-term illness cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":623,"content":"<p>Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the HSE has statutory responsibility for the administration of the community drug schemes; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600066#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services Provision","counter":624,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600066#WRP00800"},{"type":"question","counter":625,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[17179\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600066#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there are dental services available in the south Roscommon area; if not, the reason there are no services available; and the expected timeframe as to when there will be a dentist appointed to the post.","asker":"1342","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":626,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600066#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":627,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600066#WRP01100"},{"type":"question","counter":628,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[17184\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600066#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an operation for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":629,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

An Interdepartmental\/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.

The Agency plays a vital role in the protection of the health of 500 million EU citizens through the scientific evaluation and safety monitoring of human and veterinary medicines.  The Government believes that Dublin would be a very suitable location for the EMA, particularly in the interests of ensuring continuity and sustainability in the conduct of its business.  Such continuity is critical for European citizens and the industries which the EMA regulates. The EMA is also key to maintaining the competitiveness of the European pharmaceutical industry, which is worth approximately &euro;260 billion annually.  The relocation of the EMA also represents an opportunity to attract a prestigious EU Agency  to Dublin which will directly employ almost 1,000 staff and attract many more high-quality jobs in associated sectors.  Its location in Dublin would also stimulate employment in ancillary sectors, including the hospitality and transport industries.<\/p>  <p>The Government has decided a whole-of-Government approach will be taken to promoting the relocation of the EMA to Dublin.   An interdepartmental\/interagency working group led by my Department is working to prepare the strongest possible bid.  In view of the complexity of this task, the inherently competitive nature of the process by which a decision on the future location for the EMA will be made and the likelihood that the European Council will consider this matter within the coming months, it was determined that external support was needed in respect of key elements of the bid preparation and communications process.  In this context my Department recently invited tenders from a number of potential providers, seeking public relations\/public affairs and communications support for the period to the end of June 2017.  The core requirement is to ensure that the Dublin bid is prepared and  presented in a professional and proactive manner which clearly sets out, to all stakeholders, why Dublin is an ideal location for the EMA.<\/p>  <p>  The request-for-tender document indicated that the expected total costs submitted for the tender would be in the range &euro;100,000 to &euro;120,000.   While a preferred bidder has been chosen, the tendering process is currently in the 14-day standstill period and no contract has yet been signed.  In these circumstances it would not be appropriate to name the preferred bidder at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600068#WRR02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":751,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600068#WRR02700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":750,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600068#WRR02600"},{"type":"question","counter":751,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[17150\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600068#WRR02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a disadvantaged area payment will be granted to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":752,"content":"<p>An application under the 2016 Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme was received from the person named on\u00a026 April 2016. <\/p><p>Processing of the ANC application has recently been finalised and payment will issue to the nominated bank account of the person named shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600068#WRR02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme Applications","counter":753,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600068#WRR02900"},{"type":"question","counter":754,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[17151\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600068#WRR03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a review in respect of the young farmers capital investment scheme for persons will be completed (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":755,"content":"<p>The applicants in this case are\u00a0members of a Registered Farm Partnership with effect from the 31 January 2017.

2016 figures are preliminary  and are subject to change.<\/p> <p>* A Tripartite Agreement (TPA) between Ireland, United Kingdom and France allows certain categories of horses, that are in compliance with documented higher health standards laid down by Bodies approved by the Member States of the TPA, (Approved TPA Bodies), to be exempted from the requirement for pre-export inspection and official certification when travelling between the three countries.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.<\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.\u00a0 <\/p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>On the 4th April, I formally published\u00a0 an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at .\u00a0 The\u00a0updated Map shows\u00a0the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:\u00a0 <\/p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,\u00a0 <\/p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. <\/p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.<\/p><p>The updated map indicates that parts of the townland of Kilbrean Beg falls within the Blue area and \u00a0will be covered by commercial operators while the remaining part of the townland will fall within the State Intervention under the NBP.\u00a0\u00a0Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE\u00a0or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at . <\/p><p>With the publication of the updated High Speed Broadband Map the State Intervention Area has now been finalised.  A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.\u00a0 The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. <\/p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand and\u00a0a prioritisation programme.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600069#WRS04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":818,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600069#WRS04100"},{"type":"question","counter":819,"qnumday":292,"qnumall":"[17189\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600069#WRS04200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the reason he is not willing to meet a group (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":820,"content":"<p>On 8 February, I met with public representatives as well as local community groups in Leinster House regarding the North South Interconnector.

Responsibility for soil, and in particular soil contamination, rests across a range of Government Departments and State Agencies depending on the particular issue.  For example, soil contamination has relevance to agriculture, biodiversity, industry, human and animal health, water quality, bogs, and the environment generally, as well as having potential impacts on climate change.Indeed, an exercise undertaken in my Department in 2016 identified some 35 strategic initiatives and binding measures that currently apply to soil quality in Ireland. <\/p><p>The issue of soil protection, including its legislative framework, is kept under review by the relevant responsible Departments and Agencies, and through various fora, particularly in the light of national, EU and international developments in the area of soil policy.  My Department, as well as other Departments and Agencies, participate in these national and international discussions.  For example, the Environmental Protection Agency is today hosting the &ldquo;End of Waste Network&rdquo; meeting in Dublin, where\u00a0 soil is amongst the items on the agenda for discussion.<\/p><p>Once\u00a0waste has been classified as hazardous, its treatment and management is subject to the Waste Management (Licensing) Regulations 2004, which govern the process under which waste licences are applied for and maintained.

However, under UNFCCC reporting rules, the specific inclusion of wetlands as a distinct land category\u00a0is\u00a0limited to organic soils not reported elsewhere within national greenhouse gas emissions inventories.

It is worth noting, however, that while the December - February 2017 figures for visits from Great Britain were down on the previous year, they were still up 14% on the same period two years earlier. \u200b\u200b In common with the rest of Government there has been deep analysis of the challenges which industry and the commercial sectors, including the tourism industry, face because of the outcome of the UK Referendum.  While it is too early to be definitive as to why there has been a reduction in visitor numbers from Great Britain, Tourism Ireland has, in the context of Brexit, highlighted the strong likelihood of a reduction in the number of\u00a0British residents expected to travel abroad on holidays, including a reduction in the number expected to travel to Ireland.  A key element of Tourism Ireland's strategy since 2014 has been market diversification.  \u00a0In 2017, Tourism Ireland will continue to implement its market diversification strategy and intends to maximise holiday revenue through investment in Mainland Europe and North America.  In addition the depreciation of sterling against the euro since the UK referendum means that value for money will be a key message for Tourism Ireland in Britain this year.  \u00a0Looking to the medium term, Tourism Ireland's\u00a0plan for the period from 2017-2019\u00a0includes the agency's response to marketing Ireland in a more focussed manner in\u00a0Great Britain in order to maximise return on marketing spend.<\/p>  <p>  I have forwarded the Deputy's question to Tourism Ireland for any further information they may be able to provide.

The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.  The Capital Plan published in September 2015 outlined proposed transport investment priorities to 2022.  The transport element of the Capital Plan did provide for some targeted investment in a number of new projects in the Munster region including the N8\/N25 Dunkettle Interchange and the N22 Ballyvourney to Macroom schemes. In addition, a number of other schemes targeted at removing bottlenecks and upgrading port access, will commence subject to necessary consents.  It was not possible to include the M20 in the Capital Plan as the scale of investment to deliver it was not affordable.  <\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of the potential regional development benefits of an upgrade of the Cork to Limerick link and the significant interest in finding a means to at least restart planning work on the route.

Over the years, Ireland has developed an important pigmeat export trade to Canada and now there is potential to develop the export business for Irish beef and lamb also.  The removal of the Canadian 26.5% import tariff will be a significant factor in achieving this aim.  This means that Irish meat producers have full tariff free access to the Canadian market.  In October 2016, Meat Industry Ireland wrote to me expressing their support for the early provisional application of CETA. <\/p>  <p>  Beef is considered as a sensitive agricultural product in EU free trade agreements where only limited concessions are granted in the form of tariff rate quotas.  Any import of beef is subject to full compliance with EU health and safety standards including the ban on hormone treated beef.  This means that only hormone-free meat can be imported into the EU.
