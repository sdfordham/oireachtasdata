The Fisheries Council will also decide on the fishing effort, which determines days spent at sea, available for the Irish fleet in the Irish Sea and off the north-west coast for 2014.<\/p><p>  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals are based on formal advice received from ICES, the independent international body with responsibility for advising on the state of fish stocks.

Approximately 130,000 farmers benefit from these schemes and these supports will continue under the next CAP, recently agreed by the Irish Presidency. Financial controls are operated by the EU Commission on the management of EU funded schemes paid out by Member States as part of the Clearance of Accounts process.  If the Commission believes the scheme does not fully adhere to EU regulations, a financial correction can be imposed. The EU Commission has been auditing schemes in operation in Ireland over a five year period and has concluded that some farmers have declared land eligible and sought payment on land that contains ineligible features such as houses, farmyards, roads, rivers, scrub etc. This has occurred under all land based schemes including REPS. Cognisance is, however, taken where lower stocking rates apply under certain agri-environmental schemes.<\/p><p>  At a meeting between the Department of Agriculture and the EU Commission in July 2013, the Commission indicated that this practice of claiming on ineligible features has to be regularised, to avoid Ireland being significantly penalised  by the Commission.  In order to avoid a significant financial correction, which would see the overall Single Farm Payment Scheme reduced for all farmers, including those fully compliant with the scheme, a review of land eligibility has been undertaken by my Department, this review will be completed within the next few weeks. <\/p><p>  As part of that review, 950,000 eligible land parcels (belonging to approximately 130,000 farmers) are being examined; ineligible features have been identified in some cases (a minority) in the context of the 2013 payment scheme. In the vast majority of cases, it does not appear that farmers have over-claimed and most farmers have applied the rules correctly. While it is not possible until the review is complete to provide final figures on over-claims by farmers, it is clear that over 90% of the farmers reviewed to date have either no reduction or a very minimal reduction. <\/p><p>  As the review progresses, letters are issuing to farmers indicating that there is a discrepancy with regard to their eligible land declared and the farmers in question are being offered a desk review (within the Department) of the decision in the first instance and an independent review if they are not satisfied with that outcome. An independent review panel is being chaired by Padraig Gibbons and will deal with appeals in an efficient and timely manner to avoid any undue delay to the processing of payments. <\/p><p>  It is important to note that while this review is underway, payments to farmers under the Single Farm Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme are on track and on a par with 2012.

Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, operational issues concerning sea fisheries control are a matter for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service. The prosecution of fisheries infringements are carried out on behalf of the State by the Director of Public Prosecutions.<\/p><p>  In October 2009, the EU adopted a new regulation dealing with fisheries controls in the EU.  Council  Regulation 1224\/2009 establishes a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy.  Control and inspection is now focused where it is most effective through an approach based on systematic risk analysis. Inspection procedures are standardised and harmonised for all stages in the market chain, including transport and marketing.    This new control regulation complements the IUU fishing regulation Council Regulation 1005\/2008 which establishes a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.  These regulations were introduced so that there is a common EU level playing field and to provide for effective range of controls across EU waters.   It applies to fishing activities in Community waters as well those carried out by Community fishing in the maritime waters under the jurisdiction or sovereignty of third countries and of the high seas. The focus of the control regulation is to create a level playing field which is necessary to give confidence to the industry so that they understand that all community vessels and third country vessels operating in EU waters  are subject to the same level of control, and that there is equality of treatment for all vessels no matter where they operate.   <\/p><p>  As part of this common approach provided for in the Control regulation,  I will shortly introduce a statutory instrument to provide for a points system which will apply to license holders of fishing vessels when a serious infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy is detected within the Exclusive Fishery Limits of the State.<\/p><p>  The accumulation of points for persistent serious infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy  will lead to the suspension of a sea fishing boat license for a period from 2 months to one year.

","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p>I am fully aware of the issues facing beef producers at present, and despite the budgetary constraints in which I and other Ministers must operate, I recently announced a package of Budget measures designed to assist in improving the long-term profitability of a vulnerable sector that is particularly reliant on direct payments.  While suckler cow numbers have remained relatively stable since payments were decoupled from production in January 2005, my Department monitors the composition and strength of the national herd on an ongoing basis.  Calf registrations are subject to cyclical fluctuations as a contracting suckler herd causes an upturn in confidence, carcass values and margins encouraging renewed investment and restocking by producers.<\/p><p>  Challenging production conditions over the last two years undoubtedly impacted on the size of the beef cow herd and this may result in a diminution in overall suckler cow numbers. The data referred to by the Deputy covers the first 9 months of the year but it will not be possible to quantify the full extent of any reduction until the publication of data on the final outturn for the year. The annual replacement rate depends on the number of heifers calving each year and this data too, along with underlying trends, will be considered by my Department after full year data becomes available. <\/p><p>  As evidence of my commitment to the future of beef production, I can point to a number of targeted structural supports that I have put in place to enable the industry to meet future market requirements and the targets set out in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. In particular, the Beef Genomics Scheme (BGS), which is specifically aimed at suckler farmers, will initiate the process of building a genetic database for the beef sector that will position Ireland as a global leader in beef genetics and ultimately lead to a more efficient and profitable farm sector. <\/p><p>  With a total fund of &euro;23 million, the BGS will provide participants with a payment of &euro;40 per calf subject to an overall scheme limit. I have already indicated that in order to be eligible for entry into the BGS, a farmer must also join the Beef Data Programme (BDP) and I expect to announce full operational details of the new scheme early in 2014.<\/p><p>  In addition to the BGS, a further &euro;10 million in funding will be disbursed under the Beef Data Programme (BDP) in 2014. The objectives of the BDP are to improve the genetic quality of the national suckler herd through the collection of essential breeding and production information and to stimulate improvements in the competitiveness and output quality of the Irish beef industry. The Programme, which attracted some 34,000 application in 2013, assists farmers to improve the quality of their livestock by maintaining crucial data flows to ICBF that in turn will generate further advances in cattle breeding at a national level. Farmers in the BDP will qualify for a further &euro;20 per calf up to a maximum of 20 calves. Taken in conjunction with the BGS, suckler farmers will receive a payment of up to &euro;60 per calf in 2014. A payment model based on calves rather than cows sends a strong signal to the sector that supports are aimed at rewarding farmer efficiency and improved technical performance.<\/p><p>  In addition to the BGS and the BDP, a further allocation of &euro;5 million has been earmarked for the continuation of the Beef Technology Adoption Programme (BTAP) in 2014. Last year, some 5,500 farmers each received an annual payment of &euro;925 in relation to their participation in the first year of the BTAP. In total, these measures, added to residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme, amount to an investment of &euro;40m in this strategically important sector in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200047#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":75,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200047#WRC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[52922\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200047#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps he has taken to deal with some recent shocking cases of animal cruelty, neglect and abandonment; and if he is satisfied that the relevant authorities have sufficient resources to ensure compliance with the new Animal Health and Welfare Bill.","asker":"1015","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>Recent issues in relation to abuses of animal welfare, particularly in the case of horses, highlight the need for intervention before animal welfare is threatened.

A full spend against Vote 27 is anticipated for 2013.  Ireland&rsquo;s ODA programme, which is known as Irish Aid, is primarily delivered, at the local level, in the form of grants to and through a number of trusted partners.  These include UN, EU and other multilateral and international organisations, governments in developing countries, Irish and international non-governmental organisations, public sector bodies and missionaries.  The aid programme is not delivered through any private sector companies based in eland.  Some specialised technical expertise or similar capacities, not available within my Department, are purchased in eland and in Partner Countries from individual experts or experts working as part of private sector companies.  This includes consultancy services such as independent audit, evaluation and project management.  It is anticipated that expenditure on the latter will amount to about &euro;365,000 in 2013.  Following an open and competitive tendering process, the Irish Embassy in Kampala recently directly engaged the services of a project management company to oversee all aspects of the construction of a number of schools in the remote Karamoja region of Uganda.

The Commissioners have confirmed that in the majority of cases deductions from Department of Social Protection payments have already commenced and over &euro;1.2m has been collected by Revenue to date.  I am also advised that in approximately 1,400 cases the instruction to deduct at source from Department of Social Protection payments, which is an automated process, was not successful for a variety of reasons, including because the wrong scheme was selected by the property owner.<\/p><p>  It is estimated that a small subset of these cases would be where the deduction of LPT from the relevant payment could not be finalised as it would have reduced the property owner&rsquo;s personal rate payment to below &euro;186 per week.  This amount is equivalent to the weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance and section 92 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) precludes the Department of Social Protection from reducing a property owner&rsquo;s personal rate payment to below this amount.  I am further advised that, where this has arisen, Revenue has already been in contact with a number of these individuals to agree alternative payment arrangements and is in the process of contacting the remainder.<\/p><p>  As to whether property owners were advised about the possible impact of the &euro;186 threshold on their LPT deductions, I am advised that the LPT information guide, which was sent to all property owners in March\/April 2013, outlined the various payment options available and specifically advised property owners that deduction of LPT from their Department of Social Protection payment cannot reduce their personal rate payment to less than &euro;186 per week.  Furthermore, the Frequently Asked Questions section on the Revenue website outlined the possible implications of choosing this payment option and advised owners that they should satisfy themselves that the weekly deductions of LPT from their Department of Social Protection payment would meet their 2013 LPT liability by the end of 2013.  Where the scheme chosen would not allow the LPT to be paid in full by the end of the year, owners were advised to choose a different payment method, or alternatively, to consider deferring the charge, where they established that they met the qualifying conditions for deferral.  I understand that this issue was also dealt with by Revenue spokespeople who took part in a large number of national and local radio interviews between March and May this year.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Commissioners that where a property owner discovers that deduction of LPT from their Department of Social Protection scheme is not possible on account of the &euro;186 threshold, they should contact the LPT Branch helpline on 1890 200 255 to make alternative arrangements for paying the 2013 tax, or to confirm if they are eligible to defer the charge.  In this respect, the Commissioners advise that where an owner-occupier&rsquo;s only source of income is their Department of Social Protection payment, they would be eligible to defer payment of the tax.  Full details on deferring payment of LPT are available on the Revenue website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200047#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tobacco Smuggling","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200047#WRC01550"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[53512\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200047#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the current legal penalties for the sale of contraband cigarettes; and if it is his intention to significantly increase those penalties in line with the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions, in view of the fact that a single large container load of contraband may cost the State up to &euro;3 million in excise revenue foregone.

The BRRD proposal provides a common framework of rules and powers to help EU countries manage arrangements to deal with failing banks at national level as well as cross-border banks, whilst preserving essential bank operations and minimising taxpayers' exposure to losses. <\/p><p>  There are three pillars to the BRRD framework to facilitate a range of appropriate actions by authorities:<\/p><p><b><i>-<\/i><\/b> Preparatory and preventative measures including reinforced supervision and robust recovery and resolution planning for major institutions;<\/p><p>- Early intervention which would include supervisory powers, implementing recovery plans and appointing a special manager; and<\/p><p>- Resolution tools including sale of business, bridge bank and asset separation tools and also the use of bail-in mechanisms.<\/p><p>  The BRRD will apply to all 28 Member States and will ensure that losses incurred by a credit institution are allocated to its shareholders and creditors in accordance with a pre-defined hierarchy of claims. This is an important means of ensuring that a bank&rsquo;s losses are absorbed by those who fund its activities and not taxpayers. <\/p><p>  The proposed directive also includes a proposal for a resolution fund. This fund can be used for operational purposes, such as the provision of capital to a bridge bank and in some cases it can be used to provide solvency support to an institution in resolution. The resolution fund would be funded by the wider banking industry and in a banking union context this will be set up at a European level, thereby increasing the amount of funding available.<\/p><p>  In relation to the events in Cyprus earlier this year, I have said before that it was an exceptional case which took place in the absence of a clearly defined resolution regime. The BRRD now addresses this and provides for a common framework for resolution for all EU Member States.

","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":114,"content":"<p>The position is as I stated in my Budget day speech, that from 16 October 2013, tax relief for medical insurance premiums has been restricted to the first &euro;1,000 per adult and the first &euro;500 per child insured.  Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings will no longer qualify for tax relief.  The current system of income tax relief for medical insurance premiums is provided at source at the standard rate of income tax. Therefore, the State was paying 20% of the cost of all medical insurance premiums.  <\/p><p>  The cost of Income Tax relief in respect of medical insurance has increased significantly in recent years, estimated at &euro;404 million in 2011, &euro;448 million in 2012 and &euro;500 million in 2013. Despite the increasing cost of the relief, the numbers insured are estimated to have reduced by approximately 170,000 over the same period, while at the same time the level of medical cover has decreased on some policies. Against this background the increase in costs is unsustainable. If the relief were to remain unchanged and the trend was to continue, the cost would increase to approximately &euro;1 billion by 2020.<\/p><p>  Currently, the tax system is supporting those who can afford private medical insurance to the level of half a billion euros per annum. Effectively that means that those taxpayers who could never afford private health insurance, or who have had to give up their policies due to personal circumstances, are providing financial support via the tax system to those individuals who can afford such insurance. <\/p><p>  It should be noted that the Commission on Taxation in its 2009 report recommended the retention of medical insurance relief but that it should be limited. The introduction of an upper ceiling on the amount of medical insurance premiums that will qualify for tax relief achieves this recommendation.  <\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that based on 2012 data, the most up to date data available, it is estimated that up to 577,000 policy holders, which provide cover for 1.1 million individuals, may be affected by this measure.  The Revenue estimate is based on an analysis carried out on the annual returns and the gross premium prices (i.e. before tax relief at source is applied) submitted by the Health Insurers in respect of the 2012 tax year. However, it should be noted that many will only be affected marginally, depending on the cost of the policies that individuals purchase.<\/p><p>  The new ceilings will ensure continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.  In addition, individuals can of course opt for less expensive policies and therefore avoid the impact of this measure entirely. <\/p><p>  I have no plans to reverse my decision to restrict tax relief in respect of medical insurance premiums. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200048#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Powers","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200048#WRD01150"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[53445\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200048#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the basis on which the Revenue Commissioners have contacted the employers of a number of non-EU nationals employed here, in some instances for up to ten years, occasionally employed by State agencies, who are meeting their statutory requirements in respect of PRSI, income tax and all of their obligations but who, due to lack of a permit or update of residency status, are now being informed by their employer, on the instructions of the Revenue Commissioners, to the effect that their employment must cease notwithstanding the fact that many such persons hold pivotal positions in the workforce, have made a contribution to society and continue to do so; the way it has been determined that their employment is illegal but that the payment of their taxes and PRSI contributions was accepted and that subsequent employers employed such persons in good faith on the basis that they had a good employment record; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  The CCMA sets out the framework that lenders must use when dealing with borrowers in mortgage arrears or in pre-arrears.  This framework is known as the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) which sets out the steps which lenders must follow:<\/p><p>Step 1: Communicate with borrower;<\/p><p>Step 2: Gather financial information;<\/p><p>Step 3: Assess the borrowers circumstances; and <\/p><p>Step 4: Propose a resolution. <\/p><p>  In order to determine which options for alternative repayment arrangements are viable for each particular case, a lender must explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements offered by that lender having assessed the borrower&rsquo;s financial circumstances (through a Standard Financial Statement).  Such alternative repayment arrangements may include:<\/p><p>- an interest-only arrangement for a period of time<\/p><p>- extending the term of the mortgage<\/p><p>- adding the arrears and interest to the mortgage, so that they are collected over the remaining term<\/p><p>- splitting the mortgage into an affordable loan and a remaining balance which is set aside to a later date <\/p><p>  While lenders must consider such arrangements, they are not obliged to offer such an arrangement.  If a borrower is offered an alternative repayment arrangement, the lender must give the borrower a clear explanation of the proposed arrangement and how it works, including the reason why the lender considers it to be appropriate for the borrower.  The lender must also provide the borrower with the advantages of the offer and explain any disadvantages. <\/p><p>  If the lender is not offering the borrower any alternative repayment arrangement, they must give the reasons why in writing.  The lender must also inform the borrower that a copy of the most recent Standard Financial Statement (SFS) is available on request, and provide the borrower with details, in writing of:<\/p><p>- other options available<\/p><p>- borrowers right to make an appeal to the lender's internal Appeals Board<\/p><p>- the website of the Insolvency Service of Ireland <\/p><p>  The same information must be given to the borrower if he\/she does not accept the alternative repayment arrangement offered to by the lender.<\/p><p>  If a borrower is not happy with the way that their lender is dealing with them or if they think they are not complying with the CCMA, the borrower can make a complaint to their lender. <\/p><p>  Borrowers can also make an appeal to the lender&rsquo;s Appeals Board if they are not happy with the alternative repayment arrangement offered or if they believe they have been wrongly classified as not co-operating. <\/p><p>  Ultimately, if the borrower is not satisfied with the outcome of the appeal\/complaint made to the lender they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO).

Among the applicants for mortgage credit, I understand that investors, who are already active and welcome in the market, do not necessarily compete for the same property types as borrowers of residential mortgages.  As I have said recently, in the context of rising rents particularly in urban areas, new mortgage products targeted at the buy to let sector may assist in stabilising the situation and alleviating problems in the rental market.  Many of the generous tax incentives that promoted activity in this area contributing to the previous difficulties are no longer available.

","asker":"1178","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":153,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 58 together.<\/p><p>  As Questions 57 and 58 both relate to the changes to the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) regime introduced in Finance (No.2) Bill 2013, I propose to reply to them together. <\/p><p>  At the outset, I want to reject the suggestion in these questions that changes being made in the Finance Bill will favour, and indeed are designed to favour, higher earning public sector employees in defined benefit pension schemes as compared to equivalent higher earning private sector employees in similar schemes. This is not the case.    <\/p><p>  As indicated in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 37 of 4 December 2013, it had come to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners that pension advisors and administrators had been interpreting the current SFT provisions in a manner that allowed the capital value of defined benefit pension arrangements with discretionary lump sum commutation rights to be calculated incorrectly at the point of retirement and not in accordance with the intention of the legislation. In light of that, one of the amendments to the SFT regime made in the Finance Bill is solely for the purposes of putting beyond doubt how the capital value of pension rights under such arrangements is to be determined. <\/p><p>  This issue has to be looked at within the broad framework of the SFT regime as a whole. In that regard, the approach to calculating the capital value of defined benefit pension rights is best understood in the context of the Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) concept. The PFT concept allows individuals with pension rights valued in excess of the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2m on 1 January 2014 to protect or &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; those rights against any risk of chargeable excess tax when the pension is eventually drawn down. <\/p><p>  The method of calculation of the PFT requires the capital value of defined benefit pension rights, where there is a discretionary lump sum commutation option (as in most private sector schemes), to be based on the annual amount of pension which the scheme would pay on 1 January 2014 (calculated in accordance with the requirements of the legislation) and before any commutation. This works to the advantage of the individual concerned as it maximises the amount of pension rights that are protected. <\/p><p>  This is best illustrated by way of a simple example. Say on 1 January 2014 a private sector defined benefit scheme, with optional commutation rights, would pay a gross pension before commutation of &euro;110,000 per annum. The capital value of those pension rights for PFT purposes is then &euro;2.2m (i.e. &euro;110k x 20).  However, if the capital value of the rights were required to be calculated on the assumption that, on 1 January 2014, the individual fully exercised his rights to commute the pension up to the maximum allowable lump sum (using the same commutation factor of 9:1 as used in the example in the details supplied) the capital value for PFT purposes would then be &euro;1.898m (i.e. a pension of &euro;82,500 x 20 + a lump sum of &euro;248,000). So the individual would not qualify for a PFT in the first place and the capital value limit of his or her pension rights at the point of retirement would then be the SFT limit of &euro;2m. <\/p><p>  Having calculated the PFT on the basis of the gross annual pension payable, it would be inconsistent, and would undermine the whole purpose of the SFT regime, to then afford the same individual the capacity to minimise the capital value of those rights at the point of retirement by permitting the calculation to be based on the capital value of the post-commutation pension added to the cash value of the lump sum. This inconsistency, if left unaddressed, would become even more pronounced now that the SFT regime is moving from a fixed conversion factor of 20:1 to a range of age&ndash;related factors which range as high as 37:1 where retirement takes place at age 50. Conceivably, &euro;1 of pension accrued before 1 January 2014 which should have a capital value of &euro;20 for chargeable excess purposes would be valued at just &euro;9, based on a 9:1 conversion factor, and equally &euro;1 of pension accrued after 1 January 2014 which should have a capital value of &euro;37 for chargeable excess purposes, would also be valued at just &euro;9 based on the same conversion factor. <\/p><p>  The fact is that the SFT regime includes different methods of calculating both a PFT and the corresponding capital value of pension rights at the point of retirement for different types of pension arrangements and different types of pension benefits. But it equally seeks to ensure that it compares like with like and that similar pension arrangements with similar pension benefits are valued in a consistent manner. To repeat what I stated in my answer to the earlier Parliamentary Question, the same approach to the calculation of the capital value of defined benefit pension entitlements with optional commutation rights at the point of retirement applies whether or not an individual has a PFT, as it would be incongruous and indeed would give rise to more concrete claims of discrimination and special treatment, if the method of calculation for schemes of a similar kind was to vary depending on whether an individual had a PFT or not.<\/p><p>  As regards, the particular hypothetical example which the Deputy included in the details supplied with Parliamentary Question No. 58, I would make the following observations. Firstly, the question itself implies that the scenario outlined in the example will arise as soon as the revised SFT regime comes into play from 1 January, but it is clear from the example that this cannot be the situation. The example is predicated on an age&ndash;related factor of 30 (applicable at age 60) applying to the whole of the annual pension benefits accrued at the point of retirement. By implication, this means that the individuals concerned would commence accruing benefits under their respective public and private sector schemes after 1 January 2014, as any rights accrued up to that date are automatically &ldquo;grandfathered&rdquo; using a factor of 20. <\/p><p>  The example implies that a highly paid individual in the private sector who is a member of a defined benefit pension arrangement with optional lump sum commutation rights and, presumably, with knowledge of the SFT regime and how it could affect him or her would, nonetheless, continue to accrue pension benefits over their career in the fashion implied, regardless, and take no remedial action. Clearly this would not happen. Any individual in this situation would act rationally and stop accruing pension benefits and negotiate alternative immediate taxable compensation with their employer instead.<\/p><p>  All the indications are that the pension funds of highly paid private sector individuals are being actively managed in this way with a view to avoiding a chargeable excess and the penal tax charges that go with it. This, of course, is how the SFT regime is intended to operate so as to restrict the capacity of higher earners to fund or accrue large pensions through tax-subsidised sources. By imposing penal tax charges on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down, it discourages the building up of large pension funds in the first place. Unlike highly paid private sector individuals who have the capacity to act to manage their pension funds with a view to avoiding a chargeable excess, the position for equivalent highly paid public servants is that the penal tax charge cannot be prevented as they have no means of ceasing to accrue benefits under their schemes in order to prevent a breach of the SFT or PFT, as appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200049#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Schemes","counter":155,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200050#WRF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":156,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[53623\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200050#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the latest developments of multiple domestic Irish Banks restarting buy to let mortgage lending including a new non-banking firm (details supplied) entering the market; if he is monitoring the extent to which these mortgages are being loaned geographically in Ireland and that there is no disproportionate concentration of lending into the rising Dublin housing market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

There has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to contribute to their pension scheme (although schemes rules can place some level of obligation).<\/p><p>  Most defined benefit pension schemes in Ireland were established under a trust deed.  As part of the process of establishing each occupational pension scheme, an employer undertakes to be bound by the rules of the scheme and to undertake certain liabilities and duties defined therein.  The position around the employers and employees contribution obligation in a trust deed varies from deed to deed.<\/p><p>  Employers have, by and large, made great efforts to support and deliver on the promise made to scheme members.  This process is generally managed through dialogue between trustees, employers and members, where efforts are made to reach agreement regarding the steps that must be taken to secure scheme viability which may include a mix of measures such as increased employer\/member contributions, longer working and amended benefits.<\/p><p>  In developing the measures contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill (No.2) 2013, significant consideration was given to imposing a statutory obligation on employers to secure a minimum level of funding before a scheme could be wound up.  The advantage of placing a minimum obligation on the employer would be to reduce further the possible risk to the State and to protect the benefits of current and former schemes members.  It may also prevent employers from &ldquo;walking away&rdquo; from defined benefit schemes and would encourage employers to ensure that the scheme is well funded and managed.<\/p><p>  However, there are strong arguments against the introduction of an employer obligation given the uncertainties as to the overall impact and potential for unintended consequences.  The introduction of employer guarantee is not a simple matter and may result increasing State involvement in sponsoring employers&rsquo; business decisions.  Whilst it may improve the security of scheme members in certain circumstances, in other situations it may not.  For example, in certain cases of liquidation, there may be few or no assets available once the claims of preferred and secured creditors have been met.<\/p><p>  Imposing an obligation on an employer may be seen as unfair on employers who have voluntarily set up DB pension schemes.  The previously voluntary commitments under these schemes would be made mandatory whereas there would be no corresponding obligation on employers who had set up DC schemes or had not set up any pension scheme.<\/p><p>  To avoid debt, there is a danger that some employers with underfunded schemes may wind up the scheme in advance of completion of legislative process which, by its nature, would be complex and take some time to put in place.  Experience in other countries has shown that complex &lsquo;anti avoidance&rsquo; structures, with the requisite resources and expertise, were required to prevent employers restructuring to avoid their obligations.<\/p><p>  Given the current economic circumstances, the imposition of significant additional costs on employers may have a counter-productive impact regarding the very viability of the business and jobs of those employed given many employers lack of capacity to absorb this extra cost.  As such an obligation on an employer may threaten the companies financial stability and in some circumstances render employers insolvent.  This may then impact on the companies creditors.<\/p><p>  Internationally, &ldquo;debt on employer&rdquo; structures are seen as a complex measure to provide for and administer.  Given the very small proportion of DB schemes here linked to employers who have a credit rating, or another reliably accurate and consistent measure of solvency, it is not the case that a workable framework to selectively apply an obligation on the employer is easily achievable.  Rather, than placing an obligation on the employer to protect member benefits, the approach in the Bill is to support schemes to gradually move to more appropriate funding levels through the short, to medium to longer term using regulation and the benefits of a strengthening economy.  This involves the Funding Standard and improved regulation with provisions such as restructuring of scheme benefits, the introduction of a risk reserve and  the availability of sovereign annuities.  The overriding priority in this area is to ensure that pensioners and members of pension schemes are protected and the future viability and sustainability of their schemes is ensured and made safer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200054#WRK00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":265,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200054#WRK00350"},{"type":"question","counter":266,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[53442\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200054#WRK00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason she is proposing to deduct from the IASS pensions of those who have worked hard and paid taxes all their lives; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":267,"content":"<p>You will appreciate that it is not appropriate for me to comment on matters relating to individual pension schemes.

The trustees of such pension schemes have a fiduciary duty under trust law and the Pensions Act to act in the best interest of all scheme members.  In addition, the Pensions Act provides for further safeguards to protect the interest of pensioners.  In the event of the wind up of a pension scheme the provision in the Pensions Act gives priority to the benefits of pensioners before any assets of the scheme are distributed to meet the liabilities of other scheme members.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill is amending this provision to provide for a more equitable distribution of scheme funds in the event of the wind up of a scheme.  This change will only impact where the scheme is underfunded.  However, pensions up to &euro;12,000 per annum will continue to retain the same level of protection as heretofore.  For higher pensions, 90% of the annual amount between &euro;12,000 and &euro;60,000, and 80% of the annual amount over &euro;60,000, will also have priority over the distribution of assets to other scheme beneficiaries.<\/p><p>  The Bill also amends the Pensions Act to extend the options available to trustees of a scheme by providing for reductions of a portion of the benefits payable to pensioners.  The restructure of scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act is not an arbitrary matter and must comply with the requirements of the Pensions Act and the criteria set out in statutory guidance.<\/p><p>  Before the trustees make an application to the Board, they must consult with the employer, the scheme member, with pensioners and with the authorised trade union representing members.

A range of measures are employed by the Department to ensure that social welfare fraud and abuse is minimised and that its control activity is appropriately focused.  The approach taken by the Department to combat fraud is frequently reviewed and is regularly adjusted to ensure it is proportionate and is targeted on the areas of greatest risk.  Actual money recovered arises where the Department raises overpayments in individual cases.  Overpayments raised by the Department are categorised as &lsquo;fraud&rsquo;, &lsquo;non-fraud&rsquo; or &lsquo;estate&rsquo; cases.  Fraud cases arise mainly on foot of false declarations by customers concerning their employment, income and family status.  Non-fraud cases are primarily due to customer or third party error, with some due to Departmental error.  Estate cases arise where undisclosed means by customers come to light after their deaths.<\/p><p>  In 2012, a total of &euro;97m was raised in overpayments and of this amount, &euro;40.9m was recorded as attributable to fraud or suspected fraud.

In addition, the Department&rsquo;s control work is measured in terms of control savings which are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities.

Control savings do not include any cases of departmental or clerical error or any cases where the customer voluntarily told the Department of their altered means or circumstances, which resulted in a change to their rate of payment.

There are currently approximately 80,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013. <\/p><p>  Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme came into effect from Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014.  The new rent limits have been determined following an extensive review of the private rental market.  The rent limits review was completed during the second quarter of this year and used a number of data sources, including that of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) which contained details of actual registered rental tenancies.  As outlined by the Deputy, the Daft.ie Q3 2013 rental report records a year on year increase of 4.4% in rents in County Wicklow.  There is no detailed breakdown of this figure by area within the county or by property type. <\/p><p>  There have been increases in the maximum rent limits in some areas including Bray, Delgany and Greystones while there have been some reductions across a number of counties, including parts of County Wicklow, reflecting the conditions in the rental markets in those areas. <\/p><p>  There are currently over 2,400 rent supplement recipients in County Wicklow.  Latest figures show that there are over 580 rent supplement recipients in the Arklow area, indicating that it is possible to secure accommodation in this location within the rent limits.  A search conducted on a leading property website shows that there are properties available for rent in the Arklow area within the maximum rent limits.  Officials in the Department continue to examine the impact of the rent limits on those who claim rent supplement.  <\/p><p>  Department officials operating the rent supplement scheme have discretionary powers to award a supplement at a higher level in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant.  Each case is examined individually and is decided on the basis of the situation presented.  In relation to the case referred to by the Deputy, the officer administering the rent supplement claim has advised that the person concerned has been requested to provide documentation in support of the request for a rent supplement above the relevant rent limit. The claim will be reviewed by the Department on receipt of this documentation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200055#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":289,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200055#WRL00550"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[53517\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200055#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of invalidity pension claims that were awarded following appeals in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and to date in 2013; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"973","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":291,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy in respect of invalidity pension appeals from 2008 to 2012 and to date in 2013 is contained in the table below.<\/p><p>  A total of 1,991 invalidity pension appeals were processed during 2012.  1,509 (61.22%) of these appeals had a successful outcome for the appellant.  474 (31.41%) of the successful appeals were in fact revised decisions made by statutorily appointed deciding officers of my Department who reviewed the claim following the initial disallowance.  <\/p><p>  These revised decisions arose as a result, in many cases, of new facts or fresh evidence produced by the claimant after the original decision on his \/her claim.

The then Government agreed to cover the full capital costs of the project, which were estimated at that time to be of the order of &euro;35m.  It was always the intention that the Ulster Canal project would be funded from the Waterways Ireland annual allocations, as agreed through the annual estimates processes in this jurisdiction, as well as the deliberations of NSMC in relation to annual budgets.  It was a key consideration throughout the process that the Ulster Canal project would be supported by a significant level of projected income from the commercialisation of certain Waterways Ireland assets.  However, the economic downturn has had a negative impact on those plans.<\/p><p>  I am continuing to explore all possible options to advance this project within the current fiscal constraints.  In this regard, I established an Inter-Agency Group on the Ulster Canal to explore ways to advance the project and to examine possible funding options for it, including existing funding streams and the leveraging of funding from other sources.

As I have indicated previously, while it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend in the near future to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed.  My firm intention is that the process will be fully inclusive and that all stakeholders, particularly farmers and their representatives will be central to the process.  It is only by adopting this approach that the desired result can be achieved.<\/p><p>  With regard to the specific recommendations of the Committee contained in their Report, I can confirm that these will be included among the range of issues to be addressed in the process that will shortly be commenced by my Department - it very clear that matters to be resolved are very wide ranging and complex; it is self-evident that the process required to adequately address these must be fully inclusive and focused.  To this end, I am determined, as indicated, to convene a broad group of all relevant stakeholders, charged with comprehensively addressing the range of issues.<\/p><p>  Commonage lands form an important part of the farming enterprises of many farmers, particularly along the West Coast.  They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism.  However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. <\/p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission.  It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC.  It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.  This matter will be further progressed when the Direct Payments Delegated Acts are adopted by the European Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200062#WRS01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy Reform","counter":513,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200063#WRT00150"},{"type":"question","counter":514,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[53562\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200063#WRT00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when he will announce the rate of Exchequer co-funding for Pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy programme 2014-2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":515,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[53581\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200063#WRT00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which rural development is likely to be facilitated in the aftermath of Common Agricultural Policy reform with particular reference to the utilisation of all funding available from the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":516,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 192 together. <\/p><p>  The European Council agreement on the Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) provides a total of &euro;2.19bn, or some &euro;313m per year, for Ireland under Pillar 2 of the CAP for the period 2014 - 2020.

I recently accompanied the Taoiseach on a trade mission to Japan, one of the highlights of which was the agreement to open the market there to Irish beef.  In November the US lifted its ban on the importation of beef from the European Union.  This was one of my priorities last year when I visited the US, where I pushed the matter strongly with the US Department of Agriculture Secretary of State, Tom Vilsackand in meetings with Senators.  My Department is now advancing the various technical requirements to ensure commencement of the trade at the earliest possible date.<\/p><p>  My Department engages on a daily basis with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassies&rsquo; personnel on market access issues. <\/p><p>  These initiatives have led to a number of notable successes in securing agreement to import from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran which allow the import of Irish beef; with Singapore, South Africa, UAE, Canada and the Russian Federation-Customs Union for the import of Irish sheep meat and with Australia and Serbia for the import of Irish pork.<\/p><p>  Whilst the UK, as the largest single destination, and Continental Europe together account for the majority of pig meat exports, there has been a continued shift in recent years towards Third Country markets for pig meat. This differs from developments in other meats, particularly beef.  Approximately one-third of Irish pig meat export volumes are destined for international markets, with China, the USA and Russia accounting for the majority of this trade.  <\/p><p>  Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across EU markets.  This wide portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia&rsquo;s differentiation and premiumisation strategy which focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmentally sustainable, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages and superior eating quality.  Among Bord Bia&rsquo;s key initiatives this year is the continued development, global promotion and marketing of its Origin Green initiative, designed to establish Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink.  Over 200 companies are currently working with Bord Bia to develop, and commit to, sustainability plans setting out clear targets in emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and corporate social responsibility activities.<\/p><p>  Last week a delegation from my Department visited China for discussions with authorities there on the lifting of the beef BSE ban which prohibits imports from any EU country. While there are a number of stages to go before Ireland secures access for beef to China, I am hopeful that these can be progressed in 2014.<\/p><p>  There is a strong demand for meat globally and my focus is to enable Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200063#WRT01400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Disease Controls","counter":531,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200063#WRT01450"},{"type":"question","counter":532,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[53577\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200063#WRT01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which veterinary or laboratory facilities anticipated at Backweston, Celbridge, County Kildare have been put in place to date; the degree to which this provides adequate facilities sufficient to meet requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":533,"content":"<p>The laboratory facilities at Backweston are capable of meeting the vast majority of my Department&rsquo;s analytical and diagnostic requirements.

The derogation was introduced to allow a five-year period within which vehicles operating at heights in excess of the new limits could be withdrawn from use in Ireland in an orderly and planned manner, or to allow for the necessary height reductions by operators and would minimise the economic costs of the change. This derogation expired on 31st October 2013.<\/p><p>  Given the lead-in time that this height limit has had, extending the derogation would have the effect of penalising those operators who have adjusted their fleet to ensure compliance with this well flagged law, while rewarding those that did not. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200064#WRU00400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":544,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200064#WRU00450"},{"type":"question","counter":545,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[53583\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121200064#WRU00500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which pig and poultry producers have been able to upgrade their accommodation in line with animal welfare regulations; if any specific issues remain outstanding in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":546,"content":"<p>The new EU animal welfare rules for the pig sector came into force on 1 January 2013.

These import requirements are generic and applicable for all countries authorised to export to the EU. The legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements, designed to ensure that imported products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between Member States. Products must have originated in an area where there are no restrictions imposed under EU Safeguard measures and come from establishments which are under the supervision and control of the competent authorities. The products must be free from residues and contaminants, correctly labelled and travel with the specific health certificates or other documents conforming to the models laid down in EU legislation drawn up in conformity with the relevant model for the product, completed and signed on behalf of the competent authorities of the country of export. The EU's Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) carries out assessments of third countries wishing to export these products to the EU and submits for Commission approval those where the responsible authorities can provide appropriate guarantees as regards compliance or equivalence with Community feed and food law and animal health rules. Third countries and their establishments that are approved to export are audited and inspected by the FVO with regard to these guarantees and reports of the findings of inspections are published on its website.<\/p><p>  Import controls on products of animal origin arriving from third countries must be performed at an EU Border Inspection Post approved for that category of product being presented. Consignments for import requiring veterinary checks must be notified in advance to the Border Inspection Post of import and presented on arrival for checks with all the appropriate documentation. Border Inspection Posts in Ireland are operated by my Department. The import controls procedures on products of animal origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the FVO to ensure compliance. Again, reports of the findings of inspections are published on the FVO&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>  In summary, the import of all products including poultry<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>  from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by EU Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office, to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.

The ABC programme is co-funded by The Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation over 2013-2016 of &euro;29.7m.<\/p><p>  In March of this year, applications were invited from area-based not-for-profit organisations, which were either part of a pre-existing consortium or were prepared to form one for the purpose of the new programme.  In each case, the consortium had to be led by an organisation with a proven track record of working with statutory and non-statutory service providers and local community groups.  The scoring criteria identified in the application process were evidence of need; quality of the proposal; additionality and sustainability; and understanding and capturing outcomes.  The closing date for receipt of applications was 31st May 2013.     <\/p><p>  Fifty applications to participate in the new programme were received and evaluated against the programme criteria.  The evaluation process was undertaken by a Working Group of the Inter-departmental Project Team which was set up in February of this year to oversee the implementation of the programme.

A further application was recommended for entry to the design stage of the programme, on the basis that it will form part of one of the three projects which were previously in the PEIP.  The recommendations of the Project Team were noted by Government on 25th November 2013.<\/p><p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that an application was received from Galway Early Education, under the lead organisation Galway City Partnership, but that this application is not included in the areas which have been invited to proceed to the next stage.
