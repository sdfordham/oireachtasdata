We had representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine here and they talked about the current leases.  Mr. Gillen said there were many vacant properties in Howth and that the Department was doing nothing about them because there was no incentive to lease them.  He has been seeking to lease one of them but has been unable to do so for unspecified reasons.  Much of the business is going to Kilkeel, County Down.  I do not suggest we immediately accept his invitation to all pile out to Howth in a bus to see what is going on, for which I suspect there would not be much of an appetite.  However, perhaps we might write to the Department to ask which properties are vacant, what is happening, why they are vacant and what approach is being made in order to receive an update and a full account of the issue.

For example, in the case of John Shine, we were told the State was taking legal action against him.  This legal action happened only a number of months after the meeting of the committee and Mr. Shine has a case.  It is about property, leases and the management of buildings.  In this case, the person was interested in a property which has not materialised, although it is vacant.  We have to produce a report on the hearing we had with the Department, which included some of the worst cases.  In the light of the hearing, this man has a point.  I differ from Deputy Shane Ross.

The expenditure was incurred under four programme headings, as indicated in the figure on screen.  As members of the committee can see, the arts, culture and film programme accounted for almost 50% of the total expenditure of &euro;125 million.  The other programmes are heritage, which had a total of &euro;8.1 million; Irish language, Gaeltacht and islands, &euro;41.8 million; and North-South co-operation, &euro;40.2 million.<\/p> <p>  Much of the programme expenditure in the Vote is in the form of grant payments to a wide variety of statutory bodies and agencies in the culture, heritage and language sectors.  The Department&rsquo;s functions in relation to those bodies include policy development, legislation, expenditure sanction and general oversight.  The range of bodies includes intermediate grant allocation bodies, such as the Arts Council, the Irish Film Board, An Foras Teanga and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, and bodies and agencies carrying out specific statutory functions, such as the National Library, National Museum, Irish Museum of Modern Art and Waterways Ireland.  The Department also pays some grants directly to certain other public bodies not under its direct aegis, including local authorities, and to community and voluntary and some private sector bodies in the cultural, heritage and Irish language sectors.<\/p> <p>  Figure 2 presents an overview of the main bodies within the Department&rsquo;s funding remit and an indication of the Department&rsquo;s relationship with those bodies.  The level of grant funding the bodies received from the Vote in 2013 is also shown.  A variety of accounting and governance arrangements are in place in respect of the bodies.  As members of the committee can see, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the National Archives are both part of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The range of bodies includes the Arts Council, Heritage Council, An Foras Teanga, and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. All of those are grant-paying public bodies.  The other bodies include the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Crawford Gallery, the National Museum and the National Library.  The National Concert Hall and the Chester Beatty Library are bodies which receive substantial funding but they are not audited by me.  The rest of those bodies indicated are audited by me.  As I have mentioned, the National Archives and the National Parks and Wildlife Service are divisions of the Department itself, and expenditure by those bodies is accounted for in the Vote appropriation account, rather than in separate annual financial statements.<\/p> <p>  As I have also mentioned, most of the bodies directly grant funded by the Department are audited by me, and their financial statements are therefore subject to review by this committee.  I should also point out that An Foras Teanga and Waterways Ireland are North-South bodies.  Under the 1998 British-Irish Agreement, they are audited jointly by me and by my counterpart in Northern Ireland.  As a consequence, those bodies are accountable both to this committee and to the Public Accounts Committee in the Northern Ireland Assembly.<\/p> <p>  The committee is also considering chapter 9 of the report on the accounts of the public services for 2013, which concerns accounting for National Gallery of Ireland expenditure.  While the gallery is formally under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, in the past it was not grant funded by the Department.  Instead, it had its own Vote Estimate up to and including 2014.  Financial accounting provisions in respect of the gallery are also set out in the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997.  As a result, the gallery is required each year to produce both a cash-based appropriation account and accrual-based financial statements.  Both have to be audited and presented separately to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Considering the scale of operation of the gallery, which had a turnover of the order of &euro;8 million in 2013, this seems a disproportionate reporting requirement.<\/p> <p>  The gallery has sources of non-voted expenditure from activities such as retail shops, a restaurant, donations and benefactions, fund-raising, exhibitions and sponsorship.  Over the three years 2011 to 2013, this funding amounted to an average of 17% of the annual net Exchequer grant.  These receipts are not recognised in the gallery&rsquo;s appropriation account but are included in the accrual financial statements.  As a result, the latter give a more complete view of the operations of the gallery and of its financial position.  In addition, the gallery has been using some of its non-voted income, with the approval of the board, for the purposes of charging some operating costs that would normally be funded from the appropriation account.  The total of costs charged to own resources was &euro;298,000 in 2013 and &euro;156,500 in 2012.<\/p> <p>  I concluded that this use of, and accounting for, non-voted income effectively bypasses the spending limit control which is a core objective of the annual Estimates process, and the gross accounting principle required under public financial procedures.  I recommended that consideration should be given to including all resources of the gallery within the appropriations process.  Alternatively, consideration should be given to treating the gallery, like other national cultural institutions, as a grant subhead within the Estimate for the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, with timely financial reporting on a comprehensive basis.  The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht agreed that in the interest of transparency, Exchequer funding for the National Gallery should in future be provided through a subhead of the Vote for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  As a result, the National Gallery Vote ceased to operate on 31 December 2014, and the dual financial reporting requirement will cease once the 2014 accounts are presented.<\/p> <p>  The National Library of Ireland is another autonomous national cultural institution under the provisions of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997.  Certification of the library&rsquo;s financial statements in respect of 2012 was delayed due to the discovery by the library in August 2013 of the theft of a significant quantity of material from its collections.  The board of the library has made a disclosure in the statement of internal financial control in relation to the investigation of the theft and the action taken by the library to prevent a similar occurrence in the future.  Given the significance of the loss and the circumstances involved, I drew attention to the disclosure in my audit certificate.  The financial statements of the library in relation to 2013 were certified by me on 23 December 2014.  Those financial statements have not yet been presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and therefore my observations are limited to the 2012 financial statements.<\/p> <p>  The National Library receives almost all of its funding by way of an Oireachtas grant.  The amount received by way of Oireachtas grants has decreased each year and the amount received in 2012, which totalled &euro;7.1 million, represented a decrease of about one third when compared with 2009.<\/p><p>The library cut its costs over the period 20009 to 2012 but had not succeeded in reaching a break-even or a surplus position by 2012, when it recorded an overall deficit of &euro;484,000.  The library has significantly reduced expenditure on acquiring collections, the digital library and education and outreach services.  <\/p><p> The audit certificate attached to 2012 financial statements also drew attention to the appointment by the library of interns and students on short-term contracts during 2011 and 2012.

It essentially brought together the arts functions of the then Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and the heritage functions of then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Irish language, Gaeltacht and islands functions of the former Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs.<\/p> <p>  In establishing this new Department, a strong focus was maintained on ensuring an effective system of internal financial control with an appropriate framework of administrative procedures, management reporting and internal audit.  At present, the Department has 560 staff located in its main offices in Dublin, Killarney, Wexford and Na Forbacha in Galway as well as at a number of smaller regional locations around the country.<\/p> <p>  It oversees and has policy responsibility for the conservation, preservation, protection, development and presentation of Ireland's rich heritage and culture.  It also supports a promotion of the Irish language, the development of the Gaeltacht and the sustainable development of island communities.<\/p> <p>  In addition to promoting the inherent importance of our language, culture and heritage, the Department is also conscious of their value as a resource for business and tourism as well as a means for supporting economic renewal and presenting Ireland as an attractive destination for sustainable inward investment.<\/p> <p>  The briefing note provided to the committee outlines the financial allocations across the four programme areas of the Department - arts and culture; natural and built heritage; the Irish language, Gaeltacht and the islands; and North-South co-operation.  The note also sets out some key aspects of the Department's achievements in 2013, priorities of our work programme for 2015 and some of the main challenges facing the Department at this time.<\/p> <p>  Much of the Department's work is delivered through a range of intermediary bodies, including statutory bodies and agencies funded from the Vote.  The briefing note outlines arrangements in place to oversee and monitor the delivery by those bodies of their services and business targets.<\/p> <p>  A key challenge facing the Department, common with most other public bodies, has been the pressure on resources, both human and financial, in recent years.  In overall terms, the Department has seen funding across its programme areas reduced by 50% since 2008.  That said, 2015 is the first year since then in which reductions were not imposed on current funding and, indeed, there has been some increase in the allocations to the Arts Council, the national cultural institutions and for commemorations.  Clearly, this is a welcome development.<\/p> <p>  In regard to legislation, the Department's A list has two Bills - the National Concert Hall Bill and the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill, both of which have been the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny and are expected to be published in the coming weeks.  Proposals in the Government's public service reform programme have resulted in the heads for two national cultural institutions Bills also being submitted for pre-legislative scrutiny.  One relates to the National Gallery, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Crawford Gallery, Cork, while the other relates to the National Museum, the National Library and the National Archives.  Work is being advanced on a new national monuments Bill and heads have been approved for a Heritage Council (amendment) Bill.  Further proposals to amend the National Archives legislation are also under consideration at this time.<\/p> <p>  Before concluding, I might briefly refer to chapter 9 of the 2013 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding accounting for certain National Gallery of Ireland expenditure.  In line with the recommendation in that chapter, the National Gallery has now been brought within the ambit of the Vote of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on the same basis as the other national cultural institutions.  I can confirm that I assumed the role of Accounting Officer in relation to the gallery with effect from 1 January 2015.  I will, of course, be happy to expand on these areas as the committee wishes.

As well as its Exchequer Vote, the National Gallery of Ireland generates income from a variety of activities, including retail, donations, benefactions and sponsorships.  Under its enabling legislation, the board of governors and guardians may allocate its own resources at its discretion in the gallery's best interests.  The situation has obtained for many years.  In recent years, the gallery's Exchequer Vote has been severely cut.  Calls on the gallery's own resources have, therefore, increased in order to enable the gallery to offer the public service the board and the executive believe essential to fulfilling the mission of the gallery.<\/p> <p>  As a result, the board of governors and guardians believe it was in the best interests of the gallery and its visitors to utilise the gallery's own resources to make up some of the shortfall in its Exchequer Vote allocation.  They did this in order to maintain the high standard of public service commensurate with the gallery's reputation and strategic objectives.  The case for maintaining the excellence of the gallery's service to the public during a period of partial closure was made all the more compelling because of the disruption to normal operations caused by the extensive phased refurbishment works.  <\/p> <p>  Operating costs previously funded in full or in part from the gallery's Exchequer Vote were defrayed by own resources in the amount of &euro;298,000 in 2013.  This financing from own resources continued in 2014 and is expected to amount to &euro;499,000 in 2015.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General raised concerns about this.  As a consequence, the gallery's separate Vote allocation was terminated from 2015 onwards and was replaced by an Exchequer grant allocated as a subhead of our parent Department's Vote, as we have heard.  <\/p> <p>  This change represents a dramatic loss of profile for the gallery.  However, after careful consideration, the board and its executive believe that as long as the gallery continues to generate and utilise its own resources at the board's discretion and the perception of independence from central government is maintained, this change will not adversely affect its ambitious plans.<\/p> <p>  The National Gallery is in the middle of a period of major capital investment in gallery infrastructure, funded by a combination of Exchequer sources and a substantial contribution from the gallery's own resources.  The gallery has welcomed a commitment from its public funding partners that its expectation to continue to generate and for the board to allocate its own resources in support of services to the public will be fulfilled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012900002#F01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Rainbird"},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Rainbird.

Most people are familiar with their local libraries and libraries in the higher education sector.  The National Library differs from these in that its statutory remit is to collect and preserve Ireland's documentary heritage for the benefit of the public.  For that reason, it does not lend items and it seeks to keep whatever it acquires in perpetuity.<\/p> <p>  It was founded in 1877 and collects and makes available the shared memory of the Irish nation at home and abroad, caring for more than 10 million items, including books, newspapers, manuscripts, prints, drawings, ephemera, photographs and, increasingly, digital media.  Its holdings range from 14th century Gaelic manuscripts to 21st century websites, from the papers of Yeats and Joyce to the writings of historic and contemporary political figures.  It is also the guardian of personal histories in the form of archives of letters, photographs and diaries and family and local history sources, such as estate papers and parish registers. The office of the Chief Herald and the National Photographic Archive in Temple Bar are also part of the National Library. <\/p> <p>  The library today is faced with the challenge of collecting and preserving not only traditional print and manuscript media but also digital media.  It must fulfil its duty to the public, which owns and pays for it, and contribute to the cultural and economic life of the nation by making its collections as accessible as possible in its reading rooms and exhibitions and also online.<\/p><p>It must fulfil its duty to the public which owns and pays for it and contribute to the cultural and economic life of the nation by making its collections as accessible as possible in its reading rooms and exhibitions, and also online.  In this time of transition between paper and digital, it must continue to collect and evolve to meet the needs of new generations.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the issues of concern highlighted in the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General in our 2012 and 2013 accounts.  In August 2013, library staff discovered the loss of certain items from the collections and reported the matter immediately to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the library board, and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Detectives from the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation subsequently recovered a significant number of items believed to have been stolen.  In November 2013, the media reported the arrest of a library employee in connection with the theft of material.  The matter is still under investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are not in a position, therefore, to provide any further information lest it prejudice the investigation.<\/p><p> Following the discovery, the library took immediate steps to enhance security.  For obvious security reasons, it would be ill-advised for us to disclose publicly specific details of these steps.  However, I am happy to provide any members of the Committee of Public Accounts with a tour and overview of the library&rsquo;s storage areas.  The library requested both the Garda crime prevention unit and two internationally recognised library security experts to conduct security reviews.  The library&rsquo;s board and management have reviewed the resulting reports, and submitted these to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Office of Public Works.<\/p><p> In regard to the studentships, in 2010 it was decided to run a special studentship programme to be paid from the annual grant.  This built on the success of an existing studentship programme dating from 1998 and financed from own resources.  The library did not believe that discrete sanction was required from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the studentships awarded under the programme in 2011-12.  The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht advised the library in September 2010 that as the studentship programme did not constitute recruitment, promotion or an acting appointment to a management or administrative grade or to any other grade within the public sector, and as the programme for Government included a commitment to promote internships, the programme could not be opposed.<\/p><p> The studentships ran through 2011 to 2012 and provided professional developmental opportunities in catalogue and software development, digital collections, reference services, manuscripts, outreach and marketing.  Seven studentships, at &euro;17,100 per annum, were advertised in each of 2010 and 2011 and one in 2012.  Some 310 applications were received in all, and 15 studentships awarded, with periods of service varying from three to 17 months.  The aim of the studentship programme was to resource additional library projects that did not fall within normal job descriptions and to provide excellent career enhancement experience for the studentship holders, all of whom, we understand, went on to secure employment.  The cost of the special studentships programme in 2012 was &euro;113,662, which represents excellent value for the public funding allocated to it by the library.  All studentships and internships have had approval by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht since 1 January 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012900002#F01700","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Fahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Fahy.

That emerged from the fact that there had been a long-standing air service to the three Aran Islands for some years, which had been developed by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as part of its services in the Gaeltacht.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012900002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Hamill"},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Was that already in place before 2001?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012900002#H00400","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422525600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012900002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Hamill"},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Could Mr. Hamill give more information on that?

At the time, Aer Arann was set up specifically for that purpose.  It provided services both to islanders and to tourists and business.  That essentially continues to today.  The flights now fly from Inverin where a dedicated airstrip is located.  Part of the thinking at the time was the development of such an approach.  The study also considered Cleggan and Inishbofin.  There was already a private airstrip in Cleggan which was used by private businesses.  Coming out of the study the idea developed that there would potentially be a service between the mainland and Inishbofin.  At the same time there was a proposal to put an airstrip on Tory Island.  In a sense there was a general planned look at that stage around what might be possible on some of the main islands, mainly in terms of better access and also potentially for tourism purposes.  Essentially, the plan went ahead at that time and two airstrips were constructed, one on Inishbofin and one in Cleggan, at a significant cost of upwards of &euro;9 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012900002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Hamill"},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Was that for the construction of both?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012900002#H00800","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422525600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012900002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Hamill"},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Was there public procurement for the contract?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012900002#H01000","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422525600,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Yes.

Some 53 raised bogs were designated over that period.  In January 2011, the European Commission issued a letter of formal notice to the effect that in its view Ireland had failed to meet its obligations under EU law to protect these SACs and raised bog NHAs in terms of the regulation of turf cutting.  The notice was fairly strongly worded.  This was followed up with a reasoned opinion from the Advocate General, essentially threatening to take interim measures against Ireland if we did not act quickly on the matter.  That reasoned opinion was issued in June 2011, at which time it seemed there was a real danger that Ireland would be injuncted, brought before the European Court of Justice, and subjected to fines and, possibly, daily fines.<\/p> <p>  The Government at the time took the view that strong action was needed.  Part of this action was to put in place a compensation scheme for people who were cutting turf on these raised bogs-special areas of conversation.  A turf cutting compensation scheme, essentially offering compensation over 15 years, was put in place.  The payments per annum are &euro;1,500 subject to a consumer price index review each year.  Up to end 2014, we had made approximately 6,400 payments under that scheme, some of which were multiple payments in respect of years 1, 2 and 3.  Overall, approximately 2,000 cutters have signed up to the scheme.  An incentive payment of &euro;500 was also provided to those people who signed a legal agreement with the Minister.  At end 2014, 1,882 legal agreements had been issued, of which 1,408 have since been returned.  We have paid the incentive payment to 1,310 people.

I fully accept that.  I can probably only go back to what I said earlier in that when the idea was developed it was done so very much as part of a strategy at the time to develop transport infrastructure for the islands.  It was put into the national development plan around 2003 and the strategy was to undertake major developments of island infrastructure.  It was developed in that context.  It was a very different time.  The allocation to the islands in one year then was around &euro;40 million.  As I mentioned earlier, it is about &euro;600,000 now.<\/p> <p>  I have to say there was a change in the circumstances at that time.  I will give an example, although it is a bit of an extreme example.  The passenger traffic to the largest of the Aran Islands - the Deputy is probably aware of this - exceeds 250,000 passengers every year, the number that make that short trip.  The Department worked at the time with F&aacute;ilte Ireland around the idea of promoting the islands as a destination.  We were involved in developing web-based information around promoting islands as special places and part of the strategy around that was to build up the methods of access.  It was part of a wider story.  Around that time we developed the sea transport access routes to quite a large number of non-Gaeltacht islands that had not had them previously, and many of those are still there.  We have about 22 sea-based services to islands.  The only air-based services that are there are the ones that were there from the beginning, which are those to the Aran Islands.  I would put it in that broader context.  A lot of investment was being put into island infrastructure at the time.  This was part of it.  Without jumping the gun on procurement or anything else like that, there was a possibility that the Aran Islands services might have been expanded in some way to include that Clifden-Inisbofin leg of the route.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012900002#L02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Hamill"},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":267,"content":"<p>It is not that I do not recognise how beautiful the islands are and that we should promote them and invest in them but it seems that just because the money was there it had to be spent.

The issue of the turf compensation scheme was previously covered by Deputy Costello.  Unfortunately, I am only two well aware of the concerns about this issue.  Counties Galway and Roscommon had many of these designations.  I come from an area where my father cut turf in a bog that has now been designated.  I am well aware of the frustration and anger that there is over this scheme.  I am also aware of what the Department is attempting to do to resolve what is a very difficult situation.<\/p> <p>  This issue dates back to 1997.  When this scheme was introduced, I was 15 years old and I thought it was the best news I heard in that I would never have to go aback to the bog again.  However, on becoming a public representative, I quickly changed my mind.  This is a problem that will not go away.  I wish to concentrate on one area.  The Department covers special areas of conservation, SACs, natural heritage areas, NHAs, and special protection areas, SPAs nationwide.<\/p><p>There are so many designations now one would get confused.  They all come at a cost in aiming to compensate people.  Under the turf compensation scheme &euro;18 million has been set aside.  What about other areas such as hen harrier designated areas?  We are getting to a stage where many of these programmes will be coming to an end and those affected feel they should be continued.  How does the Department think we will sort out these myriad issues over the next five to ten years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012900002#L03500","speaker":"1041","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422525600,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Deputy has been very involved in the bogs issue, with which he and I are familiar.  Some of the areas have shown the way forward, where communities have come together with the right type of leadership and have found a way of relocating.  We hold them up as a model to other areas.  The Deputy is absolutely correct on the wider issue.  In recent years a number of National Parks and Wildlife Service plans have developed in various ways in response to various situations, often where there has been a threat of legal action from the EU because we are not dealing with a particular species, such as the hen harrier.  In such a case, the Department has no option but to comply with the requirements of the habitat or birds directives.  It must designate areas with consequent difficulties for people farming in them.<\/p> <p>  The hen harrier is a good example, where over a period the Department put in place an incentive scheme for farmers willing to work in a particular way to encourage the hen harrier rather than deter it.  The Department paid over moneys.  This became too expensive and at a certain point the Department had to close the scheme.  We are now running it down.  In overall terms we spent approximately &euro;13 million on the scheme.  It was very expensive.  As the Deputy probably knows, we have had other schemes with varying degrees of success, a recent successful scheme being the corncrake scheme.  We have also had schemes for waders and geese, in Wexford in particular.  We have a range of such plans.  At present our position is that most of them are coming to an end.<\/p> <p>  The view from Europe is very much along the lines that the Natura framework exists in all of the member states and as such they have legal obligations.  There is a co-funding mechanism with Europe to find ways to compensate farmers or help them do certain things in different places.  Much of our discussion in the recent past has been with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the rural development plan, in particular the GLAS and GLAS plus programmes, under which farmers in designated areas will be required to farm in an environmentally-friendly way - there is other terminology to describe it - and they will be compensated appropriately through the programme.  From our perspective we see our future interventions more as asking people to do a particular thing which has a cost.  A good example is the Wexford Slobs, where farmers were asked to plant fields and not cut them so the geese could come and eat the crop.  We see more measures being part of a broader co-financed package rather than falling 100% on the Exchequer.  This is the broad situation as I see it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012900002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Hamill"},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I understand this, but a concern for many landowners throughout the country who are affected is that the designation means their land has been rendered valueless.  People want to use their land as collateral but the banks refuse because they know the owners cannot do anything with the land and it is not worth anything to them.  It cannot be farmed and it cannot be sold because of the designation.  The Department has always attempted to compensate, but it is running out of funding because there are so many designation programmes.  What is Europe's role?  From an environmental perspective, one will not find people more willing to protect their environment than landowners.  In many cases, particularly with regard to the younger farming community, it is a very bitter pill to be told by the Department to protect an area but to be told also that it cannot afford to pay them any more compensation.  I am trying to understand the connection between the Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Europe when it comes to solving this.  All of these designations arrive at one go.  In certain parts of the country one might be caught with three or four of them.  I know this is a hard question to answer, but what does the future hold?  All of these problems are cropping up now and they will not go away.  Could Europe be doing more from a funding perspective?

There has been a very good LIFE programme in the Burren for a number of years.  We have launched two more LIFE programmes, one on the Aran Islands in the past 18 months and another in Kerry which has just begun.  We are looking at others.  These are very much geared towards local farmers coming on board and working with people in the community.  It is fair to say the Burren programme started in a suspicious context when farmers were not too sure about it.  I was there recently when it received a European award and there was a great sense of co-operation and positive engagement.  The number of farmers who wanted to join the programme on the Aran Islands exceeded the number which could do so.  These programmes are small at this stage, but their approach is successful.<\/p> <p>  What we have always tried to say, which perhaps has not always been appreciated, is that in many cases farmers create or maintain these habitats.  It is not the case that we do not acknowledge this.  The difficulty is trying to balance the various interests.  It has been said at different times that we have been too focused on science and not enough on social implications.  The problem is this is what the directives require us to do, to assess the science and put in place systems which people can appeal.  The appeals board has heard appeals in recent months and upheld some of them.  Such processes are in place.<\/p> <p>  The bogs controversy certainly brought it home to me that the biggest deficit in all of this was that people felt they were not being listened to and did not have enough chances to say their piece.  This is certainly something we have been discussing.  We have been looking at how we operate and how we engage with communities.  With regard to the hen harrier, we are trying to establish a system with a good consultative committee which will feed into a response threat plan which will, hopefully, help to give us a bit of flexibility.<\/p> <p>  I do not question the legitimacy of any of this, but it is very much a balancing act in Europe between the Commission, legal obligations, farmers, the regulatory authorities and the NGOs, and it is about trying to get it all to work in a reasonable way.  I acknowledge that at times it is very difficult in individual cases and sometimes there may not be many options.  Coming back to the bogs, we are trying to find a national approach whereby we can tell the Commission we are protecting areas but that it will not work in some places and that we would like to dedesignate a small number and compensate in another way.  To do this we must have a national approach and we do not have this over the line, with some of the interest groups not quite engaging on it in recent times.  This is how we are trying to move it forward.

Part of the thinking on this is to have a closer focus by Government on the different issues and their co-ordination.  One of the things which has been greatly emphasised, and my Minister has been strong on this, is the need for this to be inclusive, historically accurate and respectful.

It seems to be irrelevant to some of them.  There is a dearth with regard to the people who died in 1916.  All one has to do is go around Dublin.  There is a monument which does not even name the Volunteers at Upper Mount Street bridge which is where the biggest battle took place.  It mentions the Volunteers and no one else.

I am just giving a viewpoint.  I started a committee in Waterford and we put together the First World War memorial which is located in Dungarvan.  We had one rule: no politics.  When it was unveiled, people from every political party came to the unveiling.  When asked questions which were politically inclined, we made it clear that we were not going to get involved in it and that people could make their own interpretations on the First World War, who was right and who was wrong with regard to who served.  There is a danger here and I see it beginning already.  Politicians and ex-politicians are giving their interpretations.

It relates to the translation of documents.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been involved to a degree on this issue through its Secretary General.  My concern was that we were wasting money which I believed should have been put into Irish language promotion.  The money was being spent on the publication of all documents in Irish.  There is an example I always use.  The stream of funding for secondary school children who wish to take the leaving certificate through Irish ends after second year.  It was pointed out to me that this was ridiculous.  The Government is printing all of these documents when the money should be put into children's education if they wish to do the leaving certificate through Irish.  As it is a good example, I raised the issue.  Is something being done in the Bill about the translation of documents?

As the Chairman pointed out, I am accompanied today by my colleagues, Mr. Brian Higgisson, assistant chief executive, and Mr. Pat Griffin, senior inspector.  We have prepared a submission which I do not propose to go through in detail but rather will give a quick overview of some of the main elements within it.  We are very happy to deal with questions on any aspects of that detail.<\/p> <p>  To provide some context, I note that the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, was established in 1989 under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989.  Ours is the primary organisation charged with advancing workplace safety in Ireland and we have an extremely broad remit extending to environmental matters, market surveillance, machinery and all sectors of the economy.  On the dissolution of Forf&aacute;s in August 2014 with the integration of some of its functions into the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Irish National Accreditation Board was integrated with the HSA.  The scope of our role is that we have workplace safety and health responsibility for the 1.93 million people in employment but also through the environmental dimension of our work for the 4.6 million people in the State.  I have set out in the written submission some of the areas our remit covers.  In essence, it is all sectors of the economy and all areas of activity ranging from the self-employed through to the 1,000 employee-plus multinational corporations.<\/p> <p>  Like every other State organisation during recent years, the HSA has had resource reductions of the order of 24% in staffing and 26% in budget.  That appears to be stabilised in 2015, which is a positive note.  Notwithstanding the overall diminution in resources, we have increased and maintained the level of resource allocation for agriculture safety.  Currently, in excess of 20% of our total resource is allocated to improving farming safety and health for a workforce representing approximately 6% of employment nationally.  Resources are allocated on the basis of a legal mandate, which means there are certain tasks and activities which we are legally mandated to carry out and in respect of which we have absolutely no discretion.  These include Seveso control of major accident hazards as well as risk profiling by sector and risk profiling by industry with subdivisions within that.  We also look at the impact an intervention may have and try to achieve the greatest impact with our resources.<\/p> <p>  Our policy is to change culture.  We try to create culture change in all sectors of the economy.  I point members to page 6 of our submission on which there is a graph showing that the efforts of the authority and other players have been very successful since our establishment.  Ireland has gone from having approximately six deaths per 100,000 in employment down to a current figure in the region of 2.1 deaths.  Overall, we have seen a very positive reduction in fatalities.  This reduction in fatalities has been accompanied by a comparable reduction in the level of accident reporting and the economic impacts.  However, I now turn to the agriculture sector.<\/p> <p>  In marked contrast to the story we can relay in relation to the economy in general, the situation in agriculture is not positive.  It has not been possible so far to achieve the level of sustained improvement we strive for.  While there have been improvements, they have not been sustained.  In 2014, 30 fatalities out of the 55 reported were in agriculture.  In the ten-year period 2005 to 2010, there were 193 farm fatalities which was an average of approximately 19 per year.  That gives a rate of 16 fatalities per 100,000 workers in the farming sector.  The rate for 2013 was 59.9 compared with 2.9 across the general working population.  This means that a person working in agriculture is approximately eight times more likely to be killed in a workplace accident than a person working in the economy generally.<\/p> <p>  While Ireland has made very significant progress when one looks at the European comparators, we take the view that one death is too many.  Based on the investigations of inspectors of these fatalities, inspections on farms and of serious accidents, the vast majority of fatal accidents can be characterised as foreseeable and preventable.  We reiterate that primary responsibility resides with the legal duty holder, in this case the farmer, and we work to support them in that.<\/p><p>Progress has been made in other sectors through achieving a culture change and helping people to understand the right behaviours through the level of awareness.  Our approach is to bring about a culture change and this is what will deliver a sustained improvement in farm safety standards.  <br\/><br\/>Bringing about change cannot be achieved by one entity alone.  Therefore, our approach has been to work collaboratively.  We have bilateral working arrangements with Teagasc and the farming representative organisations.  In 2002 we established a farm safety partnership advisory committee which meets a number of times a year.  More significantly, a farm safety action plan has been put together.  There are five specific goals which have been translated into a series of projects on which specific groups are working.<br\/><br\/>We also use education, and have interventions at primary, secondary and tertiary level.  We provide online educational supports through our website, <i>hsalearning.ie<\/i>.  We provide farm talks and farm walks, conferences and seminars.  In one appendix I have outlined some of the indicative activities which take place in the authority.  We support other organisations.  The experience we have in terms of giving advice and the conduct of inspections or farm safety visits is that they are well received and farmers are generally willing to put in place the recommendations of the inspectors.<br\/><br\/>There have been a number of occasions when the authority has found it necessary to use the formal enforcement instruments, and generally they are complied with by farmers.  We also have communications channels on the HSA YouTube channel where we have survivor stories.  We have extensive guidance on a vast range of activities on our website and provide an online tool to help farmers prepare safety statements and identify hazards.  Those tools are available free of charge.  We work collaboratively, particularly with Teagasc, to ensure that anyone going on to a farm is, to some extent, able to assist in the dialogue.<br\/><br\/>I will give a flavour of the kind of work we are doing and go through some of the key elements listed on page 12 of our plan for 2015.  Our programme of work for 2015 will continue with the same broad approach and themes as have been adopted through 2013 to 2015.  Once again, we will work closely with the farm safety partnership advisory committee and the key players.  We will run an inspection programme of 2,300 inspections, which is the opening plan.  Our plans for inspections are based on a planned proactive element and a reactive element, which is based on notifications of serious accidents and, tragically and regrettably, where fatal accidents have been reported.<br\/><br\/>The briefing session is taking place today.  We are working with Teagasc on how we will roll out the discussion groups.  We plan to have involvement with 50 discussion groups or, as they are also known, knowledge transfer groups.  They operate on the principle of peer to peer influence and have been used internationally and in Ireland to achieve behavioural change in a number of aspects of farming practice.  There is quite a level of academic research in the area which is published, peer reviewed and challenged to show that, as a technique, they are quite efficacious.  That is the major shift in the mix of elements.  <br\/><br\/>We will also have significant awareness raising campaigns through print, radio and digital media, and through points of assembly for farmers such as marts and co-ops.  We will work with key players in the farming media.  We will have the survivor stories on the HSA YouTube channel.  People who have had experiences will tell their stories, which are quite powerful.  We will have continuous messaging through social media.  We will implement the farm safety partnership action plan.  As I said, we will work collaboratively with Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on quite a number of initiatives, including close collaboration on discussion groups.  We may come back to the Department, which will strongly support the discussion groups.  <br\/><br\/>We will collaborate with our colleagues in Northern Ireland on some all-island initiatives because its experience is very similar.  It has a similar profile.<br\/><br\/>We will carry out market surveillance on the supply chain and products used in agriculture, and we will continue to ensure that, as best we can, the products being used in the agriculture industry are safe and compliant with the appropriate testing and marking.<br\/><br\/>We will have a HSA marquee and staff presence at the ploughing championships.  Typically, of the 150,000 or more people who pass through a very significant portion of the farming community gets advice and information on safety practices.  It also includes live demos on PTOs, chainsaws, quad bikes, animal handling and a number of other areas.  We will develop a new, free online tool linked to our BeSMART tool.  We currently have more than 20,000 registered users and we will make it available free online to the agricultural community later this year. <br\/><br\/>We will have a national farm safety conference with other players.  We will have seminars and presentations to agricultural stakeholders, some of which are planned.  We receive numerous requests from farming organisations to speak at meetings, and we will continue that role.  We will also have awareness raising material including videos and posters at assembly points for farmers.  As I mentioned, we also have a website.  We will also continue to monitor and engage with European and international peer groups in identifying the best practices.<br\/><br\/>We believe that this programme will ensure continued high levels of awareness.  The levels of awareness, we believe, are very high, based on European agency research.  We want to keep it high but also we want to drive and encourage the behavioural change that will lead to improvements.  Ireland can produce world class food on farms, but we want to see world class products produced on world class safety farms.  <br\/><br\/>I can reassure the committee that the level of resources allocated by the Health and Safety Authority will continue to be maintained during 2015.  I thank members for the attention.  We will happy to deal with any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin O'Halloran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Halloran.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#E00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":526,"content":"<p>It is very useful to have this debate today.  It is good that the delegation acceded to the request by the Chairman to come before the committee at very short notice and discuss this very important issue.  All of us know of people who have been killed in farm accidents and the major tragedy it is for the families involved.  Many people are injured on farms, and some receive serious injuries.<\/p> <p>  There was a report that the number of inspections was to be reduced, which is a cause of concern.  Mr. O'Halloran articulated the challenges facing the farming and agricultural industry very well.  The person doing the work on a farm is normally a sole trader and today many more farmers work on their own compared to the past.  Factories have fixed equipment and if there are potential risks one can do a lot to reduce them.  Farms are, by their nature, full of mobile equipment which is taken in and out of fields and farmyards and is manoeuvred to different places.<\/p><p>It leads to a much higher risk factor which was very much highlighted in the 8:1 risk factor mentioned.  <\/p><p> Today, we are here to work in collaboration to see is there some way that we can reduce the number of farm accidents and fatalities, an objective that we all have.  Last year was a particularly bad year for farm fatalities.  The first issue alluded to in the report is an obligation on all industries, including farming, to report serious accidents.  It was also stated in the report that reporting of farms is much less for the obvious reason that if a farmer, the owner of the farm, has an accident one is unlikely to sue oneself and, therefore, the obligation or imperative to report an incident is not as high.  <\/p><p> In the factory or office setting the vast majority of accidents happen to employees.  In other words, not necessarily to the owner or employer.  For all sorts of reasons, including insurance reasons, I imagine there is virtually 100% reporting of significant accidents in employer-employee relationships.  As an employer I learned if there was anything, even quite a minor thing, to report when the health and safety person arrived he or she always made good suggestions.  Is there anything that can be done to ensure people report accidents?  Reporting a near miss, or an accident that did not have the serious consequence it could have had, could prevent a more serious accident happening. <\/p><p> The authority must carry out more inspections proactively because there is not as much reporting of non-fatal accidents.  Does the authority need resources from its parent Department to carry out more inspections?  More resources would mean the authority would be more proactive and would go to farms to ensure safe practices are in place.  <\/p><p> Are there other mechanisms by which we could encourage farmers to prepare their safety statement, to think about safety and to self-audit or get somebody to audit what they do without an inspection?  That would be helpful because the authority will never get to every farm.<\/p><p> As I have suggested in the past, could an arrangement be arrived at with the insurance companies, following informal discussions, that they will give a discount on insurance policies to farmers who carry out a safety audit and had a certified safety audit conducted by an appropriate person who was able to confirm it to the insurance company?  Such a financial initiative would encourage people to have a safety statement and have somebody carry out an inspection.  That would be preferable to the financial penalties spoken about because they exacerbate the problem.  I do not favour financial penalties because a lot of the reason people do not invest in safety is that they do not have money.  A penalty would take even more money away and would create a vicious circle.  We must look at positive ways to encourage people to move forward.  A small incentive would be a positive move and much preferable to exacerbating the problem by taking necessary grants away. <\/p><p> Has the authority analysed which type of farm has a high rate of accidents?  Are more intensive farming methods more susceptible to accidents due to having more machinery in the farmyard?  Is there a higher rate of accidents on more intensive farms rather than on less intensive farms?  Insurance premia and investment are likely to be a lot more for more intensive farms and, therefore, it would pay them a lot more to have some type of audit in place.  In contrast, a farm with very low intensity other than from livestock, which might have one tractor on it, would be a much lower risk.  Has the authority got a statistical analysis that says the more equipment and machines on a farm, such as a slurry tank versus not having one, the higher the risk?  In a lot of cases small farms contract out a lot of the machinery work.  It would be important to have some measure of the matter.<\/p><p> Have we any idea what the compliance rate is for safety statements?  I often have my doubts about safety statements.  I would not like to ask my colleagues how many of them have read the safety statement as an employee in this place.  I remember one day reading it because we had been given a big book which contained the statement.  Cases where one must prepare a statement and one is involved work better.  I am not sure how many employees read the safety statement.  If an employer prepares one then he or she might get better engagement. <\/p><p> I noted the statistic of 17.9% of people fell from a height.  I compliment the Minister on introducing the safety scheme last year.  It was an innovative and positive idea.  Unfortunately roofs were not included and replacing roofs that might be defective was not included.  How many of the falls from a height were caused by a person falling through a roof?  In other words, a person was doing something on a roof that was not up to standard and he or she fell off a ladder or through the roof because it was rusted or whatever.  Should roofs be included in some new iteration of the scheme?  I suggest it should include the replacement of defective roofs because almost 20% or one fifth of people fell from a height.  Is a defective roof a significant cause of accidents on farms?  The other causes are obvious - tractors, machinery, livestock, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#E00300","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Halloran for his presentation.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, we appreciate the delegation coming here today at short notice.  The backdrop of the debate is a very bad year for fatalities, not least Lester Ryan's father only last week.<\/p> <p>  It was stated in the presentation that the authority has experienced a reduction in available resources.  The number of staff has been reduced from 197 down to 152 and the budget has been reduced from &euro;24 million down to &euro;17.7 million.  I cannot help but notice the fact that only 22 of the 152 staff have a full or partial involvement in agriculture and 13 are full-time equivalents focused solely on agriculture inspections.  Given the number of agricultural holdings in the Twenty-six Counties one is talking of anything up to 150,000 farms but I am open to correction.  If I am correct then it means there is one inspector per 7,000 farms.  Is such staffing sustainable?  Is a shortage of staff a contributing factor?  To put an adequate safety programme in place one must first know the dangers which exist on some farms.  How can we overcome the problem?<\/p> <p>  The change in machinery was mentioned in the presentation as playing a big part in safety on farms.  As someone who grew up on a farm I am well aware of the changes and advancements in horsepower, size and number of machinery compared with what was on farms in the past.<\/p><p>Many of those who have lost their lives on farms are children.  What percentage of those accidents is related to machinery compared with slurry, septic tanks and so on? <\/p><p> As farming advances and machinery becomes more powerful and prevalent, there will need to be a cultural change to a greater focus on the dangers posed by machinery.  There were 30 fatalities last year.  The rate of fatalities on farms compared with that in other industries is quite alarming.  The Health and Safety Authority, HSA, talks about a similar situation in the Six Counties and is working on an all-Ireland basis.  That is commendable because not only is safety central to its work, but it is focusing on the cultural aspect, to work together in harmony to reduce the fatalities.  Much of its work is educational.  That will change the culture in respect of safety, which is paramount.  That is a big help.  The farming organisations have a big and positive role to play in so far as the HSA has a collective approach to dealing with the ongoing problems.  I take it that the research into, and monitoring of, international best practices on farm safety is part of the HSA&rsquo;s farming conferences and so forth.  I wish it the best of luck in its endeavours.  The curtailment of resources makes its job much more difficult than it should be.  If we can do anything to help in that regard, the witnesses should say so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#F00200","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  I come from a farming and contracting background.  Sometimes we have to look back to go forward.  Farmers now farm by date and by the weather.  After Christmas there are dates for spreading slurry.  Everyone is under pressure to get the jobs done.  We have to consider where we were compared with where we are now.  When pressure is on and one is fighting the clock and looking after stock, things will go wrong.  We need to consider what we have done in the past few years in setting dates for this and that, for spreading slurry or not.  This and the weather put extra pressure on people, who try to bundle everything together.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to reporting of accidents.  I agree that a message needs to be sent out that we are here to work with the HSA.  There is a genuine fear that if the HSA says something is wrong, it will go after the farmer who will have to pay penalties and be hassled.  Penalties do not resolve anything.  Working with people is the way to get the best possible outcome.<\/p> <p>  At one time in most parts of Ireland the cow was milked and the calf was reared and the next generation was a quieter animal.  Six or seven years ago I had cows and I killed them because I was afraid for young kids.  I reared cattle on a bucket to have another generation that is quieter.  That is reality.  The further we have gone to perfect the breed, which we have to do, the flightier the cattle are.  There are dangers in the line of cattle.  As people got busier over the past few years, animals became more used to a jeep or a tractor than to the person within it.  There is less and less contact with the animals.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s idea of rewarding people with insurance is a good one but I do not want farmers to be threatened because the more that happens, the less will be reported.  The age profile of farmers is older.  We are trying to attract young farmers.  We need them because while a 21 year old can jump up on the ditch if a bull runs after him, a 71 year old might not jump so quickly.  We need to deal with these matters in a common sense fashion.  I would like to hear the witnesses&rsquo; views on children on tractors and the seats that have been talked about.  We need to work to bring down the figures but farming is a dangerous game in many ways and we have to try to get the best possible outcome for everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#G00200","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I thank the gentlemen for coming in today to discuss a very important issue.  All of us here want the same thing, a reduction in fatalities and serious accidents on farms.  The rate is unacceptably high at the moment.  My community was affected by this when we lost a neighbour a little over a year ago in a freak accident.  The impact on a community is phenomenal, and goes beyond the family.<\/p> <p>  We need to improve the statistics.  They are disproportionate to the 6% of the workforce that is farming.  There are very few other workplaces that people live in with their families.  The farmhouse is in the centre of the yard and the farm.  The farmer never leaves the workplace.  That is a serious consideration.  There are many attractions for children in a farmyard.  It is seen as an exciting place to play.  As a young lad I fell off the hayshed, playing on the bales when I was warned never to play on them.  I put out three discs in my back and cracked a couple of ribs.  I was lucky not to be killed.  We have to challenge the attractions of the farmyard. <\/p> <p>  Why do the witnesses think last year&rsquo;s figures were so high?  Are we going through a bad spell or is there a particular reason?

We are all acutely aware of the trauma and stress suffered by families who have lost a loved one in an agricultural accident and others who have sustained horrific injuries.  As Deputy Heydon has said, in addition to the families, the whole community is devastated because very often these people are the backbone and bedrock of community activity and have contributed so much to developing communities.<\/p> <p>  Very often relatives come out and talk - brave people they are - and that is very important.  We saw that with the recent \"Late Late Show\" appearance of Mr. Rohan who established Embrace FARM.  I have a brother who has been a farmer for 44 years and is very experienced.  When we hear relatives speak in the wake of a family tragedy, they often suggest that the victim was a very experienced farm operator and the person one would least expect to have an accident.  That has to be taken into account.<\/p> <p>  We are dealing with a wide variety of causes of accidents from the involvement of equipment and implements.  It involves power take off, PTO, balers, slurry agitation as well as loading and animal handling - in particular, animal handling after calving.  Those are areas in which farmers are very experienced and yet something can happen.  The last thing we need to do is to regulate farming activity out of existence.<\/p> <p>  In the course of a case in the 1950s, a judge said that to make accidents impossible would virtually require people to stop work.  That is the starting premise.  Even though we have the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2006, and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2007, we still have accidents happening.  Even employers who follow every aspect can find one little thing left out.<\/p> <p>  I am all in favour of safety statements, but they need to be simple and we should avoid getting them bogged down in legalese, which is a disaster.  It is not that farmers resist them, but the last thing we want is a plethora of legalese that would necessitate a farmer having a lawyer alongside to ensure that everything was being done right.  Let us focus on the simplification of it.<\/p> <p>  It is vital to have more direct contact and interaction, and persuasion with a hand on the shoulder giving guidance and advice rather than mandatory regulations.  That means wholescale involvement with stakeholders.  We need to involve those people who have spoken out and who play a huge role in bringing focus to this.  I believe a representative from the Health and Safety Authority was also involved in the recent television programme.  I meet many farming people in Westmeath and they have been talking about it.  People are focused on it, which is a huge help in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The farmyard is a challenging workplace environment.  As Deputy Heydon said, in the 1960s and 1970s when we were growing up we pursued some activities that would be frowned on now.  It was less challenging and a more relaxed environment.  Deputy Fitzmaurice is right in saying that everything is now done at a particular time, including synchronised calving.  Everything is now happening all together.  When we grew up one could be calving over a three or four-month period.  Now calving all takes place over a week.  The Chairman knows more about sheep.  It is now possible for a farmer to have 500 lambs born in couple of weeks.  At one time that was scattered out more.  There is pressure on people.  Perhaps because of the economic situation there may be less help on the farm than heretofore.  Sons and daughters go off and get an education which opens up avenues.<\/p> <p>  Accidents could have happened in the 1960s and 1970s that were not reported and lots of chances were taken.  I took chances myself with farming activity from a very young age.  When I look back at it now, I would say that the Health and Safety Authority would have grabbed me by the back of the neck and turfed me off the thing altogether.  We have to look at where we are.<\/p> <p>  If the Health and Safety Authority starts into an enforcement regime, it will not work.  Guidance, help and interaction are required with a huge focus on education.  Every farmer under 35 has to get a green certificate and everything else.  When I completed my agriculture diploma, as Mr. O'Halloran knows, there was a full module on farm mechanisation and equipment.  In Multyfarnham Agricultural College we had to sit through hours of the theory and multiple hours in practice with PTOs, slurry agitation and working down in the dairy.  We did that under Mr. David Jordan, who was an excellent teacher and I never forgot those lessons.  Has the Health and Safety Authority made contact with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine to suggest that as part of getting that certificate a farmer would be required to do eight or ten hours theory with people from the Health and Safety Authority and then do the practice, even going out to some dairy farm?<\/p> <p>  No one size fits all.  Different farming activities attract different levels of challenge.  There are some very intensive dairy and pig farms and others being run by a single farmer on his own.  It needs to be tailored to the activity that is taking place on the farm.  As part of that certificate, there should be focus on a safety course.  It would only require about five hours of theory and five hours of practice.  That would be a good way to ensure that people who achieve certification would be taking on board a practical application.  That certificate is very important in terms of capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax when taking on a farm holding.  It should focus on the fact that a person is taking on not only a farm, but this as well.<\/p> <p>  Practical application of solutions is more important to us at this stage.  Everybody working together, including this committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Doyle, should be focused on ensuring that we minimise accidents.  However, we must start with the premise that to make accidents impossible, we would have to call off all activity.  Every one of us set out this morning in the car with the view that the last thing we wanted to happen was to have an accident.  Then something happens for a moment and we have an accident or somebody else runs into us.  That is an important starting point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#H00300","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I wish to take up on Deputy Penrose's point.

There were some overlapping questions.  I assure members that we will take all of their questions and observations on board and we will reflect on them and consider what changes in direction or finessing of direction we can develop based on today's meeting.<\/p> <p>  I will start with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question relating to reporting.  The level of accident reporting in agriculture is very low.  That is a common characteristic across all European member states, and EUROSTAT has some compensatory methods.  We agree with the Deputy's observation that an understanding of the near misses of the situations that could have given rise to very serious or fatal accidents helps general understanding.  Teagasc has conducted research on that and we talk to a group in Manchester, THOR, which collects information on respiratory and other illnesses from the medical world.  That gives us a limited level of data.  We also get some data from the State Claims Agency and the Central Statistics Office, but we do not have a complete dataset.  We try to get as much information as we can as we believe it helps in the understanding.<\/p> <p>  However, I wish to make an observation in that regard.  We believe that through the discussion groups or the knowledge transfer groups, farmers are willing to share their experiences in what I might characterise a safe environment.  It is an environment where a farmer might say to another farmer, for example, \"I had a very close call on Monday\".  We envisage that this sharing of experiences through the knowledge transfer groups will help the culture shift.<\/p> <p>  The next item was the resources.  Every State organisation has experienced resource diminution and ours is no different.  Notwithstanding that, due to the priority we have allocated to agriculture we have 22 people involved in it, which amounts to 13 full-time equivalents.  It is a high priority area for the authority.<\/p> <p>  As regards mechanisms the Deputy mentioned such as self audit, we welcome that.  We believe it is essential.  Like a number of the members, I grew up on a small farm and I am acquainted with the traditional concept of the meitheal whereby people helped out.  The modern concept of the meitheal could be to do an exchange audit, where a farmer would conduct a small audit.  To get technical, we believe cognitive dissonance sets in.  We see the danger on everybody's farm but not on our own because we are on it every day.  We believe in that approach and actively encourage it.  We will continue to encourage it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the insurance discount, we have engaged with the insurance industry in the past and asked it to consider it, but it advised us that its model is different.  It is not the model it operates.  However, based on today's discussion, we are happy to re-open that dialogue with the insurance industry and to ask it to reconsider.  While that is not the model adopted by the insurance industry, the insurance industry in the farming sector has been supportive and works with the Health and Safety Authority and the partners.  I must acknowledge that positive interaction.<\/p> <p>  As regards the analysis of farm type and intensity, as Deputies Fitzmaurice and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, the machinery and the animals have got bigger.  The animals have certainly become more flighty.  Animal husbandry practices have changed.  The days of feeding a calf from a bucket and walking the cows home are certainly in the historical annals of husbandry practices on farms.  Yes, they are more accustomed to the jeep.<\/p> <p>  I will ask my colleagues, Brian Higgisson and Pat Griffin, to elaborate because there is a significant differentiation in the risk profiling within agricultural sub-sectors.  Pat Griffin can give some context on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin O'Halloran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422525600,"counter":538,"content":"<p>There is a difference in the types of accidents that happen on different types of farms.  I agree we cannot treat the sector as a homogenous group and have projects and approaches that apply to all farmers.  We must recognise the differences.  What distinguishes Ireland from any other country is that we have a 92% or higher livestock-grassland based agriculture.  That has huge risks.  Livestock are very unpredictable and there is the issue of working grass and saving grass.<\/p> <p>  The sector in agriculture that sticks out hugely is dairy farming.  Teagasc conducted research some time ago which identified that 58% of fatal accidents happen in dairy farming, which is approximately 17% of the agriculture sector.  That rings alarm bells for me, given that the quotas will be abolished on 1 April and many farmers are going into expansionary mode in dairy farming.  With the number of replacement heifers and the increased output and intensity in farming, we are facing a difficult situation in trying to help these farmers to protect themselves.  If one looks at a map of Ireland that shows the intensity of farming and a map that shows where the fatalities have occurred - we have plotted this - the intensity of farming matches exactly where the fatalities are occurring.  That is how we have identified it.<\/p> <p>  The issues with the deaths are predominantly tractors and machinery.  We will put huge focus on that.  Over 50% of the deaths are occurring with tractors and machinery.  Of the 30 deaths last year, 18 of them involved tractors and machinery.  We have a focus on that and we will put our efforts into inspection and discussion groups and working with the farming sector to bring it along in a helpful way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Griffin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422525600,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I will ask Brian Higginson to address the other matter regarding the compliance rate in terms of safety statements on farms and the 17% caused by falls.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin O'Halloran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422525600,"counter":540,"content":"<p>In reply to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v about the compliance rate with safety statements, I will link my response to the issue Deputy Penrose raised regarding the complexity of the safety statement.  The authority has put in place a code of practice which is a means whereby the farmer can prepare a safety statement.  It was circulated to all farmers in 2008.  The idea is that it makes it a step-by-step process to aid the farmers, rather than presenting them with a blank sheet and asking them to do it.  That was one of the key initiatives taken.  It is one of the key things we look at when we talk to the farmer as part of our inspection process, or any employer or person in a place of work.  We ask if they have a safety statement.  Our figures from last year, based on our inspections then, show that 65% of farmers had their safety statement or a code of practice available on their farm.  That is the first aspect of it.<\/p> <p>  Second, we then asked them who prepared the safety statement.  To refer back to Deputy Penrose's comment, if one can get farmers to engage in doing it themselves it is the best way to proceed.  A total of 91% of the farmers have indicated to us that they do this themselves.  That is a very positive outcome.<\/p> <p>  There are some concerns about it.  The highest one is that part of the code of practice results in the generation of an action list for the farmer to improve safety on their farm, but only 52% of those we reviewed had the action list prepared.  There was a great deal of work done, but it had not gone to the final stage of listing what work needed to be done.  Where there was an action list, 60% of the actions had been done.  Again, there is an issue here in that the work is started but it might not be completed.  This ties into our approach where we are looking at knowledge transfer discussion groups, where farmers can possibly engage together on this process and exchange information with each other.  Rather than be alone in trying to do this themselves, they could work together to bring it to completion.  That is the position with the safety statement.<\/p><p> On the question about falls from heights, the vast majority of falls from heights on farms are associated with either maintenance or repair work at height, often externally such as with shed repairs.  A key problem we have seen in recent years is translucent lights on the surface of a farm shed in terms of Perspex sheeting.  When one is within the shed looking up it seems obvious where they are but as the shed weathers and ages, if one is on the roof they are not as noticeable and, unfortunately, people can step in the wrong location.  The answer to the question is that the vast majority of them would be associated with either maintenance or repair work to sheds or other farm buildings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Higgisson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422525600,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I will deal with Deputy Ferris's questions and make some observations.  With regard to education, we are involved at primary level and run a number of initiatives.  We helped develop a free online module for all primary schools.  I have written to all 3,500 primary schools advising them that it is available free of charge online.  It is linked to the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum and it includes elements of farm safety.<\/p> <p>  In 2013 we ran a farm safety campaign with all schools through our collaboration with Kilkenny Education Centre.  We ran an art and writing for children competition in the 21 education centres nationally.  We had 10,500 children participating and from that we produced a booklet on farm safety, essentially authored by the children, entitled Only a Giant Can Lift a Bull.  It was distributed to every school and library in the country and made available as a resource, so that continues.<\/p> <p>  At primary level we run a Be Safe campaign where we collaborate with other agencies on water safety, road safety and mountain safety.

Disappointingly, and this is an area we continue to seek to change, the leaving certificate syllabus on agriculture has not changed in 40 years.  We are striving to have that changed to ensure it reflects, as Deputies Penrose and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v identified, modern farming practices, the scale of machinery, the different animal husbandry practices and the different breeds of livestock.  We have been corresponding with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and will continue to seek to have that curriculum revised to reflect the changing world.<\/p> <p>  We have a close working relationship with Teagasc.  In terms of all the programmes it runs, and I understand it has trained more than 35,000 farmers in recent years, we believe the level of training and compliance by what I might call the younger more modern farmers is very high.  However, the high-risk group of children and elderly farmers have not received that training.<\/p> <p>  For undergraduates doing agricultural science in University College Dublin there is a mandatory safety module.  We have succeeded in getting very positive engagement with education in all sectors, and we see that as part of the mechanism to achieve cultural change.<\/p> <p>  With regard to research and monitoring best practice, that is done through a number of channels.  My colleague, Pat Griffin, is a member of the European network - he is probably one of its leading people - and he has regular dialogue with counterparts in the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Denmark to exchange best practices.  He has brought some of those people to speak at conferences here, so we do have international networks.<\/p> <p>  The resources question was raised also.  Every state organisation has been through a difficult period, as have those in Ireland.  We would all welcome resources but, notwithstanding that, our commitment is undiminished and we will continue to allocate a very high priority to resourcing.<\/p> <p>  As regards agricultural holdings, various estimates put the figure at approximately 130,000 holdings, but in practice the estimates we get is that there are probably 80,000 farmers whose primary source of income comes from farming activities.  There are also a number of farming endeavours from which there is off-farm income as well.  Those are the numbers at which we are looking.<\/p> <p>  The level of penetration, to use that term, we would achieve with inspections is fairly limited but in terms of the benefit, when an inspector goes in it becomes known in the farming community that he or she is in the area.  It is that experience we are hoping to build on with the knowledge transfer groups so rather than have one farm safety visit interacting with one farm, there will be an interaction with a number of farms.  That will facilitate the transfer of knowledge from an inspector.  It will have what I call a theoretical dimension to it with a dialogue to allow people exchange their experiences.<\/p> <p>  We could not disagree with Deputy Fitzmaurice's observations.  Many activities are high risk both in terms of large machinery, and obviously we cannot dictate to farmers, but there are many activities that would probably be better done by contractors.  When there is big machinery involved, contractors, if they are doing the work professionally, will be able to commit better time to that.<\/p> <p>  We could not argue with the Deputy's observation about going back to go forward.  Also, the observation about insurance is true.  We also agree with the Deputy's observations on the age profile of farmers, but the high risk group is children and elderly farmers, and they are very disproportionately represented in those statistics.  In 2014, the figure for children was five and the figure for farmers aged 65 or over was 12 or 13, so they are disproportionately represented.<\/p> <p>  With regard to getting people with credibility and authority to speak, we believe that is fundamentally important.  That is why we have again asked a number of farmers to share their very difficult experiences at events we have run, and they have been generous and brave in giving of their time.  At the ploughing championships last autumn, one farmer was willing to show his amputation, as have been a number of other people.<\/p> <p>  We also believe that one of the key successes of discussion groups and the knowledge transfer groups is that they are people who have authority in the eyes of their peer group relating their experiences.  We have to be realistic.  We are a regulator.  While we have certain personal experiences, we have to recognise that the farming community will see us as a regulator.  There is a perception that a regulator will say what a regulator will say.  We recognise that, and that is why we strive to have people with a level of credibility and authority engaging with farmers.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Heydon's observations, it is devastating and we see the tragedy and the trauma.  The experience from talking to farmers is that these experiences transcend generations.  They are incredibly traumatic, and we recognise that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of why 2014 was such a bad year, it is very difficult to say, but the key observations were that the number of children and elderly farmers killed was incredibly high.  If they were taken out, we are probably closer to the norms of other years, but I do not know that we have an easy answer to that particular question.<\/p> <p>  The question was raised about children on tractors.  The first comment to make is that there is no change in regulation.  Our philosophy always is to simplify.<\/p><p>We do not approach the community with, to use Deputy Penrose's expression, legalese because we are trained in it and we know that it is an immediate turn-off and negative in discussion.  That is why the code of practice, to which my colleague, Mr. Higgisson, alluded, is written in accessible language.  The BeSMART tool that we propose to launch later this year will be in accessible language.  It is online and is step by step.  At the end, it will help produce the farm safety statement.<\/p><p> As regards the specific question of why we are taking that view about children on tractors, I will ask Mr. Pat Griffin to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin O'Halloran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422525600,"counter":544,"content":"<p>The dreadful situation where children are being killed on farms has been an issue we have been trying to tackle for many years.  Fifteen years ago, we developed a code of practice for preventing accidents involving children and young persons on farms.  Within that, we tried to set certain parameters for activity involving children on farms.  One of the issues is one must be over 14 to drive a tractor on a farm.  Another issue is that children under the age of seven should not be carried in the cab of tractors or other farm machinery.<\/p> <p>  At the time, the setting of that age bracket was linked to the physical development of a child.  When a child is born, his or her skull is in seven pieces and then it knits and comes to full strength when the child is aged eight.  It was recognised that a child being carried in the cab of a tractor, if he or she got a severe bang in the head, could suffer brain injury, and that is why the age of seven to prevent children from being carried in tractors was chosen.<\/p> <p>  A more modern reason for it now is that many of these tractors are touch-sensitive controlled and if one has a child aged under seven years in a tractor and he or she reaches out and operates any of these controls when, perhaps, his or her father gets down to go to the back or front of the tractor to do something, the child could cause a serious injury or death to the parent.<\/p> <p>  We came out at the end of 2014 with an announcement that we would try to be tougher on three issues.  Those three issues were that we would consider on a case-by-case basis to go straight to prosecution of farmers who may have unguarded PTO shafts or who would leave slurry tanks open with a risk of persons falling in, and where farmers were carrying children under the age of seven in the tractor.  The primary reason for the one involving a child is that we believe that if children are carried in tractors commonly, when the farmer goes down to the yard to do work and his mind is on the work, a child, at the first opportunity when he or she hears the tractor operating, will go down to the yard, and children are often reversed over or crushed.  That is the reason we tried to bring in these stronger rules.  We have no wish to make the work of the farmer more difficult.  We would say that if farmers comply with those three basic issues where we really need to implement improved standards, they have nothing to fear from the inspector.  We will help them and be co-operative.<\/p> <p>  On the question of why last year was so bad for farm deaths, there was a 40% increase in output in the agricultural sector in 2014.  If there is a 40% increase in output, there certainly will be more work and greater intensity.  There is more work going on and there is more risk.<\/p> <p>  A second issue is the fodder crisis.  The fodder crisis was followed last year by probably the best year's growth of grass ever experienced.  Farmers filled their silage pits to the hilt and then found that they still had grass to cut, and they cut bagged silage.  The country is covered with mountains of bagged silage and quite a number of the deaths in 2014 occurred in handling such bagged silage or round bales.<\/p> <p>  A third issue in farm deaths is the lack of help on the farm.  The best year ever for farm deaths, and still it was dreadful, was when there were 11 deaths in 2009.  The reason for that was the economic collapse in Ireland where the construction sites closed down and many of the sons and daughters of farmers went back to the farm.  In 2009, no person over the age of 65 was killed on the farm because there was help around.  However, that was suddenly followed by another bad year where there were 25 deaths where these sons and daughters emigrated.  It is quite a complex area to identify why the spike happened last year but I believe some of those issues are in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Griffin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422525600,"counter":545,"content":"<p>If I might juxtapose the children on tractors and suggest that we would be tolerant of construction sites where construction workers might carry a child in a JCB or excavator, it gives one a sense of it.<\/p> <p>  To deal with Deputy Penrose's observations and questions, certainly it would not be our intention to regulate out of existence.  We would wish to present any regulation in language which is as accessible as possible.  We do not use the language of \"reasonably practicable\".

However, there are a couple of matters I wanted to raise.  I echo the welcome from all of my colleagues and thank them for coming before us at such short notice.<\/p> <p>  It is on the record, although the witnesses did not say it, that while we are talking here about statistics, we are talking about real people.  Nobody is unaware of that in our contributions but it should be stated.  There is personal devastation caused to families from these death, the vast majority of which, as our guests state, were potentially preventable.<\/p> <p>  There is no significant reduction in fatality rates.  One is eight times more likely to die working on a farm in Ireland than the general working population, which is a staggering statistic.  There are two deaths per 100,000 workers but the rate is eight times higher in the farming sector.<\/p> <p>  I want to make reference to the GL Noble Denton research on agriculture, which the witnesses included in the documentation.  The documentation raises one or two of the issues to which Deputy Fitzmaurice referred, for example that: \"The influence on stress of perceived excessive paper work and regulation is notable.\"  Perhaps we would not always think about such stress.  The documentation also lists: \"The stated influence of excessive fatigue, poor lighting and weather were greater than anticipated.\"  The witnesses might have a view on that.  It also states: \"Research confirmed much of our current thinking and prevention programs [sic] as being appropriate but also indicates where some sharpening of messaging and focus are needed.\"  Here is my question, which may seem a little naive.  Prior to social media and the communications era in which we are involved, I can remember when growing up that one saw aluminium signs in various workplaces, farms, etc., listing do's and dont's.  My understanding is that the statements on safety tend to be contained in books and filed.<\/p><p>Naive and all as it might seem, would the witnesses consider publicising key safety issues, for example, four or five dos and don'ts of farm safety, and putting them on an aluminium sheet in order that they could be posted up in the milking parlour or other central location on a farm?  The message would be there for everyone to see.  Farmers intend to work safely and it is reasonable to ask what occurs between the process of hazard identification and subsequent injury.<\/p><p> The research partly addresses the issue by saying that some of the answers lie in farmers having excessive self confidence, feelings of immunity to accident or injury, the fact they have never been caught before and risk taking becoming the norm.  When one looks at the statistics for last year, reference has been made to the higher than average number of elderly farmers in their 70s and 80s, it seems to me to be a case of familiarity breeding contempt to some degree, although when one looks at the details of the accidents, as have been outlined, the random nature of some of them is awful to contemplate.  It is often a case of the wrong place at the wrong time.  The assumption is that the machinery is safe when it is not.  That is why I promote the argument that rather than having elaborate safety measures and putting them in book form - which is good and I do not in any way say it should not continue - perhaps at a simple level one could consider listing three or four of the do's and don'ts because as the statistics indicate, the highest rate of fatalities relates to farm machinery.  Therefore, if even that were to be addressed it might mean that the farmer when closing the farm door would see the sign asking whether he has switched off the engine or put the machinery in permanent safety mode.  That would be a reminder not only to the farmer himself or herself but also to those associated with the farm.<\/p><p> My final point relates to the high statistics on fatalities last year, as outlined by Mr. Griffin.  He is correct to conclude that expansion is expected on Irish farms in the future and that will present a particular challenge for farm safety generally due to increased stock numbers and work activity.  The experts know what the challenges are and like my colleagues I wish them continued success in their important work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#L00400","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses from the Health and Safety Authority.  It would be remiss of us not to express our sympathy to the families of those who passed away last year.  Last weekend in my constituency we had an unfortunate death in the Ryan family and prior to that in April 2014 a Mr. Byrne died in Bennekerry, County Carlow.<\/p> <p>  I have been involved in farming for many years.  I was taught to drive on a little grey Massey Ferguson.  My father put it in gear and I hopped up on it when he got off.  That was very safe.  Things have changed a lot in recent years.  I will continue the point on which Senator Mooney concluded.  The conclusion on page 20 of the report is that the Food Harvest 2020 targets will lead to more emphasis on production and on efficiency in terms of farmers trying to do things on their own, which means they are putting themselves under more pressure.  That is a big issue.<\/p> <p>  I was interested in the statistic on the number of accidents on dairy farms in recent years.  I was mistakenly of the view that dairy farms were among the safer places because of the considerable investment in recent years.  It goes back to the fact that dairy farmers, like other farmers, are on their own.  If a cow is calving at 3 a.m. a farmer will not be looking for half the country to give him a hand to get the cow in and do whatever he has to do with her.  He will have to do it on his own and if he gets into a spot of bother he will have to try to sort it out himself.  From the point of view of common sense, one could ask how one could deal with such a situation when it arises.  In most cases, accidents have a freak nature.  One of the individuals I mentioned was unfortunately killed by his son because he was blinded by the sun.  He did not see his father coming into the yard.  The sun blinded him and he hit him with the loader of the tractor, which unfortunately killed him.  It is very difficult to legislate for something like that happening.  Last weekend, in the case of the Ryan family, which I understand has one of the safest farms in the country, an issue arose.  Again, it was a freak incident.  The culture must change.<\/p> <p>  Education is key, and it must take place on the farm, as opposed to online education, which was mentioned.  While online education might be useful the education must happen on site.  If there is an incident in my yard or whoever else&rsquo;s yard, one will see that clearly, as opposed to something online.  Education is not as effective online as on site.  Knowledge transfer is crucial.  We have had various discussions about sheep, dairy and tillage farming.  Farm safety should be a compulsory element of education.  Generally speaking, farmers do not like inspectors calling.  They would get more from a group session when they do it themselves and it would be more beneficial.<\/p> <p>  The Health and Safety Authority could consider changing in that regard and rather than having an inspection regime it could have more involvement with Teagasc and the agricultural colleges.  As a former student of Kildalton, John McNamara, whom I am sure the witnesses know, was very involved there in farm safety at a time when farm safety was not as prominent an issue.  It was a matter of getting in and out, doing what one had to do and moving on.  In recent years agricultural colleges are bursting at the seams with more and more young farmers coming back, for example, from the building sector.  Perhaps more of an emphasis could be made in the colleges, which again relates to education.<\/p> <p>  To return to a point made by Deputy Heydon on children, we all try to encourage our offspring to get involved in farming.  Reference was made to the fact that a large proportion of farmers nationally are at the higher end of the age spectrum.  Likewise, I am trying to encourage my children to get involved.  When a young fellow wants to become actively involved on a farm one cannot say he must stay in and watch television.  It is hard to say to a child that he should be careful.<\/p> <p>  In terms of children aged under seven and tractors, is a figure available on the number of children killed who were in a tractor as opposed to those who were running around the yard and got killed?  I accept what was said about under sevens.  Valid points were made about machinery nowadays and about high-tech electronics in tractors.  Is there an argument to the effect that a child aged up to ten would be safer in a tractor where the farmer can keep a close eye on him or her, as opposed to the child running around the yard near animals or a slurry pit?  I do not say a child would be safer but I am interested to hear what the statistics show.<\/p><p>There is obviously off-farm income involved and the mother in the household is more than likely out working as child care costs a good deal of money.  Increasingly more children are being kept at home and the father who is farming is trying to be the child carer and do everything else.  He is trying to incorporate everything together.  To return to my initial point, with the increasing emphasis on meeting targets, he is trying to achieve all those targets and be the Jack of all trades.  There needs to be more education around that end of it.  The main emphasis must be on education.<\/p><p> What way do the authority's farm visits work?  Its target is to carry out 2,300 farm visits this year.  Does the authority inform the farmer beforehand?  When its inspector visits the farm would the farmer be given a programme of work to do and a timescale to complete it?    How does the authority select the farmers in terms of farm visits?  Is it random or who supplies the list to the authority?     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#M00200","speaker":"968","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I call Senator Michael Comiskey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#N00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives for attending and for their presentation.  Sadly, far too many lives have been lost in the past year.  I join colleagues in offering my sympathy to all the people who have been affected by such loss.  The representatives outlined the authority's programme for the coming year.  I agree with other speakers that the knowledge transfer and the discussion groups are important.  Many farmers are involved in discussion groups and they come together and share information among themselves, which perhaps is much easier to do than an inspector coming in and doing that.  With regard to inspectors, the carrot - rather than stick -  approach would be best.  When an inspector visits a farm yard, and I know that the authority's officials do this, the first thing they would do is to offer advice to the farmer, but if there is a subsequent visit and jobs required are not being done, the stick approach could be used at that stage.  It is important to encourage farmers to get involved.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that the authority does a good deal of work in the schools and that should be continued.  That is a great way of raising awareness.  If children learn something relevant to what is happening at home or on the farm in school, they will talk to their parents and other farmers about it.  We see the great work that has been done in educating children about the environment, recycling and so on, which encourages children to get involved at a very young age.  <\/p> <p>  It is important to make the safety statement simple.  The grant scheme was touched on.  I have said previously that the ceiling of the grant scheme at &euro;2,000 is too high and that the grant should kick in when a farmer has spent &euro;1,000.  Sometimes simple jobs will make a farm much safer.  In my own case I got a galvanised cover for slats which were being replaced by heavy concrete slats and it only cost around &euro;400.  That made a great difference.  Falls from roofs are another problem.  There is a provision in the safety grant where a mesh could be installed under the Perspex or skylight sheeting on the roof.  Those are my points and I note that many other issues have already been covered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#N00300","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives from the Health and Safety Authority.  All the specific questions have been covered but I wish to make a few comments.  Johnny Ryan was a close neighbour of mine and lived only a little over a mile from me and I knew him very well.  I extend my sympathy to the Ryan family and to all families who have lost a family member as a result of a farm accident during the past year.  Johnny was a model farmer.  Nobody goes out in the morning thinking they will have an accident or that they will crash their car.  That was a freak accident, as are the majority of farm accidents.<\/p> <p> We all know what is supposed to be the oldest profession but I believe farming is the oldest profession where people have had to provide food for themselves.  It has been practised here and all over the world for thousands upon thousands of years.  Farmers are fearful of inspections.  They have inspections for single farm payments, from Bord Bia, from county councils and from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, for the agri-environmental options scheme, AEOS, and they can also have inspections from the Health and Safety Authority.  A headline on the \"AgriLand\" news portal states: \"Up to &euro;5,000 fine for carrying a children in tractors (HSA says no more excuses)\".  That will not do the authority's story any good.  It will frighten farmers and build hostility among them with regard to a visit from a health and safety inspector.  It is all about co-operation.  Everybody has hit on that point.  The main aspects to this are awareness, education, training and advice.  That is the only way to address this problem.  It is not one that can be solved because there will always be freak accidents, but it can be addressed though Teagasc, the farm organisations and an advertising campaign.  Unfortunately last year was also a bad year for road fatalities.  However, the Road Safety Authority has had good success with its advertising campaigns in tackling the problem of drink driving.  I know that funding is a problem for the Health and Safety Authority.  If we have to, we need to be lobbied to contact the Ministers for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Agriculture, Food and the Marine to secure funding if the authority is to run a proper advertising campaign.    <\/p> <p>  The largest number of accidents occur in the construction industry and on farms and we have been given the statistics on that.  The construction industry has been depressed because there has not been much construction work here in recent years.  As Mr. O'Halloran said, one would not bring a child on to a building site, but farms are not building sites.  Farms are where people live, where people make a living and children will be around.  I wish to make a few points about the banning of seven year olds from travelling in tractors.  Many of the  modern tractors are very safe because they have seats and seat belts.  If a child hears a tractor being driven, they will run out into the yard but parents also have a responsibility to ensure farm safety.  As Deputy Deering mentioned, in many farm households, the farmer's wife is out working as child care costs a good deal of money.  If grandparents are not around, the farmer has to take responsibility sometimes for the child during the day.  He cannot sit inside to do his work, he has to go out into the yard.  If the child is not in school, where is he or she to stay?  A farmer may have to bring the child on the tractor.  I believe a child is safer on a tractor.  I do not want to go into individual cases but I note from pages 38 to 41, inclusive, of this document that it is stated that so many under the age of five were killed, but none of those was killed on a tractor; they were killed by tractors when they were in the yard or by an implement in a yard.  It would be safer in that respect if a child were on a tractor.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Griffin said that dairy farms are the most dangerous.  I was amazed about that because I thought the more intensive farms would have better cattle-handling facilities and perhaps better machinery.  It is important to develop co-operation with the farmers and not to frighten them because if one scares them, they will not co-operate.  Finances are an issue in this respect.  Many farmers are struggling to make a living, especially beef farmers and smaller farmers.  They cannot afford to do some jobs.  They have to educate and feed their family and they may leave something that needs to be fixed in the yard on the long finger.  The grants paid by the Department must be reviewed because the Minister has to reduce the threshold in terms of what people can apply for in order that the small jobs can be done.  The small things are what can catch one out.  It is all about training, education, awareness and co-operation.  Unfortunately, farmers are sole traders.  They work on their own and it is a lonely life for many of them.  The idea of inspections frightens farmers.  If we can ensure there is even one death less, it would be great.  We will not be able to prevent every farm accident.  We need to make sure that people are always aware of the dangers on farms and that could be done through advertising in the schools.  It is great to see the co-operation in schools, including in the schools in Kilkenny, and that should continue at second level also.  I ask the representatives not to frighten the farmers or to pose the threat of a prosecution because they will not co-operate then.  They have enough inspections.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#N00400","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I wish to make an interesting observation on an area that has been covered by previous speakers.  I am not sure if the representatives would have a view on it and I appreciate their authority is not the competent authority in this area.  There are people who have had a full, clean licence for 15 years who at the time of the change in the rules applying to the licence inadvertently did not get a licence that legally allows them to pull a trailer on the road and yet 16 year olds have a licence that entitles them to drive huge vehicles carrying silage on the road.  That is irresponsible.  My children would probably have given out to me when they were that age for saying that, but I do not understand how with the acquisition of a simple tractor licence, a 16 year old can be left responsible for a vehicle pulling 12 or 14 tonnes of silage or grain behind it.<\/p><p>On the other hand, an experienced driver with no blemish on his or her career who would have been driving a vehicle on the road with a car trailer is no longer supposed to do this because of the changes in the system.

I will come back to the GL Noble Denton research, but in terms of sharpening the message, we will certainly take on board the observation made by Senator Paschal Mooney and ascertain whether there is a mechanism whereby it could be developed in a way that could be used.  That is why we suggested publicising \"five do's and do not's\" and having them in some form of hardware on farms.

I will ask him to touch on some of the messages on the stress, the paperwork, the fatigue and some of the key findings involved in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin O'Halloran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422525600,"counter":556,"content":"<p>We undertook the GL Noble Denton research to try to identify areas in which we could improve farm safety and change behaviour.  Senator Paschal Mooney absolutely hit a particular point, in that the research indicated that we needed to sharpen the message to farmers.  While much of the print media and commentary appeal to farmers to work safely, that certainly does not mean much to farmers because everyone wants to work safely.  Consequently, one must sharpen the message and become involved more critically in the critical messages.  An example of this arose from our reaction to the slurry handling issue, when three dreadful deaths took place within the Spence family in Northern Ireland.  There have also been a number of deaths here in slurry handling.  In this regard, we certainly tried to sharpen the message on how slurry should be handled.  We designed a safety sign that set out simple steps on how to mix slurry safely.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has now agreed to make this safety sign mandatory for placing above agitation points in any new building the Department will grant aid.  <\/p> <p>  Another notable issue to emerge from the GL Noble Denton research was stress and the pressure of paperwork.  Obviously, we have covered the point that we are trying to make both safety statements and compliance with legal safety requirements more simple for farmers.  We have produced a code of practice which is a checklist form of safety statement.  We have also made it available online to make it easier for some younger farmers to comply with it.  We have also identified that fatigue is a major issue.  Many farmers spend 12 to 14 hours a day working and fatigue is a major issue.<\/p> <p>  One point that I wish to bring to the attention of the joint committee is that when we conducted this research and tried to examine fatal accident rates across Europe, we were unable to find good statistics for deaths of farmers.  We could find figures for approximately 12 member states up to 2007 or 2008, which indicated that approximately 550 farmers were dying in the agriculture sector in the European Union each year.  However, if one were to include the new member states and the 28 member states in total, I estimate that 1,000 farmers are being killed each year in producing food for Europe.  Certainly, we will try to spread the findings of the research we have undertaken on these issues with our colleagues in Europe to try to deal with this major issue.  Our research certainly identified that education, as well as training and working with farmers, was absolutely the way to go.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Martin Heydon asked what we would do differently this year to try to deal with what happened last year.  What we are doing differently is getting involved with discussion groups.  We will cover 50 discussion groups and work with farmers to try to improve what they do on farms in order that farmer-to-farmer education and knowledge transfer on safety will actually happen.  The research we have undertaken has pointed the way towards what changes are necessary in our programmes of work to change from inspection to broaden it into discussion groups and other preventive methods that we have listed in our submission to the joint committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Griffin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422525600,"counter":557,"content":"<p>Moving on to Deputy Pat Deering's questions, we certainly agree and our entire thrust is culture change.  We want to continue education on the farm.  Perhaps I did not clarify this, but the online training programme is primarily a resource for teachers in primary schools.  However, we believe the on-farm education programme will be empowered and enabled through the discussion groups because they will be farm-centric.  Consequently, we certainly take on board the Deputy's point and do not disagree with his observations.<\/p> <p>  As regards farm visits, I will ask my colleague, Mr. Higgisson, to outline the process involved, how farms are selected and, when an inspector calls and leaves, the nature of that interaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin O'Halloran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422525600,"counter":558,"content":"<p>To respond to Deputy Pat Deering, in the first instance, our inspection campaign is a national one.  Therefore, the inspectors involved are situated around the country.  It is a random programme, in that we do not have a list of farmers or anything presented to us.  Inspectors are given the freedom to make inspections in the areas most relevant to them and that may be identified or highlighted as being of higher risk by being black spots in the presentation made to the joint committee.  Farmers are not pre-notified or pre-warned about inspections and as a result, the inspector arrives on the farm unannounced.  Our inspectors have a very high understanding and knowledge of the agriculture sector and are aware that there could be constraints at the time of the visit that may make an inspection difficult and on which they will engage with the farmer.  We will also carry out the inspection with the farmer.  In other words, the inspector will not visit the farm on his or her own.  This is all about engaging with the farmer and taking the opportunity to look at the issues on the farm, give advice and guidance on what the risks are and the actions that may be taken or may need to be taken.<\/p> <p>  If one examines the outcomes of farm inspections, more than 90% actually involve advice, whether it be verbal or written.  Approximately 10% are enforcement actions, by which I am referring to a prohibition notice; in other words, a certain activity must be stopped such as the use of an unguarded power take-off, PTO, shaft.  Another measure is an improvement notice, a notice that requires a certain action to be taken within a certain time such as the guarding of an unguarded slurry pit.  However, the vast majority of our engagements and outcomes involve agreement and getting the farmer to agree that the works must be undertaken.  Where there is such a requirement with written advice, a timeline may be and is often given.  In these circumstances, we ask the farmer to write back to the inspector who would expect to receive a written response when the remedial action had been taken.  It is important to identify that there are a number of outcomes from the inspection.  One obviously is that the HSE wishes to improve the standards on the farm, which is important.  We wish to increase the awareness and understanding of the farmer.<\/p><p>We know that when we are inspecting farms in a region, it has a broader impact.  Farmers speak to their neighbours and tell them there is an inspector in the area.  This enables them to focus on their own farms even though the inspector may not call to them.  It also gives us very important information on the standards of safety on farms.  This is one of the key things we also need to know.  We need to know the hazards and how they are being addressed and controlled.<\/p><p> We try to get feedback on the farm inspection process.  In all of our inspection processes, we try to get the inspected entity, farmer or individual to give us feedback through an anonymous survey.  We do not get a huge response from the agricultural sector but we get some responses and the vast majority of these are positive in terms of the experience of the farm inspection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Higgisson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422525600,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Comiskey and other members of the committee for recognising and welcoming the value of knowledge transfer groups because this is one of the strategic differences in the direction in which we are going.<\/p> <p>  On the grant scheme, we do not influence this but we will bring the observations made to the attention of the officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who may be able to influence any future schemes.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Higgisson dealt with the issue of feedback and the information we get from this.

We want it to be a collaborative approach and we will continue with this as a specific objective.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to recognise the observation of the Chairman and note that we share his concerns about young drivers who are relatively inexperienced being in control of a very large load.  The entitlement of young drivers on farms to drive on-farm without any age restrictions and on-road is a concern for us.

In terms of seven year olds on a farm, the choice can never be whether to leave them in the tractor or in the yard.  We have looked, sadly, at a number of child fatalities on farms.  In the vast majority of them, the child was in the yard and was either reversed over or hit by a machine.  Our sense of it is that children are commonly getting spins in a tractor, which is hugely exciting for a very young child.  I have witnessed this myself.  Children of a very young age will come down to the yard unsupervised and without the knowledge of the parent.  The parent is driving the tractor and suddenly the child is in the yard.  The mother can come home from town with her very young children and, while she is doing something, a child hears the tractor and disappears down into the yard very quickly.  For a child, the sound of a tractor, after the excitement of getting spins on one, is like honey to a bee.  The child will go down to it.  This is something about which we are hugely concerned.  We must recognise that children of that age do not have sense.  They must be supervised.  Given the number of children who have been killed on farms, we have to deal with the issue of carrying children in the cabs of tractors.  It is a very difficult rule to make and to set it out in black and white.  However, we are trying to prevent situations in which children get excited by tractors, run down to the yard and get crushed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":563,"content":"<p>Would it not have been better to put the emphasis on supervision of children in the yard as opposed to children in the tractor?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#P00500","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I know Mr. Griffin and members have the best interests of everyone in their hearts on this matter, but a headline such as this will not do.  The big stick approach of a &euro;5,000 fine for carrying a child on a tractor will not work.  This is about awareness.  I know that children can be excited about tractors and rush out to see Daddy and that accidents do happen.  However, parents have responsibility as well.  The mother is in the home and the father is in the yard.  The father is on the tractor.  He has to be aware that the wife is coming home at whatever time.  We cannot come along and suddenly draw a line and say a person will be fined &euro;5,000 if he or she has a child who is under seven years of age on a tractor.  This will not work.  Who is going to enforce it?  Will garda&iacute; enforce it?  Will the Health and Safety Authority inspector arrive in a person's yard and enforce it?  There are not enough people to enforce it.  This is about education, getting people to co-operate and making people aware of the dangers.  The other aspect of this concerns grants.  A farmyard should be fenced off properly in order that a child cannot gain access to it without parental supervision.  This is a better approach than fining someone &euro;5,000 for having a child under seven years of age on a tractor.

There is no point in saying they cannot.  It will create more accidents if children are not allowed to be on the tractor.  A person might be in a shed believing the child is not coming over, but the child will sneak over.  When writing to Santy at two or three years of age, the first thing a child on a farm wants is a tractor.  They will sneak over and back the road.   If the person brought the child with them and put the child in the tractor, at least they would know where the child was.  The authority needs to rethink this.<\/p> <p>  In tractors nowadays, there are seats and seat belts.  Given the suspension in tractors nowadays, they are easier to travel in than cars.  The authority needs to look at this again.  I fear the road the authority is going down will cause more accidents.  Children will sneak up on tractors.  There is no point in saying they will not.  They are youngsters.  It is like a hurler in Kilkenny who has a hurley in the hand at four years of age to be good at it.  The authority needs to re-examine this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015012900002#P00700","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speech","time":1422525600,"counter":566,"content":"<p>We will leave it at that.  The authority, in its presentation, stated: \"Bringing about such a change cannot be achieved by a single entity or a single approach.\"  This is probably the nub of the matter.  The Health and Safety Authority is a very important cog in the machinery when trying to ensure farm accidents are eliminated, which they probably never will be, or reduced to a number approaching the average across various sectors.  The committee needs to identify the main themes.  I have picked up on a real warning sign here.  Some 58% of the accidents are happening on dairy farms which account for 17% of farms.<\/p><p>The proportion of dairy farmers working full-time is higher than in other areas of farming.  As such, most of them do not need to rush back to their farms after work.  This area requires great focus in view of objections to Food Harvest 2020, but other areas should not be neglected.<\/p><p> The issue of grants was identified.  The joint committee will identify a list and make representations to the relevant Minister.  It is interesting that 6,000 people have applied for funding under the safety measures in the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS.  The joint committee wrote to the Minister to include this measure in the scheme.  The figure of 6,000 equates to approximately 5% of all farmers and it should be borne in mind that the application window has been short.  This indicates a high level of interest in the scheme.  The number of applications would increase significantly if the threshold were lowered.<\/p><p> Everybody agrees that the discussion groups are important.  They have generated considerable interest from farmers, members of the public and the media.  I stated at all times that the purpose of inviting the Health and Safety Authority before the joint committee was to have its representatives explain the rationale for the reduced number of farm visits in order that we could understand the HSA's position.  We were worried about the number of farm visits.<\/p><p> I was a member of this committee during the previous D&aacute;il when members stated a preference for describing farm inspections as farm visits.  Mr. Halloran indicated at the time that the Health and Safety Authority was endeavouring to do this.  The number of farm inspections or visits appears to be declining.  If the HSA policy was to access all areas through the discussion groups, we would have made that recommendation.  The discussion groups are key to this issue.  No one should fear having health and safety training made a mandatory part of training to become a qualified farmer.<\/p><p> Senator Mooney's practical proposal on the erection of signs listing health and safety requirements is a good one.  Such signs would serve as a reminder as they would be in people's faces all the time.  Warnings on social media or in a book are not in anybody's face.  Road traffic signs, warning signs and health and safety signs can be found everywhere.  I thank Senator Mooney for his sensible and easy proposal for enhancing safety awareness, which is a key issue.  As people become busier, they forget to take their time and sometimes get into a panic.<\/p><p> I am aware of an unfortunate case involving a child who was responsible for a parent having an accident by virtue of being left in a cab.  There are pros and cons to introducing a straightforward fine, although in my view this is not the best approach.  A pragmatic approach needs to be taken to this issue.  When my young nieces and nephews visit, they want to drive up and down the driveway on a tractor.  They are allowed to do this but are then told that is the end of the matter.  This is part of the thrill of visiting a farm.<\/p><p> No single entity, agency or approach can overcome this problem.  We need to raise awareness.  Nine or ten of the 30 people who died on farms last year were aged over 70 years.  Mr. Griffin's comments on the cases that occurred in 2009 provided an interesting insight into the profiles of those who died.<\/p><p> I thank all members for their input.  Health and safety on farms is close to our hearts.  When we circulated information on the issue, members expressed eagerness to invite representatives of the Health and Safety Authority to appear before us.

I am pleased to be back and am also pleased Members of the European Parliament are here to give us their reaction to the Commission's work programme.<\/p> <p>  The work programme is the European Commission's plan of action for the next 12 months.  From our perspective, we have a big year ahead.  President Juncker has underscored that we are making a new start.   He has also made it clear that he is determined that the Commission should work better, decide better and be more open and democratic.  We are into a new situation and President Juncker has tried to mark a break with the past.<\/p> <p>  President Juncker first flagged this new approach at the European Parliament in July 2014 before he took office but, of course, after we knew the results of the European Parliament elections.  He outlined the ten specific political priorities on which the new Commission's mandate to 2019 would be based.  I will not go through them because I hope members have received the green table which lists the specific ten priorities and the different actions contained in each one.  I hope it is legible because the type is quite small.  Mr. Juncker reiterated these priorities at the European Parliament in October, which was immediately prior to him taking office formally on 1 November.<\/p> <p>  President Juncker has made it clear that the Commission will only commit to launching initiatives on which it can deliver.  In other words, he does not want a whole list of promises that will not be fulfilled.  He wants to list things that we will actually do in 2015.  As members will see in the hand-outs, the work programme sets out 23 new initiatives, which is fewer than in all the preceding five years.  This is our 12-month to-do list.  Just to be clear, these are the new initiatives for 2015.  Obviously, business continues on actions agreed over the past number of years and actions under negotiation with the European Parliament and Council.  We will leave those aside for the moment but these are the new initiatives.<\/p> <p>  I appeared before the committee at the end of last year to discuss the European investment plan.  President Juncker set the ball rolling at the end of his first month in office to deliver on that ambitious agenda for jobs and growth.  The &euro;315 billion investment package was launched in close co-operation with the European Investment Bank.  Implementing this plan is the first priority for 2015.  Vice-President Katainen is doing a sort of roadshow in every member state and will be in Ireland in May to try to engage with bankers and others who can contribute to getting viable projects off the ground and contribute to triggering the additional funds we hope to see coming on stream once we get these projects up and running.  It would be very welcome if members were interested in coming to one of the various events we will plan for that visit.<\/p> <p>  Another priority is an ambitious digital single market package.  This is about creating the conditions for a vibrant digital economy and society by complementing the telecommunications regulatory environment, modernising copyright rules, simplifying rules for consumers making online and digital purchases, enhancing cyber-security and mainstreaming digitalisation.  That is another package which would be of much interest in Ireland once launched. <\/p> <p>  The work programme also emphasises European energy union and the need to stake steps to ensure energy supply security, further integrate national energy markets, reduce European energy demand and decarbonise the energy mix.  That package is in preparation at the moment.  <\/p> <p>  A fairer approach to taxation is also a priority.  There will be an action plan on efforts to combat tax evasion and tax fraud, including measures at EU level in order to move to a system on the basis of which the country where profits are generated is also the country of taxation.  This will include automatic exchange of information on tax rulings and stabilising corporate tax bases. <\/p> <p>  We will also have a European agenda on migration.  This is about developing a new approach on legal migration to make the EU an attractive destination for talent and skills and improving the management of migration into the EU through greater co-operation with third countries, solidarity among the member states and fighting human trafficking which has become a scourge in some member states.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I would like to flag steps to deepen economic and monetary union.  This work is about continuing efforts to promote economic stability and attract investors to Europe.  Banking union is necessary because of interdependence of banking systems in euro area countries.<\/p> <p>  I would like to underline that President Juncker has repeatedly said that the EU needs to be bigger and more ambitious on big things but it must recognise where the member states are best placed to act and in those cases, it must be smaller and more modest.  It shows the Commission has been listening carefully to the message it is getting back from the member states to sort of butt out of the nooks and crannies of daily life and to try to focus on the bigger picture issues that can only be solved by collective action.  This is not new in that the principle of subsidiarity has been around for some time but there is a big renewal in the commitment to actually apply the principle, which I would like to stress.  <\/p> <p>  Cutting red tape and improving existing legislation will also form an important part of the Commission's work during its mandate.  In another break with tradition, the 2015 work programme includes a significant clearing of the decks.  We have reviewed around 450 proposals, which remained on the books after the hand-over from one Commission to another and have identified 80 which do not match with the ten overall priorities, which need to be reworked in light of changing objectives and contexts or which are simply taking too long to work their way through the institutions.<\/p><p> The bottom line is that the Commission does not want to waste time on proposals that have no chance of being accepted, that will not deliver the results we want to see on the ground, or which can be achieved in a more effective and less bureaucratic way.  In many cases, the Commission remains strongly committed to the objectives we sought to achieve with those proposals but proposals are of no use if they are simply sitting dormant on a negotiating table or are so watered down in negotiations that they can no longer achieve their original purposes.  I have a few examples which members will see in the red hand-out that was circulated.  The anti-counterfeiting trade agreement, or ACTA, proposal is still on the pending proposal list despite being rejected by the European Parliament.  The Commission wishes now to withdraw it officially.  On the so-called \"circular economy\", which focuses among other things on boosting recycling, the Commission plans to present a new proposal with a broader approach to meet the ambitions in a more effective way.  The Commission proposes to withdraw the energy tax directive because the Council has watered it down so much that it no longer meets the environmental objectives of taxing fuel in a way that reflects real energy content and CO2 emissions.  I pick those three examples to provide the committee with the reasons we propose to withdraw the proposals.<\/p><p> To ensure overall coherence, we have a new position in the Commission of First Vice-President.  That job is with Vice-President Frans Timmermans who is taking on the role of co-ordinator in implementing the work programme and who also has the task of scrutinising very carefully the different proposals that come from the various departments and Commissioners to ensure that subsidiarity and better regulation become a reality.  A major snipping job was carried out by Vice-President Timmermans before the work programme saw the light of day.  Commissioners had to defend - in some cases successfully but not in others - the various proposals they wanted to put forward from their departments.  It is an extra layer of scrutiny and a job that was previously done by the Secretary General.  Now, we have the First Vice-President doing it, which shows the importance we place on the issue of subsidiarity.  Mr Timmermans has also been tasked with fighting excessive bureaucracy.  He has the authority to stop proposals coming from individual Commissioners which do not match the overall policy coherence of the Commission's work.<\/p><p> There is a tough programme of work ahead of us and I have not even mentioned some very important ongoing issues, like TTIP.  It will be vital that the institutions work together to implement the work programme.  On foot of the way the Parliament was instrumental in selecting the President of the Commission on this occasion, there is much improved interaction, engagement, relations and co-operation between the institutions in recent months.  This bodes well for the years ahead.  Finally, I emphasise the role of national parliaments in the process.  The new Commission has been clear on the need to deepen the existing political dialogue with national parliaments and I look forward to continuing to work with this committee in that context and to bringing as many Commissioners as possible before it when they visit Ireland.  The committee has undertaken a great deal of valuable work across a range of European affairs and I look forward to building on our close co-operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422541800,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Nolan and note in respect of her last remarks that we had a bi-lateral with Vice-President Timmermans last month when we outlined our views on how to improve the role of national parliaments.  Next week, we will be in Riga for the Latvian COSAC chairs' meeting.  I understand Vice-President Timmermans will be there and I have no doubt that we will be talking further about how national parliaments can improve their role through, for instance, the yellow card.<\/p> <p>  I thank Ms Nolan for her presentation and note that I am delighted to see that there has been a rationalisation of the new initiatives.  Five years ago, the Commission was looking at more than 300 new initiatives every year, three years ago it was down to 150 and now we are down to 23.  The main thing is to ensure that the project management that is put in place and the monitoring of the 23 initiatives are good enough to ensure that we get outcomes from them.  I will focus on two in particular, the first being the &euro;315 billion investment package.  One of the things that has been discussed around Europe is whether the investment will be considered to be outside the limits of the fiscal compact treaty.  Some countries, including ours, are keen to see any investment treated as being outside the limits, but there are others, particularly in northern Europe, that are less keen on that idea.  It will require agreement from across the European capitals.  Can Ms Nolan tell us how those negotiations are going across Europe and can we expect in her view to see the investment treated as being outside the fiscal compact limits?<\/p> <p>  The second issue I raise is the Commission's initiative on the aviation package and aviation policy.  How does Ms Nolan see the issue of connectivity feeding into that package, particularly for peripheral countries such as ours?  Does she see connectivity as having a vital part to play to ensure that small countries at the edge of Europe are totally connected, not just to other European capitals but to the world at large?  Many of us here share concerns about the proposed sale of Aer Lingus and the impact it might have not just on the ability of Irish people to travel to other European countries but also on our ability to attract foreign direct investment.  We are also concerned about the impact it might have on jobs.  Ms Nolan's ideas on what that package will involve and the consideration that will be given to peripheral countries are sought.<\/p> <p>  I welcome our guests from the European Parliament, from each of whom we will be hearing in turn in the next stage of the meeting.  For the moment, I will take quick questions from D&aacute;il or Seanad Members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012900002#E00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1422541800,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that we are under pressure.  It would be no harm to explain that we have taken a decision on dealing with TTIP.  Although I had extensive notes on it, we have agreed that the committee will meet to deal with that.<\/p> <p>  We wish the project of job creation every success.  I raise two areas in job creation, which are labour mobility and youth unemployment.  There is a section set on promoting integration and employability in the labour market and it argues that there should be a follow-on policy on the youth employment initiative that has already commenced to integrate the long-term unemployed into the mainstream of work and, thereafter, into the status of full citizenship of any nation.  Can Ms Nolan set out the plans that will be implemented?  There is a package of measures envisaged to target that.  Can Ms Nolan explain the labour mobility package?  Is it about labour mobility within the EU or from outside the Union into it?  We have debated our work programme in private session and, touching on euroscepticism, have discussed engaging with matters that might contribute to that including the free flow of labour.  There have been allegations that certain nations are robbing our jobs and we have seen the rise of UKIP around non-British labour.  The dimension of cultural diversity is becoming more and more of an issue in Europe given the events in France and so on.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman has mentioned the key issue of the aviation package and Ms Nolan will answer him on that.

The Chairman has asked us to be fairly sharp in our questioning.  We were told the Commission would be more political.  As evidence of that, it has been described as the last chance Commission for bringing European Union citizens closer to Europe or we will fail, according to President Jean-Claude Juncker.  Recently there was interference in the Greek elections from President Juncker.  I met the High Commissioner and formally complained about the interference of the President.  That is a view that would be shared within this House also.  People felt it was ill-timed, but I do not think it had a negative effect on the Greek elections.  President Barroso was also involved in the Scottish referendum.  Is that part of the new political way forward by the European Commission?  I have spoken to some Commission members and I do not think there is agreement right across the board.  Some felt it was ill-timed and that they should not have been involved.  That is a concern in respect of the direction of the new Commission.  We were told it would be something new and different but we have not seen that. Even its make-up and gender appear to be coming from the old boys club itself.  Perhaps the representatives cannot comment but do they think that the idea of the Commission involving itself in domestic elections is helpful for its image, bearing in mind that people are sceptical about the European Union and so on?<\/p> <p>  TTIP was mentioned.  Again it is about the involvement of people right across Europe.  I am informed that the Commission was asking the views of people on TTIP and that there were 150,000 responses, including a large response from Ireland.  One issue that arose was the investor state dispute settlement, ISDS.  There is huge concern in respect of that issue.  Do the representatives believe the Commission should drop the ISDS mechanism given the overwhelming public opposition to it?  I understand there is much opposition to it in France and Germany.  Of those canvassed, some 97%, 145,000, indicated their opposition or a concern about TTIP in general.  One of the concerns, an issue which has been touched on at this committee, was the secrecy around the TTIP and that people are not getting feedback on what is happening.  There are panels being tentatively agreed or moved to different panels.  We have been told that the US authorities have a different approach.  How can this issue be opened?  There is huge concern across Europe in respect of its impact.  Everyone wants more trade but it will impact on economies.  Farmers have started to speak about the impact in Ireland and trade unionists are talking about the impact on jobs.  While there may be positive elements to it, there are also negatives elements but we are not getting to debate them.  Thankfully this committee has already looked at them and will do so again.<\/p> <p>  There is also the regulatory harmonisation and co-operation body, particularly in respect of Irish food.  Are we going to regulate up or down in this area?  In regard to the stimulus plan for jobs, the Juncker investment plan, and the &euro;315 billion additional funding, will the representatives give the committee a sense of where that funding is coming from?  There is a concern that some of it may be coming from recycled money, that it will be taken from different programmes and that we may be told it is some private investment.  That is the big debate in the European Union where there seems to be two camps, one which believes there is a need not only for quantitative easing but also a stimulus package to kick start many economies that are floundering right across Europe.  If we are robbing Peter to pay Paul from existing programmes, it will not work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012900002#F00100","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1422541800,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for appearing before the committee.  I appreciate the setting out of the work programme and the month-by-month review.  It is this review on which I wish to concentrate.  To what extent is it expected that review will be monitored on a monthly basis with specific objectives to be achieved throughout the course of the year, bearing in mind that one month of the year is a holiday month and another month is almost gone for breaks and individual member states holidays, etc.?  That will have the effect of crushing the review into ten months as opposed to 12 months.  Arising from that my question is obvious.  My criticism in the past has been that we have great aspirations but achievement of objectives is a critical factor.  If this is to be done on a monthly basis, will it be marked off and the achievements recorded for all and sundry?  That is in line with the semester.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the &euro;315 billion investment programme, the self same criteria must apply.  It must show advances on a month-by-month basis and on a year-to-year basis.  There is no sense in having a grand objective that looks well and is good and is necessary unless it achieves its specific targets within a specified time and if it does not we need to know why.  The question is whether it will achieve its targets and how soon we can expect to see the manifestation of that investment programme throughout all the countries of the European Union, including in those countries that are island nations and, effectively, cut off from the mainland of Europe, recognising the fact that they have special requirements.<\/p> <p>  The digital Single Market is an issue that is very important.  What is the shortest possible time within which we can expect to see the achievement of the various objectives in that particular area?  <\/p> <p>  The next issue I wish to raise is European wide taxation.  I think we have concerns about that.  I agree in principle that the country that generates the profit for a particular company, regardless of where that company comes from, for example foreign direct investment, is where the taxation should take place.  Unfortunately, we have been maligned to a certain extent by people who had practices that were not exactly pristine.  As a nation we were blamed repeatedly for benefitting from a special tax haven status that we did not have.<\/p> <p>  The European agenda on migration has already been mentioned.  There is something we need to do in this area also.  At European Union level we need a general policy on migration which should be evenly spread across the European Union without exception.  That is a difficult thing to do, particularly when there is an influx of refugees from some corners at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012900002#F00300","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1422541800,"counter":581,"content":"<p>Very quickly Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012900002#F00400","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1422541800,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I am coming near the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012900002#F00500","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1422541800,"counter":583,"content":"<p>Please, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012900002#F00600","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1422541800,"counter":584,"content":"<p>The banking union has been referred to.  The presumption is - it has gone abroad and has got considerable legs at this stage - that there is no need to repay borrowings on one basis or another.  That has become acceptable in general conversation.  There are institutions within member states called central banks which govern lending policy in individual member states.  Departments of finance do similarly.  Is it expected that banking policy, as pursued under the aegis and guidance of individual member states' lending and borrowing policy, absolves the country from liability thereafter in the event of severe consequences which we had in this country also?<\/p><p>This is hugely important in the context of the direction Europe is taking at this time.

It is correct that the Commission has proposed that when it comes to assess countries' public finances under the Stability and Growth Pact, contributions that have been made to the investment package will be assessed favourably.  This means they will not be taken into account for countries in either the preventative or corrective arm of the pact.  However, there has been adverse discussion in the ECOFIN Council about this proposal, but as we are talking about guidance on the existing framework - that is how to apply the rules rather than changing the rules - it was agreed that the Council does not necessarily need to approve these steps by the Commission.  Following the ECOFIN Council, the Presidency said it would seek consensus on this issue, rather than a formal adoption of it.<\/p> <p>  This is the way we propose to do it.  Ultimately, this package is a relatively modest amount of funds that will trigger much more funding.  It aims to get member states to crowd in with funding and also to raise private sector funding.  We want to make the conditions as favourable as possible and to ensure the most viable projects to trigger that.  That is how matters stand currently.  The Chairman is right when he says there is disagreement.  Some countries have a positive view on this, while others do not.  For the moment, it stands as it is and the plan is to approach it in the way described.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Crowe has doubts about where the funding will come from.  We must wait and see.  We are involved in a marketing operation currently to try to crowd in the funding which will, hopefully, make this proposal work.  This is being operated not just by the Commission, but in close co-operation with the European Investment Bank, and they believe it has a strong chance of working.  The multiplier used was based on other operations of a similar nature.  We must give it a chance and see what happens.  Vice-President of the European Commission, Jyrki Katainen, is trying to travel around the member states to sell this idea and we hope it gets the reaction we want.  So far, the reaction has been relatively positive.  When Vice-President Katainen speaks to bankers and people who understand the concept and how it works and the importance of having seed capital on the table, this encourages others to come in with funding.  We hope it will work and everybody wants it to work.<\/p> <p>  I do not have any detail on the aviation package as it has not yet been presented to us, but it is important we keep the issue of connectivity in mind.  It should be acknowledged that the Single Market has already produced a revolution in the aviation sector, mostly to the benefit of consumers who now pay lower prices for travel between other European member states.  We have yet to see what will be in the package, but if the committee has strong views on connectivity, perhaps it would be a good idea to communicate those views to the Commission while it is still working on the proposals.  It is important to get in on this as early as possible, before the proposal is finalised.  If the committee has particular concerns, I am sure they would be a useful contribution to the work going on in the Commission.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Byrne raised the issues of youth and long-term unemployment.  These are not new issues for the Commission.  For decades, we have spent considerable funding, through the European Social Fund, to try to cater for these two particular problems of the labour market and we will continue to do so.  We will continue to keep a significant focus on young people in particular and on the long-term unemployed.  Jobs and growth remain central to everything we are doing and there is no exception to that when looking at social and employment policy.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of elements in the labour mobility package, which concerns labour mobility between the member states rather than outside of the European Union.  We have millions of vacancies in the Union and significant numbers of unemployed people, particularly young people.  The issue is whether there is a way of making the market work more effectively.  If we compare the European Union with the United States, labour mobility is very low.  We have a link-up between the public employment services of the member states, and members may know about the EURES network, which tries to link people looking for employment with jobs in other member states.  We want this to work better.  We also want to ensure the social security dimension concerned with when people move to work better.  We will look at all of these issues as part of a package of measures for the labour market.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked several questions, but I will not be able to deal with all of them.  In regard to the banking union, if I understand his question correctly, he was asking whether this would absolve national central banks of their duties.  I do not think so.  What it will do is gear up for integration of the market where there are overlaps or where something needs to be regulated at European level.  We are not trying to take away from what national central banks should be doing.  Therefore, I do not believe the proposals will absolve national central banks in the event of a crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1422541800,"counter":588,"content":"<p>Can I get clarification on that, because that is not what I was getting at?

It is there as an added \"protection\" in terms of things going wrong in the future, but it is not there to replace what should be in place already.

I thank the joint committee for inviting me to appear before it.  I hope these engagements will prove to be an important part of our work as MEPs and the work of the committee.<\/p> <p>  The European Commission's work plan needs to be taken in context.  It is fair to say the European Union continues to struggle with the deepest economic and social crisis it has faced since its foundation.  Economies throughout the Union are stagnating; there is high unemployment, particularly youth unemployment.  There is the looming threat of deflation, as well as threats to social and labour rights.  There are rising socioeconomic inequalities.  There is also the potential threat that the European Union could face a democratic crisis in its response and that of the component parts of the European institutions to the decision made by the Greek people last Sunday.  It is important for the future of the European Union and the democratic credibility of the Union that that decision be respected and that the new Greek Government be supported in implementing the very clear will of the Greek people.<\/p> <p>  The vision and focus of the work plan are a disappointment.  The plan is high on rhetoric, but with regard to specifics for countries such as Ireland, there is only one mention of agriculture and we know how important it is to the country.  Much store is given to the Juncker investment package.  As Ms Nolan and everybody else has acknowledged at this stage, there are as many unanswered questions as there are answered questions with regard to how the investment package will operate and what it will mean in new money being invested in job creation stimuli in member states.  There is a fear that it could prove to be a three-card trick with money being taken from one pot and put into another and given a different name.<\/p> <p>  This week Mr. Werner Hoyer, head of the European Investment Bank, was before the European Parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee, of which I am a member.  I asked him what safeguards would be put in place in administering the package if the funding was put in place to ensure those regions and states which need investment the most, in which I include Ireland as it has suffered as a result of an austerity agenda and economic stagnation, secure the fair share they require.  Unfortunately, I do not think the European Investment Bank knows.  There are many questions left to be answered.<\/p> <p>  As a new Member of the European Parliament, I have been struck by the ongoing references from people across the political spectrum to financial sovereignty, particularly taxation sovereignty.  At every opportunity certain interests in all of the political groupings speak about the need for tax harmonisation and to develop European own resources, addressing an agenda to undermine the fiscal sovereignty of member states.  We in Ireland can all agree politically on how precious is our financial and taxation sovereignty.  Of course, there needs to be transparency throughout member states on how taxes are collected, but we cannot allow our fiscal sovereignty to be threatened.  I ask the committee to be particularly vigilant of measures from the European Union in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The TTIP has been my research priority since I became a Member of the European Parliament.  I am glad to see that committee members are taking an active interest in it because until recently I feared not enough interest, including political interest, was being shown in the issue.  The level of interest required is high, as it is a very complicated issue.  Ireland is one of the few countries which have never had an investor state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism in bilateral trade agreements.  Many countries in the European Union include it and Germany is the best example, as it has been included in many of its bilateral trade agreements since the Second World War.  Throughout the European Union fears are being expressed by governments of countries which have operated ISDS mechanisms, including the German and French Governments, about it being included in the TTIP.<\/p><p>What is unusual for a country that has not used ISDS is the fact that our Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, has signed a letter, along with 13 of his counterparts, more or less endorsing ISDS as a mechanism to be included in the TTIP talks.  To my knowledge, he did that without recourse to the Oireachtas.  That is a very worrying development.  If we are talking about European institutions undermining parliaments, there is a need to ensure the Minister engages with this Parliament as well as with the Irish public in terms of TTIP moving forward.<\/p><p> There are a number of ways one can approach TTIP.  Some in the European Parliament are opposed to TTIP no matter what, on ideological grounds.  Others are entirely supportive and want the process to be moved as speedily as possible, no matter what the costs.  There are two other areas.  One is the section within the Parliament and within the political discourse who say, \"Let's wait and see what the final negotiations are before we make a judgement on it.\"  That is a legitimate enough case.  My view is that as a country we should engage with TTIP to the highest level possible, to ensure that Ireland's interests are protected during the negotiations.  In particular, the interests of sectors that are important to us, such as agriculture, should be protected.  People will say that standards are of crucial importance, but when one is dealing with trade negotiations, two things usually come into play.  The first is tariffs.  Between the EU and the US, tariffs are relatively low across the board.  The next thing is standards.  If we want to ensure that the likes of our agriculture and food sectors are protected, we need to be engaged at this level.  I encourage the committee's vigilance and ongoing support and I look forward to an opportunity in the future to come back to discuss this matter further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012900002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Carthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422541800,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carthy for being so concise.

I will confine myself to the committees in which I am involved.  We each have two committees.  I am the only Irish member of the ITRE committee, which is on technology, research and energy, and INTA, which is on trade.<\/p> <p>  Ms Nolan outlined the stimulus package by Mr. Juncker.  On behalf of the ITRE committee, I have recently been appointed as rapporteur to produce a report for our committee on the stimulus package, which is a big role.  It is a serious role and would give Ireland an important input into it.  That should also help Ireland's cause.  It has been pointed out that this is not really about investing public money, it is about leveraging private money.  The evidence shows that Europe is awash with money and many people do not know where to invest it because the interest rates are so low.  If this can work, and based on other situations they are confident that it will, it will make a significant difference.  We will hopefully benefit as much as other countries in Europe.<\/p> <p>  I have been involved with the digital Single Market over the last few years because I was rapporteur for the data protection regulation.  We made our report and it was passed less than a year ago.  We are now waiting for the Council to finalise its arrangements.  When that is done, we will go into trilogue.  We hope to have that done by the end of this year, which will help in the area of certainty, legally in particular, in relation to the Single Market.  There are great opportunities there.  The benefit of Europe is a Single Market and now the emphasis is being put on the digital Single Market, which is of major importance, especially in trying to grow businesses and the development of trade online, etc.  There is a great deal there which will hopefully be completed.<\/p> <p>  The new Commission is taking a practical approach in two ways.  First is the way the President of the Commission has constructed his Commissioners.  It would not be beneficial to have 28 doing their own thing, breaking them up into little silos, with a vice-president in charge.  Bringing forward less legislation also seems to be eminently practical, giving credence to the oft-quoted necessity of recognising the principle of subsidiarity, only to do in Europe what must be done in Europe.  That is why we will probably see less but more effective legislation over the next few years.  The banking union has been a great success.  Not enough credit has been given for it.  As was pointed out, the stress tests have been done and most banks are now operating under particular rules, so the chances of them going bust are greatly reduced and the taxpayer will not have to pick up the bill at the end of the day.  That should be beneficial as we move forward.<\/p> <p>  The other area in the ITRE committee is energy.  That is a big area.  The Russian situation has focused minds in Europe on the need to diversify supply and to get security of supply.  Many things will happen in that regard over the next few years.  That is very important for Ireland.  I have a great deal to do with it, both in terms of looking at how it can be done and creating connectivity.  If we had the money, we would have interconnectors both for energy and for electricity right across Europe.  It will happen some day.  Part of that investment programme that President Juncker is talking about would be great, particularly for an island nation like ours.  <\/p> <p>  TTIP has been mentioned.  I am in favour of TTIP until I see the final package.  It is a huge opportunity and we should not stop that opportunity from being explored.  People have been talking about transparency, and rightly so, but there is more transparency in TTIP than in any other trade discussion we have had, and we will continue to be more transparent.  It is a bit like CAP in the last legislature.  It was CAP, CAP, CAP, CAP, CAP.  Now it is all about TTIP.  The chances of anything getting under the radar unscrutinised are very little.  Huge movements have been made on the ISDS.  That is a good thing.  I am the rapporteur for the free trade agreement with Singapore.  That is almost finalised.  It will be a great opportunity for Ireland because it will lead to other free trade agreements with the other ASEAN countries, which have about 500 million people between them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012900002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1422541800,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly.

Before I get into the details of Mr. Juncker's work plan and its relevance to those committees, one of the things that particularly worries me about the work plan is the lobby register.  We were promised by Jean-Claude Juncker and Mr. Timmermans that we would have a mandatory lobbying register.  What we have got in this work plan falls far short of that.  It does not address the main issues of concern, namely, mandatory disclosure and the implementation of binding sanctions if a company that is lobbying does not disclose properly.  For example, Goldman Sachs, the largest world investment bank, declared in 2013 that it spent &euro;50,000 on lobbying in the European Union.  This is the largest world investment bank.  The same bank in America, where they have very strict disclosure methods, claimed it spent $3.6 million on lobbying activities.  There is clearly a discrepancy and what Jean-Claude Juncker has done with this lobby register goes nowhere near addressing that issue.  We need to deal with that because there is a lack of trust among people across Europe in how the European Union does its business, particularly around the Commission and around transparency.<\/p><p>It was a real opportunity which, unfortunately, has been missed.  <\/p><p> Another issue of concern about the work plan is the sunset clause in the maternity directive.  It was a proposal which sought to extend maternity leave to 20 weeks, something any woman of child-rearing age would welcome.  I do not understand why it has stalled at the Council.  It was openly stated that if something could not be agreed within six months at the Council, it would be taken off the table.  A member state opposed to legislation would then oppose and delay it for six months in order that it would be withdrawn.  I do not understand the logic behind this.<\/p><p> With regard to environmental protection, from the very beginning of Jean-Claude Juncker's term we have seen that he has no regard for environmental regulation.  For example, no Commissioner has been given responsibility for the issue of sustainable development and in the merging of energy and climate change issues in one portfolio it has certainly been watered down.  I refer to the fact that the Commissioner appointed to this role and his family have very public links with oil companies.  I do not think this bodes well in dealing with climate change and energy matters.  <\/p><p> The circular economy package which deals with recycling and the reuse of raw materials is being dropped.  It was estimated that it would lead to the creation of thousands of jobs - up to 180,000 across the European Union - and that it would also save the European Union billions of euro, but it has now been dropped.  This contradicts Jean-Claude Juncker's stated priorities to boost job creation and growth in Europe.  It is a case of short-term business interests being unwilling to adapt and being put before the long-term public interest.  I am deeply disappointed that this package has been removed from the work plan.<\/p><p> With regard to employment and social affairs, I am pleased that Deputy Byrne has raised the issue of youth unemployment.  When Jean-Claude Juncker addressed the European Parliament, he spoke about channelling a significant proportion of the investment plan into projects to get the younger generation back to work.  This will be welcomed, particularly in Ireland and other countries in bailout programmes where young people have borne the brunt of a crisis that was not of their making.  I draw the attention of the committee to the youth guarantee.  It is no secret that I was very vocal about it when it was introduced because I thought it was under-funded.  That remains my view.  There are glaring omissions such as how it will deal the lack of facilities for people with disabilities and lone parents.  It is interesting to note that since the pilot programme was begun in Ballymun, a report has been undertaken by the European trade union syndicate on the roll-out of the youth guarantee across Europe.  There are concerns in member states about its roll-out.  I draw the attention of members to some of the aspects of the Irish model highlighted.  I encourage the Government to reflect on and address these criticisms and make an effort to adapt the youth guarantee.  <\/p><p> One of the issues highlighted was raising the participation age to 30 years for those who wished to access the youth guarantee programme.  Jean-Claude Juncker has said he is open to this idea, which is welcome.  I, therefore, encourage the Government to extend the participation age to 30 years.  I flag that the Government stated it did not consider precarious work to be a serious issue.  It is.  <\/p><p> I refer to Ireland's record on the issue of low-paid jobs.  The report by the European trade union syndicate flagged that the work contracts being offered to young people were bad and that interns were displacing jobs.  If the Government proposes to roll out the youth guarantee on a national basis, I suggest it takes on board these concerns.  The report also flagged the rapid decline in the number of apprenticeships.  I ask the Government to take this finding on board for the sake of young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012900002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Lynn Boylan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422541800,"counter":608,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend.  I also thank Ms Barbara Nolan for her presentation.  <\/p> <p>  I am a member of the agriculture and the environment committees and a vice chair of the European Parliament, in which role I deal with the issue of communications, or at least I try to.  It is something that, at some stage, might be a subject for discussion between the two parliaments - how we communicate as parliamentarians.  It is an issue about how we explain the work we do.  It has been said to me that people do not know what we do.  I often say people do not know what happens in the county council chamber.  How we communicate is an issue for politics.  This is an open invitation to committee members to have a discussion on communications.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the approach taken in the work programme in that less is more.  I am now a lifer in the European Parliament, in that I have served two terms, with the second mandate being about fire-fighting and writing more legislation than was humanely possible.  We have had our fill of legislation.  We need effective implementation; we also need feedback on where regulations and legislation are ineffective or excessive and then get rid of them.  I agree with the Commission's general approach.  <\/p> <p>  On the investment programme, I get the impression from the conversation not just here but also elsewhere that it is included in the Commission's plan.  There is a great responsibility on member states to suggest projects that can receive funding.  This is an invitation to the 28 countries to come up with good ideas and funding will be made available.  That is the challenge for Ireland and all other member states.  The projects and programmes will succeed or fail, depending on what the member states can devise.  <\/p> <p>  The third point is that there is no magic money available.  In discussions around Europe the question that is most frequently asked of our colleagues - members will echo this - is whether funding is available for projects.  I was present for the last budget discussions, but the tragedy is that there is little or no willingness among the member states - we get more than we give - to increase their contributions; there are net contributors that state: \"Thus far and no more\".  Many countries want to pull back in their funding for the European Union.  I suggest the committee discuss at a future meeting the review of the overall budget, how money is collected, who contributes and how we might put it on a sounder footing.  The subject of own resources is part of that discussion and should not be ignored, as we need to look at all options.  Having a strong centrally funded European budget is very important to ensure solidarity between member states.  I hope greater solidarity might emerge out of the crisis, as well as a strengthening of the budget.<\/p> <p>  There is not a great deal said about agriculture because there should be no need to do so.  What there should be is a CAP reform implementation plan, as well as the roll-out of the rural development programme which, from an Irish perspective, is of huge importance and eagerly awaited.  We are happy that we will receive a letter of comfort from Commissioner Hogan, in particular, on the roll-out of the agri-environment scheme.  There is a problem in rural areas generally of underinvestment.  While there is recovery in Dublin, it needs to filter into rural communities.  The rural development programme is part of this, but so too is the roll-out of broadband and other measures that have been mentioned.  These are very important aspects which should be kept in mind.<\/p> <p>  I do not share the concern about secrecy and transparency with regard to the TTIP.  If I may be forgiven for saying so, it is overdiscussed.  Perhaps people do not read enough of what is available on the web on which there is a wide range of material available.  My approach to negotiations is that Ireland is a trading nation; we export more goods and services than we can consume.  The Commission will be leading the negotiations.  I would like our negotiators to look for opportunities for the European Union and be aware of the threats posed.  In the agriculture sector there are opportunities and threats.  On the dairy side, we are seeking benefits, while the beef sector has concerns.  It is a question of what is in the detail of any potential deal on which my colleagues and I in the European Parliament will have a say.  We must be mindful of the concerns expressed.  It is welcome that the committee will discuss the issue.<\/p> <p>  This year in the European Union the focus is on development.  In this regard it will focus on the issues of labour and migration.  We should mention this for two reasons.  There is the horror where people leave their home countries in Africa and risk life and limb and even give birth in the waters of the Mediterranean as they flee conflict or desperate circumstances or because of a lack of hope.  However, the European Union is not coping particularly well in dealing with this problem.<\/p><p>It is in our interests as a Union to ensure we develop their economies and give them some hope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012900002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422541800,"counter":610,"content":"<p>Thank you, and I thank all our guests for being so concise.

To what extent do the witnesses see in both European and member state policy the move towards carbon reduction without dramatically affecting the economic output of the country?  In some countries this relates to agricultural output, and some more urbanised nations may find it easy to suggest making sacrifices in the agricultural and food-producing sectors.  National economies would be dramatically affected.  What is the favourite policy throughout Europe, as that will affect us all?  We will find consequences flowing from that which will affect us.  If carbon reductions are not achieved, fines will follow and there will be a need to purchase carbon credits to meet guidelines that have already been laid down or even more stringent guidelines that may well be laid down by the international community.

In private session we spoke about the work plan and I mentioned the importance of development on our committee agenda.  There was some discussion about issues being European or foreign affairs; it flows from one to the other.  We are a big investor and there are major changes across the world.  Anybody who has gone on the trips organised by Irish Aid would be really impressed by the work being done.  There is always criticism of multilateral aid and there may not be the same scrutiny of where that money is being spent.  It is important for this or any committee to discuss that issue as people are disconnected and worried about where money is being spent.  People have heard about corruption and so on, which means they want their MEPs and parliamentarians to ask the right questions, particularly if they are suffering.  Anywhere we go, we must point out the sacrifices being made by Irish people in trying to invest in other countries.  Many of these countries have major resources and potential.  That potential can go to a small elite or be used to develop the country for the better.<\/p> <p>  There was a discussion about migration and we discussed it with High Commissioner Mogherini.  There is the idea of the impact of north and south and I do not agree that we have a sense in our country of the impact of immigration.  The MEPs might pick that up more in Europe.  It is not unusual for boats to have 4,000 or 5,000 on them, and they may sink off coasts, with hundreds of people dying.  There is a desperate desire of people to go to Europe to work legally.  We do not have a common approach.  I was recently in the Canaries and I saw a story on the front page of the newspaper detailing how a boat had come from Africa but the poor people on it had been kept on the beach for nine hours after the boat was set on fire.  There were tourists on the beach watching this.  It is only an example.  In Fuerteventura one can see clothes on the beach.  I am thankful that we have not had that problem in Ireland of people dying on our shores, but other countries in the EU or on the edge have it.

As regards my remarks on Greece, I was not suggesting for a second that we have to agree with every decision the Greek Government makes.  The best, and ultimate, judges of those decisions are the Greek people.  That is the point I was making.<\/p> <p>  As regards Europe's role as a strong global actor, our position is well documented.  We believe that countries like Ireland should have an independent foreign policy.  We have a place in the world and our international image is a credit to successive Governments.  That includes having a positive role to play in ending international conflicts, as well as promoting international development.  However, that role has been undermined in recent years as a result of Europe's role as a strong global actor.  Probably the greatest example of that was the Government's scandalous, shameful and embarrassing decision to abstain from voting on a UN Human Rights Council resolution concerning the attack on Gaza last summer.  We rowed in behind the European policy of sitting on our hands on a motion that simply called for an investigation into the Israeli actions in Gaza during what was a terrible siege for the people there.<\/p> <p>  There are times when Europe needs to speak as a single voice, such as in response to the recent atrocities in Paris.

It should go into the negotiations in Paris with a strong position and not be prepared to back down.  We can lead the way in terms of renewables and the green economy.<\/p> <p>  The European Investment Bank is currently having a public consultation on green jobs.  There are huge opportunities for addressing energy needs, including renewables.  I would encourage Ireland to play a strong role in that regard.

This is encouraging polluters to pollute, instead of getting them to change their practices, which we need to do.  <\/p> <p>  In dealing with climate change, rather than trying to react and meeting businesses that are resistant to change, we should be leading the way with research and development innovation.  We should not adopt a conservative approach in trying to offset emissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012900002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Lynn Boylan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422541800,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I will start at the end and pick up a point that my colleague, Mr. Matt Carthy MEP, mentioned about the all-Ireland approach.

Forced adoptions in EU member states - some close to us - constitute an issue that has only come to my attention recently.

Efficiency is an area on which we must work.  I would like to see a calmer debate on energy in Ireland, which is more focused on the future.  Tragically, the energy debate rests on infrastructure, pylons, wind farms and upsetting rural communities.  It is not about the big project which is an interconnected grid.  Some Oireachtas committee should start to lead that debate which needs to take place.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy's concerns for carbon reduction in agriculture are well made.  They have been met by the statement which the Taoiseach stitched into the Council's proceedings whereby the food security issue is being taken into account. <\/p> <p>  With regard to Europe being a strong global player, I disagree with Mr. Matt Carthy, MEP, in so far as sometimes we have to pick and choose.  However, it is too big an area in which to say: \"We're grand on our own, but at other times we can be with you.\"  Of course, we need to be conscious of Irish concerns but Europe has a strong role to play as the European Union.  It can be much more effective if it works as a union.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about what happened when Greece withdrew its name on the Russian issue that Deputy Eric Byrne raised.  In addition, the Greek election was mentioned.  As with every member state that holds an election, we welcome the new government to the table.

I express my deep personal gratitude for the opportunity to present my key findings to the committee this morning.  I do not intend to go through the detailed recommendations.  I intend to stay within the ten minutes allocated me, to afford members the opportunity to put any questions they might have on the detail of the report.<\/p><p>As I was recently appointed as the founding patron of the Children's Rights Alliance, my first official task in that role might very well be to endorse the Chairman&rsquo;s comments.<\/p><p> My seventh report on child protection identified several outstanding issues that need to be addressed in this area.  These included how the best interests principle should be a core part of our legislative framework.  Direct provision is an issue which I have raised with this committee on every occasion I have attended it.  I continue to advocate on the need to address what I would describe as a potential breach not only of domestic but of international law in this area.  The Child Care Act 1991 is over two decades old and it is time to review it.  During the year, I met with all key stakeholders including members of the Judiciary and the President of the District Court has now published judgments in the area.  This gives us a unique opportunity to examine some of the gaps in the child protection legislative framework.  Internet safety of children is a key issue which I have also raised every year.  We need to be ahead of the curve on this matter.  A gap was identified in our laws concerning forced marriages in a judgment of Mr. Justice John Mac Menamin in 2013 which needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> A very significant year for child protection was 2012 with the passing of the constitutional referendum on the rights of the child.  As part of that, we signed up to ensuring the best interests principle will become part of our domestic law in child protection.  There are three core aspects to how best interests principles are implemented.  First, it is a substantive right.  Second, it is a fundamental and interpretive legal principle.  Third, it is a rule of procedure.  We need to ensure that this is just not an aspiration but is included in all of our laws and administrative processes in the area of child protection.<\/p><p> The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is the standard-setter in protecting the rights of the child.  It has four core principles.  First, non-discrimination, as set out in Article 2.  Second, the best interests principle, as set out in Article 3.  Third, Article 6 is dedicated to life survival and development.  Fourth, the voice of the child, as reflected in Article 12.  There are other core provisions of the convention of which we need to be aware.  The rights of parents are important and need to be considered when legislating for the rights of children, as set out in Article 5.  We have had a national debate around the needs to ensure the right to identity is reflected in our laws, as clearly reflected in Articles 7 and 8.  There is also the right of children and parents to have access to each other when relationships break down, as set out in Article 9.  Perhaps the most important right is the right of the child to be protected from harm, abuse, exploitation, violence and neglect which is reflected in article 19.  This should be the template for legislating in this area.  In approaching my report, I have attempted to reflect the principles of the convention in my recommendations.<\/p><p> This year for the first time I looked outside into other areas where I feel child protection concerns are beginning to emerge.  As I was writing my report in 2013, two key documents were issued by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  General comment No. 14 gives us an insight into how to imbed the best interests principle into domestic law and expounded guidelines as to its application.  This should be a template in ensuring our laws reflect not only the substance but the spirit of Article 3 of UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The committee also released General comment No. 15 which ties into Article 24 of the convention, namely the right of the child to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health.  This is quite interesting in terms of the current concerns articulated about obesity.  The committee&rsquo;s comment referenced the World Health Organization, WHO, guidelines on childhood obesity and the need to address this issue.  It also contained an express reference to breastfeeding.  I have highlighted the issue of breastfeeding rates in this jurisdiction as the comment states there is a direct correlation between breastfeeding and lower levels of obesity citing WHO research in this area.<\/p><p> I have raised the issue of direct provision every year at this committee.  I welcome the recent establishment by the Minister for Justice and Equality of a working group to examine this issue.  I have been asked by the chair of that working group to appear before it soon.  During the week, the Department of Justice and Equality issued new figures showing there has been a decrease of 110 in the numbers in direct provision.  Now, there are up to 4,280 individuals in direct provision, a third of whom are children.  This should give us all pause for thought.  While there are 34 centres, only three of these are purpose-built.  There are large numbers of vulnerable women housed with children in the centres.  The system has been criticised by virtually every international body including the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights and the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights.  The very issue at stake here is dignity.  What we all want for our citizens is dignity.  When I was writing my report, the Northern Ireland High Court considered the case of a Sudanese family which it decided not to return to the Republic on the basis our direct provision system was not consistent with the best interests principle for children.<\/p><p> It is my considered view the direct provision system is a disproportionate response to the need to control immigration.  It is arguable it breaches Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, an international instrument to which Ireland is a signatory, and that it does not meet the right to respect for family life, not least because children do not enjoy life in a family unit but rather in a communal setting in inadequate accommodation.  We have spent an entire year on the Tuam mother and baby home issue.  I congratulate the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, for his comprehensive terms of reference for the inquiry into these homes.  However, we should not forget that poor practices of the present can be the scandals of the future.  Taking the costs of the direct provision system on mental health, child development and family life, apart from the human cost, there will be future costs on social services that yet have to be quantified.  Direct provision is an issue of which we all need to be aware.  Neither should we forget our past.  When the Irish travelled abroad to the UK in the past, we were critical of the manner in which we were treated.  Are we happy with the way we treat those who land on our shores, sometimes in a very vulnerable state?<\/p><p>I also urge the committee to add the case that Ireland opt into the recast reception conditions directive of 2013, which set a baseline for conditions in these reception centres and in asylum in general.<br\/><br\/>In terms of European developments, my report highlights a number of developments and I would just cite one of those, namely, the recommendation of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers to member states on measures to combat discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity.  This is something of which we need to be aware and must embed in our laws.<br\/><br\/>Perhaps the key recommendation in my report this year revolves around the need to review our Child Care Act.  There are more than 50 recommendations on reform of our Child Care Act.  I welcome the fact the <i>in camera<\/i>rule has been relaxed.  The legislation introduced is a sensible balancing act between the need to ensure the right to a fair, transparent and accountable system of justice and the need to protect privacy.  As I cited in my opening statement, during 2013, three cases came before the High Court, two of which were worthy of particular note.  The judgment of Mr. Justice Hogan found that the absence of the same discount in regard to remission for children in Oberstown, relative to adults, was an issue that needed to be addressed.  <br\/><br\/>The second issue highlighted a gap in our child protection system.  A case came before the High Court dealing with what is called &quot;a supervision order&quot;.  If we are looking at keeping children in families, we need to add to the tools in the toolkit.  The High Court stated that one could not attach a condition to a supervision order.  Our legislation now needs to look at providing much greater flexibility to the court.  This comes into sharp focus when one looks at the two Roma cases.  I was asked by the Ombudsman to advise her office on the Roma case.  One of the issues to emerge from that case was that perhaps there were not enough options available to those faced with this dilemma, something I will address momentarily.  <br\/><br\/>Some 20 years on, the time is ripe to look at whether our Child Care Act needs updating and it is my view that it does.  If we look at how society has changed in the intervening period, we see that there is a greater number of children arriving on our shores from other jurisdictions.  We have a protocol with the UK.  In so far as Northern Ireland is concerned, we have a very good working arrangement but that needs to be extended.  We need protocols across all member states and perhaps a more robust protocol with England and Wales, given the number of children arriving from the two jurisdictions.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the emergency powers being exercised, in particular, by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under section 12 of the Child Care Act, again, we need greater protocols and greater transparency in regard to those protocols.  That was a key feature of the two Roma cases and it is one that needs to be addressed.  I make a number of recommendations in the report on that issue.<br\/><br\/>An issue that has received very little public attention is the number of women arriving in Ireland in the late stages of pregnancy.  What seems to happen at the moment is that applications are made to the District Court when the women are in labour, which is not a civilised way to deal with this.  What I suggest is that we introduce a new order.  I characterise that as an emergency care order pre-birth, so that we give the birth mother an opportunity to put her position to the District Court.  The District Court can do this in a manner which gives that mother the opportunity to put her position.  It is about ensuring that we keep children in families rather than taking children into care system when that is not necessary.  That is a more proportionate response and it is one I would advocate.<br\/><br\/>As well as the legal issues I address in my report, there is also a need for structural reform in terms of a family court system that meets the needs of our citizens, is less adversarial and promotes alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.  I am conscious of the fact that this matter is in the programme for Government and that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, is currently looking at this issue.  However, I think both go hand-in-hand.  Legislative reform and structural reform will ensure we have a more civilised system.<br\/><br\/>I will finish on two issues, the first of which is Internet safety.  Many members will have seen the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme prior to Christmas which sent shivers down all our spines in terms of the real dangers posed by the Internet.  The fact that it is remote and anonymous seems sometimes to take away from the impact but for children, the permanence and global reach of the Internet can have profound damaging effects.  Also, there are problems in terms of bringing cases against perpetrators because it is very difficult to establish jurisdiction.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, recently published the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill and that there will be an attempt to deal with this jurisdiction issue.  <br\/><br\/>There are two aspects of that which I have raised before this committee consistently.  The first of those is the need to criminalise child pornography.  I welcome the fact that happens in this Bill.  Perhaps the recommendation with which I am most associated is the need to criminalise grooming.  I raised this recommendation in 2007 and I welcome the fact we are at last addressing it because it is hugely important that where child protection issues are addressed and are identified, we close those gaps as soon as possible.  I welcome the fact the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, proposes to do this in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill.<br\/><br\/>There are two further international instruments which I urge the State to ratify, namely, the Lanzarote and the Budapest conventions, addressing the whole area of cybercrime.  It is a new area at which we need to look.  In both Canada and Victoria, the area of voyeurism has been addressed.  We must have zero tolerance when it comes to the exploitation of our children on the Internet.<br\/><br\/>A final recommendation I make in my report touches on the need for legislation to deal with child protection and welfare concerns in circumstances where the subject of a forced marriage involves a child.  We need legislation in this area and I suggest that this gap in our legislation is closed as soon as possible.  <br\/><br\/>I am very grateful for the opportunity to present before the committee and I am happy to take any questions.  We should not lose sight of the fact that the present we are constructing is the future we want.  I thank the committee for its attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422523800,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Geoffrey Shannon.

It is an issue of human dignity.  How could it be resolved?  The Department has commissioned yet another report but the time for reports is over.  It is now time for action.  We know from the figures released last week that 58 deaths have occurred in these institutions in the past ten years of which 13 have been children under the age of five years.  That is horrific.  It is wrong that people live in these circumstances and we do not need a report to tell us that.  Dr. Shannon has the expertise in how to deal with these situations.  In his report Dr. Shannon outlines that Mr. Justice J. Stevens would not send a family back to Ireland because it was not in the best interest of the child to live in these institutions.  Members across all the political parties condemned the barbaric practices of mother and baby homes, yet in our modern democracy we are facilitating barbaric practices in direct provision centres.  Will it not be the case in 30 years' time that those who succeed us as Members of the Oireachtas will be talking about how we, the current Members, failed a vulnerable section of society?<\/p><p> Dr. Shannon speaks about the need for fundamental reform of child protection legislation.  There are in excess of 20 suggestions in his report.  In his view did the shortcomings in the legislation contribute to the Roma case?  It must have been a difficult experience for the family to have a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na knock on the door and take away their child because the child did not look like the rest of his family or bear a resemblance to them.  I do not criticise the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because in the absence of a proper protocol and clear legislation one must strike a balance in arriving at the circumstances in which to intervene to ensure that the welfare of the child is protected.  Sometimes the State and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are criticised for failing to intervene in time.  It is very important to ensure we have clear protocols in place so that the State intervenes only at the appropriate stage in child welfare.<\/p><p> The issue of Internet safety was raised.  This is a recurring theme which was addressed in previous reports.  It is welcome that legislation will be introduced to criminalise child pornography and child grooming.  I hope that will be passed by the Oireachtas this year.  We are aware of horrific instances of bullying and harassment.  We know that such incidents have led to teenagers taking their own lives.  Our legislation has not kept pace with the advances in technology.  Would Dr. Shannon consider it appropriate to update the legislation to deal clearly and explicitly with cyberbullying and have penalties that are a clear and strong deterrent to the perpetrators of such a heinous crime?  At present, the only person who suffers the consequences of the bullying is the person who is being bullied, not the bully.  I would welcome Dr. Shannon's opinion on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012900002#E00800","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422523800,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Shannon and I commend him on his comprehensive report.  I apologise on behalf of my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who cannot be here this morning.<\/p> <p>  The reports states that \"the best interests\" were adopted in 2012.  Has this changed the reality of the way the State agencies and the Judiciary actually work?  I wish to raise the issue of direct provision, however the figures I have from the Department of Justice and Equality differ from those of Deputy Troy.  According to these figures, 61 people living in direct provision have died since its establish in 2002 and of that number, 16 were young children under the age of five years.  This is a shocking figure and raises fundamental questions about the suitability of direct provision for women and children.  The Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs and Justice and Equality have much to answer and we need to have a serious debate on this issue in the House.  Apart from the general issue of cooking facilities and facilities in general, I am concerned about young children and women living in close proximity to adults.  Will we look back at direct provision in ten years' time and compare it with the mother and baby homes of a previous age?  I believe that will be the case.  Will Dr. Shannon outline his views on how we can address this serious issue?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Shannon mentioned the rights of the child to health services, with which we all agree.  A significant issue arises for the parents of young children with disabilities.  They have to fight tooth and nail to access basic services.  I wish to pay particular attention to children who may have multiple disabilities.  We have no cohesive pathway to services and parents are in a battle with a number of Departments to access services.  I will not mention the Disability Act 2005 because as others have pointed out in respect to accessing services, we are constantly in breach of the Act.  A lady who contacted me recently had a very premature baby, who survived.  She highlighted that the State, at significant cost, helped her baby to progress to the age of two years but then she hit a brick wall because he needed numerous services.  She had a consultation on the speech and language therapies he needed but was told that the service would not be available for nine months as the person was on maternity leave and nobody else was trained in that area.  After all the effort made for such children to survive, no cohesive service is available for them.  We need to try to progress services in a cohesive way so that parents can access all the services required.  Parents find it very difficult to get an early diagnosis of autism.  They face months waiting to get a diagnosis of the child's condition.  We need to reduce the waiting period for a diagnosis because early intervention is so important.  <\/p> <p>  In other jurisdictions the social workers dealing with child protection work from the police station and work hand-in-hand with police officers.<\/p><p>It is a very good way to work.  It would not be practical in all areas of the country but in particular it could be used in city areas where cases are considered together.  What are Dr. Shannon's views on that?  <\/p><p> The Minister made comments last week about access to drugs on the part of children in care.

I may be slightly biased in saying that it is an outstanding organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012900002#G00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1422523800,"counter":645,"content":"<p>It is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012900002#G00300","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1422523800,"counter":646,"content":"<p>Dr. Shannon's appointment is well deserved and the alliance has made a superb choice.<\/p> <p>  My first question is more general.  I received a commitment last year from the former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, that the Government would look at Dr. Shannon's different reports - I feel sometimes he is reporting on an issue again and again - and look to carry out some implementation plan so that we as legislators would know what different Departments felt about the proposals made in his reports, such as whether they were viable or feasible and whether they were intended or planned.  Has Dr. Shannon had any contact with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or its Minister with regard to ensuring not just that we get a report from him, which is invaluable but that we can see how we could progress and track it and bring about change?  I will limit myself to a few specific areas.  Each area of Dr. Shannon's report warrants a hearing in itself.<\/p> <p>  In respect of direct provision, I support Dr. Shannon in respect of the recast reception conditions directive.  The right to work is very important for family life and is critical in respect of role models for children.  Dr. Shannon mentioned the work of the working group at the Department of Justice and Equality.  I realise that this process is ongoing.  However, I do not accept there is any barrier as to why the Minister for Justice and Equality cannot bring in the independent complaints mechanism and why we must await the outcome of a working group report.  Dr. Shannon has recommended having an independent complaints mechanism on several occasions in his reports.  We brought it in through legislation in the Child and Family Agency Act, which has the Ombudsman for Children as that mechanism.  Is there any reason why this delay exists?  It unacceptable at this stage that we do not have this mechanism in place.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that Dr. Shannon has again raised the issue of forced marriages.  It was on foot of his report that I put forward a motion with Senator Ivana Bacik on child marriage in June 2014 because I was alarmed in respect of the High Court ruling about the 29-year-old and the 16-year-old.  For me, child marriage is socially licensed sexual abuse and amounts to exploitation of children.  It reprehensible that Ireland allows it to happen.  We allowed 28 applications in 2012.  Does Dr. Shannon believe there is any reason we should keep the exemption in place to allow this?  I do not see a reason in this day and age given our understanding of childhood.  <\/p> <p>  I note what Dr. Shannon said about grooming and the measures proposed are well overdue.  As Dr. Shannon said, he raised it in his first report in 2007 so we should take that on board along with the recommendations he made relating to the Child Care Act.  They are wide and varied and could have huge ramifications that would be positive for child care now that we know more about what is happening in the courts, as Dr. Shannon noted.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of the forthcoming child and family relationships Bill, I am of the opinion that Dr. Shannon has been misquoted.  Perhaps I have misunderstood but I hear many people saying that he has said that marriage is the gold standard for families.  I believe they have deliberately misinterpreted and misrepresented him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012900002#G00400","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1422523800,"counter":647,"content":"<p>I remind Senator van Turnhout that we are discussing the seventh report of the special rapporteur on child protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012900002#G00500","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1422523800,"counter":648,"content":"<p>I know but I have the special rapporteur in front of me and given the forthcoming legislation on children and families, I would like to make sure that I understand what was meant by that comment because I believe it has been repeatedly misrepresented.<\/p> <p>  My final point relates to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.

I am conscious that we are awaiting a Supreme Court decision on the Thirty-first Amendment of the Constitution, which will bring in some of the language of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  I am also very conscious that Dr. Shannon's reports were begun during the last periodic review of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child so he has had that period to consider  matters since our last hearing.

In respect of care orders and the birth of the child, is there any analysis as to the number of children being born where there is clear evidence that the mother is using drugs?  I remember how in the 1990s, the figures I got from one hospital showed that in any one day, ten babies were suffering from withdrawal symptoms.  That did not mean there were ten babies being born every day but that the number of days a person has withdrawal symptoms goes on for a period of time.  Have we any up-to-date data on the numbers we are talking about?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Shannon talks about a pre-birth order.  If we are going down that road, there should be serious consultation with the medical profession.  I recently spoke to three or four medical consultants who deal with this area.  They spoke to me about cases involving people involved in substance misuse who failed to attend clinics, which makes the work that much more difficult from the consultants' perspective.  In one case, there was a co-ordinated effort between social services, the medical profession and the Garda where the Garda brought the person to the clinic each week or month.  It was a co-ordinated effort to make sure the person and the baby were looked after.  After the baby was born, an application for a care order had to be made.  If care orders are applied for before the birth, that may have consequences regarding how to get the person to attend clinics and all the work that must be done before the birth.  If we are going down that road, before we decide on that issue, there should be serious consultation with the people working in the medical services on this issue.<\/p> <p>  One frightening aspect is that previously this was very much a Dublin problem.  Now it is a problem in all 19 public maternity units around the country.  It is a growing problem that is not going away.<\/p><p>That is why I am asking about the need for research and more up-to-date data in this area, so that we can see the extent of the problem.<\/p><p> Another issue also arises.  If the person expecting the child already has children who appear to be coping well, is there not a difficulty for a care order to be justified in that situation?  Those are some of the issues that will arise, so perhaps Dr. Shannon could deal with them in light of his own experience.  We have not faced up to this issue in recent years, but it is now coming more and more to the fore so we need to start planning for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012900002#G01300","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422523800,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Shannon for being here.  I would remind Deputy Troy that Fianna F&aacute;il was in government for over 30 years since the foundation of the State, yet the current Government was the first to create a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in Cabinet.  This Government was also the first to address the Magdalen laundry issue.  The Deputy should therefore consider what he is saying here.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions.  In what way does Dr. Shannon think obesity can be addressed through education in schools?  Does he believe in pre-natal care and that enough promotion is given to mothers to breast-feed?  If not, why not?  What does he think needs to be done in this regard?<\/p> <p>  As adults we eat what we like, but children do not.  They eat what is put in the shopping basket or supermarket trolley, and then provided for them at home.  The grocery sector is very commercial at the moment.  One can buy a bag of carrots for 49 cent compared to a tin of carrots for &euro;1.79.  The whole process of preparing food is a turn-off for some parents, but home-cooking can make a huge difference in children's lives.  There is a great opportunity for children to be fed well in this country.  <\/p> <p>  At the opposite end of the scale we once had a presentation here about food.  I was struck by the fact that the person giving the presentation said people should eat more fish.  However, it can cost &euro;7 to purchase a fish.  Many people are not in a position to buy fish for their children.  Poultry is one of the biggest selling foods around the world, including this country.  As an island nation, there are plenty of fish around.  The price of fish in supermarkets is astronomical, yet we are asking people on very low incomes to feed their children properly.  Hopefully, however, things are changing.  <\/p> <p>  I wish to comment on breast-feeding.  I have three grandchildren who were born in the last four years.  I never breast-fed any of my children and never felt the need to do so.  They all turned out healthy.  Some of them are fanatical about their health while others, like me, can put on a bit of weight and lose it again.  I often asked them why breast-feeding turns them off.  One of them recently said to me, \"Mam, when I look at the television and see poor children in some countries hanging out of those withered breasts, it turns me off\".  I believe that is down to our psyche.  It comes from a religious upbringing in this country and the requirement to behave modestly.  We need to change our attitude towards young people.  When one goes into a caf&eacute; in town to have a cup of tea, one might see a poor girl breast-feeding with a blanket over her child's head.  It is ridiculous carry on.<\/p> <p>  I thank Dr. Shannon for his presentation.  It is always interesting when he comes before this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012900002#H00200","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1422523800,"counter":658,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Shannon for his presentation.  He mentioned a review of the Child Care Act.  I wish to ask about the involuntary admission of children to mental health treatment.  According to our Constitution a child is a person under 18 years of age.  I can understand young children being admitted for such treatment involuntarily, but are teenagers with difficulties consulted regarding involuntary admission?  If so, what level of consultation takes place?  We refer to mental health services for children and adolescents but there is no such thing as adolescence unless one goes over 18, if one wants to call them adolescents.  Legally, anyone under 18 is a child.<\/p> <p>  We have been concerned for a number of years about mental health services for children.  Some improvement has taken place but it is coming from a low base.  Children are still being admitted to adult psychiatric institutions, which is a matter of concern years after an all-party commitment was made to ensure it would not happen.<\/p> <p>  Has Dr. Shannon examined the area of cyberbullying, which is much misunderstood?  The media will label everything as cyberbullying but in the cases I have examined, cyberbullying had very little to do with it.  That is because there was a history of serious mental illness concerning children as young as six who later took their lives aged 13, 14 or 15, yet somebody signed off on it as being the result of cyberbullying.  It is a real issue but we do not have a handle on it.  Can we get a handle on it?  How does one undertake research in that area?  We can all say we must do something about it, but if we do not know the extent, limitations or the issues involved, what can we do?  What is Dr. Shannon's experience in that regard?

I am grateful for the questions, which I could spend all day responding to because they are so rich in terms of the issues they raise.  I will start with Deputy Troy's questions about the implementation plan.  Of course, I would like to see an implementation plan concerning my recommendations; that goes without saying.  Anybody who writes a report always likes to see it implemented.  I am reassured that many of the recommendations I have suggested in the past are reflected in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, as published.  The concerns I had about child trafficking are captured to a certain extent, in addition to child pornography, grooming and jurisdictional issues.<\/p> <p>  There is merit in having an annual review of recommendations.  As regards how I came up with these recommendations, I engaged in extensive consultations for my report.  It comes back to a question raised by Senator Colm Burke.  With regard to the emergency care order pre-birth, I consulted widely on that issue in gathering data.  I consulted with members of the Judiciary on cases coming before the courts, not only in the Dublin area but also outside it.  The Deputy's question is a legitimate one and I will come back and deal with it specifically.  I consult all the stakeholders and then look at the issues.  I try to frame a recommendation that reflects international best practice on the issue raised.<\/p> <p>  I am profoundly concerned about direct provision.  It would be disingenuous of me, as an independent expert, not to articulate that view.  Earlier this morning, I articulated the issues surrounding that.  These practices have the potential to become the subject of tribunals in the future.<\/p><p>I welcome the establishment of the working group and I also welcome the opportunity to present my views to the group.  What I present to the committee this morning is my considered view as to why I believe that the practice, while it may be cost-effective in the interim, in the long run it may end up costing the State significantly.  I refer to the commission of investigation into the Tuam mother and baby home.  The Minister is to be commended that &euro;21 million expenditure has been allocated because it will be a robust system.  However, what we should be trying to do is to ensure that this will be the commission of all commissions and that it should be the last commission.  I would much prefer to see money invested in the protection of children in the future rather than on an historic inquiry.  We are storing up trouble for the future in the case of the direct provision system.  That is how I would characterise it and I do not need to add anything further.<br\/><br\/>I refer to Deputy Troy's question about the Child Care Act<b><\/b>in light of the Roma cases.  Undoubtedly, the lack of clarity around the protocols did act as a catalyst for at least one of those cases.  The public need to be reassured in the aftermath of the Roma cases.  As a citizen listening to the media commentary one would be left with the impression that the agents of the State, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, took these kids into care without due consideration.  In my view they did so for all the right reasons.  We heard reference to the fact that they may very well have been criticised if they did not take these children into the care system.  We need to publish protocols and to make them available in a manner that is understandable to the public so the public knows when these provisions will be activated.  I make a number of further recommendations in my report which I urge should be implemented.<br\/><br\/>I do not intend getting involved in the politics of alcohol but my recommendations on alcohol have not been ambivalent.  Norah Gibbons and I chaired the review into the deaths of 196 children in the care system.  One finding that stood out is the failure on the part of society to comprehensively address the alcohol problem leaves the State services dealing with an insurmountable problem.  We cannot have an ambivalent approach when it comes to alcohol or alcohol-sponsorship, particularly in the area of sport.  For example, I was struck by what Deputy Byrne said and I agree completely with her in terms of breast-feeding in that it is a case of how it is portrayed.  If we link alcohol to the advertising, children get the impression that this is something trendy.  This is my concern.  I am aware of the fact that there will be trade-offs.  I say this from the position that I do not have to make those difficult decisions but I reiterate what I said to the committee last year.<br\/><br\/>On the question about Internet safety and the issue of bullying, I will link this question to Deputy Neville's question.  I addressed Deputy Neville in my last year's report when I made a comprehensive submission to this committee on cyberbullying.  I referenced the fact that mental health issues arise and that it is not a straightforward issue. None the less, I said that, in my view, the law had not kept pace with technology in the general area of Internet safety.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, has introduced comprehensive legislation on sexual offences. <br\/><br\/>Cyberbullying is a problem.  I was asked last year to speak at a conference on this issue organised as part of the Greek Presidency.  This problem is not confined to this jurisdiction and it exists elsewhere.  We need to look at how we respond to it.  I refer to some very good research on the subject.  I have suggested that homophobic bullying needs to be tackled with a zero tolerance approach.  We have seen in the media in recent hours that it is a societal issue.  I refer to the extraordinary work done by BeLonG To and GLEN in addressing this issue which society must deal with.  I agree with Deputy Neville that cyberbullying may be part of a broader problem.  I agree with Deputy Troy that it needs a legislative response.<br\/><br\/>Deputy McLellan asked how has the best-interest principle been implemented following the referendum.  The referendum result has yet to be ratified.  The legislation emerging post the ratification of the referendum has reflected that principle.  I wish to put on the record that there has been a lot of misinformation in the aftermath of the publication of the children and family relationships Bill.  I suggest that as part of the three legislative consultation processes that two separate drafts have been put into the public domain so there has been wide consultation.  Some people are saying that this legislation will be rushed.  The legislation has had two airings already and it is commendable that the first draft was significantly changed in the redrafting into which was added the right to identity in the donor-conceived register.  That is the advantage of having a pre-legislative consultation process.  I refer to a very progressive provision in the Children and Family Relationships Bill.  Head 34, as it was, addresses the best-interest principle in a pervasive type of fashion so this is being reflected in our law and it will be very positive once it has constitutional standing.<br\/><br\/>I share passionately all Deputy McLellan's views on direct provision.  Few people who have worked in this area believe it is satisfactory.  I share the Deputy's views on the need for supports for those with a disability.  This issue ties in, to a certain extent, with the recommendations that I make on the Child Care Act.  I refer to those parents who find themselves unable to cope and because they are unable to cope, their children may end up in the care system.  It is not just a question of support but rather targeted support to meet the needs of adults.  That is what we need to examine.  Too often in the past, our approach has been to throw money at an issue when, in fact, a more targeted approach would generate much greater returns.  <br\/><br\/>I also agree with Deputy McLellan's view on the need for a greater link between the agencies.  She suggested we look at other models.  I have examined many models, including the Australian and New Zealand models.  This also ties in with my recommendation for structural reform as well as legislative reform.  It is not just about legislation, which is only one part of the issue.<br\/><br\/>I agree with Senator van Turnhout that we need robust, independent oversight of the direct provision system.  There is a counter-argument that these children are really not in State care.  I would passionately say that these children do not enjoy life in a family unit.  It is exactly what Deputy McLellan said, that vulnerable women and children are in close proximity to other individuals, the type of individuals whom we would vet if given the opportunity.  I suggest that there should be an independent complaints mechanism, whatever shape that takes.<br\/><br\/>Senator van Turnhout also asked about my views on marriage, which have been grossly misrepresented.  A number of years ago I put together a piece in which I had described marriage as the gold standard but I mentioned it in the context of that institution as being available to all citizens.  I see it as being manipulated by some people and I do not intend to include it in today's discussion.  However, it is important to clarify that point for the record.<\/p><p>A great deal of progress has been made.  We need to be fair and objective.  I refer, for example, to the establishment of a separate Minister with responsibility for this issue.  We have also had a referendum on the rights of the child.  However, much work remains to be done.  It would be disingenuous of us if we were not to acknowledge the fact that progress has been made.  When we make progress, it is important that we should acknowledge that fact.  The next big body of work relates to the Child Care Act.  The latter is our fundamental instrument of child protection and in my opinion it is in need of significant updating.<\/p><p> Senator Colm Burke posed a really good question.  Just to explain, this is not a recommendation which occurred to me overnight.  It is one which I framed having discussed matters with many of the key stakeholders involved.  I do not have to hand the statistics the Senator is seeking but I agree that it is important to gather the relevant data.  If the Senator is asking why I made the recommendation in question, the answer is that I am of the view that we need a proportionate response to a child protection issue that is likely to emerge.  I happen to think that it is not proportionate to seek to take a child into care where a mother is in labour.  That is my view.  When I started examining this issue, I discovered it is becoming much more prevalent.  It needs to be addressed, taking into account all of the caveats the Senator highlighted.  I am of the view that what I propose is much more proportionate response.  The birth mother will, at least, have the opportunity to respond and to defend her situation when she is not in a hospital bed.  That is why I am suggesting this may be a better way of dealing with the matter and taking into consideration all of the caveats the Senator outlined.  I agree with everything he said - which is legitimate - but I am suggesting that this is probably a more proportionate response to the child protection issue that is emerging.  I agree that further work needs to be done on this matter.<\/p><p> I passionately share Deputy Catherine Byrne's views on LGBT children.  I have had the absolute pleasure of working with BeLonGTo.  When I was compiling my report last year, I spent a great deal of time considering the issues with BeLonGTo.  By working with such an organisation, one obtains an appreciation of what are the issues.  I also travelled internationally to discover whether there are other models in operation.  I spent a great deal of time in connection with my report for last year looking at the discrete issue.  I am really concerned that some schools should be aware of the fact that all children should be treated equally, regardless of their sexual orientation.  There is much to be done yet on this front, particularly in terms of education.  Many children will be aware of their sexual orientation at 12 years of age and they spend those formidable years in a school context.  The research conducted by Dublin City University, the Supporting LGBT Lives study etc., all point to the need to ensure that teachers are equipped with the necessary resources to ensure that the school environment is safe.  A child falling out of school because he or she has been bullied or targeted for bullying is really regrettable because it is not possible to get those years back.  We need to redouble our efforts in this regard.  In fairness, however, much has been done.  The publication of the report by the Department of Education and Skills on tackling this issue is a major step forward.  The current Government has been very impressive in the context of tackling this issue and is to be warmly congratulated for engaging directly in respect of it.<\/p><p> I fully agree with the Deputy in respect of prenatal care.  I wondered whether I would address this kind of topic but I felt I had to do so because as I was writing my report, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child published its general comment No. 15.  The issues the Deputy articulated so eloquently are very clearly reflected in the latter.  What struck me when I read general comment No. 15 was the referencing of the World Health Organization's research and data and the fact that there is a direct correlation between breast-feeding and lower levels of obesity.  That is quite a stark revelation.  I am of the view that there is a reluctance to tackle the advertising issue in this area.  If we are going to place children's health at the centre of our decision making, then we are going to be obliged to make some tough decisions.  This was one of the recommendations in my report which generated a great deal of debate on publication.  This meeting presents me with an opportunity to articulate why I felt it necessary to include it.<\/p><p> On Deputy Neville's question regarding involuntary admissions, I completely share his view in respect of consultation.  A great deal has already been done but a lot more must be done in the area of mental health, particularly in the context of involuntary admission.  The judgment I cited in my opening statement is very interesting in that it considers the issues the Deputy raised.  In the instance in question, the court felt that the approach adopted under section 25 of the Mental Health Act was sufficient to incorporate, in a proportionate manner, the welfare and the views of the child.<\/p><p> Those are brief responses to the questions that have been posed.  Lest there be any doubt, I wish to place on record my opinion that enormous progress has been made in so far as children's issues are concerned.  I am privileged to have the opportunity to bring these further recommendations to the committee.  My headline recommendation relates to direct provision and many members, including Senator van Turnhout and Deputy McLellan, referred to it.  I am of the view that we need to redouble our efforts on that front.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012900002#H01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422523800,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Shannon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012900002#K00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1422523800,"counter":674,"content":"<p>On the issue of care orders before birth, this is a very difficult area with which to deal.  I fully accept that Dr. Shannon has examined all aspects of it.  The big problem that will also arise is that if a care order is in place before birth, a partner who may have the same problem as the mother may intervene.  The latter can give rise to a number of difficulties for medical and nursing staff.  This is an issue which must be dealt with in a very careful manner.  Each case will have to be judged on its merits.  Nursing, medical and hospital administration staff would be very concerned by the prospect of fighting a number of battles simultaneously.  Their first priority is to ensure the safe delivery of babies and to see to it that there are no risks to such children.  If they are obliged to do this while a number of people are working against them, then matters can become difficult.

I had the opportunity to discuss this matter with people and I am of the view that it is only a matter of time before litigation arises in respect of it and that Ireland ends up before the European Court of Human Rights.  If a birth mother is lying in a hospital bed and is trying to defend proceedings, she would have a fairly decent case to argue that one's Article 8 rights had been infringed.  I accept everything Senator Colm Burke states but we need to consider a number of issues.  I do not have a fixed view about how we dealt with or characterise this matter.  However, I do have a fixed view another matter.  In the trauma and emotion which follows the birth of a child, it is more difficult for a birth mother to defend proceedings such as those to which we are referring.  I am coming at this from the point of view of considering how we might ensure that fewer children end up in our care system.  This is something to which I am passionately committed because family support sometimes ranks as a poor third to child protection and alternative care in the battle for resources and professional time.  We must ensure that we do enough at the emergency care order pre-birth hearing to clarify the position for the prospective mother.<\/p><p>If she is in a position to act responsibly, we do not have to take the child into the care system.

The Irish Airline Pilots Association represents approximately 1,200 pilots, most of whom are employed within Irish-registered airlines.  Some 500 of our members are Aer Lingus pilots who are in all five of the airline's bases at Dublin, Cork, Belfast, Heathrow and Gatwick.  We own 7% of Aer Lingus.  That is divided among a number of investment vehicles, the largest of which is our pension scheme, which currently holds 2.5% of Aer Lingus.  Some of our other shares are in an investment vehicle called Tailwind.  The rest of our shares came from the dissolution of the employee share ownership trust and from the internal share options that took place during the 1990s before Aer Lingus was floated.  Despite our position as stakeholders under various headings, neither the board of Aer Lingus nor anyone in the International Airlines Group has been in contact with us about this takeover.  We do not have any information in addition to that which is readily available to the public.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons I have set out, and based on the information that is available to us, we have formed the view that the proposed takeover is not good for our members, for the families or for many people who are engaged in aviation in Ireland.  While we have not issued any recommendation to our members at this point in time, we plan on doing so at a later stage.  I ask the committee to keep an open mind about inviting us back when we have more information as we would like an opportunity to comment after the International Airlines Group or the Minister have made their plans known.<br\/><br\/>While we agree broadly with everything in the letter that was sent to the Minister by Matt Staunton of IMPACT with regard to the takeover, we would like to ventilate some other issues that have not yet been ventilated in the public domain.  I refer, for example, to the incredible amounts of financial gain that will be enjoyed by a small number of managers within Aer Lingus if this transaction goes through.  We are also concerned that the price being offered for Aer Lingus is well underneath the asset values of the company.  This would be of huge benefit to International Airlines Group shareholders and to the disadvantage of the State and the many citizens who use Aer Lingus.  We are also concerned about how the transaction will be completed.  We are satisfied, on the basis of what we have been told by our advisers in London, that the International Airlines Group does not have the cash to complete this transaction.  It must find a way to raise that cash, either through the sale or the mortgaging of assets.  Obviously, the assets that it would sell or mortgage would be Aer Lingus assets.  This brings us back to Eircom and to other State assets that were heavily mortgaged in order to generate money to buy those assets.<br\/><br\/>I have included the letter that was sent to the Minister by Matt Staunton in my presentation.  The top right-hand corner of page 6 of the presentation refers to the long-term incentive plan for Aer Lingus management.  It makes it clear that under the terms of the group's long-term incentive plan, an early vesting of an award may occur at the discretion of the remuneration committee on a change of control of the company.  According to a report in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, which we think is accurate, such a change of control would result in &euro;30 million for the senior and executive management of Aer Lingus.<br\/><br\/>Point 9 in the appendix to my presentation, which is taken from the annual report of the International Airlines Group, describes how that group achieves cost synergies in cases of consolidation.  It would be very naive of anyone to think that the International Airlines Group will not seek to drive greater profits and cost synergies if it is successful.  It will do this by eliminating duplication of backroom resources and maintenance services in Aer Lingus and the International Airlines Group.  The elimination of duplication is how consolidation works.  All of this is set out in points 9, 10 and 11 of the appendix to our presentation.  It goes into some detail about how synergies are developed and about the International Airlines Group's targets for synergies in its existing airlines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Evan Cullen"},{"type":"speech","time":1422540000,"counter":686,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cullen and invite Mr. Matt Staunton of IMPACT to address the joint committee.

The proposed takeover of Aer Lingus by the International Airlines Group presents significant risks to Ireland's interests in terms of accessibility to the island of Ireland for business and tourism.  It also represents a significant risk to the security of employment for Irish workers employed directly or indirectly by Aer Lingus.  Therefore, the Government and the D&aacute;il, as guardians of the State's 25.1% share in the airline, will have to make a very serious decision in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  I ask the committee to consider a couple of key points of national interest that will arise if a sale of the State shareholding to the International Airlines Group is to be contemplated.  As an island nation, the State should maintain some holding in an airline that serves to maintain strong links with the EU, the US and other critical trading partners.  The sole purpose of the International Airlines Group's interest is to expand its own commercial interests.  The costs of such expansion to Aer Lingus and the Irish market are likely to be secondary.  Heathrow Airport is a vital hub connection for Ireland.  Aer Lingus is the third largest holder of slots in Heathrow.  The International Airlines Group is the largest and Lufthansa is second largest.  Aer Lingus owns 23 prime-time return slots and two seasonal slots at Heathrow.  These slots would make greater returns for the International Airlines Group if they were used to service the London-US market rather than the London-Dublin market.  In such circumstances, they would encroach on the successful direct connections between Ireland and the US.<\/p> <p>  It is in the best interests of the International Airlines Group to funnel as many passengers from UK provincial and Irish airports through its Heathrow hub at terminal 5.  Over 1 million passengers per year travel from UK provincial airports to use Dublin terminal 2 as a hub to the US.  British Airways and the International Airlines Group would like to reclaim this lucrative long-haul business.  The business plan of the International Airlines Group in the event of a successful takeover bid remains unknown.  Our best guide to the company's likely actions can only be informed by its participation in the last takeover bid by Ryanair.  That bid involved dismembering Aer Lingus between three entities: Ryanair, the International Airlines Group and Flybe.  The proposal sought to carve up the assets, including the Heathrow slots, the transatlantic operation and the Aer Lingus brand, between the three companies.  There were very limited undertakings from the International Airlines Group regarding the eventual use of the Heathrow slots after an initial period of three to five years.<\/p><p>There is no evidence to suggest the current IAG bid is not similar in its intentions.<br\/><br\/>Aer Lingus directly employs 3,900 people, the overwhelming majority of whom live and work in Dublin.  Around 2,100 employees work exclusively on the ground in clerical, operative and other back office roles.  For the purpose of the takeover, IAG would have to identify cost and revenue synergies to justify its investment.  One of the primary cost synergies would come from a reduction in the Aer Lingus employee headcount, particularly in the back office where there would be readily identifiable duplication with existing resources in London and possibly in IAG&rsquo;s Iberia base in Madrid.  This is also true of some maintenance functions, given the substantial IAG maintenance facilities in London and Madrid.  Executive and senior decision making would transfer to London, with perhaps a token executive presence in Dublin.  Following the IAG takeover of Iberia, the company announced 4,500 job losses.  On a like for like basis with Iberia, this would represent job losses of between 1,000 and 1,200 in Aer Lingus at Dublin Airport.  This figure factors in the Aer Lingus jobs lost less than five years ago under the greenfield plan.  The IAG CEO&rsquo;s record with Aer Lingus speaks volumes.  During his tenure as Aer Lingus CEO 2,500 Irish jobs disappeared forever.  We have confirmed these estimates with analysts in Dublin and London.  Following the rejection of the two initial bids, a research note from Nomura, a major international holding company, observed, &ldquo;Any material bid increase is unlikely to be forthcoming without the ability to drive significant cost synergies&rdquo;. <br\/><br\/>As a substantial shareholder in Aer Lingus, the Government will be aware of the long-term incentive plan for current Aer Lingus senior management.  Committee members should further be aware that a takeover of the nature proposed by IAG would represent a substantial wealth windfall for individuals in the management team by way of the long-term incentive plan and other share bonus schemes.  Therefore, consultation with management or the board on this issue must have due regard to this reality.  <br\/><br\/>Ciar&aacute;n Hancock&rsquo;s column in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>made for interesting reading.  He pointed out that the company, founded in 1936, had survived a world war, the 1970s oil crisis, the 9\/11 crisis, Ireland&rsquo;s worst recession in living memory and competition from Ryanair, including three hostile takeover bids from that company.  People seem to forget that it has stood on its own two feet quite well since the turn of the century and that it has arguably had its best trading years during the recent recession.  The company delivered profits in 11 of the years between 1999 and 2013.  In the four full trading years from 2010 it made an aggregate profit of &euro;187 million, while its operating surplus for the first nine months of 2014 was &euro;103 million.  Revenues in these four years rose by 15%.  At the end of last September the airline had &euro;973 million gross in cash, while passenger numbers, including for Aer Lingus regional, last year hit a record 11.1 million.  It has successfully established Dublin as a hub to North America, with the number of passengers carried on its transatlantic services rising by 20.6% last year.  This is far from a deadbeat airline.<br\/><br\/>In a post-takeover Aer Lingus it is almost certain that the real decision making power would be remotely relocated to London, with functions considered unnecessary duplication in Dublin.  That would mean job losses.  IAG has stated IMPACT&rsquo;s claims of job losses of the order of 1,000 to 1,200 are wide of the mark, but implicit in this statement is the fact that job losses are inevitable.  In the absence of a detailed plan from IAG, we can only assume the company would take the same approach as it did when Iberia merged with British Airways to form IAG.  Iberia was forced to shed 4,500 jobs.  Our estimate is adjusted for scale and takes account of the greenfield plan redundancies.  Analysts in Dublin and London have confirmed that our figures are closer to the mark.<br\/><br\/>Given the cyclical nature of the aviation industry, at the first sign of trouble in a post-takeover Aer Lingus, IAG would have the power to limit this island&rsquo;s air connectivity with London and the United States in order to lower its overheads.  These are two of the most important pumping arteries of the economy.  An economy in recovery such as ours cannot afford to trade its future away.  We can never expect or assume that IAG would see these concerns in the same way.  Its commercial interests would always come first.  I, therefore, urge all Deputies and Senators to do their utmost not to do something rash or, worse again, stand back and let something happen that could never be reversed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#CC00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Staunton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422540000,"counter":689,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Staunton.

I have been group secretary to the group of unions in Aer Lingus for the past nine years.  I led the defence documents on the three bids from Ryanair very successfully.  I wish to focus on two issues, the first of which is staff concerns, while the second is connectivity.<\/p> <p>  The prospect of Aer Lingus being acquired by IAG has raised huge concerns among the 4,000 workforce employed directly by the airline.  As with any mergers, all sides involved tend to look at what synergies they can deploy.  This potentially could lead to a major shift in the backroom staff employed in Ireland by Aer Lingus.  It is possible that as many as 1,200 jobs could be moved to IAG headquarters in the United Kingdom, which would have a devastating effect on employment and the employment spend in this country.<\/p> <p>  The aviation division of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport asked us to comment on a new draft aviation policy.  One of the questions put to us was: \"What is the importance of London Heathrow for Ireland's international connectivity now and in the future?\"  We are a small island nation; this one of the few small countries not connected to mainland Europe by land.  By way of our membership of the European Union, our business links with all of the countries within the Union are crucial to our economic development.  At the same time, we must maintain and develop our trade links with our closest neighbour, the United Kingdom, while not forgetting our extremely strong business links with the United States, with the IT sector being particularly important in this relationship.  In that context, it is vital that we maintain and develop our air transport links with major airport and business hubs.<\/p> <p>  We have been lucky enough to have had a State airline for almost 70 years and the State still has a 25.1% share in Aer Lingus, which  has strong connectivity with the global hub at Heathrow Airport through slots.  For strategic reasons, these slots were vested in Aer Lingus and remained thus after the IPO in 2006.  The then Minister for Transport, former Deputy Martin Cullen, assured us that the State would retain a minimum of a 25.1% stake in Aer Lingus to be used as a blocking vote should a predator ever try to acquire or sell this vital State asset.  Nothing has changed since 2006.  If anything, the case for the State retaining its share in Aer Lingus has probably been strengthened.  Ireland is recognised as having a very good transport network infrastructure and many of the world's leading high-tech companies have a base here.  Let us not lose it.  Even Fianna F&aacute;il could see the importance of maintaining connectivity when it privatised the company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Myles Worth"},{"type":"speech","time":1422540000,"counter":691,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Worth.

I am responsible for the energy, construction, transport and aviation sectors in the union.  The union represents over 1,500 workers in the company, across Dublin, Cork and Shannon in a range of categories, including baggage handlers, cleaners, caterers, cargo agents, clerical support staff, ground staff, middle managers and others.  In the past decade, since the part privatisation of the company, SIPTU members have engaged in quite a number of restructuring and cost saving programmes.  They have come to the understanding the industry requires a workforce that is agile and flexible, not only to meet customer requirements but also those of an ever-changing industry.<\/p><p>In particular, they have seen pay cuts, pay freezes and significant cuts to their pensions.  Effectively, they have had to do much more with much less.  <br\/><br\/>In recent years the union concluded a number of important agreements with Aer Lingus management that negated and addressed its views on the need to outsource large swathes of the workforce.  We did this by reducing the cost base in a significant way, working with Aer Lingus management to preserve and continue decent, direct and sustainable employment.  This model has allowed Aer Lingus to retain complete control over all of its operations, while continuing to grow the business, passenger numbers, revenue and, in recent years, profits.  It is fair to say the direct labour model in Aer Lingus has worked.  Given the flexible nature of our agreements and the manner in which we and management work, the model continues to give safety and security to workers and the employer.<br\/><br\/>On the possible sale of the company and the stance the Government should adopt as the second largest shareholder, our position is simple and clear.  We have called on the Government to block any sale of its shareholding in the company unless clear and tangible guarantees are secured from IAG in this instance or any other possible suitor.  The guarantees must cover a number of issues, the first of which is connectivity, something many people have mentioned.  As an open market island economy on the periphery of Europe but also at its gateway, it is essential that access to and from other markets continue and develop.  This underpins tens of thousands of jobs for employees, many of whom are union members and work in foreign direct investment, FDI, multinationals and other sectors, including tourism.<br\/><br\/>Second, the Heathrow Airport slots Mr. Worth mentioned have been the subject of much discussion.  It is clear that they are of critical value to the company under a number of headings, particularly given the nature of supply and demand and the fact that Heathrow is one of the busiest airports in the world and operating at nearly full capacity.<br\/><br\/>Third, the transatlantic routes have played a large role in the development of Aer Lingus and are a significant part of its operation.  They are a major source of revenue and, with US immigration pre-clearance services operating in this jurisdiction, comprise a key element of the company's strategic growth prospects.<br\/><br\/>Each of these three issues must be a core factor that the Government will consider when making any decision on its shareholding in the company, taking into account their role in balanced regional development, maintaining key exporting industries and businesses in the economy and underpinning thousands of jobs.  The Government must also factor in the maintenance of the current level of decent and sustainable direct employment within Aer Lingus across the three airports in Ireland.  It must receive cast iron guarantees from any party seeking to buy the airline.  The workers have made significant commitments and sacrifices to make Aer Lingus the successful and profitable airline that it is today.  These commitments must be reciprocated by the current management and any prospective owner and must be secured before the Government would even consider selling its 25.11% share of the airline.<br\/><br\/>Our position should not be characterised as conservative, negative or merely seeking to protect the <i>status<\/i><i>quo<\/i>as some of our detractors seek to infer.  Our position is grounded in reality and is pragmatic and prudent.  We want to ensure the Government uses its shareholding for what we were told was its purpose, that is, to act in the strategic interests of the State, its economy and, crucially, its people, including the 3,900 workers employed in Aer Lingus, as well as the tens of thousands of employees who work in a range of sectors and whose industries and livelihoods could be impacted on negatively without clear and tangible guarantees.

The company is profitable, does not require additional cash and has been in a growth cycle since its privatisation.  Last year it routed 1 million passengers from the north of England through Dublin Airport and onwards to the United States at a time when Heathrow Airport was becoming even more congested, with the prospect of providing a third runway a long way down the road.

I agree with Deputy Timmy Dooley on the cash windfall that might come the Government's way.  While all other shareholders are interested in the return on their investments, the Government is a unique shareholder and must consider the matter from a strategic position.  It has an opportunity; it is in the driving seat and should not drop the ball.  Many backbench Deputies from both parties are making positive noises on the issue.

In the absence of facts, we do not want to speculate too much.  The Government and the board of Aer Lingus have an opportunity to obtain clarity.  While there are macro guarantees around connectivity, the Heathrow Airport slots and the transatlantic routes, the critical micro guarantee is to maintain quality, sustainable, direct labour within Aer Lingus and we make no apologies for saying this.  It is a key factor that has contributed to the company's success and must be a key issue for the Government, the business community and the chambers of commerce in the Dublin, Cork and Shannon regions.

However, he has omitted to mention that it already has substantial code share agreements with the Star, SkyTeam and oneworld alliances.  If, as IAG proposed in one of the published documents, Aer Lingus were to become a member of the oneworld alliance, the membership would have to increase its return by 300% to replace the losses of the Star and SkyTeam alliances.  In addition, it would require a different model because we would have to introduce a two-class service on short haul routes, similar to that of British Airways.  There is only one sustainable argument for consolidation in the airline industry, which we must concede, namely, the fact that if one goes to Airbus or Boeing to buy 40 aeroplanes, if one is part of a conglomerate that is buying 400 aeroplanes, one gets a better deal.  Aer Lingus has already addressed this fact through its substantial agreement with Etihad on the purchase and procurement of services and does not need IAG to help it with its capital expenditure, capex, because it already has a strategic partner.  There is no other reason for an airline that is growing, profitable and on the trajectory Aer Lingus is on, with one of the youngest average fleet ages in Europe and the best fuel hedging contract in Europe, not just by a few dollars but by a country mile, for the IAG takeover.  Aer Lingus does not need IAG; IAG needs Aer Lingus.  When one takes a capital market value on Aer Lingus of &euro;1.3 billion, there will be close to &euro;500 million of free cash on the balance sheet.  That would bring it down to &euro;800 million.

Now we see that they were not true and that promises were not worth the paper they were written on.  I cannot see how anybody can make a promise about the 24 Heathrow Airport slots.

We have to be objective about it and not get over-emotional about it.  As already alluded to, it would take some substantial offer with multiple conditions for anyone to be persuaded for the State to surrender its 25.1% share.  I am one of the people who take that view.  As a lifelong trade unionist, anybody who has read what has happened in the past in Aer Lingus will be aware of the sacrifices that were made to turn it into a profitable company.

Should IAG complete the acquisition, the focus will then be on how these slots are used.  Some will undoubtedly be used for services to Ireland but everyone realises that the real prize is long-haul usage of these slots.  Let us take mainland China as one example.  The table in this article highlights just how weak British Airways' position is at the moment in terms of its service to the world's fastest growing market.  Based on planned February 2015 schedules, British Airways goes to three destinations with 68 flights; Air France has four destinations with 106 flights; KLM has five destinations with 88 flights; and Lufthansa four with 108 flights.

I agree with Deputy Maloney's comments.  In response to Deputy Ellis's question as to where the staff would come from if IAG take over and people are outsourced, again, nobody knows but the speculation, when people compare it with Iberia, is that it would be the ground staff yet again.  To put it in context, this goes back to Deputy Maloney's point about the profitability of the airline.  Since 2008 our members and the members of all the unions in Aer Lingus have put their shoulder to the wheel and saved significant moneys.  Many of the staff have had their terms and conditions of employment bought out and have gone on to lower terms and conditions of employment to reduce the cost base so that the organisation can be as lean and as efficient as many of its competitors.  They have done that, they have been on pay pauses, pay freezes and pay cuts and have had, effectively, what was a defined benefit pension scheme, albeit one which got into serious trouble, changed into a defined contribution scheme and we are not out of the woods on some elements of that yet.<\/p> <p>  Given that people have made those contributions and sacrifices there is no way they will willingly lie down and have a situation where their jobs are outsourced whether by the current owner or any new owner.  We have current, existing, flexible, agile agreements with the current owner, one of which is a registered employment agreement.  We know the Government wants to reinstitute that legislation to allow for further registered employment agreements.  If people get certainty and clarity, it creates the context where they can continue to work in an environment to make sure that the company continues to be successful.  The absence of that kind of clarity is usually replaced by chaos and that is not what anybody wants but potentially that is what could happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Owen Reidy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422540000,"counter":709,"content":"<p>To address Deputy Ellis's question, the aircraft which are flying between Dublin and Heathrow on the Aer Lingus slots are catered for and maintained in Dublin.  The proper cross synergy one expects to happen is that they would be catered for and maintained in Heathrow.  That would be true of aircraft that are currently catered for in Shannon and Cork.  If IAG was to follow up on the cost synergy logic of its whole existence then that catering contract should go into Heathrow, hence a loss of work and employment in Dublin.  It equally follows that flights from Dublin to Barcelona would then be catered for and maintained in Barcelona where Vueling has its main base.  Flights from Dublin to Madrid would then be catered for and maintained in Madrid where Iberia has its presence.  That is how the cost synergies work and that would have a knock-on impact.<\/p> <p>  In the hard copy of my presentation which I gave to the committee, IAG identifies how it is targeting cost synergies in the existing IAG companies.  There are revenue synergies and they are positive for everybody but the cost synergies are just as dramatic in the IAG model.  Somebody said there were not many defenders for the privatisation.  There is a reality about the privatisation of Aer Lingus in 2006.  It is almost a certainty that Aer Lingus would not have had the cash buffer that it needed to get through 2009 if it had not had the cash on its balance sheet because the cash was not going to come from the Government in 2009.

The situation has turned into a good cash cow for the industry but that is not always going to be the case.

People have reached the conclusion that if IAG is doing that by itself, why would it then reduce the slots.  Members should be aware that the slots were originally BMI slots.  IAG swallowed BMI whole and bought it from Lufthansa for a very cheap price.  IAG was required by the UK regulator to operate the slots, as was, for a period.  Equally, Virgin Atlantic acquired the remainder of the BMI slots and it was required to operate the slots, as before, for a period.  Virgin Atlantic did not have short haul aircraft and hired Aer Lingus to operate the slots for a period, but the contract for doing so will come to an end in September of this year.  In the public domain there is a belief that IAG operates on the London route at the moment with its own aircraft.  It is important that is set in context against the requirements of the UK regulator in terms of the slots.<\/p> <p>  With regard to consolidation, somebody asked whether Aer Lingus would not have bigger problems there.  I cannot see what problems Aer Lingus has at the moment.  It is more profitable on a like-for-like basis than IAG, it has one of the youngest fleets in Europe and is growing.  If somebody could identify the problem with Aer Lingus and that it needs something, then I would love to hear it.  Aer Lingus has one of the best co-chair agreements with all three of the world alliances - SkyTeam, Star and oneworld.  It has one of the best fuel-hedged contracts in Europe.  Why does Aer Lingus need IAG?  The only reason Aer Lingus might need IAG is to buy new aircraft.  As I have said before, if one needs 40 new aircraft, one will always do a better deal if it is 400 aircraft.  Aer Lingus has already solved that problem with its strategic alliance with Etihad.

The following nationally owned airlines are no longer with us - Sabena, Iberia, Alitalia and Swissair.  They are all gone yet we now have a thriving business which Mr. Reidy mentioned.

He more or less inferred that he would accept a takeover if certain guarantees were given from a private company that in my opinion is nothing more than a predator hovering over a very successful airline.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask a question about jobs.<\/p><p>Has there been any increase in the workforce as a result of Aer Lingus's success in recent years?  Has the workforce remained static?  I am glad Mr. Reidy outlined in his presentation the serious difficulties the workforce has experienced in recent years.  It is a great credit to the Aer Lingus workforce that it has managed to come through three hostile bids and through all the rationalisation that took place to make it a leaner airline, which as Mr. Reidy said has made it a more profitable airline.  I record the appreciation of all of us of the outstanding contribution the workforce has made to ensure that Aer Lingus is now an attractive enough option for a major commercial company to want to take it over.  I am interested as to whether there has been an increase in the workforce.  If there has been and I would be surprised if there has not been, it is a further indication of the reasons the Government should not allow a takeover of a company that is not only expanding in terms of bringing in more tourist numbers but is creating more jobs on its own through its own good efforts.  I, like everybody else, cannot understand why the Government would for one moment contemplate allowing this takeover to go ahead because, as has been pointed out, Aer Lingus does not need IAG, rather IAG needs Aer Lingus.  It would not be around otherwise.  That is the way predatory companies operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#H00800","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422540000,"counter":722,"content":"<p>I, too, acknowledge the contributions made by all speakers.  I have been greatly informed today about the issues that I have read about in the newspapers.  On the question of a &euro;300 million bid, that does not amount to two days' social welfare payments.  As everyone has mentioned, connectivity at Heathrow is paramount.  The Heathrow slots are the main issue.  Guarantees or assurances in any takeover are not worth the paper on which they are written.  The group's proposals are job cuts, as was mentioned.  I am not aware that any other shareholders have made a bid.  I have not heard or read a comment from Mr. O'Leary or Ryanair.  That is a significant point and I do not know what is behind it.  I also note Aer Lingus has stated that it would be willing to sell depending on the conditions that IAG would give it, but from my experience conditions and assurances are not worth the paper on which they are written.  Tourist numbers to this country last year were the highest ever, exceeding the year of The Gathering.  Many of those tourists from North America travelled here via the slots at Heathrow Airport.  It is paramount that we retain those slots.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#J00200","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speech","time":1422540000,"counter":723,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.  There is strong and pretty much unanimous support in the Seanad - which does not get reported very much - as our guests will have heard from Senators Brennan and Mooney, for the case they have been making.  The Minister came into the Seanad yesterday to announce the committee, and I note that there are some misgivings today that it is excessively focused on finance in its orientation, and both David Begg and Christoph Mueller were not at the recent board meetings for various reasons.  I think their terms had expired.  Would it have been different if both those directors had been there - the one who had been managing the airline in the recent past and the one who was the representative of the employees?<\/p> <p>  I have a few concerns.  What does British Airways bring to the party?  I have mentioned its eclipse by both EasyJet and Ryanair in the UK.  A consumer survey put it  at number 17.  Therefore, it is not Singapore Airlines bringing something that is any way superior to the product that is produced by Aer Lingus.  Another concern relates to what happened in Scotland.  As a region, it is seriously neglected by British Airways, which is Heathrow focused, as speakers have said.  There are approximately 400,000 passengers from Scotland to North America and we transport 2.4 million passengers number on that transatlantic route.  The population of Scotland, at 5.3 million, is 500,000 more than ours at 4 million odd.  There is more transatlantic traffic out of Dublin than out of Manchester, Birmingham, Belfast, Glasgow and Edinburgh combined.  We are talking about \"air Heathrow\" taking over.  Heathrow is still growing.  Ever since I started to study this area, Heathrow has been full.  It just keeps growing.  It is growing faster than Gatwick where in the past five years there has been a decline.  The traffic will go through there.  I believe that is the plan.  I would be nervous having regard to the anti-competitive mergers that people mentioned, the gobbling up of British Midland and so on.  We have developed a North Atlantic product that is six times better, at 2.4 million passengers versus 400,000 passengers, than anything that serves Scotland, a country the same size as ours.  I do not believe British Airways has any great interest in developing that whereas in recent years Aer Lingus has had, and that is to the credit of everybody involved.<\/p> <p>  I thank our guests for their submissions.  I do not want to exceed my allocation of three minutes as the committee has to keep to the timetable set.  Certainly in the Seanad, there is no great welcome for this bid.  What our guests are doing is appreciated.  As Senator Brennan said, the bid of &euro;300 million equates to about two days' public expenditure, but what has been built up on the North Atlantic routes in particular is worth far more than that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#J00300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422540000,"counter":724,"content":"<p>To answer Senator Mooney's question on consolidation,  the number one priority of consolidation in any industry, particularly in the airline industry, is to eliminate over-capacity because over-capacity drives down prices.  It is easier for airlines to make money if they consolidate.  There have been mega-consolidations in the US and on all the routes where consolidation took place, the average price per kilometre flown, per seat mile produced, increased.  That is a mathematical fact.  Consolidation is designed to eliminate over-capacity.<\/p> <p> I would take issue with the rhetoric about national carriers.  I will set out a number of facts.  Sabena only made a profit in one year of its entire existence and that was the year that Air France went on strike and all the French had to drive to Brussels.  Sabena was a basket case from the day it was born to the day it died.  Everybody accepts that.  Swissair got damaged because it was a major shareholder in Sabena and got wiped out by Sabena.  However, Swissair is an extremely successful airline.  Alitalia still exists and is now controlled, but not owned, by Etihad.  While Iberia has had its difficulties, it still exists within IAG, just like British Airways.  With regard to the notion that national flag carriers are all a thing of the past, they all exist.  I can assure members that if there is one thing the Norwegian Air Shuttle debate shows, it is that the Americans are very committed to their flag carriers.<\/p> <p>  Senator Barrett raised some excellent points, which may stray outside the debate, but he is correct that BA brings nothing to Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus gets everything it needs from BA by way of its code-share agreements with the oneworld alliance, but it equally gets its income from the SkyTeam and the Star Alliance.<\/p> <p>  I agree that there should have been more worker participation.  Despite the fact, for example, that the pilots hold 7% of this company, we have no representation on the board and we have not even received the courtesy of a telephone call during all of this.  The Senator is correct about BA's neglect of Scotland.  Scotland has a similar sized diaspora to ours and its population is larger than ours but it only has a fraction of the transatlantic traffic.  That is correct.  I would ask Senator Barrett to voice our concerns that Dublin could be a substantially bigger hub but because people think it is a shopping mall with a runway appended to it, we do not have the proper infrastructure to put the proper aeroplanes onto the tarmac because nobody wants to invest in the taxi-way system or in the exits at the runway.<\/p><p>The manner in which the airport looks after itself as a shopping mall and not as an operational runway is an abomination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Evan Cullen","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422540000,"counter":726,"content":"<p>We are encouraged to hear the broad thrust of what the three Senators said.

What Senator Mooney said is ironic and a little bit rich.  If I can say so in a respectful manner, the party to which he belongs needs to decide whether it is in favour of the privatisation of commercial semi-State companies.  There is no point in a Government selling the family silver - 75% of the company - at a knock-down price of &euro;200 million and then, a decade later, people who were members of that Administration beating their breasts and saying that what is happening now is outrageous.  The Senator's party needs to decide.  The position of parties, whether they are in government or in opposition, should be clear.  We have been clear and we disagree, with respect, with some of our colleagues - I do not want to misquote Captain Cullen here - who thought privatisation would not be as bad as we believed it was going to be.

If the takeover were to proceed, I presume some competition rules would come into play in respect of the Heathrow slots that would have to be disposed of.  I am not a conspiracy theorist but this all points towards certain events happening if the takeover were to go ahead.  Given that one should measure twice and cut once, in this instance we should measure a number of times before we decide to take any future action.

We represent 95% of the pilots in Stobart Air.  There is no question that we would be greatly concerned that the operations of Aer Lingus Regional, on behalf of which Stobart Air provides the service in question, would be hugely curtailed by what is proposed.  IAG does not have a history of keeping relationships such as that involving Stobart Air alive.  That would have a knock-on effect into the regions.  A key aspect of what is happening at Dublin Airport is that Aer Lingus Regional is bringing passengers from the UK provincial airports into the terminal 2 hub.  Terminal 2 is operating in direct competition with Heathrow's terminal 5 at present.<\/p><p>In the industry, we call Heathrow \"Fortress Heathrow\".  It is a fortress for BA to make money.  No one can get a foothold in Heathrow unless it is a company like Aer Lingus, which arrived in the 1950s when the runways were first laid, or Lufthansa, which has grandfather rights for many years.  This is why terminal 2 is posing a challenge to terminal 5.

If Aer Lingus joins One World, as IAG proposes in writing, it would have to break its relationships with the others.  It would then have to generate three times the income in the One World code-share to justify the breaking of the code-share with the others.

If one were to follow a similar model for an Aer Lingus consolidation into IAG, it would lose between five and eight slots straight away.  These slots would be redistributed to other competitors on the route.  The UK regulator would say they will be able to operate these slots for a fixed period of three to five years.

Cork chamber is the leading business organisation for the Cork region, representing in excess of 1,000 businesses that employ more than 100,000 people, with a mandate to drive the wider economic development of the region.<\/p> <p>  Cork is the economic hub of southern Ireland and Cork Airport&rsquo;s services and air connectivity are critical to the economic health and global investment appeal of Ireland&rsquo;s second city and its surrounding region.  Cork&rsquo;s air connectivity has been instrumental in attracting inward investment from global market leaders in key sectors with Cork now home to 145 IDA Ireland client companies employing almost 30,000 people.  Cork's air connectivity also plays a pivotal role in serving the connectivity needs of the broader indigenous business base and tourism sector.<\/p> <p>  The accessibility of Cork, in particular the range and frequency of inbound and outbound air services, is a core priority for the chamber given the vital role of these services in facilitating business and tourism in the wider Cork region.  Based on our geographic representation, our air travel surveys give a unique understanding of our connectivity infrastructure, the critical nature of the London Heathrow connection being paramount.<\/p> <p>  Despite some recent positive policy initiatives, Cork chamber has grave concerns regarding the adequacy of existing Government policy measures to support a fair, balanced and effective approach to the development of Cork Airport as one of the three State airports, the most recent of these serious concerns being the potential sale of Aer Lingus to IAG.  Following this week's recommendation of the Aer Lingus board to its shareholders to accept a potential offer from IAG, Cork chamber strongly urges the Government to oppose the sale of Aer Lingus in light of our growing concerns over the absence of legally binding guarantees around the safeguarding of the existing Cork to Heathrow slots or any information relating to IAG's longer-term plans for the airline as they relate to Cork Airport.<\/p> <p>  The Cork to Heathrow slots are a national asset and are a critical piece of business infrastructure for our region.  Heathrow is the leading connection to Cork's largest trading partner, the UK, and is the leading access point to and from the globe from a business and tourism perspective.  In the absence of direct US connectivity from Cork, the significance of our direct link to Heathrow is further magnified.<\/p> <p>  In 2014, almost 400,000 passengers flew on the four daily flights which currently operate between Cork Airport and Heathrow and these accounted for almost 20% of Cork&rsquo;s total 2.14 million passengers.  One in five of these passengers then transferred onto another international flight which underlines the critical nature of this onward worldwide connectivity link.  In addition, our 2014 business air-travel survey showed London Heathrow is the most used hub airport by almost two thirds of businesses in Cork.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, losing this route would have severe consequences for our business sectors and we urge Government to ensure a legally binding guarantee is put in place to maintain the existing Cork Airport to Heathrow connectivity before any sale of Aer Lingus is considered.  Any reduction in connectivity to Heathrow would undoubtedly make Cork a less attractive destination to multinational businesses considering investing and creating jobs in Cork as well as existing investors.  It would inhibit international market access for our indigenous businesses and put our city region at a very significant disadvantage.<\/p> <p>  While we welcome the Government's announcement to establish an interdepartmental group to consider the implications of the potential sale of Aer Lingus to IAG, it is essential that the terms of reference of the group include a requirement to report specifically on the impact and implications of any sale on Cork Airport.  A broad national overview would not be sufficient and would not acknowledge the growing concerns across the Cork business and tourism community which reflect the incalculable importance of connectivity to London Heathrow, which is an intrinsic core of Cork's business and tourism infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Healy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422540000,"counter":785,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair, Deputies and Senators for having us here.  Dublin Chamber of Commerce represents about 1,300 companies in the greater Dublin region - companies of all sizes across all sectors and employing about 350,000 people in the region.  Our business is about promoting the Dublin economy as a key driver of the economy of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Our concern over the issue relates to connectivity which has been mentioned by many of this afternoon's speakers.  We know that international air connectivity enhances a national economy.  It is crucial for that criterion to be at the forefront of the assessment of any proposal on the Aer Lingus company.  The Oxford economic group, which looked specifically at the impact of connectivity, estimated that a 10% improvement in air connectivity for a country can have a 1% increase in GDP in the long term.  So there is a very significant connection between connectivity and GDP growth.<br\/><br\/>The market forecast of aircraft manufacturer, Airbus, that looks at the global aviation market to 2030 estimates that the global market will be dominated by 87 aviation mega cities - hubs around the globe through which traffic will transfer.  It includes Ireland's Dublin Airport as one of those 87 aviation hubs.<br\/><br\/>The key in connectivity is often long-haul traffic, which has also been mentioned this afternoon.  The figures for Dublin and for Ireland have been very encouraging in this regard.  Since 2010 we have seen a 40% increase in the number of passengers travelling between North America and Ireland through Dublin Airport.<br\/><br\/>I have had personal experience of the campaign over the past four years to re-establish the route between Dublin and the west coast of America, resulting in the re-opening last April of the route into San Francisco.  We worked very hard with companies throughout the island and in the Dublin region to ensure that route was reinstated.  Since it was reinstated last April more than 1,500 jobs have been announced for Ireland by companies from the US west coast.  Some of those involve the expansion of existing companies, such as PayPal, and some of them are new companies such as Calypso Technology, AdRoll and AMAX.  So it is very significant that this route has been re-established.  I am encouraged that Aer Lingus has announced it is expanding that route from five flights a week to seven from the summer.<br\/><br\/>A key driver for long-haul routes is transfer traffic.  That is the concept that passengers will travel through Europe into Ireland and on to the United States of America.  We believe this has been a real success for Ireland for Dublin in recent years.  It has already been mentioned this afternoon that more than 1 million passengers pass through Dublin <i>en route<\/i>.  The pre-clearance facilities in Dublin are a very significant part of that.<\/p><p>I am encouraged by the statement in the document issued by IAG yesterday that it plans to use its aviation network to grow transfer traffic at Irish airports.  This should be good news for Irish business travellers and consumers.<\/p><p> We have very ambitious targets for the economy in the years ahead as we face economic recovery.  We must create more jobs and do everything possible to support economic growth, and international connectivity is key to achieving this objective.  We also have an ambition to increase tourist numbers by 25% in the next ten years.  Tourism is extremely important for all parts of the island and achieving growth in the sector will only be possible if connectivity is improved.  This will be the key criterion for assessing the proposed sale of Aer Lingus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Gina Quin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422540000,"counter":787,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. &Oacute;rlaith Borthwick, chief executive of Limerick Chamber of Commerce, to make her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#O00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422540000,"counter":788,"content":"<p>My colleague from Shannon Chamber of Commerce, Ms Helen Downes, will speak first, after which I will summarise the position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. &Oacute;rlaith Borthwick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422540000,"counter":789,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to make a presentation to this meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications on the impact of a potential sale of Aer Lingus.  I am attending in my role as chief executive of Shannon Chamber of Commerce.  I will make my presentation in collaboration with the interim chief executive of Limerick Chamber of Commerce, Dr. &Oacute;rlaith Borthwick.  We are also joined by Frank Greene, president of Galway Chamber of Commerce.  The concerns and views my colleagues and I will present also have the backing of the Ennis Chamber of Commerce.<\/p> <p>  The content and substance of our submission is being made on behalf of the economic corridor which stretches from Galway to Ennis, Shannon and Limerick, 1,355 businesses which form the membership of the four chambers in the area in question and 45,700 people who are directly employed in the region by these businesses.  I have submitted to the joint committee a document setting out our position.  As I am conscious of time, I will proceed to posing the key question that arises on this issue, namely, what vision do we have for Ireland?  Do we want the country to remain an internationally traded open economy, with global corporations conducting business globally?  If so, we must keep the issue of connectivity to the fore when considering the sale of Aer Lingus.  Connectivity is vital for the retention and growth of business on this island nation.  We cannot afford to allow it to be determined by market forces.  Instead, it must centre on the needs of citizens, business and tourism.<\/p> <p>  Our focus is less about ownership and more about ensuring that the 23 slot pairs connecting London Heathrow and Irish airports are retained to ensure connectivity to each airport, not only Dublin Airport, is maintained.  This requirement must be enshrined in Government policy regardless of ownership.  It must be central to the decision-making process and any subsequent deal with IAG or another carrier.  Cast-iron and long-term guarantees must be provided to ensure the slots at Heathrow are maintained for access from Irish airports, including the three major regional airports.  A minimum of three slots for Shannon Airport must be retained at all costs.  Should competition authorities consider that the combined total of slots occupied by IAG and Aer Lingus is anti-competitive, any displacement of Dublin slots should be allocated to the other airports in Ireland, thus facilitating delivery of a more balanced economy and resulting in at least the same number of slots for Ireland Inc.<\/p> <p>  The loss of the London Heathrow slots would be at odds with the Government's plans to correct regional imbalance and add a hollow ring to the concern expressed by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, that Ireland would \"pay a heavy economic social cost in years to come if regional imbalances are not addressed\".  Airports, including Shannon Airport, play a vital role in the economic and social development of their region and act both as a gateway and an engine of growth.  Why should such strong emphasis be placed on developing national aviation and tourism policies, on the one hand, if connectivity is reduced on the other?  Notwithstanding any short-term gain, the sale of Aer Lingus has the potential to do detrimental damage to the country&rsquo;s economic well-being in the long term.  The financial gain of circa &euro;320 million in the context of a &euro;67 billion bailout does not warrant the potential detrimental impact the loss of connectivity would have.  Any potential return must be assessed in the context of the risk exposure to be realised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Downes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422540000,"counter":790,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators for inviting us to come before the joint committee to make a presentation.  I am the interim chief executive of Limerick Chamber.  Given my background in economics, I would like to deal in facts and remove emotion from this discussion.  We must consider where the country is and what types of policies we are trying to implement.<\/p> <p>  It should be noted that this debate is taking place in the void left by the absence of the long overdue national aviation policy.  Furthermore, there is a little clarity about the proposed sale of Aer Lingus and a formal offer to the company has not yet been made.  For these reasons, much of this discussion is taking place in an information void.  It is not good for jobs and businesses in the region to have a question mark hanging over the sustainability of connectivity into the regions.<\/p> <p>  According to the policy statement issued by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on foreign direct investment, FDI, Government policy is \"focused on creating competitive and globally connected city regions, attractive places to do business, to work and to live\".  The statement also notes that the \"role of city regions has become increasingly important in FDI flows - not only in terms of the city itself but how it is connected and networked globally\".  The region Ms Downes and I represent, the catchment area of Shannon Airport, encompasses a corridor that stretches from north of Galway to south of Limerick.  Approximately 150 multinational US companies are operating in the region, directly employing more than 30,000 people.  In addition, 25,000 people are directly employed in the tourism sector in the mid-west.<\/p> <p>  The State has a duty to act strategically in the interests of citizens, employers and investors and their long-term requirements.  It must take into account the wider impact of the sale of Aer Lingus on the economy and connectivity.  Irish business travellers strongly depend on the hub at Heathrow Airport and require interlining services to access third locations.  In 2013, connecting travellers accounted for approximately 45% of Shannon-Heathrow traffic.<\/p> <p>  Any sale of Aer Lingus must not threaten the unique access Ireland needs as an island economy on the periphery of Europe.  The direct transatlantic flights which Aer Lingus offers to our members, namely, businesses located along the entire western coast, continue to facilitate inward investment and job creation.  Any reduction in this connectivity would have a detrimental impact, not only on the foreign firms located in the region but also on indigenous companies which are trying to expand their networks and internationalise.  We strongly support Government policy on place-making, which is very firm in highlighting that Ireland's regions continue to have strong value propositions for foreign direct investment where there is good international connectivity.  The Government simply cannot make any decision that would in any way threaten the connectivity and transatlantic access that our members and businesses along the west coast enjoy via Heathrow.<\/p> <p>  I hope we will be invited to attend any future debates that may take place if greater clarity emerges on any potential offers for Aer Lingus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. &Oacute;rlaith Borthwick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422540000,"counter":791,"content":"<p>Members have heard representatives of the chambers of commerce address topics of particular relevance to their members and regions.

I am attending in my role as group strategy director for Shannon Group plc, the semi-State company responsible for Shannon Airport.  Shannon Group welcomes the recent statements from the Government that connectivity will be a key consideration in the proposed sale of Aer Lingus to IAG.  We also welcome statements that it will take into account much wider issues than the potential monetary value of the State's shareholding in Aer Lingus.<\/p> <p>  Heathrow remains the single most important gateway for business to and from key international markets from Ireland.  It is the only European hub served from Shannon Airport, which is the only airport in the west with a hub connection.  Some 60% of passengers on the Heathrow route, Shannon Airport's busiest route, are travelling from outside Ireland and one third of passengers on the route are travelling on business.<\/p><p> Direct accessibility, as the committee has heard, is a key decision factor for multinationals which are looking to establish or grow their operations in Ireland and it is also essential for the competitiveness of indigenous businesses which are seeking to reach their export markets.  IDA Ireland has been successful in recent years in attracting foreign direct investment into Ireland and the past year, in particular, has seen a series of wins in the mid-west and the west.  The leaders of the companies involved, such as Regeneron, AMAX, Genworth and Zimmer, have been explicit in linking their location and expansion decisions to Shannon Airport connectivity and they are constantly seeking reassurances about that connectivity.  Any reduction in regional access would thus jeopardise existing employment across these regions.  It would make it far harder to attract significant further FDI and associated employment and, of course, it would also impair access for overseas tourists to the west of Ireland and to the Wild Atlantic Way.<\/p><p> This is not a narrow regional issue but a broader one of national economic competitiveness.  Heathrow connectivity is vital for the country as a whole, but particularly so outside of Dublin.  The language so far has been about protecting slots for Ireland at a macro-level, but that is not sufficient.  Retaining Heathrow slots and connectivity for individual Irish airports, including Shannon, must be a priority if Ireland is to have a balanced regional economy.<\/p><p> We would, therefore, expect that any Government decision to sell the State's Aer Lingus stake to IAG would be conditional on an enforceable agreement which would have at least three key elements.  First, it would safeguard service levels, with frequency of flights and their spread throughout the day, between Heathrow and Irish airports, including Shannon.  Second, it would ring-fence these slots on an airport-specific basis rather than as an aggregate number for the whole country.  Third, it would provide long-term clarity, for example, for 15 years or until a new runway is operation at Heathrow - whichever is earlier.<\/p><p> Time is tight this afternoon.  I will conclude there and I would be happy to take any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Edmond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422540000,"counter":794,"content":"<p>We will go straight to Deputy Dooley.

No doubt they all are key stakeholders, in the regions and across the country, and they represent various organisations.  There is a nuanced difference between some of the presentations, notwithstanding that they all recognise the importance of connectivity.  From our point view, for us to come to some position on this, it is to understand whether the State could sell its 25.1% interest in the company or not.  That is ultimately the decision we will have to take.<\/p> <p>  In the case of Mr. Edmond and Ms Quin, I am hearing that we should sell if we can put in place appropriate guarantees for the future.  While I can understand Ms Quin's position, I am disappointed that such is the position of Shannon.  I hope it is not the position of the board.  From the evidence we have already heard today, there is no chance that we will get the kind of legal guarantees that would be appropriate.  To be honest, it is a bit of a smokescreen.  Captain Evan Cullen, a representative of the pilots who are considerable shareholders in the company, stated that at a minimum, if IAG were to purchase Aer Lingus, within three years a number of slots would automatically be up for dislodgement or dislocation under competition rules.  Therefore, there are real issues here.  Perhaps it may not be Mr. Edmond's fully thought-out position, but I would hope that all of the witnesses who have an interest in this would seek appropriate legal advice and develop a position that understands the limitations of any such guarantees or binding warranties.  To be honest, when it is gone, it is gone and one has little chance of exercising control over it, and now is the time to deal with that.<\/p> <p>  Generally, in any takeover, for example, by a bigger company of a smaller company, it is usually the seller, not the buyer, that issues the warranties.  There is a wish list being exercised here that nearly expects that the tooth fairy will appear and resolve the problem.  This does not happen in the real world.  Let us be honest about that.  That is the political cover that certain politicians are taking at present.  Thankfully, the witnesses are not in that space and they can be a little stronger.<\/p> <p>  The key theme coming across from what they talked about is connectivity.  Ms Quin talks about the wider connectivity and the importance of getting into the global network.  We have already heard from others that such is already provided for through the oneworld alliance and the Star Alliance, which Aer Lingus is part of in its independence status.  If the airline teams up with oneworld exclusively, it loses its connectivity and onward code share and alliances with Star Alliance.  I am not so sure that it provides Ms Quin with the upside of which she speaks.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Edmond has spoken clearly on the importance of regional connectivity.  The only way that such can be achieved is by the State's retention.  There are complications and there are difficulties.  We have seen it in Shannon in the past even with a State shareholding in how management were able to orchestrate a certain strategy that saw Shannon deprived of slots for a period of time and a lot of work had to be done since, in terms of ensuring that the board had the appropriate level of representation and was in a position to prevent that happening.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Downes, Dr. Borthwick and Mr. Healy are clear that the sale cannot go ahead.  They do not believe that the State should divest.  It is clear to me from what they say that one would not get the kind of long-term guarantees that are being talked about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#P00300","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1422540000,"counter":796,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for the presentations.<\/p> <p>  I suppose I would feel a bit disappointed over the opinion that IAG is merely going out there and stating it will improve connectivity, deliver more flights and deliver more passengers.  It was Deputy Dooley and I who put forward the suggestion of bringing witnesses in, not to scare people but because, in advance of the possibility that some group would takeover Aer Lingus, it is important we have this discussion.  I note it has been said we are scaremongering.  We are not scaremongering.  We must get answers and point out the problems and fears that we all have.<\/p> <p>  I would have terrible fears.  The chamber of commerce must consider that if there is a takeover, by all accounts and according to all of the evidence we have heard so far, there will be job losses that will affect the different airports.  That will have an effect on the economies in each of those areas.  The connectivity is not guaranteed.  The Irish Air Line Pilots' Association, IALPA, made it clear that it has happened in the past where the regulator made it clear after a certain period of time that they could not hold on to those slots, and that is what this is all about.  The Heathrow slots are vital, for the west and for all the different airports.  That is what we have got to keep our eyes on.<\/p> <p>  The last thing companies such as IAG will worry about is the regional imbalance.  They will be worrying about what they will get.  There will be staff in Aer Lingus who have vested interests and will only be worrying about the shares and the money they will get for them.  We have heard evidence of that.  There are executive managers and managers in Aer Lingus who have a vested interest in selling this off.<\/p> <p>  From a strategic point of view, why would one sell off an airline that is making money?  Passenger numbers are increasing.  Connectivity is getting better right across the country.  Why would one do it?<\/p> <p>  This belongs to the people.  I made clear earlier that the selling off of Aer Lingus and the State ending up with 25.1% has been a disaster for the country, but we are where we are.  If we further lose our control here, we will leave it at the mercy of the markets.  That would not be good for the country.  It would not be good for business because IAG will not worry about what is happening in Shannon and Cork.<\/p><p>It will be worrying about cutting costs, reducing numbers and using the Heathrow slots for other purposes.

We recognise that the existing Aer Lingus shareholding structure does not give that reassurance, as those in the Shannon and mid-west regions know very well from the experience of 2007.  In the event of any change of ownership of Aer Lingus and as a precondition of any potential sale of the Government's stake, we would look for enforceable agreement to preserve that and would not be in favour of any sale which did not protect the slots.  We are very clear on that.<\/p> <p>  Shannon Airport has been independent for two years and we are growing our passenger numbers steadily - they were up 17% in the last year.  Shannon Airport is developing well, is successful and is delivering connectivity to business users and tourism interests in the area.  We are very much about connectivity and preserving it.  We are extremely clear on that subject and the preservation of Heathrow as a key connecting hub is essential for us in that respect.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Edmond"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422540000,"counter":800,"content":"<p>I wish to respond to some of the issues raised by Deputy Dooley.

My sense is that One World can bring just as much to Aer Lingus as the other alliances.  However, I do not have facts on that.<\/p> <p>  I would see a real opportunity here for Ireland to be a key transfer hub.  We must remember that the geography of Ireland is unique, located as we are on the western edge of Europe, heading towards the Americas - South and North.

Earlier we heard from the unions at Aer Lingus that the company has grown significantly since privatisation, both in terms of profit and jobs but there is no guarantee that this will continue.  There is no guarantee of anything in the future.  Aer Lingus is at the mercy of the markets, as a private entity.  The question we must ask is this - if Aer Lingus becomes part of a large body, can it have more might to fight the markets?  We all know that the airline business is extremely cyclical.  It tends to have very big ups and downs in terms of profitability.

To clarify, the perspective of the Cork Chamber of Commerce is that there is an absence of clarity here and a lack of information.  That said, without ring-fenced, clear, legally binding guarantees as to the future of those Heathrow slots, no sale is the correct response.  We are not in that position yet and the whole process is only a number of days old.  Everyone in the debate needs clarity on the current legal position.  If it is not possible to have legal guarantees, then no sale should take place.<\/p> <p>  We must look at this from the perspective of economic activity in the Cork region.  We are particularly concerned that Cork Airport is more vulnerable than the other airports in the context of this debate.  I agree that there is potential for growth and that hubbing could bring economic advantages to Ireland.  Such advantages would primarily accrue to Dublin Airport, however, which is absolutely fine as long as it is not at the expense of activity and economic development at Cork Airport.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding Aer Lingus and its activities in Cork, the airline accounts for 45% of all traffic through the airport.  In the earlier debate, Stobart Air was mentioned, as was the Aer Lingus regional connection.  That accounts for an additional 13% of traffic at Cork Airport.  Therefore, combined, the Aer Lingus family accounts for 58% of all traffic at Cork Airport.  Anything that would threaten in any way Aer Lingus' future commitment, activity and ambition to grow out of Cork Airport is something that we could not support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#Q01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Healy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422540000,"counter":807,"content":"<p>I will try to draw together a number of issues.  First, the committee can hear the arguments we are all making here.  For everyone, connectivity is key, as is the lack of information on this deal.<\/p> <p>  We are an island economy which puts us in a very unusual space.  Deputy Dooley pointed out that Aer Lingus was part of the oneworld alliance but that was a long time ago and the issues at play then were very different from those at play now.  Ultimately, it was just Aer Lingus piggy backing off something bigger that was already in place.  It was focused on Irish people being able to get a few air miles for moving on.  There is potential here, as Ms Quin said, for Ireland to be a hub for transfer passengers.  We have advantages that other countries do not have, such as pre-clearance, for example.  Ireland is also directly on the route to the United States of America unlike Scotland, which is further north.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of job losses, I am struck by the short-term versus the long-term picture.  A very short number of years ago we were told that terminal 2 was the biggest white elephant imaginable.  Now, as I understand it, terminal 2 is almost operating at full capacity and I would imagine there are plenty of jobs arising from that.  We have been hearing for years about the catastrophe of job losses at Aer Lingus and elsewhere but Dublin Airport is booming.  As several people have testified today, Aer Lingus is a profitable company at the moment.  That must mean that its routes are profitable.  I believe the Dublin-London route is the second most active route in the world.  If these routes have all of these people flying on them, then some airline is going to want to fly them anyway.  In terms of the fear factor about job losses, I would argue that in a few years time, airports will be bigger than ever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#Q01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot"},{"type":"speech","time":1422540000,"counter":808,"content":"<p>Is Aer Lingus a member of any of the chamber of commerce organisations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#R00100","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422540000,"counter":809,"content":"<p>Yes, it is a member of Dublin Chamber of Commerce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Gina Quin"},{"type":"speech","time":1422540000,"counter":810,"content":"<p>And in Limerick and Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#R00300","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422540000,"counter":811,"content":"<p>And of Chambers Ireland.

The word \"connectivity\" looks to be the big player in this debate.  We spoke earlier about highs and lows, recessions and airlines going through bad times.  Aer Lingus has come through the biggest recession this country has ever had, and has come through it well.  We have made mistakes in the past.  That is why we need to debate the issue and to make clear decisions.  We have made mistakes as a country and cut off our nose to spite our face.  Having listened to the people from Cork and Shannon speak, we must be clear where we are going for the benefit of the country.  Let no one be codded.  If I buy something I could say I would do this, that or the other but later I will do what I like because it is my company.  No one can say that someone else will tell them what to do, because that will not happen.  That is being frank about it.  One can have all the aspirations and dreams and say this, that and the other will be put into the contract but if it does not stand up legally, which it will not, there is no point in saying it will.  People are being sold a pup if they believe things like that.  Let us be clear.  If a person buys an airline or other business, someone will not tell the owner what he or she will do with it in nine or ten years time.  Either one is the boss or one is not.  It is one or the other.<\/p> <p>  One must look at how the regional airports are getting on at the moment.  To make matters worse, when the pilots spoke to us earlier they spoke about &euro;500 million in the bank, &euro;650 million in assets and &euro;450 million in landing slots.  One does not generally sell something for a couple of hundred million below what it is worth.  Generally, one tries to make a few pounds extra on something.  In addition, it will not be beneficial to the country.  Under EU law we cannot use the money to create employment as it must go to Angela Merkel for debt repayment.  We must be clear and make decisions for the benefit of Dublin, Limerick and Cork and for the betterment of the country.  I am a firm believer that at the moment we would be better to hold on to Aer Lingus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#R00600","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speech","time":1422540000,"counter":814,"content":"<p>I agree with what my two colleagues have said.  I am surprised at the attitude of the chambers.  That is fine if they got the guarantees.  Aer Lingus is a profitable company that has done a huge amount to develop this country but when one looks at the performance of British Airways in its own market its consumer ranking is No. 17.  It is not Singapore Airlines.  It is substantially overshadowed in its home market by EasyJet and Ryanair.  I do not know what it brings to the party but it appears that for a few guarantees Chambers Ireland is happy to agree to the sale for, as the Deputy outlined, a minuscule amount of money.<\/p> <p>  I am pushed into a situation where I have to say that one should please look at what Christoph Mueller and company have done in Aer Lingus in recent years and give it a bit of support at this stage.  It is bizarre that if we got the slots we would not mind that British Airways could transfer jobs and managerial functions.

We must get a bit of life into the campaign because what I have heard this afternoon is not going to cut the mustard.<\/p> <p>  As for saying we did not know what was happening, the board agreed to something over the weekend and it is recommending the deal to shareholders.  Milk and water stuff from the chambers of commerce does not help to develop the Irish economy at all.  Let us get some adrenaline into it.  If one does not mind, that is fine, but as Deputy Fitzmaurice said, we will not get agreement to conditions anyway.  The chambers should stop waffling and either support the sale, which they appear to be leaning towards in terms of the safeguards, which they will not get, or recognise that to sell a brand such as Aer Lingus that was built up over 80 years for &euro;300 million which will go into a fund in Brussels would be extremely silly.

In its first draft it provided no real future for Cork Airport.  In that context, I would be very interested to hear of the potential opportunity for Cork Airport should a potential sale be investigated further but the potential for growth or the opportunity that might come would not in any way outweigh at this point the potential loss of the Heathrow connectivity.  That is the No. 1 priority.  I doubt very much we will get to that point, but it is worth having that particular view on the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#R01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1422540000,"counter":821,"content":"<p>I tried to get the same autonomy for Cork Airport that was granted to Shannon Airport but there was no support coming from Cork.

What are the risks to tourism and the economy in general in the areas the delegates represent and Shannon Airport?  In financial terms, how important is the Heathrow Airport link?  Some 400,000 passengers travel through Shannon Airport per annum, a significant number.  The figure for Cork Airport is approximately 400,000.

One of the key criteria for potential investors is connectivity.  If we look at how Shannon suffered from the loss of the Heathrow connection in 2007, it could not get customers in or out of the country.  Customers had to come all the way from Dublin as opposed to directly from Heathrow to Shannon, which was a huge problem.  This had a massive effect, not only on me, but on all the industry around, which relies on proximity to the airport.  Connectivity is critical and our location ticks a box for many customers throughout the world.<\/p> <p>  Recently, Genworth Financial invested heavily in opening a new facility in Shannon.  This new state-of-the-art facility was built on the basis of connectivity to Europe and onward to Asia and Latin America.  Therefore, connectivity is one of the key criteria for potential investors when making a decision to locate in a region.  Amex also recently announced a decision to open a new facility.  One of the key criteria for it was the connectivity in and out of Shannon for clients.  Similarly, other companies, such as Zimmer Holdings and Wipro bring key stakeholders in to visit the region.  The spin-off from this from the point of view of tourism is huge, because this connectivity creates an awareness of the region and people invest and spend more time in the region. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012900002#T00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Downes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422540000,"counter":848,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy O'Donnell, connectivity is critical to the position taken by the chambers of commerce on this issue.

We usually apply a multiplier of three to calculate indirect jobs, which means these 30,000 jobs support approximately 90,000 indirect jobs.
