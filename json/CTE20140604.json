The INTO is the largest teacher union in the country, representing more than 30,000 teachers in primary schools in all parts of the country.  This presentation is informed by the views of members as expressed at INTO meetings and through correspondence and communications with the organisation.<br\/>A book grant is paid to all primary schools, with DEIS schools receiving an enhanced payment.  It is paid in June each year in respect of the following calendar year.  A non-DEIS primary school - approximately 90% of all schools - receives a <i>per capita<\/i>rate of &euro;11, while a DEIS primary school receives &euro;21 per pupil per annum.  The equivalent rates at post-primary level at &euro;24 and &euro;39, respectively, are significantly higher.  This funding is made available to all schools regardless of demand.  It replaces a previous system under which schools applied annually for assistance based on verified need.<br\/>Following the announcement of the budget last October, the Minister for Education and Skills announced the provision of additional funding in the next three years for book rental schemes in primary schools.  This funding was to be in addition to the existing scheme of book grants outlined.  Under the terms of the scheme announced, disadvantaged schools were to receive &euro;150 per pupil over three years, while non-DEIS schools were to receive &euro;100 per pupil.  Schools had to apply for the grant by the end of January 2014.  However, primary schools which already had in place any form of rental scheme were specifically excluded from applying for this funding, which meant that the vast majority of primary schools were excluded.  <br\/>Some 80% of primary schools operate some form of a book rental scheme. This does not mean that each school has a comprehensive or fully functional scheme.  Rental schemes in primary schools vary from the provision of one or two books to every book required by every pupil in the school.  In many cases, the rental scheme in place in a school is a factor of parental or corporate fund-raising, the length of time a rental scheme has been in place in a particular school, the ability of a local school community to establish, administer and maintain a rental scheme and requests for assistance from parents from year to year.  In the case of the latter, the greater the demand for assistance the less need there is for seed capital to get a rental scheme off the ground.  What most primary schools had in common was very limited funding from the Department of Education and Skills for book rental schemes.  Where progress was made on book rental schemes, it was in the main due to local initiatives and local funding. <br\/>The scheme announced as part of budget 2014 drew significant criticism from individual schools and teachers, the INTO and political parties which viewed it as an announcement driven not by the needs of pupils, parents and schools but by politics.  A departmental press release announced that the Minister for Education and Skills had &quot;revealed plans to ensure that every primary school in the country has a book rental scheme in operation.&quot;  There was no reference to the fact that 80% of schools would not be funded.  There was no acknowledgement that few schools would be able to provide a comprehensive scheme, particularly given the increased demand and the decreasing ability of schools to maintain a scheme.  The Minister subsequently admitted that the purpose of the funding was to close the gap in order that every primary school had a book rental scheme.  There would, he told RTE, &quot;be no excuse.&quot;  In other words, it was not about helping all schools in order that they could help parents but an attempt to deflect criticism of inadequate funding.  It was about ministerial box ticking, rather than making meaningful, comprehensive provision for book rental.  <br\/>Some schools did not have a book rental scheme because there was no demand for one from parents.  In some of these schools there were small numbers of parents experiencing hardship and schools were able to assist them from the small annual grant provided by the Department of Education and Skills for that purpose.  The Minister&rsquo;s policy resulted in a financial gain for those schools where there was no demand for a scheme.  Schools that had followed the Department&rsquo;s advice two years previously to phase in book rental schemes were excluded from the additional funding.  These schools, many of which fund-raised to make up for inadequate State funding for school books, followed departmental advice and tried to improve the position for hard-pressed parents.  Many more schools fund-raised significant amounts and prioritised or diverted funding intended for other purposes to put full book rental schemes in place.  The policy was seen as a slap in the face to parents and teachers in these schools who were discriminated against in order that the Minister would be able to say there was &quot;no excuse.&quot;  Schools in which schemes had been established at great cost and effort by school communities saw others receive full State support.  Many schools are questioning why they would expand book rental schemes in such circumstances.<br\/>The former Minister for Education Noel Dempsey once said schools would not be penalised by the Department for making improvements.  The book rental scheme overturns this policy.  Schools that had made improvements were penalised by this approach.  The decision to exclude was made on very dubious information.  Schools were asked to respond &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; on whether they had in place a book rental scheme, with no effort made to obtain the details of that scheme in terms of whether it covered one book or all books or if it was limited to some classes or available throughout the school.  The questionnaire to schools was poorly constructed, leading to an increased anomaly, rather than a solution, on the need for book rental schemes in schools.<br\/>The INTO believes funding should be made available to all schools seeking to introduce or improve existing schemes.  Penalising schools that have struggled and made sacrifices to support book rental schemes is wrong.  Penalising schools that have diverted funding to meet other needs such as ICT and that now find themselves at a loss is wrong.  Patronising schools by saluting the initiatives of principals who have gone the extra mile with parents and teachers to put in place a book rental scheme while at the same time depriving them of funding is wrong.  Only 400 or 12% of primary schools applied for and will receive funding to establish book rental schemes.  This is good news for 400 schools, but in thousands of others parents, teachers and pupils believe they have been treated unfairly.  The Minister subsequently announced that the balance of the funding would be divided over two years among all other primary schools that operated book rental schemes.  These schools are expected to receive &euro;9 per pupil or, in the case of a DEIS school, &euro;10 per pupil for each of the next two years.  In 88% of schools the additional funding will provide little more than one additional textbook.  It is limited and will do very little to tackle the cost of textbooks in schools.  It is clear that a small number of schools will benefit from the scheme, while there is a marginal improvement for most schools.  They are being discriminated against because of the hard work of parents and teachers to establish such schemes. <br\/>The Minister needs to re-examine the proposal and make changes to ensure all schools, pupils and families are treated fairly and equitably.  It is a matter of regret that the Department undertook this work without consulting the INTO.  Such consultation would have ensured the views of teachers and principals would have been taken into account.  The union could have pointed to the flawed nature of the survey and the inequitable treatment of many schools.  Consultation should form part of any review.  The INTO has on several occasions expressed concerns about the low level of State funding to support necessitous families with school books at primary level.  Given the increased numbers of parents seeking assistance from schools, the level of funding is completely inadequate.  It is an effective cutback in the scheme and one that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>The disparity in <i>per capita<\/i>funding between primary and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014060400004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean McMahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401884700,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Could you conclude now, please?

I will outline the Department's perspective on this issue and any actions it is taking regarding same.<\/p><p>  The Department encourages all schools to operate school book rental schemes.  In the budget last October it was announced that the Department is to receive &euro;5 million from the proceeds of the national lottery licence transaction to allow primary schools to invest in book rental schemes.  Further investment is to take place over the next three years to support the establishment of book rental schemes in all primary schools that do not currently operate them.  Since then, the Department contacted primary schools that did not operate book rental schemes to advise them of the seed capital funding being made available.  Just over 530 schools that had previously indicated in their annual returns that they did not have book loan schemes were invited to apply for funding.  Of these, approximately three quarters have applied.  DEIS schools will receive &euro;150 per child and non-DEIS schools will receive &euro;100 per child in seed capital funding over the next two years to establish book rental schemes.  This will cost approximately &euro;6.7 million and will benefit more than 63,000 pupils and their families.<\/p><p>  The balance of the funding, some &euro;8.3 million, will be divided among all other primary schools that currently operate book rental schemes.  DEIS schools will receive an additional &euro;8 per pupil in 2015 and &euro;12 per pupil in 2016, while non-DEIS schools will receive &euro;7 per pupil in 2015 and &euro;11 per pupil in 2016.  This is in addition to the annual book grant that is issued to all primary schools and second level schools in the free education scheme.<\/p><p>  Since 2011, the Department has gathered information from primary schools as to whether they operate book rental schemes.  Returns for September 2013 indicate that 84% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme.  This compares to 83% in 2012 and 77% in 2011.  The position at second level is that for September 2013, some 68% of schools reported that they operate book rental schemes.  A more detailed analysis of the returns show that 55% of voluntary secondary schools, 66% of community and comprehensive schools and 88% of schools operated by education and training boards are operating book rental schemes.  Responses to a survey conducted in 2012 were disappointing and the survey does not lend itself to comparisons with the returns received in respect of 2013.  The Department will continue to request information on book rental schemes from first and second level schools annually.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014060400005#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1401884700,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Ms Anna Heussaff and Ms Nicola Winters are representing Dublin Friends of the Earth while Ms Deirdre McDonnell and Mr. John Dolan are representing the Department of Education and Skills.

Everybody knows money is desperately needed in schools.  We also know there is a climate crisis as well as a financial crisis.  Emissions must be cut as much and as soon as possible.  Cutting energy waste across the public sector is a step to address both crises.  These are cuts that do not hurt, which is not a phrase one hears very often.  In the work we have done on this issue we have found there are good policies and some good schemes, but there is no responsibility on school boards of management, which are responsible for school finances, to achieve energy savings.  There is no national data available at present to measure progress and there have been major delays by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, in publishing data on other parts of the public sector.<\/p><p>  There is no effective national strategy, that we can find, on implementation of the Government's policy that between 2009 and 2020, some 33% of energy use across the public sector will be reduced.  That is a big change.  We are almost half way to 2020, yet there is no data from the public sector.  The SEAI has been promising data from 2011 but it is still not available.  Schools will not be included in that data.<\/p><p>  How much does energy cost for schools?  The estimate ranges from &euro;50 million to &euro;80 million per year.  That is the estimate made by the SEAI as well.  Between 20% and 35% of capitation spending goes on energy.  It is a substantial amount of money.  Existing projects show that 20% of energy use can be saved over a short period of time, between one and three years, through no cost and low cost means.  The no cost means refer to behaviour change, which must be planned and targeted and not simply consist of hassling people and hoping for the best.  The low cost means include light sensors, timers and so forth.  Again, that must be part of a plan.  A 20% saving could mean an extra &euro;20 million per year for schools.  The schools would keep the money because it is part of the capitation spending and obviously they badly need it.<\/p><p>  It has been found across the board that without energy management plans energy usage does not just stay stable but increases.  In schools, for example, whiteboards are now widely used and are a great resource.  They involve a laptop and projector as well as the whiteboard.  The bulbs cost &euro;400 each and often break after a year or two.  If that single element in the school is not controlled, planned for and regulated, those costs can increase.<\/p><p>  There are two programmes in respect of energy management in schools.  They run in parallel but do not really work together.  Energy in Education is a programme set up by the Department and SEAI.  It runs a good website and provides advice to schools, talks, competitions and so forth.  It was launched in October 2012 and at the time it was said that 250 schools had used the programme.  Last January, 15 months later, it was stated that 260 schools had used the programme.  That was an increase of only ten in 15 months and only 6% of the total of over 4,000 schools.  The Department has not told schools about this scheme, certainly not by circular or by any big announcement by the Minister.  I will be interested to hear the reason for that and what is planned.  We are told that from next January all schools will be required to monitor and report not just their energy use, but also their actions to reduce energy use.  So far, however, there is only a small pilot project taking place this year for the system to make that possible.  Moving from ten schools in a pilot project to 4,000 schools does not appear likely to happen in 2015.  Again, SEAI, which will be implementing it, has still not published data from 2011 from other areas of the public sector.<\/p><p>  Second, there is the Green Schools programme, of which many people are aware.  It is a voluntary scheme run by An Taisce and is not funded by the Department of Education and Skills.  At least half of the schools are now actively involved in it at a given time.  Energy is one of six themes in the programme and schools work on it for two years.  They then move on to water, travel and other themes.<\/p><p>  Green Schools and Energy in Education are great examples of individual schools saving thousands of euro.  The measures are quite simple but must be done in a planned way.<\/p> <p>Possible actions include using timers to switch off computers overnight, switching off heating overnight and at weekends, ensuring boilers are running correctly and set at the right temperature, and making sure photocopiers are not left open, which uses five times more energy than is necessary.<\/p><p> The green schools programme does great work but has limitations.  It is not a national strategy to achieve savings of 33% in six years.  Work on energy may not continue after two years have elapsed.  Also, no data has been collected and there is no requirement for schools to do so after two years.  The programme does not have the resources to support schools to maintain reductions.<\/p><p> The OPW has done a lot of work on energy reduction in some areas of the public sector, but unless one maintains the momentum and the revised system, one will go back to square one fairly quickly.<\/p><p> The school board has no responsibility.  The green schools initiative is often co-ordinated by one person.  In most cases the principal and board will be involved, but in other cases it will be just one teacher who acts as co-ordinator during his or her lunchtime or after school and is left rushing around.  Again, there is no post of responsibility, so it is voluntary.  It is difficult to keep the momentum going and the board does not have a responsibility to see that this happens.<\/p><p> Green schools have sought a remit.  For example, they work with the National Transport Authority to implement their policy on cycling, walking to school and so on.  They have not been given the remit or resources to have the SEAI as an institutional partner to implement a national strategy.  If they had this, we could assess how many schools achieve savings, the type of savings achieved, and how to reach the target in 2020.<\/p><p> The policy seems to be falling between two stools and hoping for the best.  Rather, we should be collecting data and publishing it.  As we know, unless one has data and can measure progress, then improvements are not going to happen.  We think it is all happening far too slowly in these financial and climate crises.<\/p><p> We ask the committee to pursue with the Minister and other bodies the establishment of a requirement that all school boards have an energy management plan in action.  As part of their financial responsibility, they must report energy usage and actions from next January.  Unless that forms part of a national strategy, we are afraid that in two or three years' time we will hear the phrase \"Well, we are about to get there.\"  <\/p><p> We are not here as advocates for the green schools initiative, or any particular mechanism, but they seem to have the infrastructure to carry out the job.  If there is another way of achieving a strategy that happens now, this year and next year, then that is what should happen.  The main thing is that there is a plan and a strategy rather than just a hope that we reach 15% in three years' time and so on.  <\/p><p> Finally, we want the committee to urge the Minister, and all Government Ministers, to give leadership on the issue of energy cuts.  The fact that we can save &euro;200 million in pubic spending by cutting energy usage by 33% is rarely mentioned in public debates on the Haddington Road agreement, public sector reform, expenditure and so on.  The matter should be sent to the Committee of Public Accounts, because it is about public spending and whether it is being wasted.  We would like the issue to be raised much more widely both in education, health and other areas of the public sector.  Again, these are cuts that do not hurt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014060400005#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Heussaff","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401885300,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I call on the final speaker, Mr. Dolan, to make a presentation on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014060400006#F00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401885300,"counter":18,"content":"<p>The Department welcomes the opportunity to discuss energy in schools and our work on the area to date.<br\/>For the past 17 years the planning and building unit within the Department of Education and Skills has been using a process called the DART approach to develop policy, sustainability and energy efficiency in educational buildings.  The acronym focuses on four key areas, namely, design, awareness, research and<b><\/b>technology.  The policy is informed by the building unit's professional and technical staff.  That is driven by its technical guidance documents, which are updated by continued energy research and development.<br\/>In recognising that the programme should be about people and changing behaviours and cultures while delivering services, the approach was developed initially through the four strands of design, awareness, research and technology.  The earlier projects researched individual opportunities and tested them locally.  Energy saving measures that showed promise were further developed, given trials and monitored in various all-encompassing projects such as that which took place at Gaelscoil an Eiscir Riada, the generic repeat design, and the passive schools programme, an example of which is Col&aacute;iste Choilm.  Tried and tested successes have been incorporated into standard school design guidance documents for inclusion in all school designs for new extensions and refurbishments.<br\/>The current near-zero energy building projects, and monitoring and test results from the passive schools and Col&aacute;iste Choilm, will continue to inform the Department's technical guidance documents into the future.  These documents set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings, with a clear focus on energy efficiency.  They are based on solid energy research projects.  The Department's policy is supported by a strong research programme which currently has 45 research projects at various stages.  It has been demonstrated that all schools designed and built in accordance with the above policy and the technical guidance documents can have an energy performance that is up to twice as efficient as the benchmark for international best practice.  All new schools and extensions must achieve a top A3 band building energy rating.<br\/>Schools in Ireland, by their nature, present particular limitations from an energy conservation viewpoint.  In energy terms, they have relatively short operational hours and do not have building management specialists on site, and energy conservation is not a core function of a school.  This means that all the heating, lighting, power, water, security and communication systems, known collectively as the building services, used in schools must be robust, simple, reliable and, where possible, automated.  These have all been considered within the energy approach and building designs.  All new technologies and approaches are again tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements.<br\/>A hybrid approach is taken with respect to sustainable design in schools based on maximising natural resources and energy efficient technologies.  Schools are positioned to maximise gain from the sun during the day for passive solar heating and natural daylight.  Passive solar design can save up to 20% during the early morning heating period, and adequate natural daylight, when combined with automated lighting systems in classrooms, can eliminate the need for electrical light for up to 80% of the school's teaching hours.  Energy-efficient boilers and individual digital room temperature controls, combined with a strong emphasis on air-tightness testing of the building envelope - which is currently twice as good as Irish building standards - and insulation levels minimise heat requirements.  Water usage is minimised through automatic shut-off taps, while local water blending valves are provided to prevent scalding and rainwater recovery is provided for dual-flush toilets.<br\/>Over 40% of the research programme features renewable aspects.  These renewables include wind generation, solar hot water heating, photovoltaics, heat pumps and biomass systems.  Results have varied with respect to the application of renewables in a school environment.  Research continues in this area as technologies and economic influences develop.  In the interest of sustainability, the potential of renewables should be maximised in school design.  However, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to the application needs and not just applied for the sake of having a renewable tag on a building.  It is also critical that the demand for energy is minimised before investment in renewable energy applications takes place.<br\/>The aim of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan 2009-2020 is to ensure that by 2020 all public sector buildings with areas over 1,000 sq. m have their energy rating improved to D1 or higher.  These principles are supported by the Department of Education and Skills with significant investment through the energy efficiency insulation scheme 2009, the water conservation scheme 2010 and the summer works scheme.  Research is progressing on the development of cost-optimal levels of energy improvements which will improve existing schools' energy performance to inform future upgrades.<br\/>The sustainability and energy efficiency programme of the Department received further endorsements to its approach when a sample school building, built in 2006, was assessed in 2009 for a building energy rating.  These ratings came into being in 2009.  The school which was designed and built in accordance with the Department's technical guidance documents from 2004 received a top band rating of A3.<br\/>Sustainability awareness in schoolchildren is included in many elements of the energy research programme.  It is also provided through a dedicated programme run by the SEAI and also through the An Taisce's green flag programme.  There is a strong focus on the provision of practical guidance and direction to schools via the energy and education project.  The project was developed in partnership with the SEAI using the energy<i><\/i>website <i>energyineducation.ie.<\/i>It provides a one-stop shop based on an energy web portal designed to help school boards of management, principals, teachers, administrators, caretakers, pupils, parents, architects, engineers and contractors to improve energy use practices and to reduce school operating costs, along with helping to protect the environment for future generations.<\/p> <p>The website is supported by the Energy in Education pack, which provides practical guidance on managing energy in schools, information on involving pupils in the process, case studies and training opportunities.  The delivery of the programme and SEAI training is supported and promoted by the school patrons and management organisations through partnership with the SEAI and the Department of Education and Skills.  New buildings owned or occupied by public authorities after 31 Dec 2018 must be near-zero-energy buildings and all new buildings are to be near-zero-energy buildings by 31 Dec 2020, which to a very large extent should be from renewable sources.  Research on achieving near-zero-energy building is under way, with two new school extensions at design stage and due to commence construction this year.<\/p><p> The above approach has placed the Department and Education and Skills at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy efficiency in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both national and international level by sustainable energy boards for excellence in design specification and energy awareness in schools.

To start with the issue of schoolbooks, the INTO has already outlined and reiterated the flaws in the last scheme that was announced.  I thought it was rather bizarre that a grant scheme was announced from which 80% of schools were excluded access.  It not only penalised those who had taken the initiative and set up a scheme but sent out a message that if people were thinking of taking an initiative to set up a project next month or next year they should not bother because they would lose out in doing so.  That was a damaging message.  There was a partial rowing back on that later and the schools that have a scheme in place are getting a smaller amount.  Will the Department officials advise whether an initiative will be taken in the next budget, if it is too late for this year, to address that gap and make sure that all schools have enough money to set up and sustain a proper scheme?  That is essential.<\/p><p>  One of the issues raised is the need for compulsory book rental schemes in all schools.  All schools should have a scheme.  As a decent society we should be able to make sure that every family can afford school uniforms, books and such items, and it is to cover such items that people pay tax.  That burden should not fall to individual families.  As a society we should be able to guarantee those as a basic minimum to all primary school children.  However, the question is how do we get to that point.  We know that schools are not in a position currently to be able to do that.  Will the representatives of the INTO indicate how much it would cost to implement such a full scheme that would not only include books for some subjects or books for some school years but would give every child a full suite of books and replace them as necessary?  Is that something the Department officials see us achieving?  It should be.  <\/p><p>  Another issue that is raised regularly is e-books.  Grants for paper books are becoming redundant in many respects.  We should be moving towards the use of e-books, more so at second level, because the development of literacy and such skills require more interaction with paper books at primary level.  We should be moving more towards the use of e-books, yet they can be more expensive than paper books because of VAT.  I have raised this issue several times at the committee and we have been told it is an EU issue because of the VAT directive.  Will the Department officials indicate whether it is an issue that the Minister for Education and Skills has raised with other Ministers for education at European meetings?  Will the Government push at EU level to have that directive amended, if need be?  It was written at a time when nobody anticipated that we would be seeking to give children e-books in schools.  This needs to be revisited.<\/p><p>  On the issue of energy costs, I welcome the presentation from Mr. Dolan.  To be fair to the Department, much has been done in this respect in terms of new schools.  Much has been done in recent years to incorporate best practice and build in better designs that are energy-efficient and that help schools to save money over time.  The difficulty is that we still have many old school buildings and there is a question about how can we assist those schools.  Guidance has been produced but, again, the key issue comes down to grant assistance.  There have been small grants in the past for works such as thermal insulation, but a host of other works are needed at a national level.  We also need to be consider this issue from a climate strategy perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014060400007#G00400","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1401885900,"counter":23,"content":"<p>The Senator has now exceeded three minutes.

The presentation from the INTO, as always, was straight to the point.  There is an opportunity for the Department today to try to outline the rationale for the decision to initially allocate money for a school book rental scheme for that percentage of schools that did not operate one.  A explanation has never been given as to why it was targeting schools with no school book rental scheme in place, to the detriment of other schools that had school book rental schemes but were at varying degrees in terms of implementation.  Some would be very basic school book rental schemes.  The only conclusion one could come to, to borrow a phrase from Mr. McMahon, it that it is a box-ticking exercise by the Department to be able to say that every school has a school book rental scheme.  If that was the purpose of the initial decision, then that did not succeed, because there are 531 schools that do not operate a school book rental scheme and I understand that only 400 have applied for funding to operate one.  There are still 131 schools that have not applied under the new funding allocation.  What is the position regarding those schools?<\/p><p>  A further issue, related to the cost of school books, is the voluntary code of practice that was entered into with publishers in 2011.  The INTO might have some information on that - I am sure the Department has - and how successful it was.  One of the agreements as part of that code of practice was to offer schools a discount of up to 17.5% if they bought in bulk.  How is that being measured within the Department, and it is experience of the INTO that this is happening in practice as well as in theory?<\/p><p>  On the issue of energy costs in schools, I read the detailed submission that was made.  In the presentation it was stated that schools should have an energy efficiency plan, implemented by boards of management, and if after two to three years there is no reduction in energy costs, schools could face financial sanctions.  Could the representatives give us more information on that?  There are schools that would love to see a reduction in their energy costs but because of the quality of the buildings they are in it would be very difficult to achieve any significant savings.  Is there a percentage they would have to reach before they would like to see financial sanctions put in place?  Schools are already struggling.  We had the scraping of various summer scheme grants, although I acknowledge that they are now back in place, which schools would have used in the main to upgrade heating systems or replace windows and carry out basic remedial works to try to save energy costs in the longer run.  There is that balancing act.  I would like the representatives to tease out the issue of financial penalties.  <\/p><p>  I direct my final question to Mr. John Dolan from the Department with regard to the construction of new school buildings and extensions.<\/p> <p>Obviously, best practice is being followed, but it should be followed across the board.  How is the Department measuring its success?  Are there benchmarks?  I ask the delegates for more information on how the Department is measuring the success of these new initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014060400007#G01000","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401886500,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates.  On the book rental scheme, it is clear from the discussion that the term is too broad and should have been narrowed.  The Department will have to acknowledge that asking schools if they had a book rental scheme in place as part of a box-ticking exercise did not provide enough detail.  Some schools would only have rental schemes for the core books in Irish, English and mathematics, while others would have a scheme covering the full array of books.  It would be remiss of the Department not to acknowledge this in dealing with the issue.<\/p><p>  I ask the officials from the Department to explain why there was such a variation in the surveys and the actual returns from schools.  What has the Department learned from the differentials that have emerged?  I ask the INTO to confirm that the Department did not make any effort to engage with it in advance.  Does the Department acknowledge that this was a mistake in hindsight?  There should have been better learning before this scheme was launched.  What should have been a positive news story for schools, regrettably, turned into the opposite because of lack of engagement with stakeholders.  I ask the Department to comment on this because it was not referred to in its presentation.  <\/p><p>  I refer to the role of the boards of management of schools in this issue.  Some schools have very good boards of management, while others have very weak boards.  I ask the Department and the INTO for their views on this issue.  Are boards of management taking responsibility for book rental schemes, ensuring they represent good value for money and are sustainable?  Such schemes must be operated in a business-like fashion.  Schools cannot buy books every year and cannot be careless about it; they must use funds productively.  Sustainability is also an issue.  Boards of management have an important role to play and need to step up to the mark.  Is this being done?  Are they being encouraged and provided with guidance by the Department and the INTO?  <\/p><p>  On the issue of sustainability, I thank Friends of the Earth for its interest in these matters and its efforts to ensure the issue is kept to the fore.  The delegates are correct in their assertion that sustainability does not receive the attention it deserves.  I particularly like the slogan, \"cuts that don't hurt\".

Are there prerequisites, for example, in the context of the funding of &euro;300,000 to replace three or four prefabs with permanent classrooms?  Are there sustainability-related terms and conditions attached to the draw down of such funding?  Obviously, value for money is important, but so too is sustainability which also relates to teaching and learning methods.  Schools should be wired to meet future needs and so forth.  Several school principals have told me that they do not receive guidance on such matters from the Department.  I emphasise the difference between guidelines and prerequisites in this regard.  Boards of management also have a role to play in this regard.  While I accept that they are voluntary, schools deserve strong boards.  Talent should be available to schools from the body of parents and this talent should be used to make sure schools have good energy efficiency policies in place.

I ask the question in the light of the fact that we are moving towards a more digitised education sphere.  It is a noble aspiration towards which we should be working.  This entire conversation is taking place in the wider context of back to school costs and the costs incurred by schools which are transferred to parents.<\/p><p>  On energy costs, there are over 4,000 school buildings, many of which are not as populated as they used to be.  Leadership is required from players in the education system to find a way to reduce energy costs.  We are funding, heating and lighting a lot of schools, some of which should be amalgamated.  It is difficult to justify the existence of some schools, but that is a very difficult conversation to have in many parts of rural and urban Ireland.  I ask the INTO and the Department for their views on the issue.<\/p><p>  Last year the committee completed a report on back to school costs and one of the recommendations included in it was from the parents councils - primary and post-primary - that a financial committee be part of the structure of schools, separate from the board of management.  Such a committee would examine in detail the way money was being spent.  Parents are involved in fund-raising and often contribute directly to schools, but they do not know where their money goes.  If there was proper auditing or scrutiny of on what money was being spent, it might foster better energy awareness of the need to close windows, turn off radiators, lights, sockets and so forth when not needed.  Do the Department and the INTO have a view on the recommendation that schools have a financial committee, either as a sub-committee of the board of management or separate from it, to enable proper scrutiny of how funds are spent in schools?  If a school genuinely cannot pay its bills, despite being careful with money, the finger could point, reasonably, at the Department.  Is it reasonable to suggest having a financial committee might enable schools to find solutions to some of their problems?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014060400008#H00700","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1401886500,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions for the INTO.  In his presentation Mr. McMahon states the scheme announced as part of budget 2014 was viewed as one driven not by the needs of pupils, parents and schools but by politics.  He makes similar criticisms throughout his presentation.  To be honest, I thought the presentation was political, entirely negative and one-sided.  He did not, for example, take into account the fact that this committee had produced a report on back to school costs.  Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in was rapporteur and committee members spent a lot of time working on the report.  We organised numerous hearings which included presentations by the INTO.  We also received numerous submissions.  One of the recommendations made in the report was that the Department routinely survey schools in the schools census about book rental schemes in order that better data on the prevalence of such schemes could be maintained.  We also recommended that it be mandatory for all schools to have a book rental scheme in place to reduce or eliminate the cost of schoolbooks for parents.  We also said a five year template for the delivery of an entirely free schoolbook system, based on the UK model, should be produced.  It was after our report was published that the Minister and the Department made their decision.  I am not saying it was not flawed, but to say it was motivated by politics only is very unfair.  This is a cross-party committee made up of Government and Opposition Deputies and Senators and we came up with recommendations.<br\/>As Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in<b><\/b>has asked, how do we fund this initiative in the current economic climate, given the State's financial position?<\/p> <p>The idea behind the Department's decision was to extend the scheme to all schools and, in particular, to target the schools that currently did not have a scheme.  This involved making a budgetary choice and this was the dilemma.  Politically, any Minister would love to have money to hand out to everybody, but hard decisions had to be made in regard to the scheme.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, in terms of the current situation, that the pots of money do not exist to do all the things we should do.

The Chairman has put her finger on the button in regard to the difficulty.  My colleague across the way referred to the \"noble aspiration\".<\/p><p>  My submission is very much reflective of the perspective of principals and teachers who have been in ongoing communication with the INTO.  It is born of a frustration that as principals of schools, we all received a circular which simply asked whether we had a book rental scheme in our schools, whether our board of management or parents had done some fund-raising, whether we were proactive and whether our community got involved.  The answer in my case and in the case of 80% of schools was \"Yes\".  Then, having ticked that box, we found ourselves excluded from a laudable additional injection of finance into education.  Our frustration is born of that.<\/p><p>  Our frustration and what might be perceived as negativity is linked to this.  The difficulty is that the scheme sought to provide national remediation in an area which should have been investigated and teased out first.  I agree the laudable aspiration can be achieved and do not believe the inherent costs of doing so are enormous.  Traditionally, the book rental scheme resulted from a situation in which, for a generation, particular pupils in all schools deemed necessitous were supported.  Then, as society moved on, we tried to move from that to a concept whereby books would be available for all children.  We need to divorce these two themes.  We need a book rental scheme available to all schools, with financial support provided for it year on year.  This scheme must be separated in its entirety from a scheme that is focused specifically on necessitous pupils.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the difficulties in terms of current fiscal realities.  In an ideal world, I would like the Minister to have lots of money to divvy out, but I fully accept that is not the case.  However, I suggest the Minister could, over a period, provide a cash injection towards a book rental scheme that would be available to all schools that choose to provide a scheme.  Perhaps that could be a small amount, such as &euro;20 per pupil per year.  Then, as a principal, I would know that I could focus on English books one year and on maths or Irish books the next year.  This would be preferable to the type of scheme proposed. <\/p><p>  The remaining schools, as identified by Deputy O'Brien - approximately a quarter - have not decided to travel the particular road of book rental.  Therefore, what we are doing is reinforcing the parents, the communities and the schools that are not part of the 80% that espoused the concept of book rental and put huge time and energy into it.  This brings us to the issue of boards of management.  These boards are voluntary and the book rental schemes are administered at no cost to the State.  They are administered by parents, principals and boards of management.  We need to compliment people on the contribution they are making in this regard.  Therefore, I do not see our approach as being negative overall, but as a response to the realities we perceive - that support is inadequate, poorly focused and based on an extremely flawed perspective in regard to where the money needs to go.<\/p><p>  I will pass over to Mr. Mullan now to deal with the questions asked regarding e-books and overall back-to-school costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014060400009#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean McMahon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401887100,"counter":39,"content":"<p>The INTO supports the view that all schools should be able to offer a book rental scheme to pupils.  I do not believe we can force parents to avail of the scheme, but all schools should be able to offer it.  I suggest the Department could engage in a five-year plan of capital funding for school books, while at the same time maintaining support for necessitous pupils.  My guess is that with reasonable expenditure over five years of approximately &euro;10 million per year, we would have book rental schemes in place.  Then the amount of support that would need to be provided for necessitous pupils could be decreased.  I suggest that if we could keep a twin-track approach going for approximately five years, this could be achieved.  This would lead to a situation similar to that of other countries, which is what we would like to achieve.  The disappointment with regard to the proposed scheme is that it will not lead us to that position.<\/p><p>  The jury is very much out on the issue of e-books.  We must remember that we deal with young children from four to 12 years of age.  E-books are being introduced in second level schools and we are monitoring what is happening.  We have seen significant cost increases in schools which have moved to e-books.  I spoke with a parent this morning who told me the bill for her child who was going into second level was &euro;850.  This was for the iPad and the licence.  Admittedly, this is for three years, but it is a significant up-front cost.  We need to look at this issue very carefully and learn from other sectors.<\/p><p>  In regard to book rental, there is a cost implication, but I believe we could capitalise the scheme over five years and that this would be a positive development for schools.  Deputy Daly raised the issue of boards of management.  These boards do their work well and do so on a voluntary basis, but much of the work falls on the school principal.  Seventy-five percent of our principals are full-time teachers, but they are asked to take on overall responsibility for book rental and many other schemes.  We have reached a stage at which we must say \"Stop\" in terms of pushing an additional workload on school principals.  While they get help from many parents, who do significant voluntary work, the overall responsibility falls on the principal.  We need to look at providing more time for principals or at reintroducing posts of responsibility in schools that have been badly hit by this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014060400009#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Mullan"},{"type":"speech","time":1401887100,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Thank you.

The Minister published a discussion document a number of years ago on the cost of schoolbooks and whether book rental or other schemes should be implemented to meet the costs.  Wide-ranging consultation was held with various partners in education, national parent councils, both primary and post-primary, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Barnardos.  Following the consultation, the Minister published a report and sought feedback from the various educational partners.  Following all that effort, he decided not to change the current book grant schemes.  People were saying he should make book rental schemes compulsory, but he does not have the legal power to do so.  Therefore, the only penalty he could impose would be to withdraw grants from schools that did not operate book rental schemes.  This would bring its own issues, so he decided not to go down that route.<\/p><p>  The Minister and Department have published guidelines for book rental schemes.  These guidelines, which were a result of consultation, give examples of good practice on how to establish and fund these schemes on an ongoing basis through the contributions of parents and the use of the grants that schools get from the Department.  This documentation is available.  Special guidelines were published also in regard to parents and how they might assist boards of management and principals in establishing book rental schemes.  I make these general comments to provide some of the background on this issue.<\/p><p>  I will now deal with some of the more specific questions.  The scheme announced in the budget last October was targeted specifically at primary schools that did not operate book rental schemes.<\/p> <p>At the time the scheme was announced we could have taken the route of writing to all 3,200 primary schools, explaining the scheme and asking them whether they wished to participate.  However, we realised that we already had some information coming into the Department by means of the October returns.  Each school was asked to indicate whether it has a book rental scheme.  I accept some of the criticism that has been made at the committee today to the effect that this was a rather  naive question or did not go deep enough.  It was the question asked and that was the information we had.  As I noted in my submission, those returns showed that 84% of primary schools are currently operating a book rental scheme in some form or other.<br\/>We took that essential information, wrote to the schools involved and invited them to participate.  There is a gap between the numbers that do not have book rental schemes and the number that have applied.  We contacted the schools that did not apply.  In the main they were special schools.  Most of the 100-odd schools that did not apply for the seed grant were specialist schools.  Essentially, they said they do not operate books in the normal sense of the word and, therefore, they took the view that the scheme was not for them.  With the 400 schools now getting grant assistance it should mean that the vast majority of primary schools in future will have book rental schemes in place.<br\/>The issue of the e-books was raised by Senator Power.  I am afraid I do not have specific knowledge in that area.  It is a matter for our information and communications technology policy unit.  However, I understand the issue around VAT.  I understand that is of course a matter for the Minister for Finance in terms of ministerial responsibility.  I believe the Minister has made soundings but thus far has not been successful in having the issue addressed.<br\/>Deputy O'Brien asked about the decision to provide book grants to schools.  That was a budgetary decision.  Once we had all the applications in, we found that we could give the grants, amounting to &euro;150 for DEIS programme schools per child and &euro;100 for non-DEIS programme schools, and that it would cost &euro;6.7 million.  The Minister agreed to listen to the complaints and legitimate concerns raised by public representatives and schools about how the grant scheme was operating.  The balance of the funding in the amount of &euro;8.3 million, which has been set aside over three years, will now be directed towards those schools that currently operate book rental schemes.  The submission I sent to the committee details how that funding will be issued in 2015 and 2016.  All schools will get some of that funding.  In fact, the majority of the funding will go to schools that currently operate book rental schemes.  Funding of &euro;5 million has already issued this year to the schools that do not operate book rental schemes.  That funding issued in April and the balance will issue next year, approximately &euro;1.3 million.  The funding has already gone out.<br\/>Deputy O'Brien raised a query about the code of practice.  We do not have specific information in terms of schools that might have received discounts for buying or purchase.  I am unable to say how many schools availed of the offer from the book publishers.  I am afraid we simply do not have the information.<br\/>Deputy Daly raised the issue about the definition of the book rental scheme.  We do not have a definition whereby we can say that a given scheme is a book rental scheme while another is not.  As the president of the INTO outlined in his submission, it can vary from a number of books on a particular subject to the full range of textbooks.  For example, infant classes, generally speaking, do not have textbooks or at least not many.  Therefore, it is difficult to have a definition that we can use across the board.  I will explain the position for post-primary schools.  Next year, when we ask the question in the October returns, we will ask the schools whether they have a book rental scheme.  If they reply in the affirmative we will ask them to clarify whether it applies at junior cycle only, senior cycle only or both cycles.  We are attempting to refine the information we get back from schools in terms of the type of book rental schemes they operate.<br\/>I have already explained the differential in the returns between the 100 or so schools that have not taken it up.  I acknowledge on the Department's behalf that there was a lack of engagement with some of the education partners around how this scheme would operate.  In hindsight, we probably would do it differently.  We would certainly acknowledge that.<br\/>Reference was made to the issue of boards taking responsibility for book rental schemes.  The guidelines that I referred to earlier, published last year, put the onus on the board of management, as the school authority, to take ultimate responsibility.  However I acknowledge that <i>de facto<\/i>it is the principal teacher and the staff of the schools who operate the schemes.<br\/>Reference was made to having a general scheme whereby all books are free.  Probably in an ideal world one would be moving towards that, but it would be difficult at this stage to ascertain the cost of it.  We know that the overall book rental business, between first and second level, is worth approximately &euro;60 million per annum.  That might give the committee some idea of the cost of having a scheme that operates across first and second level whereby books are free for everyone.  Those are the issues.  If I have missed anything I can come back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014060400009#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401887700,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I wish to respond to several points that were raised and the specific question asked by Deputy O'Brien.  I am rather disappointed that the Department referred mostly to new schools.  New school design is evidently of a high standard, in particular a high energy efficiency standard but, as Senator Power said, most schools are not new schools.  Therefore, unless energy reductions are achieved in most schools then serious cost savings will not materialise for decades to come and we do not have decades to spare.<\/p><p>  The summer works scheme was mentioned in this regard.  It can help with insulation schemes.  One scheme specifically for insulation was introduced five years ago but there has been nothing since then.  Summer works schemes cover resurfacing schoolyards, toilets, furniture and all sorts of other things as well as energy issues.  Therefore, it is not a substitute for an energy policy to deal with the third element, which I did not address, that is, the retrofitting element.  Senator Power raised this issue.  The fabric in many schools is poor and they can only get to a certain point.  However, our experience is - this is the strongest message we have - that there is a good deal of low-hanging fruit with regard to energy saving in schools that has not been picked.  Green-Schools estimates that there is approximately &euro;4 million of energy saving in the schools it is working with now.  However, having spoken to its representatives I understand that if there was a proper implementation plan for all schools with targets, etc., across the board then there could be between &euro;18 million to &euro;20 million to be saved.  We argue in this country over every thousand euro that has to be saved.  Therefore, it seems like a lot of money not to be chasing and we should chase it as quickly as possible and in as structured a way as possible.  The Department did not deal with how the roll-out of monitoring and reporting by schools will happen next January, especially since there is only a small pilot under way at this time.<\/p><p>  The question of sanctions was raised.  We wanted to raise the issue because at the moment the policy seems to be that it is nice if a school does it and the Department is glad, but the Department is not actually requiring or even requesting any school to impose them to save this public money.  The main element of schools being involved is by voluntary engagement and such that the whole school works with pupils and teachers and so on.  The idea is to highlight the rewards the schools themselves would get for that effort, including the financial rewards and other rewards.  A major question remains.  If certain schools did not engage with the process or simply ticked a box to produce a plan but actually could not show that they had done the work on the low-hanging fruit and the low-technology changes that can bring a good deal of savings, then perhaps the question of financial sanctions could arise.<\/p><p>  I realise there is a legal problem with the status of schools and so on.  It is not something that we have looked into in detail.  However the point is to underline how we believe this is public spending and there are problems if schools are not being sufficiently supported and assisted, as is the case now, to gain it.  If that does arise and they are still not doing it then maybe there is a need for sanctions at some point.  Perhaps that is something to evaluate after two or three years of a national strategy actually being implemented.<\/p> <p>We have not raised the issue of the involvement of third-level colleges.  They have a large number of buildings and my colleague will make a brief point on this to give an example of what is possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014060400010#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Heussaff","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401888300,"counter":45,"content":"<p>It is interesting that one of the hearings today is on the need for funding and the other relates to cost-saving measures.

They believe there are good initiatives and policies in place at a governmental level but the issue is how they trickle down and are played out.  There must be support for implementation so students will feel responsibility for saving energy and becoming sustainable is shared across the board from the Government to society in general.<\/p><p>  In terms of measuring savings, I spoke to a green campus co-ordinator recently.  I was told of a campaign over Easter, Campus Unplugged, as a result of which phenomenal savings were made.  Those involved were surprised by the level of success.

We ran an energy electricity competition in late 2013 that was open to all schools in the country.  We received expressions of interest from around 1,700 schools.  These were put into competition and contracts were provided to be signed.  Savings in the region of 10% to 15% could be made on existing energy costs and overall the saving estimate from the competition was &euro;1 million across all schools.  This money was retained by schools that signed contracts and could be spent by them elsewhere.  To date we have received around 1,300 contracts back and they are being processed by the Office of Government Procurement and the energy suppliers.  Another 230 schools have signed up for the natural gas competitions that are being run and other energy contracts where savings can be achieved are open to schools.  These projects are ongoing and details are on the Department's website.  We are also working closely with school management bodies to involve them in promoting these competitions and encouraging schools to sign up.<\/p><p>  The issue raised at the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform is not within our area of responsibility.  There are detailed guidelines for school boards of management, particularly at primary level where they are appointed for four years.  Different rules and regulations apply to Education and Training Board, ETB, schools so we can examine the idea put forward at the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform but we would have to see how it would fit within existing structures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014060400011#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre McDonnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401888300,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I will address Senator Power's question on grants for existing schools.  The insulation scheme was carried out in 2009 and it was 100% grant-aided.  It was decided in advance that it was to be a one-off scheme and &euro;15 million was spent on it.  The scheme has not been repeated because we cannot re-insulate cavity walls and attics that have already been insulated.  The water conservation scheme took place in 2010 and cost &euro;7.4 million.  It was 100% grant-aided and all schools could apply.  This year's summer works scheme focuses on mechanical, electrical and roof-related matters so the goal of energy saving is a significant element though not the sole motivation.  Some &euro;60.3 million will be spent on this.<\/p><p>  We are working with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, on contracts to attract private finance to improve energy performance in schools.  Our energy and education website gives clear guidance on low-cost and no-cost opportunities for schools to maximise potential and reap the low hanging fruit.  Any energy savings made in this scheme are kept by schools.<\/p><p>  On Deputy O'Brien's question relating to the imposition of penalties, our goal is to encourage energy saving by allowing schools to retain any financial savings made.  We do not favour the imposition of penalties.  On measuring the success of our schemes, we pilot all new technology and designs that are used in schools because we aim to ensure that something works before it is rolled out across the country.  In some ways we view schemes that do not work as more successful than those that do because they allow us to ensure faulty technology is not rolled out nationally, becoming a headache for school principals and caretakers.<\/p><p>  We aim for a building energy rating of A3 for new schools and this must be proven by the design team.  This is achieved through modelling as designs are developed.  The end results are tested.  For example, air tightness testing is carried out independently to ensure it is satisfactory.  The more airtight a school is the less heat will leak during the night and the less heat will be needed in the morning to bring it to the requisite temperature.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Daly's question, we have publicised various schemes, including the energy and insulation scheme and the energy and education scheme, which was launched with a press release by the Minister in 2012.  Our partners in education tell us that the problem is there are only good news stories on energy and education matters and such stories do not receive coverage.<\/p><p>  I will now address guidance, prerequisites and the issue of ensuring that our work is future-proof.  We decided that energy saving should be incorporated into school technical guidance documents so that it would not be treated as an add-on that could be removed when budget issues dictated.  Some people are unaware of our energy saving policy because it is a core function of the design that we insist upon.  The school we tested in 2009 was built to 2004 guidelines in 2006 and got a top band rating of A3 so this is evidence that we try to render our schools future-proof as much as possible.  The new building regulations will apply next year and our guidance documents from 2004 indicate we will have little to do to satisfy the next generation of building regulations.  We continue to future-proof as much as possible in the education sector with an emphasis on the reduction of maintenance and running costs for schools.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred to the amalgamation of schools and this is a choice that is open to schools that may have the benefit of a modernised building with lower operating costs for those involved.  Regarding financial committees, on our energy and education website we try to focus on the entire school community.  In my submission I read the long list of people at whom the website is targeted.  It is a whole-community approach and the tools are provided in our energy and education programme.<\/p><p>  The matter of monitoring and reporting on schools and public bodies is the remit of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland under legislation.

Clearly, the Minister's press release did not cut it with regard to publicising the scheme.  Is the Department considering issuing a circular or engaging with schools on a proactive basis rather than just stating that there is a scheme in existence and that schools have not, for whatever reason, engaged with it?  Schools themselves may not even know of the existence of this scheme.<\/p><p> Mr. Ryan indicated that there is no information available in respect of the voluntary code of practice and that, therefore, it is not possible to gauge the success of the school book rental scheme.  I do not know if the INTO has any information in respect of this matter and I accept that it may be unfair to put its representatives on the spot in terms of asking them to answer that question.  A commitment was given to the effect that schools which bought school books in bulk would receive discounts.  However, we do not know if this is happening in practice.  How can we measure the success or otherwise of the scheme?  How will we know whether we should move from a voluntary to a mandatory code of practice?  We do not have basic information in this regard.

That is a matter of opinion.  I am of the view that he does possess that power under section 7 of the Education Act 1998, which clearly outlines the role of the Minister and bestows extensive powers upon him or her.  The section does not specifically state that he has the power to introduce a school book rental scheme but it does say that he has the power to implement policy decisions and ensure good quality educational outcomes.  If one of those outcomes were to be the introduction of a mandatory school book rental scheme, it could be done by means of the introduction of a statutory instrument as opposed to primary legislation.  As already stated, it is a matter of opinion.  The Minister possesses the relevant power and perhaps the officials from the Department could investigate the matter further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014060400011#L00600","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401888900,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I refer to the discussion document the Minister circulated in 2012 and the fact that we examined this issue at that stage.

I suspect that the real issue is that he is of the view that it would be unreasonable to introduce a mandatory scheme without providing schools with the necessary funding.  Perhaps it is easy to say that he is hiding behind the legislative barrier when the reality is that a mandatory scheme could not be introduced unless funding could be made available to schools.<\/p><p>  I inquired earlier about the gap in funding between schools that are setting up schemes under the new initiative and those which already have schemes.  I appreciate that &euro;8.3 million is being given to the remainder of the schools but that still equates to &euro;20 per pupil for DEIS schools and &euro;18 per pupil for non-DEIS schools introducing schemes now, as opposed to &euro;150 and &euro;100 per pupil for schools which already have them.  There is a huge gap in this regard, which is unfair.  In the context of the forthcoming budget the Department should be seeking money to bridge that gap.  Priority should be given to finding money for school book schemes.  I accept the point that only &euro;6 million was available to begin with and that a policy decision was made to the effect that the best way to use this was to focus on a small number of schools.<\/p><p>  We can argue about the equity of this but it must be accepted that the current position whereby one school is receiving &euro;20 per pupil while another is getting &euro;150 is unfair.  As the INTO representatives pointed out, the school in receipt of &euro;20 per pupil might not have a big scheme in place and may only have just introduced it.  These schools may only have a handful of books as they begin rolling out their schemes and they will not then have the funding necessary to allow them to catch up.  That is unfair and perhaps our guests from the Department will seek to procure additional funding in this regard in the forthcoming budget.<\/p><p>  In the context of energy, it was recently brought to my attention that schools which erect their own wind turbines cannot sell power to the grid.  This issue was raised with me six or nine months ago by the management at a rural school and when I raised it with the Minister, he confirmed that schools cannot sell power they produce to the grid.  Has any further consideration been given to this matter?  The school to which I refer is in a location where there is a great deal of wind.  There are some 4,000 schools throughout the country and many of them would be in locations similar to the school in question.  Small schools could, if they so desired, erect small wind farms to meet their energy needs and any excess could be sold to the grid.  Surely these are the type of projects to which we should be giving consideration.  I do not know if any action has been taken in respect of this matter in the nine months since I was contacted by the school to which I refer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014060400012#M00900","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1401888900,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Mr. Ryan referred to questionnaires being be sent to post-primary schools.

The Energy in Education programme is proceeding, but - this is not a criticism of the SEAI, as it may be short of resources, with three people at most working on its entire public sector programme, of which education is only a small part - it takes a long time to publish any data, and we are still waiting for 2011 data, never mind data from 2012 or 2013.  I am anxious about how long it might take it to roll out monitoring and reporting by schools.  It is good to have guidance available, but if there is no plan for how many schools will be engaged over a particular period of time, we will be here in three or six years stating that it is a pity we did not get this done faster.<\/p><p>  Green-Schools has an infrastructure for engagement and relationship with schools which seems to be considerably more extensive.  Proposals have been made to make its programme more structured and medium-term, but these have not happened either.  Our concern is that the opportunity for savings is falling between these two stools and is not being realised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014060400013#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Heussaff"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401889500,"counter":70,"content":"<p>The SEAI has met Green-Schools to see whether there are gaps, and we do not believe there are.

In some cases the actual cost of books amounts to one third to one half of all costs of so-called \"book bills\".  Arts and crafts and PE are required subjects in primary schools but there is no funding for them.  ICT has not been funded in schools for several years and, as was pointed out, the cost of one bulb in a classroom can be substantial.  There is no equipment grant for an infant classroom.

The first of two particular amendments will provide for a formal internal review process in respect of certain decisions on the operation of the HAP.  The second will make the necessary amendments to the social welfare code subsequent to the introduction of the HAP.  There are also a number of amendments to section 49 on foot of views expressed by the Minister for Social Protection during the consultation process on the Bill.  These amendments are, in the main, designed to streamline the legislative provision for direct deduction in order to bring it into line with legislative and operational requirements in the Department of Social Protection.  We have also tabled an amendment to allow the Housing Finance Agency to lend to the Local Government Management Agency.  A number of other minor amendments will be tabled, as is the case on most Bills.

The fundamental objective of the amendments is to relax the rent arrears disqualification by not applying it where the housing authority or approved housing body is satisfied that the household's failure to keep up the repayments of rent arrears agreed to under rescheduling arrangements is due to circumstances beyond the household's control, for example, because the tenant has been laid off from his or her job.  Amendment No. 1 relates to section 8(2)(f) of the Bill and provides that a tenancy warning relating to rent arrears shall, in setting out the possible consequences of not paying off rent arrears, refer to the relaxation of the rent arrears disqualification where non-payment of rescheduled payments is due to factors outside the household's control.<br\/>Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 to section 23 are linked with and update the rent arrears disqualification relating to the purchase of a dwelling under Part 3.  Amendment No. 18 amends section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 to relax the existing rent arrears disqualification from eligibility for social housing support in the manner I have outlined.  This amendment also extends the disqualification to cover arrears of rent owed to an approved housing body, as well as a housing authority.<br\/>Amendment No. 20 makes three amendments to the 2009 Act, two of which relax the existing rent arrears disqualification from eligibility to allow tenant purchases of newly built or newly acquired local authority housing under Part 3 of that Act or, under Part 4, local authority apartments.  The amendments extend the rent arrears disqualification to cover arrears of rent owed to an approved housing body, as well as to a housing authority.  Amendment No. 20 also deletes from the 2009 Act the requirement that an incremental purchaser of a newly built or newly acquired local authority house will, during the charge period, obtain the prior written consent of the housing authority to carry out material improvements to the house.  This will make it easier for purchasers to improve their homes, with consequent benefits for the construction sector generally.<br\/>Amendment No. 27 amends the new subsection (5A) proposed to be inserted in section 20 of the 2009 Act.<\/p> <p>The amendment brings the disqualification from continued social housing support relating to rent arrears into line with the other disqualifications relating to rent arrears by providing that a household in arrears of rent shall not cease to qualify for social housing support where the household's failure to repay rent arrears in accordance with rescheduling arrangements is, in the opinion of the housing authority or approved housing body concerned, due to circumstances outside the household's control.  The main purpose of these amendments is to disapply the various statutory disqualifications from social housing supports relating to rent arrears in cases where the household's failure to meet repayment commitments is due to circumstances beyond its control.  It is an easing of the situation in light of the fact that for many people the reason they cannot repay is because they have lost their jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014060400002#A01000","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401874200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Sometimes the arrears are not real arrears in that owing to staffing issues, local authorities only review cases annually and a person may lose his or her job following a review resulting in a change in his or her circumstances for that year and this is only amended the following year.

Under current law a joint tenant may seek an excluding order against the other joint tenant of the dwelling in specified circumstances.  Amendment No. 2 provides that where a possession application is being sought in the District Court on the grounds of anti-social behaviour, the court will be empowered to treat the possession application as if it were an application by a housing authority for an exclusion order under section 3 of the 1997 Act, as revised.  Effectively, if the person engaged in anti-social behaviour is a joint tenant the court has the discretion to consider making an excluding order against that tenant rather than making a possession order that has the effect of putting the entire household out of the dwelling.

Some of the anti-social behaviour in this area is being caused by minors.  According to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na there is very little it can do when there is a minor involved.  While I acknowledge that the Bill does not provide for an excluding order in respect of minors, I am seeking a multi-agency approach to address the anti-social behaviour problem.  It is often the case that particularly vulnerable people are being terrorised by five, six or more youngsters who are aware they are above reproach.  This issue needs to be addressed.  I do not believe this is necessarily only a court issue.  It is also a child welfare issue in that often these youngsters are not attending school.  There is a whole range of issues involved.  While the issue may not be one for address in this Bill there is a need for a different approach if we are to break the cycle of anti-social behaviour.<\/p> <p>It can be a very costly cycle.  I am aware of someone who has caused extensive damage to public and private properties - I refer not just to one person but to several - and this is behaviour that has been replicated around the country.  How can we deal with the situation?  What legislation covers these activities?  What legislation can impose a legal obligation on local authorities to engage with other agencies?  Unless one legally forces change, one will not change the culture of how the situation is handled.<\/p><p> I will outline my experience of what happens when a tenant liaison officer is involved.  He or she will deal with the situation and will liaise with a juvenile liaison officer if there is one.  Often one finds that problems at home have led to such behaviour.  The problem will not be resolved unless one gets the ringleader, breaks the cycle and demonstrates that there are consequences to their actions.  Moving them on is not good enough.  The problem must be tackled head-on.  Moving them on just means they will do exactly the same thing somewhere else, which is true where minors are involved.  The agencies should be required to do something about this type of behaviour and resolve these cases, perhaps with the aid of child welfare training and a JLO, which several of us have sought for many years.  That must be done before things get out of control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014060400003#B03300","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401874800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>We have all come across cases of anti-social behaviour involving minors.

If I recall correctly, a person had to be in a house one or two years - it may have been three years - before becoming eligible to purchase it.  Is this the type of arrangement with which the Minister of State intends to continue?  What does she have in mind in that regard?<\/p><p>  Another issue is the availability of mortgages.  I presume it is exactly the same arrangement that would apply in the event that a person is turned down by a bank or a building society or two banks.  In such cases the local authority can consider funding a mortgage.  There have been significant problems with some of the mortgages offered.  For example, this does not apply to tenant purchases.  In the case of shared ownership loans, what lessons have been learned about the age profile of people who wish to purchase but who are unable to buy or are significantly in arrears because their work circumstances have changed?  Has this occurred mainly where people are in affordable housing or houses on a shared ownership basis?  From my experience of people going through the local authority in looking for a mortgage, the criteria are stricter.

Unfortunately, this will remove many people from local authority waiting lists and it disregards the wishes of many who would enter into short-term agreements as a step towards being accommodated on a more permanent basis in local authority housing.  There is a feeling that what is proposed in the Bill may distort the figures and will not allow people to understand the real issue, namely, that sort-term measures will not solve our long-term problems.  Giving 90,000 or 100,000 people on a housing waiting list HAPs is a short-term measure and it will not allow us to meet our obligation to assist these individuals on a long-term basis.  I am concerned that there may be a perception that this legislation provides the means to solve short-term problems while it also seeks to tick the box of solving our long-term difficulties.  Of course, it will not solve the latter.  The amendment would replace the word &quot;shall&quot; with the term &quot;not&quot; in order that people will not be removed from waiting lists and will, like others, still be able to avail of long-term solutions.

It goes to the heart of a policy shift which began with a document produced by the Department in either 2011 or 2012.  That shift involved a move away from direct provision of council housing to a situation where the provision of social housing was outsourced to landlords.  This was slightly glossed over by what is a positive idea, namely, that if a person happens to be in receipt of housing support, there should be no disincentive for him or her to work.  Such a disincentive currently exists under the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  That element of what the Minister of State is trying to do is positive.  In addition, it is both sensible and positive that all of the matters in question should come within the remit of local authorities rather than a plethora of agencies or Government Departments.  However, what is proposed in this section presents a major problem.  In the first instance, people are going to be removed from the housing waiting list.  Essentially, it states that a short-term solution is, in fact, a long-term one.  That is absolutely not the case, particularly because we are institutionalising and making permanent a massive outflow of public money into the pockets of landlords.  The latter is incredibly wasteful and we need to move away from doing it.  The major difficulty with what is proposed in this regard is that it is just not going to work.  Landlords are running away from arrangements of any sort which involve local or rent allowance.  They either state - in the most horrendous and discriminatory manner - that they will not accept these arrangements or they run away from agreements with tenants for whose business they were desperate a number of years ago when matters were not going so well.<\/p><p>  This is just not going to work.  It is also going to cause major problems in terms of relationships between tenants, landlords and local authorities.  As matters stand, nobody knows who is responsible for what.  For example, landlords are discussing matters with tenants which perhaps they should be bringing to the attention of local authorities.  Questions are also arising as to who is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of properties.  I wonder whether councils have proper oversight in respect of matters of that nature.  There are major problems in respect of this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014060400008#G01600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1401877200,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Landlords who signed up to RAS are now withdrawing from it.  The latter is much more advantageous than the HAP scheme in that it involves 92% of the market rents.  I do not know which landlords are going to rush to sign up to the HAP scheme in the first instance, particularly as it will be less advantageous than RAS from the point of view of the income they will receive.  There are many aspects to what is proposed which, in theory, are correct.  However, difficulties are going to arise both in the context of the number of landlords who sign up to the scheme and the amount of money that will be available in the form of rent paid.<\/p><p>  I completely agree with the point Deputy Cowen made with regard to people being removed from housing waiting lists.  At present, and as already stated, landlords are withdrawing from RAS.  This means that certain families who thought they would be able to remain in the same location for five or then years are on the verge of being homeless and councils are being obliged to find alternative accommodation for them.  Reference is continually made to Irish people wanting to buy houses but there is an extremely large cohort of individuals who, as a result of their income levels, do not fall into that category.  Those who surrender their local authority houses and enter RAS find themselves in a very precarious situation because of a lack of available accommodation.  If there are no guarantees for these people, then they are in trouble.  In the context of the waiting list, they are being placed ahead of those who are homeless because local authorities gave them a commitment and they now feel a sense of obligation to them.<\/p> <p>This is an exercise in massaging figures rather than dealing with a housing need where people can believe they have a home rather than a temporary arrangement that meets their needs temporarily.  We must see this as somebody's home rather than somebody else's property that the local authority will rent temporarily.  That may be fine in terms of crisis management or for a small cohort of the people on the waiting lists, but they should not be removed from the permanency a local authority house would give them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014060400008#G01700","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401877800,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I support amendment No. 22.

The reality is that the money is going into the pockets of the private landlords already.  One of the core objectives of the scheme is to bring all social housing supports under the umbrella of local government of which the housing assistance payment, HAP, is one.  That will enable the State provide a more integrated and streamlined service for households seeking support to meet housing costs.  That is the purpose of doing it.<\/p><p>  I am aware that it is getting more difficult to get a landlord who will accept rent supplement at the caps available.

Part 4 of the Bill would effectively be providing for the management of rent supplement by housing authorities and in so doing would lose fundamental benefits and opportunities provided by the new scheme.  Undoubtedly, the introduction of the HAP as a social housing support is a major change but the intention of it is that people who have social housing support needs are brought under the one system and in that sense, the local authority has certain obligations to them.  It does not mean there will not be short-term rent supplement, which we will deal with later, but short-term rent supplement will continue for people who lose their jobs, for example, and are in urgent need of support etc.  Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014060400009#H00500","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1401877800,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014060400009#H00600","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1401877800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is saying that anybody who enters these agreements goes off the housing list, therefore, there is no permanent housing solution for those people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014060400009#H00700","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1401877800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I did not answer that the first time.

All of us have examples but I came across a case only yesterday.  It involves a recently separated young woman with two children who cares for her mother also.  She was offered short-term rental accommodation under RAS in a location that did not suit not just because of the situation with her mother but the difficulty for her children and not wanting to move them at such a distressing time for them and the family.  However, in refusing that accommodation she has reduced points in terms of a permanent solution.  That cannot go on.  It cannot be such that there would be a sleight of hand on the part of those in authority to give the impression that they are solving a housing crisis when, with all due respects, they are doing no such thing.  Fifty thousand people are accommodated through this scheme.  Is the Minister telling me we do not have a problem with those 50,000 because they are in short-term rental accommodation?  That is not the case, and we have to call a spade a spade.  Those people should still be considered for long-term, permanent solutions, and they should not be cast aside because of that.  I do not abdicate responsibility for my party being a party to the RAS, which similarly has deficiencies in that regard, but this issue is resulting in a huge crisis.  If we are serious and fair to people, that is fine.  If, in the short to medium term, the only solution that can be offered in a certain circumstance is that of short-term rental accommodation, we should not penalise people in terms of the opportunity they might have for a permanent solution because they take that.  To think that a system is penalising people in that scenario is wrong, unfair and absurd.  We have to stand up against that.  There should be no sleight of hand, massaging of the figures or misrepresentation of the current situation.  It is too serious an issue with which to play games.

Tenants do not see it that way.  Objectively, that is not the case because the tenant is dealing with a private landlord.  A private landlord can pull out of the arrangement or may not maintain the house to the same standard required of a local authority.  I have some advice for anybody in a HAP or RAS scheme.  They should take photographs of the inside of the house as soon as they move in because in two or three years' time they may find that the landlord will blame them for problems in the house which are to do with their failure to maintain the house.  Those are serious issues that have arisen.

It will point out the growing dependence on the private sector to provide housing over very many years.  Deputies all feel very strongly that we should be providing more social housing and I would like to provide more also.  It will have to feed into the process as time goes on to see what is cost-effective for the public purse, what the demands and pressures are and how the scheme beds into the system we already have in place.<\/p><p> The specific amendment relates to a general obligation to stay within available resources.

The amount that people are paying for rent is being understated where they are making arrangements with landlords to pay extra.  I do not know anyone in my area who is not paying additional amounts under the table, to the point where some of them are going hungry.  There has always been flexibility within the rent caps for very special cases.  I know of a young woman with very premature twins who is homeless.  Those babies are homeless and due to go home to I do not know where.  They are in intensive care and their case was put to the Department of Social Protection, which relaxed the rent cap by &euro;50 per month.  There is nothing I can find that comes anywhere close.  There are hundreds of euro in the difference for any accommodation that can be found.  If that is not a serious situation and cannot be regarded as an exception, I have no confidence that the limit being imposed on the Minister of State by the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be workable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014060400011#K00200","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1401879000,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I heard on the grapevine that the Limerick phase is not going terribly well, but we shall see.  I take the point the Minister of State makes about creating pressure in respect of the long-term solution, which is council housing.<\/p><p>  The more I think about this, the more I want to object.  The Minister of State says this does not fix us to the rent caps.  If there is flexibility and local authorities exercise it, they will just exhaust their budgets at a certain point and have to turn people away.  This is happening.  I was talking to Wicklow County Council yesterday about a particular woman who has a severely autistic child.  She was in a hotel which kicked her and the child out - probably because it is coming to the summer holidays.  She is now out on the street.  She went to the local authority on Friday and whoever she was dealing with just said, \"Sorry, we have nothing for you.\"  I rang the senior housing official and said \"You have an obligation to this woman.  She has a severely autistic child.\"  She said \"Sorry; the budget has run out.  I agree with you and am sympathetic, but the budget is gone.\"  She said there was nothing to give this woman.  I do not know where the woman is today and will have to talk to her later.  She is out on the street with a child who has severe special needs.  That is the problem.  Therefore, the legislation should provide that housing needs must be met, not that a local authority must work within certain financial parameters.

The reality is that we have had homeless people lugging children around trying to find places.  They need help to do this.  If there is no role for local authorities in approaching landlords or providing a mechanism to approach them, a huge burden is placed on people.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, people are certainly topping up on rent supplements across the board.  It is quite common.  When we introduce HAP, how many people will fall by the wayside?  I worry that we will have an issue in terms of what funding will be provided by the local authorities.  Some tenants will certainly try to talk to landlords to top up, which is something we want to avoid.  Unless there are rent controls, which the Minister of State has said she is looking at, whether they are tied to the cost of living or some other mechanism, we will continue to come back to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014060400011#K00400","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1401879000,"counter":265,"content":"<p>None of us wants topping up to happen, as it impoverishes people.

operation of the HAP.  The review process proposed is based on that provided for in section 10 in respect of the review of tenancy warnings.  The proposals for review are made in recognition of the fact that housing authorities have, on request, operated for many years without statutory underpinning their own procedures for internal review of their decisions.  The Department of Social Protection also has statutory review and appeal procedures for its rent supplement scheme, parts of which are being taken over by the HAP.<br\/>The amendment proposes the insertion of a new section in Part IV relating to the HAP which will provide that, on request by a HAP recipient or applicant, a housing authority will undertake a review of a HAP decision made by a housing authority affected the household that is in a class of decisions prescribed as being reviewable under the section.  A review request must normally be made within eight working days of the decision, outlining the grounds for the request and indicating whether the household or a member of the household wishes to make oral representations to the housing authority.  Provision is made for the extension of the period for making the review request in extenuating circumstances, but, in any case, this would not exceed 16 working days from the date of the decision.<br\/>The chief executive officer of the local authority will appoint a local authority official who was not involved in the original decision and is senior to the official who made the decision to carry out the review.  The reviewer will review the decision as if the matter were being decided for the first time and on the basis of the information available to him or her at the time of the review.

That amendment inserts a new section 50 into the Bill making a range of amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 that are required as a result of the introduction of the new housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.<br\/>Subsection (1) of the proposed new section 50 of the Bill amends section 196 of the 2005 Social Welfare Act as a consequence of the provision in Part 5 of the Bill for the introduction of mandatory direct deduction of rental of rental contributions due to housing authorities from the welfare payments of local authority tenants and tenants of HAP-assisted dwellings.  The amendment to section 196 of the 2005 Act will ensure that persons cannot, as a result of meeting their social rent liability, rent or rent arrears through direct deductions from their social welfare payment, claim supplementary welfare allowance as a consequence of meeting this cost.<br\/>Subsection (2) of the proposed new section 50 of the Bill amends section 198 of the 2005 Social Welfare Act.  Section 198(3F) provides for the entry points for rent supplement.  Paragraph (a) of that enactment currently provides that those who qualify for social housing support have an entitlement to rent supplement.  The proposed amendment provides that where HAP is in place in a local authority area for the class of household that has been prescribed under section 48 of the Bill, of which the rent supplement applicant is a member, those customers will no longer have an entitlement to rent supplement but instead must be accommodated under the HAP scheme.  If HAP is not in place in a given local authority area, and HAP is being introduced on a phased basis, qualifying for social housing support will continue to be an entry point to rent supplement.<br\/>Rent supplement will always continue to be paid to clients already in the private rented sector but who, generally because of a loss of income through unemployment, require short-term income support to pay their rent.  Rent supplement will therefore over time return to its original intention of being a short-term payment.<br\/>The amendment at subsection (3FA) will remove entry to the rent supplement scheme for persons with long-term housing needs who have been deemed by a housing authority to be qualified for social housing support under a social housing assessment pursuant to section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 2009.  This amendment will also remove entry to the rent supplement scheme for persons residing in homeless accommodation or in an institution for periods of at least six of the previous 12 months where these categories of household have been deemed qualified by a housing authority for social housing support within the previous 12 month period.<br\/>Subsection (3F) is amended to clarify that access to rent supplement is closed to those deemed to be qualified for social housing support by a housing authority but that this closure is dependent on the local authority concerned being specified in regulations to apply Part 4 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 2014.  By inserting &quot;subject to subsection (3FB)&quot;, the legislation allows for the fact that HAP will be phased in across local authorities in stages.<br\/>Subsection (3F)(a) is to be inserted after subsection (3F) as a transitional measure to protect existing rent supplement recipients in local authority areas when HAP is available.  This provision is to protect those who change address or who leave rent supplement for short periods, for example, to take up employment or educational opportunities.<br\/>Subsection (3FC) stipulates that rent supplement will be closed to those who have been residing in homeless accommodation or an institution for a prescribed period if they have been assessed as being qualified for social housing under a social housing assessment pursuant to section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009<br\/>Subsection (3) of the proposed new section 50 of the Bill inserts new subsections (3G) and (3H) into section 198 of the 2005 Act.  To facilitate the transition of long-term rent supplement recipients to the housing assistance payment, it is necessary to prescribe the duration a person is on rent supplement before they are required to apply to a local authority for social housing support.  As a consequence of a housing needs assessment, this period will be prescribed in secondary legislation and will be agreed by both the Department of Social Protection and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.<br\/>Subsection (3G) has been inserted to allow a designated person in the Department of Social Protection insist, after a prescribed period, that a rent supplement recipient applies for a housing needs assessment and provides proof of the application within a six week period.  Sub-paragraph (3G)(a)(iii) confirms that if this proof of application is not received, ongoing entitlement to rent supplement will cease. <br\/>Sub-paragraph (3G)(a)(ii) has been inserted to allow a designated person to give a further six weeks, a total of 12, to a rent supplement recipient to provide proof of a housing needs assessment application if they deem it justified.  If the proof is not received within this further six weeks period, sub-paragraph 3G(a)(ii) allows for the cessation of the rent supplement.<br\/>Subsection (3G)(b) is necessary to allow for the cessation of a rent supplement payment if the relevant housing authority informs the designated person that a rent supplement recipient has not provided, within the allotted timescale, additional information requested by them to properly carry out a housing needs assessment.

It provides housing authority tenants with the facility to deduct rent directly from their weekly social welfare payments.  Currently, some 34,800 housing authority tenants use household budgeting to pay their rent.  In the short term the household budget facility will support housing authorities in the collection of rents from social welfare recipients during the early roll out of HAP.  The Department of Social Protection has committed to developing a direct deduction facility in respect of social rents and it would be intended that a deduction system developed for rent and rent arrears would operate in a somewhat similar basis to that operated by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection for the deduction of the property tax.<\/p><p>  Engagement between both Departments and the Local Government Management Agency is ongoing regarding the necessary systems and supports in this development.

I need to examine the detail, but I urge the Minister of State to think about this.  We may find that many will be told they are off the system because they did not comply with requirements and will not receive any rent allowance because they did not move correctly into the HAP scheme.<\/p><p> Another issue I would like to mention may not be covered in the detail of the Bill.  People on the street often have great difficulty in providing an address.  I am aware of a number of cases in which people who have offered the address of a sister or a brother have problems because this is not acceptable.  For example, a guy in D&uacute;n Laoghaire who is from the town has a bad drug problem but is trying to kick drugs.  There is no place for him in Bentley House, the homeless accommodation centre in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  As a result, he is sent into town to find accommodation, but he will not go because there are people with a chronic drug problem in the accommodation and he thinks he will have no chance of getting off drugs if he goes there.  If he was provided with accommodation in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, he believes he would be okay.  Faced with the option of going to Cedar House, he says he would rather sleep on the street, but the Department of Social Protection will not accept this.  It states that if he does not stay in Cedar House, it will not accept his claim.  These issues need to be examined in order that we do not have an unfair and rigid system under which people will be axed and told that if they do not carry out a certain action, they will be off the system.  While I do not know how we can legislate for this issue, I wanted to flag it.  I will study the Bill in more detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014060400015#O01400","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401882000,"counter":353,"content":"<p>If I heard correctly, rent supplement will continue to be paid in the absence of the availability of another payment.

The amendments have been drafted in consultation with the Minister for Social Protection and will streamline the legislative provision for direct deduction to bring it into line with the legislative and operational requirements of the Department of Social Protection and tighten up appropriate references to social welfare legislation.<br\/>Amendment No. 31 replaces the definition of &quot;net scheme payments&quot; in the Bill.  The revised definition defines net scheme payments as the amount payable to a person under a social welfare scheme after any deductions have been made in respect of social welfare overpayments and-or as required under an order of the court.  The revised definition also provides clarity on the social welfare payments and amounts from which rent or rent arrears may be deducted, including the personal social welfare rate, allowances for qualified adults and dependent children and other appropriate allowances.<br\/>Amendment No. 34 defines &quot;weekly rate&quot; in section 49 and is consequential on the acceptance of amendment No. 41 which defines that term in subsection (4) in the manner provided for in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005.  The effect of the two amendments is to transfer the definition of &quot;weekly rate&quot; to a subsection dealing specifically with rent arrears thereby avoiding any suggestion that rent deductions will be similarly confined.<br\/>Amendment Nos. 35 and 36 are minor amendments which will require that upon making a rent related deduction from a social welfare payment in accordance with a request from a housing authority, the Minister for Social Protection shall, as soon as is practicable, notify that authority that the deduction or partial deduction has been made.  This provision will standardise provisions in the Bill relating the function of the Minister for Social Protection in notifying the housing authority of deductions made or not made in accordance with section 49.  The amendments are linked to amendment No. 46 which provides access for housing authorities to information held by the Minister for Social Protection as to why rent related deductions might not have been fully made from social welfare payments.<br\/>Amendment No. 37 is a minor amendment to section 49(3)(<i>c<\/i>) which is necessary to take account of systems limitations in the Department of Social Protection which cannot automatically provide the amount of social welfare overpayment being deducted by the Department and for how long that will continue.  As amended, subsection (3) will require that the Minister for Social Protection notify the authority concerned that a deduction has not been made.  As with the previous two amendments, amendment No. 37 is linked to amendment No. 46 providing access for housing authorities to information that would allow them to assess the level and extent of overpayments in this regard.<br\/>Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 are linked technical amendments which delete the reference to an end date for a rent arrears deduction to take account of the new subsection (6) which it is proposed to insert in section 49 by way of amendment No. 45.  The new subsection (6) deals comprehensively with the circumstances in which a housing authority request for a rent related deduction will cease to have effect.<br\/>Amendment No. 41 defines the term &quot;weekly rate&quot; in subsection (4) in the manner provided for in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 and, in effect, replaces the definition of that term in section 49(1), which is proposed to be deleted by way of amendment No. 34.  The effect of the two amendments is to transfer the definition of &quot;weekly rate&quot; to a subsection dealing specifically with rent arrears, thereby avoiding any suggestion that rent deductions will be similarly confined.<br\/>Amendments No. 42 and 44 are minor amendments which will require that upon making a deduction in respect of rent arrears from social welfare payments in accordance with a request made by a housing authority, the Minister for Social Protection shall as soon as practicable notify the authority that the full deduction, partial deduction or no deduction has been made.  This provision will standardise provisions in the Bill relating to the function of the Minister for Social Protection in notifying the housing authority of deductions made or not made in accordance with section 49.  The amendments are linked to amendment No. 46 which provides access for housing authorities to information held by the Minister for Social Protection as to why rent related deductions might not have been fully made from social welfare payments.<br\/>Amendment No. 43 deletes paragraphs (<i>b<\/i>) and (<i>c<\/i>) of section 49(5) of the Bill as published.  Section 49(5)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Bill mirrors a corresponding provision in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 in respect of deductions relating to social welfare overpayments and would allow the Minister for Social Protection to deduct rent arrears in excess of 15% of the personal rate where the social welfare recipient consented to the deduction.  I have reviewed the provision in consultation with the Minister for Social Protection and decided to delete it on the basis that it could place the social welfare recipient at risk of destitution.<br\/>Amendment No. 45 proposes to insert a new subsection (6) into section 49 dealing comprehensively with the circumstances in which a housing authority request for a rent related deduction will cease to have effect.  This will occur either when the housing authority terminates the request or submits a new request in respect of the same social welfare recipient or on the second anniversary of the start date specified in the request.  Ultimately, the amendment will avoid the possibility of a deduction continuing to be made indefinitely through the failure of a housing authority to terminate or replace the deduction request.<br\/>Amendment No. 46, to which I have already referred provides that where the Minister for Social Protection is required to notify a housing authority of the amount of a deduction in respect of rent or rent arrears which has not been made, the Minister will enable the authority concerned to access relevant information on the deduction in the manner and for a period to be agreed between the Minister for Social Protection and me.<br\/>Amendment No. 47 proposes to amend section 49(11) to reflect the fact that the effluxion of time is only one reason for which the Minister for Social Protection may not be able to duly pay the balance of net scheme payments to a relevant recipient.  If made, the amendment will allow the provision to apply regardless of the particular circumstances in which the balance of net scheme payments is not paid duly out to a relevant recipient.<br\/>Unfortunately, I cannot accept Deputy Catherine Murphy's amendment No. 40 as the ceiling in the Bill of 15% of the weekly personal rate of a social welfare recipient for deductions in respect of social welfare overpayments and rent arrears is the same as the ceiling for recovery of social welfare overpayments only in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014060400016#P01900","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401882600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>To speak to amendment No. 40, 15% represents a sizeable amount of money and would impact very harshly on families with children in circumstances in which the social welfare payment for dependent children is small anyway.

I remember being contacted about the property tax by a person who asked if the Department of Social Protection could deduct it, which would be a cheaper way to pay.  The person would not have to pay the monthly amount in the post office if that were the case.  The answer from the Department of Social Protection was that it could not do that as it would bring the person below the supplementary welfare rate deemed necessary for that person to live.  It was the basic minimum rate on which a person could live.<\/p><p>  This could have the effect of drawing people below the supplementary welfare rate.

The published Bill already provides for certain amendments to section 31, rent schemes and charges, of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  The additional amendments required now arise from the transitional arrangements decided upon for the introduction of local authority rent charging under section 31 of the 2009 Act and the consequent need for bespoke arrangements for charging rent contributions on HAP beneficiaries during the transition period for section 31 local authority rent charging.<br\/>Amendments Nos. 50 and 51 are technical amendments which are consequential on and allow for the making of the substantive amendment, No. 52.  The latter amendment provides for the insertion of two amendments in section 51 of the Bill to make necessary substantive amendments to section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  A new paragraph (h) is inserted into section 31(6) of the 2009 Act empowering the Minister to prescribe that among the matters to be included in a rent scheme is the manner in which a housing authority shall determine rent and charges for local authority and rental accommodation scheme dwellings under section 31 and the considerations to be taken into account for that purpose during a transitional period that will expire on a prescribed date falling not later than two years after the rent charging provision of section 31 comes into operation.  Under the proposed paragraph (h), in determining section 31 rents during the transitional period, housing authorities will have to have regard to the other provisions of regulations under section 31 and any ministerial guidance issued to them in the manner under section 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.<br\/>A new subsection 6(a) is also inserted into section 31 of the 2009 Act empowering the Minister in respect of the transitional period for section 31 rents payable by local authority and RAS tenants to prescribe the rent contributions payable to a housing authority on behalf of a household in receipt of housing assistance, having regard to the composition, financial circumstances and ability to pay of the household.<br\/>The introduction in this Bill of a transitional period for section 31 rents for local authority and RAS tenants will put back the introduction of section 31 rent charging, which was originally expected to take place on 1 January 2015 after the elected members of each housing authority would have made their first rent scheme under section 31.  I now expect that housing authorities will start to charge rents under section 31 from 1 July 2015.  This necessitates the extension of the period of a transitional rent arrangement for tenants of housing authorities that were amalgamated or dissolved on 1 June, as was provided for in paragraph 14(4) of Schedule 4 to the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  This transitional arrangement provides that former tenants of these councils will pay rent to their successor authorities at the rates of their dissolved authorities until the section 31 rent scheme comes into operation on 1 January 2015.  Amendment No. 52 will extend that transitional arrangement until 30 June 2015, the day before housing authorities begin to charge rents under section 31 of the 2009 Act.<br\/>Basically, these deal with the transitional period for the new rent scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014060400018#R04400","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1401883200,"counter":419,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 52 is included in this group.

People who had been on the housing list for ten years or more now find that they must go back and start all over again.  That does not make sense.

By all means the local authority can consider their application, but giving them priority is a problem in so far as local authorities are entitled to make their own allocation schemes.  Under section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, a housing authority can determine the order of priority in which it makes allocations to individual households in accordance with its allocation scheme.  Section 22(5) allows the housing authority, having regard to any regulations made by the Minister in that regard, to reserve dwellings available for allocation in its area in respect of particular classes of household, forms of tenure, and households transferring from other forms of social housing support.  The making of an allocation scheme is a reserved function of the local authority.  In providing for specific allocations and prioritising for same, it is important to have regard to those vulnerable groups that are in greatest need but also to avoid measures that would have unintended consequences for the different categories of need.<\/p><p>  My concern about accepting Deputy Cowen's proposal is that those who have availed of RAS would get priority and that would have the effect of constraining the local authority in terms of applying its own allocation scheme.

It is important to note that much of the legislative reform programme on European banking union has now been completed.  This banking union work is designed to address the risks posed to financial stability by the banking system.  However, banking is just one part of the picture regarding credit intermediation.  A substantial and growing element of credit is provided by the so-called shadow banking system which facilitates the provision of credit to business through the markets as an alternative to bank funding.  As we near the conclusion of the new banking union framework, attention in Europe and across the world is now turning to the large shadow banking regulatory agenda.<\/p><p>  Shadow banking is a broad term which covers a range of activities in the area of non-bank credit intermediation.  It is important to note that shadow banking activities, which include securitisation, securities lending and repurchase transactions, constitute an important source of finance for financial entities.  It includes entities which raise funding with deposit-like characteristics, perform maturity or liquidity transformations, allow credit risk transfer and use direct or indirect leverage.  It is broadly accepted that shadow banking needs to be regulated because of its size, its close links to the regulated banking sector and the potential systemic risks that it poses.  There is already some regulation of the shadow banking sector through the existing undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities, UCITS, directive, the alternative investment fund managers directive, and other EU legislation.  However, some would argue that this provides only partial regulation and further measures are required.<\/p> <p>It is in this context that the European Commission has brought forward its proposal to enhance the regulation of money market funds, which constitute possibly one of the most prominent sectors of shadow banking.<br \/>Money market funds are collective investment schemes which bring together demand and offer short-term money.  They act as an important source of short-term financing for financial institutions, corporates and governments.  To corporate treasurers, money market funds offer a short-term cash management tool that provides a high degree of liquidity.  They are mainly used by corporations seeking to invest their excess cash for a short period, for example, until a major expenditure such as payroll is due.  In Europe they are generally established as undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities, UCITS, under the UCITS directive and thus have a passport which allows for their sale across the European economic area, EEA.  However, they can also be established under national laws of member states and fall within the scope of the alternative investment fund managers directive.  As UCITS, they comply with European Securities and Markets Authority guidelines on money market funds.<br \/>There are two types of money market fund: those of which the net asset value - that is, the value of the assets held by the fund - is allowed to float, the variable net asset value, VNAV, fund, and those of which the net asset value does not float, namely, the constant net asset value, CNAV, fund.  A CNAV fund seeks to maintain a stable &euro;1 per share through the amortisation - or writing down - of any loss or gain in value over the life of the asset, rather than valuing at the market price on a daily basis.  This kind of fund holds a particular attraction for corporate treasurers beyond its usually limited yield.  The stability in the price of the fund allows for investments to be treated as similar to bank deposits in corporate accounts.  By contrast, a VNAV fund is priced according to the market value of its assets at a particular point and thus its value floats in accordance with the markets for its underlying assets.  It would not be correct to say it would be a straightforward matter to require all CNAV funds to convert to VNAV funds.  There is evidence that most CNAV investors would leave money market funds altogether, rather than redirect their funds into VNAV money market funds.<br \/>The intention behind the money market funds regulations is to deal with the perceived risk of runs on the funds.  In summary, the regulations propose the following measures: that money market funds will be required to have at least 10% of their portfolio in assets which mature within one day and another 20% which mature within one week; they may only invest in money market instruments, deposits with credit institutions, financial derivative instruments and reverse repurchase agreements; they will not be permitted to invest more than 5% of assets in money market instruments issued by the same body or 5% of its assets in deposits made with the same credit institution; they may not solicit or finance an external credit rating; they must identify the number of investors in the MMF, their needs and behaviour and the amount of their holdings; they must put in place sound stress testing processes for the fund; and CNAV funds must have a 3% a capital buffer or convert to a VNAV fund.  In broad terms, these are the additional regulations being proposed by the European Commission.<br \/>The total money market funds sector in Europe amounts to some &euro;1.3 trillion in funds.  This is shared between VNAV and CNAV funds.  CNAV funds are favoured by US investors and the Irish funds industry hosts up to &euro;300 billion worth.  The question, therefore, of a specific regime for the regulation of CNAV funds is of particular interest to Ireland.  As structured, the proposals for the added regulation of CNAV funds pose a risk to the future of the CNAV funds sector of the Irish funds industry.  We have been advised by the European Commission that the additional requirement for a CNAV buffer arises from a perception that these funds are riskier.  It is argued that the apparently fixed price of an investment in a CNAV fund lulls investors into a false sense of security and that there is a market perception that the value of these funds is guaranteed.  In the event that assets depreciate, the fear is that the investment manager will no longer be able to hold the net asset value steady and that investors might not get &euro;1 or $1 back for each &euro;1 or $1 they put in.  When that happens, the CNAV fund is said to have broken the buck, so to speak.  Such events are rare and seen as dramatic and could be a cause of market instability.  The Commission's intention is to require buffers which would require investment managers to place aside a percentage of the value of the CNAV fund to act as a safety net in times when the fund's assets devalue to such an extent that there is a risk of the buck being broken.<br \/>We agree fully that shadow banking needs to be robustly regulated and that the risks to financial stability arising from such banking are recognised and addressed.  There is no room for complacency in markets regulation.  We support the general approach taken in the European Commission's regulations and are keen to play a full part in the debate on all elements.  We will engage in the debate on each of the measures I outlined.  The Department of Finance will approach the forthcoming Council working parties in a constructive and open-minded manner and with the hope of securing a proportionate approach to the regulation of both CNAV and VNAV funds.<br \/>Members might recall that in the European Parliament recently there were mixed views on the approach to the capital buffer for CNAV funds, with many MEPs arguing, in particular, that the potential negative impact on the industry was not fully understood.  This resulted in consideration of the regulations being postponed until the election of the new Parliament.  We will be highlighting this concern at the Council and encouraging a greater focus on and assessment of the consequences of this proposal.  In particular, we will be making the point that the 3% capital buffer for CNAV funds is seen by many as excessive and potentially dangerous.  In the context of a product which operates on very tight margins and at a time when interest rates are at an all-time low, the cost of funding a 3% buffer could render these funds uneconomic.  Should this occur, it would amount to an effective ban on CNAV funds.  Commissioner Daniel M. Gallagher of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, made this point well last year when, at an open meeting of that organisation, he stated:<blockquote>[O]ur economists believe that in order to act as a bulwark against default risk or run risk, a buffer would have to be so large that it would not be economical for money market funds to continue to operate.  And, conversely, if the buffer was small enough to be economical, then it would provide no protection against events like the ones experienced in 2008.  This is not news.<\/blockquote>We will also be reflecting concerns that the effective ban on CNAV funds might damage both the funds industry and European markets generally.  The European Systemic Risk Board acknowledged this in its report on the regulation of money market funds.  It stated, in the context of the possible imposition of more onerous conditions on CNAV funds, that: <blockquote>[T]here could be a sudden outflow from European CNAV funds to other jurisdictions or alternative products.  The consequences of this happening could result in a serious impact on the pricing and availability of short-term funding for European borrowers, in particular banks.<\/blockquote>Europe hosts some &euro;400 billion in CNAV money market funds.  If CNAV funds were effectively prohibited, this could have the effect of driving much of this funding out of the European banking system or distort liquidity in unpredictable ways which could include a withdrawal of liquidity from all other banks and a movement of liquidity outside the European Union.  Demand for European short-term paper could easily be undermined.  At a time when the European Union is trying to broaden sources of funding for Europe&rsquo;s businesses and, in particular, SMEs we must be very careful that we do not accidentally frustrate those attempts here through an overly narrow focus on regulation.<br \/>While there are risks associated with the creation of large buffers, there are alternative measures put forward to mitigate run risks and these can apply to all open-ended funds.  Such measures include liquidity fees and redemption gates to prevent runs on either VNAV or CNAV funds.  Liquidity fees would require a fund of which the liquid assets fall below a given percentage of its total assets to impose a fee on all redemptions to act as a disincentive to redemptions, while redemption gates would permit a fund to restrict or suspend redemptions for a period if it came under particular stress.  We will be supporting these as better alternatives to the buffer approach to CNAV funds in the Council negotiations.<\/p> <p>We will also be pointing to continuing developments in the United States where the Securities and Exchange Commission is advanced in its deliberations on how best to approach the regulation of money market funds.  It is examining several approaches, but it has already made it clear that it sees capital buffers as the least effective way to achieve the goal of mitigating run risk in money market funds.  The financial markets are global and both the United States and the European Union have repeatedly stated the regulation of these markets should be co-ordinated.  It is important that we try to co-ordinate the EU-US approach to the regulation of these funds.<\/p><p> The introduction of differing rules across jurisdictions may result in the intentions of one set of legislators or regulators being frustrated, or result in unintended consequences, amplified by the international market for money market funds.  A case in point is the actions taken by the Federal Reserve in 2008 when it introduced support mechanisms which eased pressures on US money market funds and improved the liquidity position of such funds but separately affected European money market funds which did not have similar support mechanisms.  We will, therefore, seek to align developments in Europe with those in the United States.<\/p><p> The Department of Finance has been consulting a range of stakeholder interests on this issue.  We have also been in contact with the European Commission and other member states.  It is clear to us that while some differences of view remain on how best to enhance the regulation of money market funds, there is a growing appreciation of the concerns we are raising about the proposed approach to CNAV funds.<\/p><p> Our objective is to achieve enhanced regulation of money market funds as a first step towards the harmonisation of the regulation of Europe&rsquo;s shadow banking sector.  Within this broader objective, we are seeking to achieve an outcome to the Council working party deliberations that ensures proper, effective and proportionate regulation of both types of money market funds so as to allow the safe development and growth of this market sector in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014060400003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Carrigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401891900,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I am not sure whether this meeting is being broadcast live.

The Financial Stability Board has done significant work.  The first question the Chairman asked concerned shadow banking and the entities involved.  The Financial Stability Board has urged that we look at activity rather than the entity involved.  It is a question of determining whether it is shadow banking activity, rather than whether an entity is engaged in shadow banking.  The board has done work in which the largest 20 economies have been involved.  An issue arose concerning the question of whether one should try to identify whether there was credit facilitation, or whether an entity was providing credit, and whether there were maturity transformations.  A bank takes in deposits on a short-term basis - through a current account or a money on demand arrangement, for example - and that money is lent for mortgages or to finance businesses over five, ten or 15 year periods.  One examines these types of activity and ascertains what types of entity are involved.  The money market funds sector does fall into this context in Ireland because it is acting like a bank in a sense.  The securities the funds are buying are financing businesses or banks.  Therefore, it is not just bank paper that money market funds are purchasing; they also purchase paper issued by corporates.

On behalf of the Council of Ministers, the European Commission holds regular consultations with the USA on developments in this area.

We do not reflect that structure.  The USA is looking at solutions around its particular structure.  I do not think, therefore, that we will be able to have things that closely harmonised.

I was just thinking that if we were to forget about the term \"shadow banking\" and simply use the term \"banking\" as most of us do - it is just a matter of different products - it would not be high street banking.  If one were to look at the solutions being offered, instead of having a capital reserve or buffer, the solutions the Department is suggesting are that there be liquidity fees and redemption gates.  To consider this in terms of ordinary banks and apply what the Department thinks should be applied to shadow banking, there would be no capital reserves in the banks.  If people wanted to withdraw money and the banks did not have it available as their assets had declined in value, there would be redemption fees.  That means I would be charged more by the bank to withdraw my own money or that the redemption gates would apply and there would be a complete ban on withdrawals where assets had declined to a certain level.  I find this extraordinary.  I understand completely the fact that Ireland has the bulk of the market in a European context, but we must deal with the consequences.<\/p><p>  I want the Department to look at the solutions it and the industry are putting forward.  The industry has a vested interest and is making huge profits on these billion euro shadow banking funds.  The Department is mirroring the industry's proposals.  If the Commission were to agree with liquidity fees, for example, if a fund's liquid assets fell below a given percentage, liquidity fees could be imposed.  If liquidity fees were to be imposed on a fund operating in the State, would it not send a signal to others who had invested in other funds?  Could it potentially escalate a run where one manager had imposed liquidity fees?  There is a similar issue with redemption gates.  Some of the funds entail &euro;120 billion worth of assets.  If a fund at that level managed in the State were to trigger redemption gates and forbid anyone to redeem from the fund for a certain period, would it not cause an escalation of events and trigger problems in other shadow banking funds?  Would it potentially cause problems within the wider banking sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014060400006#G00400","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401892500,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question which shows a good understanding of the issues and debate under way.  In case there is any misunderstanding, I clarify that we are not proposing soft regulation of money market funds.  We are fully behind enhanced regulation and the securing of the sector.  Our aim is to secure the sector and regulate it in a way which does not strangle it and lose the industry to elsewhere in Europe, which is a real concern.  The question is whether money market funds have equivalent pay buffers to those for the banks.  I outlined in my opening statement the range of additional enhanced regulation procedures which had been introduced which might not apply to banks and I place the matter in that context.  There is a limitation on what these money market funds can do with the funds.  Money market funds can only have 10% of the portfolio of assets mature within one day and they must have another 20% maturing within one week.  They can only invest in money market instruments, deposit with credit insitutions, financial derivative instruments and repos.  They will not be permitted to invest more than 5% of their assets in market instruments issued by a particular body.  There must be a dispersion.  There are various other matters, all of which are aimed at reducing the risks associated with the funds.  These are minimal risk funds which are very restricted in the way they can be operated.  Therefore, we are not comparing like with like when comparing these funds to banks.  The 3% buffer proposed does not compare, therefore, with a similar buffer in banking where the actual capital buffers are calculated based on risk-rated assets.  If the buffer was calculated based on risk-rated assets in this context, it would meet many of our concerns.  The risks are very low with these funds compared to the risks taken by banks.<\/p><p>  The funds are for professional investors only.  These are investors who know the risks they are taking and are managing their funds.  Much of the capital requirement for the banks is designed to protect ordinary consumer investors.  Mr. Gilvarry might discuss the differentiation in approach to the calculation of funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014060400006#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Carrigan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401892500,"counter":479,"content":"<p>On the point Deputy Pearse Doherty made on the banking side, if one puts one's money on deposit in a bank, capital requirements apply.  The capital requirements apply in order that if the loans or investments made by the bank are bad, there is a buffer in place to prevent depositors from losing out.  On top of this, one has deposit guarantee schemes.  As Mr. Carrigan outlined, money market funds are for professional investors.  With the 3% buffer, one is not taking into account whether money is invested in high quality, short-dated sovereign debt.<\/p> <p>An example would be if one were investing in German government paper, which has a three-month maturity, or in what people would call peripheral debt within Europe, which would be seen by the markets as higher risk and which would give a higher return.  From a banking perspective, if banks are involved in riskier loans, the capital requirements under CRD IV and the CRR would require a greater buffer because of the risk involved.  This could mean that a money market fund that is facing some pressure on its buffer would take greater risks to try to make greater returns than the fund so that it does not have to replenish the buffer from its own resources, because it is no different from investing in very high-quality safe assets and maybe taking a risk to try to get that extra return.  From a banking side, one is looking at different risk ratings based on the riskiness of the asset, whereas for this 3% buffer, it is much more of a blunt tool and does not take those risks into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014060400006#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver Gilvarry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401893100,"counter":481,"content":"<p>While I acknowledge completely that there is a difference between shadow banking and banking, the same argument made by Mr. Gilvarry in terms of the buffer could be applied to the capital of any bank where the capital is being eaten into and the bank takes riskier initiatives to build up its capital.  That is a catch-22 system.  Mr. Gilvarry also spoke about this being very low-risk and about German government bonds.  Only 3% of the entire amount managed by these constant funds are government debt.  That is the problem.  Distinctions have been drawn in terms of the US model and there have been calls to converge with this model.  With the constant model in the US, 80% of the funds are going into government-secured debt, which is completely different.  We cannot compare apples and oranges.<\/p><p>  Mr. Carrigan mentioned that this was low-risk and diversified.  That is fine, but - correct me if I am wrong - if I invest &euro;10 billion into one of these funds, under this constant net asset value model, I am guaranteed to get &euro;10 billion back.  The bank does not do that.  While they have limited the risks in terms of how they are diversified, when the asset decreases in value there is absolutely no buffer.  Not one cent is set aside to deal with the losses that would be incurred.  With the best investors in the world, nobody predicted the collapse of 1998 and previous collapses.  Therefore, shortfalls arise that have been made up by financial institutions in the past that do not set aside buffers for those scenarios.  If we are just looking at it from a jobs perspective in respect of Ireland, I can understand why we would tell Europe to go and stuff itself, because we dominate the market in Europe, but this is a very dangerous and risky enterprise if we are not providing any type of capital buffer for any collapse in the constant net asset values of these funds.  The two solutions put forward by Mr. Carrigan have also been put forward by the industry and seem to be supported by the Department.  If the two solutions - the additional liquidity charge and basically refusing to allow anybody to withdraw money from the funds - were given effect, would that not cause a greater problem?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014060400007#H00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401893100,"counter":482,"content":"<p>First of all, we are at the outset of a negotiation at European level, so we are not determining.

I have a few comments relating to what the Deputy said.  It is not our intention to guarantee corporate investors that they cannot lose money if they invest in these funds.  There must be the possibility of losing money.  However, these are low-risk funds and the risk of losing money is less because it is for turning over cash on short term.  There is a possibility that these funds might lose money and in that case, the concern of the Government is financial stability.  The Government's concern is to ensure that a run on the markets does not occur as a result of a sudden fear and to put the necessary protections in place - not to protect an investor against losing a bit of money but to protect financial stability and ensure that something does not build into a run.  The benefit of gates and liquidity fees is that they limit the rate at which money can be taken out in the event of a sudden impact and, therefore, provide time for a correction and for the market to adjust.  It contributes to stability, not to protecting corporate investors.<\/p><p>  It has been pointed out that the latest figures will show that 11% is invested in government-secured debt at the moment, but that is just a small point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014060400007#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Carrigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1401893100,"counter":483,"content":"<p>It is still a long way off the US model, under which the figure is 80%.

Mr. Carrigan mentioned a number of times that he is not in favour of light-touch regulation.  I put it to him that this is light-touch regulation because, again, he has not be able to convince me that the solution he is putting forward would be effective.

What Mr. Carrigan is suggesting goes against the grain of what the European Commission is suggesting, which is that there should be a minimum buffer.<\/p><p>  I would obviously be concerned if there were an impact in terms of job losses, but has the Department carried out any independent research rather than just listening to what the industry is saying, which is that it will close shop and move out?  Has the Department carried out any independent research regarding the impact of these funds?  If one were to talk to AIB, or if Richie Boucher or David Duffy were sitting here and we told him we were intending to increase the banks' tier 1 capital ratio to 15% due to a regulatory requirement, he would tell us the bank would have to close up shop, but it would manage it.  Banks have managed increases in requirements under Basel I and II by increasing fees.  It has been shown that an increase in fees of up to 3% would be required.  That is what the industry is telling us, but I could say one could probably split the difference to get the real figure.  Multinational companies and banks are investing their money in these funds.  Nobody sitting around this table is investing his or her money in these funds.  Yes, there are pension pots, but at the end of the day, if these funds collapse, who picks up the tab?

The issue with rehypothecation is that once a proper framework is put in place, sufficient collateral must be provided.  If, for example, the bond was valued at &euro;100, the fund would only lend &euro;90 in cash to ensure a buffer of over-collateralisation.  If there is any movement in the value of the collateral, further cash calls can happen.  However, an issue can arise if the asset is further lent on through the chain and something happens.<\/p> <p>If one of the parties to which this asset in essence has been passed fails, where does the asset lie?  Who owns the asset?  Within the money market fund regulation that is proposed, rehypothecation by money market funds will not be allowed.

We saw in the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008 that there were strings of collateral about which nobody knew.

These money markets are creating a casino in speculation that is at yet another remove from any control or probably understanding of state authorities and the public and, against that background, like on the financial transactions tax, FTT, when the EU recognised that these instruments are dangerous and potentially destabilising for the European economy and want to take some action to regulate it, Ireland yet again says that while we would like to regulate and while we see the need for it, we ask that there not be too much regulation because we might lose out.  That logic will scupper the FTT and has prevented us from imposing it and the same logic is being applied in this opaque area of international financial speculation.  Could Mr. Carrigan respond to that allegation?<\/p><p>  The Member, referred to by Deputy Twomey, who has raised alarms about these instruments says that one of the key features at the heart of the financial crisis was the move by banks away from prudential lending practices.  Banks began to lend way more money than they had and when the loans went bad, there was a massive hole. We ended up with a massively destabilised economy and somebody had to pay the piper.  Is this not the same?  Money markets are so far away from prudential banking practices as to be a dangerous example of the over-financialisation of the international economy and we should try to rein them in completely, if not stamp them out.

That is a risk I can get.  Let us take the risk of investing, for example, in afforestation because that will lead to jobs and the development of an energy source, social housing and so on.  However, this measure facilitates risk in an opaque area.  We do not know what is being lent to whom or for what purpose but it seems primarily to be about speculation on prices going up and down and the value of assets going up and down.  I do not see how that can be anything other than a dangerous activity.<\/p><p>  The FTT is a revenue-raising measure but one of the key reasons it was first proposed was to regulate the financial services sector, which many people in Europe rightly said was out of control and needed to be cooled down by imposing a tax on it.

It would make available to the banks liquidity that would otherwise be tied up in those corporates and provide funds which could then be used to finance the economy.  We think there is something worth regulating here.  We want to maintain money market funds and grow them in Ireland and Europe, and we want to enhance their regulation to protect against any abuse.  We believe that proper regulation is being achieved.  That is why we have representatives of the Central Bank with us today.

If we did not have such a concentration of funds of this type, would we be supporting a European proposal for a 3% buffer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014060400011#M01100","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1401895500,"counter":546,"content":"<p>The question was already asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014060400011#M01200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401895500,"counter":547,"content":"<p>There is a financial stability aspect as well.  Even if this industry was not here, we must consider what the money market fund industry is investing in.  It is investing in securities issued by entities.  On the whole, those entities are financial institutions.  On the points Deputy Pearse Doherty made in relation to the pressure on money markets in 2007 and 2008, and the pressures on the banking system because of runs on money market funds, we saw that affecting the system overall.  Even if these funds were not here, we would have to look at the financial stability concerns for any institution based in this jurisdiction outside the money market funds - let us say, on the banking side.<\/p><p>  The other matter we have to factor in is the point Deputy Pearse Doherty made on the French market.  The French market, 99% of which is a variable net asset value market, has suffered significant runs as well, in 2007 and into 2008, and there have been a number of academic papers on that.  The Boston federal reserve and also the Bank of Canada have highlighted that, and so has the Central Bank of Sweden, Sveriges Riksbank.<\/p><p>  The issue we face here with the 3% buffer, and whether we support it, is that this sector is internationally focused and, unless there is international co-ordination, it moves offshore.  Our issue with regard to the links to and concerns for the banking system is that those securities will still be issued by the European banking system and our own banks and money market funds outside this jurisdiction will be able to purchase them, so there is still a risk in relation to pressure on money market fund instruments and the banking system.  If we impose a buffer, that basically means the industry will move offshore.  That is why it is so important that we see international co-ordination between the two main jurisdictions, Europe and the United States, where these funds are based.  The point is that the buffer is very much for constant net asset values, but we saw runs in variable net asset values as well, which were equally damaging to confidence within the banking system and the financial market system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014060400011#M01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver Gilvarry"},{"type":"speech","time":1401895500,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I have one brief comment and then a question.

We are delighted to welcome them to this meeting.<\/p><p>  Diplomatic relations between our two countries were established relatively recently.  We opened an office in Maputo in 1996 and the first embassy in 2006.  Mozambique's ambassador is accredited from London.  The relationship between our two countries has grown very strong, principally founded on Ireland's overseas aid programme.  The goal of our aid programme and the identified outcomes are consistent with the Millennium development goals set out by the United Nations.  I am particularly glad to see that access to and availability of land and water, two subjects that are very dear to the heart of Irish people, have improved significantly with Ireland's support.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to note the great economic strides that Mozambique has made in recent years.  This has been reflected in the comments made by the IMF Managing Director, Christine Lagarde when she said: \"The gains of the last decade, during which many countries in sub-Saharan Africa saw sustained high rates of economic growth and an impressive reduction in poverty, have been nothing short of remarkable...\".  That statement from a very powerful woman on a country like Mozambique is great credit to what has been done in the past 20 years since the end of the civil war which tore the country apart.  The country has gone from strength to strength.  We are delighted and we are also delighted to have such a strong relationship with Mozambique.  The State visit during 2006 by our then President McAleese was very important.  Equally the State visit by President Emilio Guebuza today will foster stronger relations between our two countries.  It is not just the President who is here but he is accompanied by four Ministers and a delegation from parliament.  That is evidence of the strength of the relationship between our two countries.  It is against this background that President Emilio Guebuza has arrived.

We appreciate the level that our bilateral relations have achieved and the commitment to its consolidation.<\/p><p>  Peace in our country came from the decision of the nation to bring to an end many years of conflict that killed more than 1 million people and wrecked the social and economic structure of the country.  Today, despite the challenges we are facing head on, the political landscape in Mozambique is one of stability and peace where civil liberties, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, assembly and association, free movement of people and political parties are guaranteed by law and have been in fact the right of our citizens.<\/p><p>  Democracy has found its roots in Mozambique and the scars of poverty are being bravely attacked by our people, regardless of the challenges ahead.  There is no peace without development.  There is no development without peace.  That is the reason that our approach to development at national, regional and international levels is based first and foremost on the need to secure and preserve peace and stability.<\/p><p>  The continuing process of reconciliation, democratic consolidation, building of solid and inclusive democratic institutions are among the highest priorities of our Government.  Let me reiterate that we are committed to the consolidation of democracy and political pluralism, as we believe those shared values are essential for development and stability.  In this context we are now preparing another electoral cycle, the fifth since our first general elections in 1994, which followed the Rome Peace Agreement in 1992.  After holding the fourth local elections in 2013, Mozambique will hold presidential, parliamentary and provincial elections on 15 October 2014.<\/p><p>  These elections come under the framework of a new electoral law approved by the Parliament after a comprehensive dialogue and extensive consultations.  We have been counting on our friends' and partners' experience to learn and consolidate our democratic process.  Of particular importance has been the valuable role of the electoral observers, both national and international, in enhancing the transparency and credibility of elections.  Under democratic rules, it is of paramount importance that all parties and contestants respect the rule of law and exercise politics through peaceful and democratic means, with no intimidation or violence.  In this regard allow us to reiterate the important role of the opposition parties in the consolidation of democracy and pluralism.  As part of this exercise we are pursuing dialogue with all relevant actors, mainly with the main opposition parties with which we have a platform for consultation and dialogue.  The government will continue favouring dialogue.

How widespread is the franchise to enable people to vote?<\/p><p>  It is welcome that our Ministers have made regular visits to Mozambique during the past number of years.  We have a very substantial development programme, which I think amounts to &euro;36 million in 2014. <\/p> <p>Naturally we hope it would be possible to increase trade between both countries, which is relatively small currently.  The goals outlined in our development programme rightly support sustainability, inclusive growth and reducing poverty.  Substantial progress has been made in a number of areas, which I welcome, through the impact of Irish funded initiatives, particularly in regard to education.  These include the development of schools infrastructure, improved learning outcomes and the necessary and welcome increase in participation in school.  An issue that is raised regularly by African delegations appearing before the committee is the lack of essential progress in the number of young school girls completing their education.  It must be a source of concern.  Mozambique has made progress in respect of enrolment and retention rates among girls.

Mr. Marques Bal&oacute;i began by referring to the 1 million people killed during the conflict.  There have been disturbing reports that the security situation in Mozambique has deteriorated, particularly over the past few months, and it is possible that conflict could break out again.  Nobody wants that to happen.  Which international organisations or countries are involved in the peace talks?  There was mention of some opposition groups returning to the jungle and so on, but we are relying on Western media.  I am interested in  Mr. Marques Bal&oacute;i's views on that and on how to rejuvenate the peace talks.  There is resentment among the rebel groups, which clearly do not feel they are part of society.  However, reports suggested that only a partial group was talking about returning to the jungle.<\/p><p>   Mr. Marques Bal&oacute;i is wearing glasses.  At the end of last year, Mozambique's first ophthalmologists and optometrists graduated with the help of Irish students from the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The Mozambique Eye Care Project is a Dublin-based and funded initiative to train optometrists through a degree programme at the University of L&uacute;rio.  A total of 170 Mozambicans have qualified as optometrists and they have been trained to deliver eye care and glasses to millions of visually impaired people in the region.  Is  Mr. Marques Bal&oacute;i aware of the programme?  If so, is it working?  Can anything else be done via Irish educational institutions to assist in the training of Mozambican professionals in other aspects of health service delivery?<\/p><p>   Another issue raised with the committee regarding many African countries, and Mozambique in particular, is the lack of proper land titles for farmers, which has led to land grabbing and so on.  Many farmers and NGOs have been critical of the approach of giving over large swathes of land to multinational companies for intensive farming.  There is a great deal of criticism regarding environmental impacts, the displacement of farmers and their families and the fact that most of the food produced is for export markets.  What impact is that having on the price of food and on smaller farmers?  Many farmers who sold their land have complained that promises made regarding new land, money and investment in agricultural infrastructure and social services have not been delivered.  How does the Mozambican Government respond to these claims?  Are there programmes to address land grabbing and so on?  The Chinese Government is significantly involved.  How is that working out?  Mozambicans are working on these projects but the committee has heard reports about the poor quality of building work in some African countries.  Chinese companies are involved in building in Maputo and many people have been killed on those sites because of a lack of health and safety regulation.

They have been effective in establishing and maintaining positive relationships between Ireland and Mozambique.<\/p><p>  I chair the Irish section of AWEPA, which is an organisation comprising African and European parliamentarians.  In that capacity I received funding from Irish Aid for a project to monitor parliamentary oversight of aid and I welcomed parliamentarians from Mozambique to a conference in Dublin last June which was opened by the President of Ireland.  In turn, I visited Mozambique a number of months ago and met Mr. Eneas Comiche, who is the chairman of the planning and budget committee of the Mozambican Parliament.  We had lengthy, frank and good meetings in the parliament with him and other parliamentarians.  We discussed budgets and financing.  Ireland gives general budget support.  Should that be targeted at particular areas, including, for example, support for the planning and budget committee?  We were taken by the fact that budget committee members travel throughout Mozambique when preparing their budget submission, which is a novel development.<\/p><p>  Like many African countries, Mozambique has significant natural resources.  The developed world has been responsible for depriving countries such as Mozambique of all their natural assets and wealth.  How strong is the will of the Government and Parliament to prevent illicit capital flight and to ensure there is no corporate tax avoidance?  Even though the corporation tax rate is 35%, one multinational company paid less than 0.5% of its pre-tax profits to the country.  Mozambique was, therefore, deprived of significant wealth and resources that it needs.<\/p><p>  With regard to parliamentary oversight, there is a need for a strong opposition in Parliament, and it is good that Renamo and the MDM party are in Parliament.  How strong is the opposition?  It is through parliamentary debate that we enhance democracy.<\/p> <p> To come back to the budget, the other question concerns the Mozambican Parliament and its committees calling in multinational companies to address these issues and answer directly to Parliament.  This is to ensure they pay their just taxes within the country in order that any tax concession or tax break has a very limited timeframe and does not go on forever such that the benefit is to the multinational company, not the country.<\/p><p> With regard to education, we visited a technical school and saw the potential of skills-based, craft-based and trade-based education.

I will kick-start my contribution by noting that when we review the figures for Mozambique, the amount it receives in aid is phenomenal.  It is also phenomenal that our little island of 4 million people will this year alone provide &euro;36 million.  We do not want to shout about this too loudly because we are supposed to be in the depths of recession, the IMF has just left and people might be wondering why we are spending all of this money in Mozambique.  Having said that, I am proud that we are using our development aid funds to target particular provinces in Mozambique.  I would like the delegates to comment on the situation in some of them.<\/p><p>  How does it feel to be running a country that has the world's highest growth rate?  While there has been 7.5% growth for the past ten years and it is continuing at 7%, Mozambique is, however, listed as one of the world's poorest countries.  Is there a contradiction in this regard?  How can one have such massive growth and still be so low in the UN poverty statistics?  It worries me that 80% of the population are engaged in agriculture, most of whom are probably engaged in subsistence farming.  Does having 80% of the population engaged in agricultural production indicate, in the Foreign Minister's opinion, a weakness in the Mozambican economy?  Is there a case to be made for attempting to diversify and industrialise the production of farm produce?<\/p><p>  There was a Marxist or perhaps a Leninist phrase: \"educate to be free\".

I am interested in education.  Given its competitive nature and that Mozambique has a competing partner in South Africa which has probably the most advanced education system in Africa, what is Mozambique doing to increase education provision?<\/p><p>  In welcoming the delegation I suggest we have a long way to go in our relationships.  For example, I see that we only import &euro;240,000 worth of goods from Mozambique.  It is a huge country, but that is all we are buying from it, which might suggest some Irish aid should be provided on the trade side in terms of developing markets and so on.  Moreover, we export just &euro;2.7 million worth of goods to Mozambique.  Overall, there is definitely plenty of room for improvement in the area of trade.<\/p><p>  I will conclude by congratulating Mozambique on successfully coming out of a terrible civil war, having gained its independence in 1975.  I ask the Foreign Minister to outline his view of the world in the light of the following perspective.  Mozambique receives massive amounts of European aid.  The European Union, among others, observed the 2009 elections which were not deemed to be very democratic.  It is alleged that the European Union was very influential in compelling the Mozambican Government to change its electoral law.  How do the Foreign Government colleagues feel about this?  Do they see it as a threat or something positive that when the providers of aid do not like a particular aspect of Government, they pressurise Mozambique into changing it?  I am happy for productive and progressive changes to happen, but from a political perspective, is there undue weight behind aid donors when they want Mozambique to correct its ways?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014060400005#E00300","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1401890700,"counter":577,"content":"<p>Before I hand over to the Foreign Minister to answer questions, I welcome to the Visitors Gallery His Excellency Valeriu Zgonea, President of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania.

As he can see, members have a real interest in the situation in Mozambique.  Let me add one further question.  Given that we have such strong relations, that Ireland has a resident embassy in Maputo and that we are obviously eager to grow trade between our two countries, would the Mozambican Government, particularly the Foreign Minister, consider opening a resident embassy in Dublin?  It would be a good way to strengthen our relations further, particularly in the area of trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014060400005#E00400","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401890700,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I thank members very much for their questions which clearly show their interest in the situation in Mozambique.  I will try to be deep but brief and we will see if I get the balance right.<\/p> <p>My biggest challenge is not answering the questions of this committee but rather doing so in such a way as to please the members of my country's Parliament.  My hope is that they will realise it is correct to approve the Government's budget for foreign affairs because we are really working.  I hope they realise life is not easy for me.<\/p><p> I will now address the issue of elections and voter participation.  The political landscape in Mozambique is changing rapidly but there are basically three kinds of political party.  The first are those sitting in Parliament, of which there are three.  Then there are those who do not sit in Parliament but are constantly active between elections.  The third group consists of those that only show up at election time.  The performance and visibility of each group is obviously different.  Peak participation is around election time, when more than 20 parties seek parliamentary seats.  The registration process has just concluded and we expect that around 8 million people will vote.  This is around 87% of registered voters.  To ensure that most people vote, there is a permanent civic education campaign.  Abstention was one of the major problems in the last election and this is surprising in a young democracy such as Mozambique.  It is more common in mature democracies such as Ireland.  Something is wrong and we are working hard to reverse it.<\/p><p> I agree with the suggestion that the potential for bilateral trade should be explored more fully.  As was mentioned earlier, the trade balance is not favourable to Mozambique, and this is why my delegation is here today.  We aim to raise the level of co-operation between our countries.  We are here to ask you, among other things, to help us help ourselves.  We are concentrating on self-explanatory sectors such as agriculture and agri-industry.  We must produce and process goods so we can export goods with added value and consume high-quality goods.  The education and health sectors are important in the formation of human capital as they help improve levels of productivity over time and have a positive influence on the performance of the economy.<\/p><p> The participation of girls in education is a complex matter that has been identified by the people of Mozambique in general and by the Mozambican Government in particular.  There is a cultural component to this issue and it also relates to the level of development.  It is a matter that is tied to poverty.  Some parts of Africa have a patriarchal societal model and others have a matriarchal pattern of cultural development.  Mozambique is so huge that it has each model in different parts of the country, and this is an influencing factor.  The cultural influences to which I referred act indirectly rather than directly.  Poverty means that families must engage in agricultural production, but the technology is poor, as is the quality of seed.  Infrastructure has not yet responded to the needs of agriculture, and for cultural reasons, girls are expected to help their mothers solve these problems.  Girls are expected to engage in farming, fetch water for the family and take care of younger children.  These facts mean that solving the problem of the participation of girls in education will take some time, but the trend in this matter has been positive.  <\/p><p> Some decades ago, far fewer girls were enrolled in school than boys, but now there are often more girls than boys.  However, as family difficulties intensify, these girls tend to abandon school.  The main problem is no longer enrolling girls in schools but keeping them there.  This can be done by educating parents.  Adult illiteracy is high in Mozambique, at over 50%, so unless parents and grandparents are educated and learn the crucial importance of education, we will continue to face these problems.  This is why adult education is a key component of our education system.  Supporting the struggle of women for empowerment is another way of motivating people to study.  Seeing women in government, parliament and positions of leadership can motivate families to send girls to school.<\/p><p> The Government of Mozambique aims to finance its own budget, and I believe this is realistic.  We are quickly reducing dependency on our co-operating partners.  I emphasise the word \"reducing\" because, as our capacity to finance the budget increases, our needs increase faster.  We are trying to reduce the gap as fast as possible.  Based only on what we in Mozambique call the traditional economic sectors, we can sustain our growth.  These sectors have driven Mozambique to an average growth of 7.2% in the past ten to 15 years.  Now we have discovered gas and coal, and this will produce income in 2018.<\/p> <p>In the meantime, we have two non-recurring sources of income due to sales and purchases of assets between the investors.  Although it is non-recurring, it is nevertheless very useful.  In the medium term, we will be in a much better position to finance our budget both through growth of the so-called traditional sectors, namely, agriculture, industry, tourism and services, and due to the benefits we will accrue from these new discoveries.<\/p><p> Foreign direct investment benefits the citizens greatly.  We would like it to be more beneficial in terms of creating jobs but foreign investors are in the upper level of the economy and being in the upper level often means they use high technology and capital intensive techniques rather than making labour intensive investments.  This is why our bet - it is a common belief everywhere - is to promote the development of the domestic private sector, mostly at the level of micro, small and medium enterprises.  These sectors are by their nature job creators.  We are trying to match the big investments with these sectors through linkage processes.  From the outset, we want to ensure that the services required by the big investors are provided by the private sector, and preferably domestic companies.  The first big investment attracted into Mozambique was the Mozal aluminium smelter.  We have learned from that project and are trying to implement this approach in all the big projects we develop.  However, we do not have big expectations from the new discoveries when it comes to job creation.  We want to get things upstream and downstream.  That is where we will build our competitiveness in terms of medium-sized enterprises.<\/p><p> A question was raised about Chinese construction in Mozambique.  There is a misperception in regard to how Mozambique is dealing with China.  There is a general fear when it comes to China that problems arise in terms of its human rights and its approach to the environment.  I remind people that it is the Government's responsibility to enforce its own laws and regulations.  If one ties it, they fulfil it but if one loosens it, they may take advantage.  That applies to all human beings.  We do not have cases of deficit due to bad construction.  We may have one or other building with problems of quality but that is not because of China; it is because the person who was paid to supervise construction did not do his job.  It is the system that failed.  We refuse to attach that to a particular country because it happens with everyone, even among Mozambiqueans.  I refer to micro, small and medium enterprises.  We try to give them opportunities to build small schools, small factories, houses and so on.  Besides the fact that a minority of them under perform, a certain number disappear with the money after they receive their first payment.  These are Mozambiqueans.  It is a human problem, not a problem of nationality.<\/p><p> Budget support is a precious tool for Mozambique not only because of the money, although that is critical, but also because of the externalities of the process.  We need to manage the budget accurately.  We need to train people.  We need to be accountable.  We are, by nature, accountable to the Parliament but because it is providing us with budget support, we are also accountable to it.  That helps to improve the system because, underlining all this, there is a problem of human capital, which is weak everywhere without exception.  Through budget support we interact intensively and we learn to finance our budget.  That is not a tradition with co-operating partners but we are also learning to use the money in a transparent and credible way.  It is a win-win situation and that is why we value the budget support.  In the past we received credits and grants from everywhere, many of which were channelled through NGOs, but when it came to measuring the impact of these grants nobody, including the Government, had the figures.  That is why the concept of concentration and co-ordination arose and that is what we are trying to implement jointly.<\/p><p> Capital flight and corporate tax evasion are challenges.  We prevent capital flight by maintaining peace and stability.  Investors need to trust a country.  Macroeconomic stability is also important.  We are doing well in this regard, as Ms Lagarde has noted in a recent statement.  We are focused on providing even more peace and stability.  That is why investors trust us and remain in the country.  Corporate tax evasion is a matter of efficiency of our fiscal authority, which is striving and succeeding.  The levels of tax collection are improving every year and we have a strong entity that is delivering a good performance.<\/p> <p>In that region of the continent, Mozambique has a role.  We are one of the founders of the South African Development Community, SADC, we were a member of the Frontline States, FLS, and we are chairing the Community of Portuguese Language Countries until July.  That last organisation has eight members, five of which are African.  In March, we finished our term on the African Union Peace and Security Council.  We are pretty busy.  We are also involved in the Great Lakes region.  Some of the SADC's members belong to the Great Lakes region organisation, those being the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola.  Although an infant democracy, Mozambique enjoys a good reputation worldwide.  Even before everyone was seated at the SADC, we were asked to chair it in specific contexts.<\/p><p> There is the principle of subsidiarity.  This word is hell for me, even in Portuguese, but members get the idea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014060400005#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oldemiro Marques Bal&oacute;i","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401891900,"counter":582,"content":"<p>Subsidiarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014060400008#H00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401891900,"counter":583,"content":"<p>Yes.  It means that, in central Africa, the regional organisation is the one that leads, and we show up when we are asked.  We follow the course of events in the Central African Republic, Mali and Guinea-Bissau.  Wherever there is a hotspot in Africa, we follow it closely and are available to help by all means in the region, on the continent, in the African Union or even in the UN.  We have very much been involved.<\/p><p>  Our industry is developing, but more slowly than we would like.  With developments in human capital formation and infrastructure, though, we are getting there.  Our ambition is to have an agri-industry.  Agribusiness is developing rapidly, but we are not happy yet.  There have been positive developments, mostly at a higher level in the sector.  Development depends a great deal on the economic basis.  We need to empower people in rural areas, where the overwhelming majority live.  In the past ten years, the Government has introduced two basic programmes.  First, approximately $300,000 is provided per year per district to finance local initiatives.  This is paying off, in that things are happening.  There is a problem with the repayment of those loans, but that has not led us to give up, as the impacts on production, productivity, management skills and so on are very positive.  Second, a slightly larger amount of money is provided per district to address infrastructural issues such as road maintenance and well boring.  Small needs that belong to the infrastructure component can also be financed locally.  This is the basis of our work and, in five to ten years, it will pay off even more powerfully because we are addressing two issues, those being production and productivity.<\/p><p>  As to what extent peace will prevail, we Mozambicans are generally good learners.  The destabilising war that lasted for 16 years was a hard, sad and tough lesson for us.  This is why every segment of Mozambique is involved in bringing it back fully - the churches, civil society, parties, the Government and our friends abroad.  By asking the question, the committee has shown its concern, and this is an additional source of encouragement for us.  The answer is that, yes, peace will prevail.<\/p><p>  We must take into account the fact that Mozambique has a newborn democracy and is a new country, in that a country is only considered mature if it is more than 100 years old.  We are not even 50 years old.  Our multi-party democracy is even younger.  We are all going through the learning curve.  Obviously, as in a classroom, some go quickly through the learning process and others go more slowly.  This is what is happening.  We are not learning at the same pace and never will, but we will reach a level at which we can at least realise one thing, namely, that democracy has nothing to do with violence.  Rather, it is a tool to make one's point.  We are getting there.  Fortunately, we will have elections in October.  These will clarify many matters.  We have a new electoral commission, which is trusted by everyone because every party in the Parliament is represented on it.  We are all committed to holding good, credible elections to eliminate a certain perception that I will address when answering another question in a few minutes.<\/p><p>  We are striving in terms of the business environment and are achieving good results.  Tomorrow, there will be a business seminar where a great deal of information will be provided.  We might be able to share with the Houses the representations that will be made at that seminar, so I will not use much of the committee's time addressing that issue.<\/p><p>  As to the question of growth versus poverty, I am glad that members are impressed with the growth of the Mozambican economy, but please bear in mind that we started from a very low base.  We need many years of this kind of growth to overcome poverty, or at least its shocking aspects.<\/p> <p>Again, to encourage ourselves, let us look to the trend.  The trend is fairly positive.  One has growth of the economy and the population.  Moving around the country, those who have been in Mozambique, particularly NGOs, can testify as to what they saw 15 to 20 years ago and what they see now.  There has been a clear change.  One of the debates at home is on the distribution of wealth, feeding the budget properly and encouraging people to continue to be participative in discussing priorities for each part of the country in the national context.<\/p><p> Of the population, 8% is involved in agriculture.  There is a low level of education and technology.  Seed quality is also low and there are problems with infrastructure, in particular roads to deliver goods to markets.  I agree that we have a quality problem in respect of education.  We are not yet at the level of competing with neighbouring countries, most of which have always been stable.  They have not faced war.  The comparison should not be with South Africa but with Angola which had a war as we did.  Such a comparison would be relatively fair.  We all know what South Africa is.  However, we are competing with ourselves to develop and progress all the time.  We are not happy with our situation and try to ensure that year after year it improves.  A few years ago, we tried to ensure that the maximum number of children had access to school.  The economy could not support that but the political will and determination was there to achieve it.  As the economic situation progresses and the fight continues to change mentalities to make everyone believe in and commit to improvements in education, the results will appear.  We are well aware of this and are fighting hard to reverse the situation.<\/p><p> I was asked how I see the situation in Mozambique given that we have received a great deal of aid, the elections held so far have had problems and donors are putting pressure on us.  Pressure from donors used to be stronger.  It is no longer that strong as we are no longer very dependent.  We continue to be dependent but to a lesser extent than in the past.  When I was Deputy Minister for Co-operation, I was also co-ordinator for the emergency programme.  We were still at war.  My predecessor is here.  He was Deputy Minister for Agriculture and the co-ordinator and when I was appointed I took over from him.  We were fully dependent on foreign aid.  When we reached peace, the dependence was still very high and we could hardly take our own decisions even on issues having to do with our sovereignty.<\/p><p> The de-mining programme is my responsibility as Minister with responsibility for foreign trade, which does not make sense.  De-mining is a matter for defence.  We were in a confidence building process, however, and while the Government thought it was not necessary, the donors - at that time they were donors and not co-operating partners as we call them today - imposed on us the condition that de-mining be in Foreign Affairs.  We had to accept.<\/p><p> NGOs are foreign organisations and they are supposed to be registered and controlled by the Minister for Justice.  However, as the Minister for Justice was far from the donors, responsibility for NGOs was given to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The third component has to do with immigrants.  That is by nature a matter for the Ministry with responsibility for the interior.  However, for the same reason, it is with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.<\/p><p> Fortunately, we concluded in the Ministry last year a functional analysis which was carried out through outsourcing.  Now that we are no longer as dependent as we have been in the past, we have taken the decision that de-mining will go to the Ministry of Defence by the end of the year.  Responsibility for NGOs is in the process of being transferred to the Minister for Justice and immigration matters are about to be transferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs.  It is not enough to have legitimacy, one must have the power to impose that legitimacy, which takes time.  Nevertheless, it was useful and it will continue to be useful to interact.  We believe in a world of interdependence and that is what we are striving for.<\/p><p> Elections have never been perfect.  We have attempted from one election to the next to improve, which is why our electoral law is far from being stable.  Before almost every election, it is subject to revision to incorporate contributions from national and international organisations, including the constitutional court, domestic entities and other observers, particularly the European Union, which has been very proactive in making contributions.  Most of those have been incorporated in our electoral law.<\/p><p> We have challenges but we know where to go and how to get there.  Simply put, things take time.  We will have a resident embassy as soon as possible.  Our friends understand us very well and multi-party accreditation is a powerful tool for countries as poor as Mozambique.  I thank the committee very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014060400008#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oldemiro Marques Bal&oacute;i","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401892500,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for updating the committee on the progress of his country over the last number of years and the strides that have been made.

As the Minister rightly said, we have given &euro;36 million to Mozambique this year, which is obviously there to support its people and reduce poverty.<\/p> <p>We have seen the impact at first hand.  We are aware of the importance of farmers being helped with expertise and providing assistance in other areas, including in dealing with the incidence of HIV-AIDS.

It is good to hear that the Department of Foreign Affairs in his country is considering opening a resident embassy here as soon as possible.

This is the presentation of my first annual report on what was a significant year for the office with the extension of its remit following the enactment of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill.  With the permission of the committee, I will take the opportunity to talk about some current issues and some of those affecting my vision for the future of my office.  My predecessor, Ms Emily O'Reilly, was responsible for the conduct of the office for much of the year covered by the report.  I began in December.  I pay tribute to Ms O&rsquo;Reilly for her stewardship of the office and the very successful period during which she was responsible for it.<\/p><p>  The office received more than 3,000 complaints in 2013.  To a large extent, they followed the pattern one would have expected.  The largest number of complaints involved the Department of Social Protection.  As the Department has a very high level of engagement with members of the public, it is no surprise that it should feature so significantly.  Other bodies in respect of which large numbers of complaints were received included the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Revenue Commissioners.  Complaints concerning local authorities amounted to 495.  This is no great surprise, given the extent of their engagement with members of the community.  There were 310 complaints against the HSE.  I will say rather more about the complaints against the HSE as I proceed.<\/p><p>  Nearly 200 additional public bodies were brought within the jurisdiction of the office.  Probably the most significant of these in terms of complaints was Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, in respect of which we received 150 complaints.  It is well documented that it had some difficulties in the early part of its work.  We found it good to work with and it made significant changes in response to the concerns raised by my office.  We hope to see a reduction in the volume of substantiated complaints at least in the year ahead.<\/p><p>  There was nothing strange or startling in the distribution of complaints among the Civil Service, local authorities and the HSE.  Of the complaints received, 5.8% were related to third level education bodies.  The balance was made up of complaints about a number of miscellaneous bodies.  Speaking of the HSE, it has been a surprise to me that the volume of complaints about care and treatment has been so low.  However, there are restrictions on my jurisdiction which may affect this.  A very high proportion of complaints concerned financial matters.  Medical cards are a recent topical example.  I am surprised at the low numbers of complaints about care and treatment and intend to examine this in further detail this year.  I do not believe the level of complaints reflects people's experience of the health service and I do not believe it is because the quality of health care is so good that there are few complaints to be made.  Something is causing complaints to fail to find their way to my office, whether it is signposting or people simply being exhausted by the process of complaining.  It is an area I will examine in some detail in the course of the current year.<\/p><p>  In addition to dealing with formal complaints, staff from the office dealt with nearly 11,600 queries.  This is a huge level of contact.  Some of the contacts, as members might guess, are for other ombudsmans' services.  People might come to us when they have a complaint more appropriate to GSOC, the Ombudsman for Children or even the financial ombudsman.  We are quite proficient at helping complainants to find the right place to complain.  Some cases concern people who have complained to my office before they have made their complaint to the body the subject of the said complaint.  Dealing with these is a very significant part of the work of the office.<\/p><p>  Members will have had the opportunity to read about some of the significant cases resolved.  There was a very tragic case of a woman suffering from cancer who attended St. Vincent's University Hospital at Elm Park.  She did not receive the follow-up diagnosis she should have.  She was properly treated for a heart condition from which she was suffering but did not really have time to understand the diagnosis of cancer that she should have received.  An apology was issued to the family for the poor treatment she had received prior to her death.<\/p><p>  A case that is very topical in the current climate concerned the State Examinations Commission providing assistance for a student at short notice.  I am aware of at least one case in the current round in which a student has received support as a consequence of the involvement of my office.  Clearly, the normal timescales cannot apply because people do not want a report after the event.  They actually need an intervention before it.  We do not have time for investigations, but we are able to draw concerns to the attention of the examinations commission.  On occasion, we can have its decision overturned in time for people to receive support during the examination.<\/p><p>  There was a case in which a woman was incorrectly refused invalidity pension twice by the Department of Social Protection.  While ours is not a compensation body or one which seeks to levy fines, where people have been denied benefits to which they were entitled or have lost out financially, it is our job to try to put them back in the position in which they would have been.  In the instance in question, the arrears totalled more than &euro;90,000, which is significant.  We were very pleased to be able to resolve that case.<\/p><p>  The final individual case I wish to consider involved a local authority imposing a time limit for local residency contrary to regulations within its housing allocations policy.  It was not entitled to do so and a person was wrongly denied housing as a result.  We were able to have that decision reversed.  Importantly, we were also able to ensure other local authorities were not doing the same and that other people in County Laois who might have been similarly affected would not be affected in that way in the future.<\/p> <p>It is that aspect of the office.  It is not just about providing recompense for an individual but is also about making sure that systemic learning takes place.  It is one of the key differences between the Office of the Ombudsman and some of the other routes to redress that might be available.  <br \/>It is important to say something about the mobility allowance and motorised transport grants, to which this committee has given considerable attention.  I am a bit concerned there has been some delay in finding a replacement for those schemes which were clearly in breach of the law.  I am sure those are issues that the committee will wish to continue to pursue.  I know it intends reporting at some point to the D&aacute;il and I hope that it will be able to do that soon and that the replacement scheme which has been promised will be put in place.  We were able to gain redress for some of the people in Donegal who we felt had missed out.  The HSE agreed with that and we were able to find redress for them.  The real concern I have is that people who might have been eligible for the schemes are missing out because there is no scheme.  <br \/>Discretionary medical cards are another topic I want to address.  We have been looking at the situation in respect of them and have received quite a number of complaints - 70 at one stage.  I believe there are 40 currently within the office and I do not doubt that they will continue to come in although the recent decision to suspend the review is an important one.<br \/>I will make a couple of points.  When we looked at the cases, we found that people had been awarded the discretionary cards originally but the files specifying the basis upon which they had been awarded those cards were no longer available.  When one was comparing the decision not to award a card today, it was impossible to say whether the same things had been taken into consideration when the medical card was originally granted.  We have a concern about process and the fairness of that process.  We also found that with regard to the decision not to award a card, the decision of the medical officers was often simply recorded as a tick in a box and no explanation was given as to why having taken the circumstances of the individual into account, discretion had not been exercised.  Again, that was a matter of considerable concern to us.  We now have agreement that should the situation continue, at least an explanation will be given as to why the decision was taken.  Those are issues relating to the decision to award a card or not.<br \/>One of the problems that people faced when they found they were being reviewed was that they often had medical cards with quite a long expiry date yet they found that they were being reviewed and the cards withdrawn long before the expiry date.  One of the important learning points arising from this is that it is vital that the HSE explains to individuals with medical cards that they are subject to review, regardless of what the new arrangements for review are in the future.  In light of all of the circumstances, when the consultation comes forward on whatever changes are made to the scheme, my office will have quite a lot to say in respect of how that scheme should be administered in the future to avoid the perceptions of unfairness that have undoubtedly been part of the recently suspended review.<br \/>One issue I spoke to the committee about when I first took up office was the issue of case books and issuing detailed information about all of the cases that are decided by my office and not just those that feature in the annual report or that become subject to public reports.  I have not put it in my speaking notes but I should say that we are making good progress.  As the committee is aware, we have to record a summary of each case that is examined in order for those summaries to be aggregated into a case book.  That work is under way and I expect the first issue of the case book to be in the committee members' in-boxes in the autumn so I am very pleased that progress is being made on that.  That was a commitment I gave to the committee when I last spoke to it.  <br \/>I have also expressed my concern about issues around the privatisation of services and the way in which redress is dealt with.  In particular, what brought it to my mind was the issue of Irish Water.  In my other capacity as Information Commissioner, I was very pleased to note that Irish Water was brought into my jurisdiction so that people could ask for information.  However, when Irish Water was transferred away from local authorities, access to my office in respect of complaints was lost and as yet, there is no formal route to redress for anyone with a complaint about Irish Water.  My contention is that it should not been removed from my jurisdiction.  There is no reason the route to redress should change because the provider is changing.  There is an opportunity with the EU alternative dispute resolution directive to rethink how redress relating to services that have been privatised is offered.<br \/>It is very difficult to know how anybody might seek redress for failures in waste collection.  Clearly, my view, as one would expect, is that access to independent redress via an Ombudsman for people using public services should be a <i>sine qua non<\/i>.  There should be no discussion about it and I am disappointed that in some ways, it has inadvertently been lost.  There was no reference to redress in the legislation that introduced Irish Water except in respect of water quality, which is a separate technical issue.  Complaints about things like the installation of meters and billing, which could have come to my office when it was a local authority function, are now simply suspended until new legislation is introduced to address them so that is a concern of mine.<br \/>I am also still very keen to work with this committee, the Government and public bodies on the introduction of a standardised means of complaining about public services.  There is a plethora of ways to complain and there is no clear indication as to why there is such variation.  It just brings about confusion for members of the public.  I would like to see it addressed and will continue to work to bring proposals forward to that effect.  Making it easy to complain is one of the things that is quite important.  We all believe that public should have access to individual redress but we also know that people's complaints help us to identify where there are problems with public services and to make sure those are put right.  The other idea of a single complaints portal based around the concept of <i>Healthcomplaints.ie<\/i>is one thing I would like to see brought forward in the future.  <br \/>The importance of the independence of the Office of the Ombudsman cannot be underestimated.  If people are to have confidence, they must believe the Ombudsman is independent of the bodies in its jurisdiction.  Constitutional status would be a very good way not just of demonstrating that independence but securing it in a very meaningful and important fashion in the same way as the Comptroller and Auditor General is a constitutional office.  I hope that this might be brought forward in the future.  As I said at the beginning, my engagement with this committee - this relationship with the Oireachtas rather than with the Administration - is one of the very significant aspects of the independence of the Office of the Ombudsman and I am very glad to have had the opportunity to present the report to the committee today.  I look forward to questions and a discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014060400004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401894900,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I will now ask members for comments and questions.

My recollection of the TG4 case is that it did not take longer because it was in Irish.  I have an concern about the length of time it is taking us to deal with cases in general.  I spoke about the reader issue for the leaving certificate and our capacity to fast track cases.  The reality is that at one point the office was 16% down on its staffing.  One should also have regard for the work of the Information Commissioner.  There are different teams in the office.  The impact of that was producing unacceptable delays.<\/p><p>  Wearing my Information Commissioner hat, I have given a commitment that no case will be more than one year old at the end of this year.  I cannot give that commitment on the Ombudsman side because there is a backlog of over 100 cases.  Some of those are in groups and a number of them will be resolved at once but the reality is that the volume of work was overcoming the capacity of the office to deal with it.  That is a matter of deep concern for me.  It is something I have addressed in previous positions and I am working with colleagues on dealing with the historical backlog.  It is not acceptable but it is understandable.  It has been there for some time.  It is difficult to work without sufficient resources, as members will understand.  I have to make sure that I have enough people who can do the job properly.<\/p><p>  The Ombudsman's office changed its procedures substantially three years ago to make it more efficient.  The backlog has decreased notably since then.  The question arises of whether we can squeeze further efficiencies.  The problem that always arises with an Ombudsman office is that we have to be careful in turning cases over quickly that we continue to do our job to the level of quality required and that we are not turning away cases we ought to be investigating more thoroughly.  We are conducting a process review to see if there is any way to achieve this objective, such as through further automation.  It is, therefore, not so much a question of working as Gaeilge as that the average length of time we take to deal with complaints has to be reduced.  That is a hard nut to crack.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014060400006#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401895500,"counter":606,"content":"<p>We have an Irish language scheme because we are subject to the Language Commissioner's office.

Can he shed more light on why the body processing these applications does not have crucial and pivotal information on the granting of discretionary medical cards?

I shall not go over ground that others have covered on the discretionary medical card and the mobility allowance.  I am interested in two areas. The first is the outstanding cases which Emily O'Reilly as Ombudsman had raised over the years and which to date have not been fully concluded.  We have just talked about one of them, the mobility allowance, but others have been raised.  One that jumps out at me and which I have raised here, and I know that it is still being pursued, is the Lost at Sea scheme.  Is there continuing tracking of those matters on which the Government did not take action or fully deal with in the years since the Office of the Ombudsman has been making annual reports?  <\/p><p>  The second area is one which the committee should look at and where it may be able to help the Ombudsman.  The report mentions the idea of a public services Ombudsman as opposed to a public sector Ombudsman.  It is an interesting suggestion; I had not thought of it in that way before.  The distinction is correct, because we are dealing with a lot of privatisation or contracting out of public services.  There are plans for further contracting out.  I do not know whether the Ombudsman is aware of JobPath, a scheme run by the Department of Social Protection.  A tender process has been completed, but we do not know the result.  The services which those who are unemployed will be able to avail themselves of in trying to get back into employment will be contracted out to a private sector organisation, or perhaps a combination of private and public sector.  Once a provider of those services goes beyond the public sector, it is more difficult for us in the D&aacute;il to hold it to account.  Obviously, the same applies to the Office of the Ombudsman in many ways.  Mr. Tyndall mentioned waste services.  Anyone who lives in Dublin will understand the chaos that has ensued since responsibility for collection and disposal has passed to a private company.  While the overall responsibility for waste management still lies with the council, it is only in so much that it ensures that it is done rather than ensuring that standards are kept up.  We should look at whether it is a major change for legislation and what the options are in other things.  Perhaps Mr. Tyndall would elaborate on what was a detailed part of his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014060400008#G01300","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401896700,"counter":631,"content":"<p>Starting with Lost at Sea, it is a matter of concern to me that that report's recommendations remain unimplemented.  On the issue of a public services Ombudsman, I take the strong view that the findings should be binding unless challenged in court.  The legislation would need to be amended to do that, as is the case in some instances.  In that sense, it should not be possible for a body in jurisdiction to decide to disagree with the findings and ignore them.  If it disagreed with the findings, there should be a formal process of challenge.  That would give greater authority to the findings.  It is right in a democracy that decisions about recommendations fall to the relevant democratic bodies, be they local authorities or, in this case, the Government.  The previous Ombudsman made the recommendation; she put forward an extremely well argued case in her report.  This committee is to some extent a product of Lost at Sea and concern about the fact that that recommendation was ignored.  I will certainly support it in any way I can.  We should all continue to work to find redress for those people who have suffered the injustice.  I hope that members of the committee will continue to do that.  Thankfully, during the 30 years of the office's existence, there have been very few examples of reports where the recommendations have not been accepted and implemented.  I am not sure that we have always been as rigorous as we should have been in following up to make sure people have done what they said they would do, but at least they have said they would do it.  There have been very few instances where people refused to accept findings and implement recommendations.<\/p> <p>As a result, they are of particular significance.  We have talked about two, the lost at sea scheme and the motorised transport grant.  I hope we can work with the committee to make some progress on both of those.  It would be disappointing to see them left unremedied.<\/p><p> Privatisation is an issue that is troubling ombudsman&rsquo;s offices across the globe.  It is not unique to Ireland, although Ireland has gone further and faster than other countries in areas such as waste management.  People have redress one day for a service they rely on, such as the water coming into their homes, but the next day they may not.  What most troubled me about it was that nobody even consulted the office.  It was just the case that one day we did not have jurisdiction.  Nobody had even talked to us about it.  Redress for individuals using services is often an afterthought.  People depend on waste collection, water and the other public utilities - electricity, gas, the post, transport and so on - and should have access to independent redress on them.  That should be through a public service ombudsman.  There is no reason to make the landscape of provision so complex that it is difficult even to know who is providing the service.  It should not be difficult for people to know where to go to complain.  I am pleased the committee is thinking of taking up this issue.  There is a particular opportunity at the moment because the State has to decide how it will implement the EU directive on alternative dispute resolution.  I hope the opportunity will be taken to create clarity and bring into being a more direct route to redress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014060400008#G01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401897300,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I thank the Ombudsman for his presentation, which I have read.

The many developments at national, EU and international level since the energy White Paper of 2007 make it timely to review our energy policy and to consider how best to shape it for the future.<\/p><p>  The context in which these discussions will take place is inevitably complex, with many interrelated strands and competing interests.  The cornerstone of energy policy will continue to be the three pillars of sustainability, security and competitiveness.  In addition, there is increasing recognition that the energy sector is an important contributor to the economy both financially and in terms of the numbers employed in the sector.  It has the potential to generate further economic activity and real employment.  <\/p><p>  The Green Paper is taking a long-term look at the policy, the regulatory and societal interventions we need to make in the coming years.  Government, industry, system operators and the public will all need to make sound evidence-based choices.<\/p> <p> In developing our energy policy for the future we face several key challenges, including reconciling competing and interrelated dynamics of the three pillars, to ensure good equilibrium and maximum flexibility on an evolving energy landscape; significant international policy developments such as the impact of indigenous shale gas in the United States on EU energy prices and geopolitics generally; the United Nations fifth report on climate change and the need to closely align climate change and energy policy; the importance of informed engagement by the public in energy debates, especially on affordability, renewable energy, climate change and energy infrastructure; and the potential of energy policies to transform the economy and stimulate jobs and growth.  The challenge for policy makers is to find the right balance of measures, taking account of these complex interrelationships and the need to maintain the economic and social fabric nationally and regionally.<\/p><p> In view of these many and complex energy challenges, I considered it timely to publish the Green Paper to stimulate an informed debate on the future shape of energy policy.  I decided that, set against the backdrop of the three energy pillars and the need to stimulate economic growth, the paper should focus on a number of key themes.  This does not preclude anyone from raising other issues during the public consultation process.  The six priority themes chosen are empowering energy citizens; markets, regulation and prices; planning and implementing essential energy infrastructure; ensuring a balanced and secure energy mix; putting the energy system on a sustainable pathway; and driving economic opportunity.  There are inevitable tensions between competing policy objectives.  Resolving these complex and interrelated policy choices is critical, especially if we are to encourage the right conditions for economic recovery and job creation.  These difficulties are further compounded by the continuously changing energy landscape.  For example, the International Energy Agency&rsquo;s World Energy Outlook for 2012 highlighted the significant change on the global energy landscape which had taken place owing to increased deployment of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling.  The USA&rsquo;s unconventional oil and gas production is having a profound impact on international energy markets and prices and likely to have significant implications for EU competitiveness and geopolitics generally. <\/p><p> Of equal importance is how to reconcile energy policy and climate change.  This has been underscored in the United Nations&rsquo;s fifth assessment report which concluded that the effects of climate change \"are already occurring on all continents and across the oceans\" but that the world was \"ill-prepared for risks from a changing climate\".  We have a progressive position on climate protection, but we also have a long way to go in terms of economic recovery, particularly in the context of the challenging greenhouse gas mitigation target for 2020 set for us under EU law.  It is clear that an equitable distribution of effort sharing will be required in allocating national contributions to achieving new targets under the 2030 climate and energy framework.  Economic development and low carbon transition are not mutually exclusive and can be progressed in parallel, provided we advance on an informed and sensible course. <\/p><p> Involving the citizen in debates on energy and climate change must be central to policy development.  We need to develop balanced and far reaching policies on areas such as grid development, the use of wind resources and the streamlining of public permitting and consent procedures.  In doing so, it is important that past lessons are learned and that we adequately address valid public concerns about the impact of policies on the environment and health and safety, while, at the same time, ensuring security of supply and cost effectiveness.  The Green Paper aims to encourage a wide ranging debate on this critical issue and I look forward to suggestions on how we can achieve effective and informed public participation and engagement.<\/p><p> I refer to prices, an issue that is important for all energy consumers, whether residential or business.  Prices have been fully deregulated in the electricity retail market and the regulator has decided on 1 July as the date for complete deregulation of gas prices.  Consequently, prices are mostly set by suppliers and commercial and operational matters for them.  Customers can and do avail of competitive offerings from electricity and gas suppliers.  We have a limited capacity to influence prices, as electricity and gas costs in Ireland are influenced by various drivers outside our control.  These include global gas and oil prices, the cost of capital, exchange rate fluctuations, the small size of the Irish market, geographical location and our low population density.  The most important factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is the continuing upward trend in international gas prices.  To mitigate the impact of these factors, we must remain focused on controllable costs bearing in mind their limited extent.  Increasing the penetration of indigenous secure renewables and adopting greater energy efficiency measures in homes and businesses are among the most significant ways we can counter the effects of cost drivers.<\/p><p> The promotion of energy efficiency is an area within our control where action can be taken to reduce energy costs.  Initiatives such as the new &euro;70 million national energy efficiency fund will act as a catalyst to develop energy efficiency projects in the market and enhance the level of finance available to support the clear energy and cost saving opportunity for public and commercial sectors.  The development of indigenous sustainable sources of energy will also help to offset the impact of volatile fossil fuel prices.  I hope to hear innovative and creative suggestions on the further steps we might take during the consultation phase on the Green Paper.  I hope to publish a new bioenergy strategy in the coming weeks which will inform the debate on how best to put the energy system on a sustainable path.  A more indigenous low carbon economy, centred on energy efficiency, renewable energy and smart networks, offers great scope to address the interrelated challenges of climate change, energy security and competitiveness.  Achieving this transformation lies at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s energy policy. <\/p><p> As we develop the new technological know-how to manage the electricity system of the future, we are creating opportunities for Irish-based companies to become world leaders in smart grids and deliver working solutions a decade ahead of their international competitors.  In building on our strengths we have the opportunity to further develop Ireland&rsquo;s reputation in the renewable energy sector as a place of excellence in research and the development of new technologies.<\/p><p> To sum up, we need a new transformative vision for a robust energy policy framework for the future.  The Green Paper provides an opportunity to reflect and take stock of our current position and adopt a long-term view on the interventions necessary to help to shape future energy policy.  Competitiveness, security of supply and sustainability, as well as energy policy&rsquo;s potential to support economic growth and job creation, will remain at the heart of energy policy as we move forward.  I look forward to an informed and robust debate and would like to encourage everyone to engage actively in the public consultation process in order that we can collectively transform the Irish energy system for the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014060400003#D00500","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401875400,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister who has clearly outlined the challenges and the opportunities ahead in the energy sector.

Yes, there have been energy reduction measures and some improvement generally in our consumption patterns and all the rest, but, primarily, it is due to the economic step-down.  The Chairman&rsquo;s question concerns whether this gives us some headroom in planning, to which I believe the honest answer is &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  We are not on the same knife-edge.  The possible exception is that we now operate in an all-island energy market and Northern Ireland does not have the same easy security of supply in the immediate years ahead.  That is hugely significant in the context of the interconnector project planned between County Meath and County Tyrone.<\/p><p>  The Chairman is right about the urgency that might have been evident in 2005-06.  It does give us time to plan and is one of the reasons, although only one, I opted for a Green Paper rather than a White Paper.  So much has changed and while the Chairman has put his finger on one of the reasons, we must also look at international developments.  The revolution in unconventional gas and oil production in the United States is also a hugely significant factor and the European Union is preoccupied with the competitiveness implications of that development for Europe.  Gas prices here as compared to those in the United States have been turned on their head dramatically.  In the United States one will find people connected with the energy business predicting that in the next ten or 15 years the United States will head for self-sufficiency.  This would have enormous implications both for geopolitics and energy policy in the European Union.  The short answer to the Chairman's question is that he is right, that this does give us some time.  That is why we have a Green Paper and an open invitation to all to contribute during the public consultation phase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014060400005#F00150","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1401876000,"counter":655,"content":"<p>In the renewable sector as a whole, Ireland has invested heavily policy-wise and, in general terms, in the wind energy sector, but we have not done as much as we might have in the wave and tidal energy sector.  I accept that they are at an early stage in terms of development, but they have been at that stage for some time.  The Minister has rightly identified the emergence of hydraulic fracturing as an opportunity to generate energy closer to home and that seems to have taken some of the smart money in developing an alternative energy source away from the wave and tidal energy sector.  I am a little concerned that we are, to some extent, starting to buy into this.<\/p><p>  I note the Minister's comments on the context in which we are competing with the United States.  We have always competed with the United States which has always had a cheaper source of energy available in terms of its oil drilling business and this has not prevented us from developing our industrial sector to date.  While I accept that it is a challenge, our unique characteristics on the western side of Europe give us an advantage, if we could get our heads around investing a little more in wave and tidal energy projects.  Clearly, the markets have not advanced the moneys needed.  It will take a progressive approach on the part of the Government at some point to really make it happen.<\/p><p>  On the fracking issue, the jury is out in some countries.  From what I have seen and the general view, for a country as small as Ireland with a strong tourism industry, it is just not an option.  I know there are exploratory licences, but we would have done better from the start if we had just said: &ldquo;No, thanks, we are not interested.&rdquo;  While l accept that it is always important before one makes a final decision to look and see, from what is available from other countries, we should be at the point of saying it is just not for us.  I can understand why it works in parts of the United States where there are vast tracts of land that are entirely depopulated and if there is a level of destruction of the environment, it is manageable and can be contained and the impact is relatively limited.  I am not an individual who jumps on the bandwagon and says, &ldquo;Not in my back yard&rdquo; - quite the opposite.  However, in this instance, we must consider the potential impact not just on drinking water but on the visual amenity of the country which we market very strongly as a green destination from a tourism perspective.  Wearing my hat as Opposition spokesperson on tourism, I would be deeply concerned about anything that might emerge in that regard.<\/p><p>  On LNG, liquefied natural gas, what is the Minister&rsquo;s view on the decision of the regulator to include a cost for the gas interconnector in respect of the LNG project at Ballylongford?  This has effectively prevented the project from going ahead, as he knows.  He has noted that the Green Paper is strong on the issue of competition.  The LNG project would have provided for a level of competition and assisted with security of supply.  It was unfortunate, therefore, that the regulator took the decision it did in that regard.<\/p><p>  In a broader context, does the Minister believe there is still a need for a regulator in the energy sector?  Have we reached a point where we can move on from it and allow the market to effectively dictate the supply of energy? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014060400005#F00250","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1401876000,"counter":656,"content":"<p>Quite honestly, the last question is a six-marker, on which I do not have sufficient knowledge to give the Deputy an informed reply.  It is a very big question as to whether, having deregulated prices and with gas prices about to be deregulated from 1 July, there is a need for a regulator.  I would have thought our EU partners would be horrified at the suggestion there would not be a regulator.  I would certainly appreciate an input during the public consultation phase on the regulatory regime in Ireland from whomsoever wishes to make an input, not just those who have a vested interest in making a pitch on that issue.<\/p> <p> I could avoid the Deputy's question on the regulator taking into account the cost of the interconnector as part of the infrastructure by saying that I do not have to answer it given that the highest court in the land decided it is right that it should be taken into account.  My Department has consistently argued that it is an integral part of the infrastructure and that the interconnector has to be remunerated.  In those circumstances a level playing pitch is necessary.  We could not allow a situation in which a decision made on a particular company does not apply.  For example, Corrib gas will come ashore next year and the project may beat the summer 2015 deadline which was fixed several months ago.  The same rules would have to apply in that context.  The judgment, which I had to read, is a very detailed and extensive unravelling of the complex issues arising.  I was persuaded by the correctness of the decision.  It is not right to say that it has prevented the LNG project from proceeding at Tarbert.  Coincidently, I met the promoters of the LNG plant at Tarbert last night.  I remain hopeful that it will provide an extra string to our bow in terms of an LNG facility.  I am actively working with the promoters to see how the Government can facilitate the project and I have every hope for its future.<\/p><p> Deputy Dooley raised an interesting question regarding our focus on renewables in Ireland, which has primarily been on wind.  I am proud that, notwithstanding the straitened circumstances in which we found ourselves, we managed to maintain our investment in research in wave and tidal energy.  The offshore renewable energy development plan, OREDP, which we published in September, takes an imaginative and comprehensive approach to the future exploitation of offshore resources as a contribution to our energy security and needs.  We continue to invest in this area.  I do not know of any country which has made great advances beyond the research and development stage in which we are currently engaged.  We are carrying out innovation work in this respect in co-operation with the sector.  It will undoubtedly become an important source of energy in future but it will not meet our energy needs next week or next year.  Last year we hosted a major international conference on ocean energy which was attended by approximately 950 delegates.  The scientists attending the conference lauded our potential for developing wave and tidal power given that we are an island nation.  Our main thrust has been to maintain investment in the test beds, including work by the Irish Maritime and Energy Resource Cluster, IMERC, in Ringaskiddy and the development of the new Beaufort laboratory.  This area is, therefore, very much on our radar and it is included in the Green Paper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014060400005#F00350","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401876600,"counter":658,"content":"<p>It is important for my part of the country that the lines of communication between the Department and the promoters of LNG are kept open.  Leaving aside the regulatory issues, the major size of the project would help to transform the economies not only of west County Limerick and north County Kerry but also the entire mid-west region.  It has been likened to a new Aughinish Alumina for the Shannon Estuary.  There are concerns locally, however, about the delays in developing this potential win for the State.<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to Corrib gas.  Notwithstanding the regulatory issues in LNG, where would we find anybody who would be willing to make a substantial investment in Ireland given the experience from a regulatory and a planning point of view in terms of bringing resources onshore, which is regarded as straightforward in other countries?  Will the Green Paper address some of the issues that arise in terms of capital investments required by companies to come into Ireland and, in some cases, the welcoming committees rolled out to meet them?<\/p><p>  The issue of biomass and incorporating the biomass industry into the energy sector is very relevant to my constituency.  The Minister will be aware of the issues arising in respect of the application of REFIT from Bord na M&oacute;na for those who cultivate miscanthus.  I am interested in learning more about the relationship between the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this regard. On the one hand, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is actively encouraging people to cultivate energy crops but, on the other, there is a lack of a transition from farm gate to end of life use for crops that could compel, for want of a better word, State-owned entities such as Bord na M&oacute;na, Bord G&aacute;is and ESB to use these products to meet our carbon targets.  Biocrops are currently being cultivated on a considerable area of land across the country, with significant investment from the State by way of grants from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There appears to be confusion as to how these crops can be best utilised in meeting the State's energy needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014060400006#G00200","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1401876600,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I can reaffirm there are the close contacts and co-operation on LNG.  We have to be careful to ensure we have diverse sources of supply.  When one considers the crisis in Ukraine, depending on a single source for supply is not encouraging in terms of energy security and, therefore, it is important to develop indigenous resources, including renewables.  LNG will also become an important aspect of ensuring future security of supply.  Apart from what it would do for the region that Deputy O'Donovan represents in terms of employment, it is an important policy objective.<\/p> <p>As regards its having gone on too long, I find it hard to make up my mind on that issue in the sense that global developments in energy affect major investment projects.  Investment in energy projects is so massive by comparison to the more normal investment in this economy that there is a longer timeline between conception and execution than in any other area I know of, and there is nothing unusual about a major investment taking ten to 15 years in energy internationally.  Therefore, I would have thought that the step-down in economic activity here, to which the Chairman drew attention at the outset, and the changes that have taken place in the global marketplace, where, for example, the United States is now exporting coal, are developments that were not foreseen.  I believe they do affect the pace of decision making in other areas.  I hope the energy project will be realised for a whole variety of reasons.<\/p><p> I do not know if it is fair to say that what has happened in north Mayo is typical of Irish attitudes to industrialisation or anything like that.  I do not think it is.  I do not deny that what has happened at Corrib has been communicated around the world, as that is certainly true.  Mistakes were made, of that there is no doubt.  If one goes back far enough, to the period of switchover from Enterprise Oil to the present ownership arrangement, the mistakes were not all on one side either.  We have been trying to address these issues going into the future.  I honestly cannot recall whether an expansive piece of legislation to do with foreshore licensing, permits and all the rest has actually been published.  It certainly has been brought to Government on more than one occasion at its various stages by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It is a major piece of legislation, which is very far advanced, although it has not been published yet.  It will provide more clarity in the future in this particular area.  I have had some input into it, given our concern in this area.<\/p><p> The miscanthus episode was not a happy one, which I entirely accept.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, will within the next two or three weeks publish a major policy statement on bioenergy.  I hope it will pick up on some of the points and disconnects the Deputy has raised.<\/p><p> There has been discussion for some time now about the synergies that might obtain between aspects of two different State companies, Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte.  I believe that process is also coming to an end in the sense that there are some overlapping areas and there are undoubtedly synergies.  The question has been mooted as to whether one could create a bioenergy company by merging the two companies.  There are also strong views that both companies should concentrate on their core business and, where there are synergies, that issue should be addressed.  Those discussions are about to come to an end.  I imagine a Government statement will be made on that in the very near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014060400006#G00300","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401877200,"counter":661,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his team and thank him for his presentation.  I said in the D&aacute;il that I welcomed the Minister's initiative in putting forward this Green Paper.  I could hardly do any less, having called for it for some two years now.  I recognise it is not going to be easy to come up with a blueprint to ensure we have a sustainable, secure, competitive energy market that enjoys the support of the majority of people, particularly for certain projects in certain communities.  However, I have already indicated in the D&aacute;il that I want to work with the Minister and the Department on this because I share the vision that we have to maximise our use of renewable energy in this country.<\/p><p>  I will be submitting a detailed response to the Green Paper.  If I may, I will go through the six headings that the report hinges upon.  The first is \"Empowering Energy Citizens\".  Language is a funny thing.  We sometimes take a condescending approach towards public consultation, and what we mean by public participation or consultation is that we make \"them\" understand the scientific facts.  That is not what I would regard as \"Empowering Energy Citizens\".  What I would look for is a way to give real power to local communities and to local government, representing local communities so they would become an intrinsic part of the whole wider energy strategy.  It is not simply a question of conveying and convincing them that the science is right.  It is a process of getting communities and local authorities engaged as part of the wider energy strategy.  In that regard, I would be looking at issues such as micro-generation projects, the cost of connecting to the network and obstacles in the way of those who, in many cases, wish to put up their own money to help themselves to access energy that is renewable, that is micro and that serves a purpose for them.  We have a lot of work to do under that heading of \"Empowering Energy Citizens\".<\/p><p>  Under the second heading, \"Markets, Regulation and Prices\", and on the question of whether the CER should exist, European regulation has resulted in a fairly major overhaul of Irish and European energy markets.  In our case, the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is have been split into different companies, we have allowed some sections of those companies to be privatised and an area that was once under State control is now shifting to the hands of private companies.  I know the Minister has said it is not his intention or wish that there would be increased privatisation but the same may not be said of another holder of the office.  I will be arguing that, despite increased competition from the various energy companies and despite this push towards privatisation, energy costs have continued to rise.  The CER should be doing more, or the process involving the CER should be doing more, to control the rising costs of fuel for families and for commercial consumers.<\/p><p>  Under the heading \"Planning and Implementing Essential Energy Infrastructure\", I am concerned when I see the words \"fracking\" or \"hydraulic fracturing\" mentioned twice in the Minister's remarks.<\/p> <p>I know the Minister will say there has been no fracking and that no decision will be made until the EPA reports have been prepared.  However, I agree with Deputy Dooley on this issue.  Even if we accept the denials of fracking causing damage in the countries in which it has already been introduced, it has not been tried on a small green island with a dispersed population and a reputation for agri-food based on clean and green.  It is bordering on economic suicide to consider hydraulic fracturing given the nature of the island on which we are privileged to live.  We should not even be preparing an EPA report because we should have prohibited it from the outset.  The licence to explore was granted in the dark of night during the dying days of the last Administration.  Serious questions arise about how and why that was done.  We should not give any company the slightest glimmer of hope that we will allow fracking.  These companies will take legal action against governments if they see the slightest sign that they invested money in projects that were prevented from proceeding.  The further we allow them to proceed in their explorations, the greater the risk that they will take us to the cleaners.  We should do the prudent and proper thing, and say \"No, you cannot frack here.\"<\/p><p> I agree that we should investigate interconnectivity between the Six Counties and the Twenty-Six Counties, and between ourselves and Europe.  It is a pity that the Government did not listen to Leitrim County Council 14 years ago when, on foot of a proposal I had prepared, it forwarded a motion to what was then the Department of Local Government to the effect that every motorway development should include a multipurpose service duct alongside the road.  It would have added an additional 5% to construction costs but we would not now be having this debate about overhead wires.  It shows the lack of vision and joined up thinking - I hate that phrase - among Departments that are working within their own bunkers and refusing to sanction an additional 5% in expenditure.  It will now cost 100% more for a sister Department, all of which will come from the taxpayers' money.<\/p><p> It is important to ensure a balanced and secure energy supply based on a mix of renewables.  We should not be relying solely on wind energy.  The Minister has pointed out that the State is investing in trials of other options.  We need to accelerate these investigations.  We will have to put the energy system on a sustainable pathway.  We have signed up to legally binding agreements on reducing our CO2 emissions and it is important that renewable energy is the focus of the debate.<\/p><p> In regard to economic opportunities, the State rather than the energy companies needs to be driving the energy agenda.  The biggest risk to the vision set out in the Green Paper is that we fail to change that basic principle.  I am not arguing that energy companies should not benefit from developments in this country but the State should be setting the agenda and making decisions based on the interests of Irish people and our energy security and sustainability.  Development should not be at the whim of an energy company which will push a certain form of energy because it can get a higher grant for it.  We need to take control of that horse.  State companies like the ESB can play a role in developing energy opportunities.  Any further privatisation needs to be opposed and it should be set out in writing that we will not allow it.  All analysis needs to include an assessment of impacts of economic existing economic activities, such as agri-food, tourism and landscape and water management.  I find it somewhat scary that when I speak to people who are involved in agri-food exports, tourism or water management they feel they should not have any concerns about the threat of fracking in this country.  I do not understand that.  No company will make money from poisoned water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014060400007#H00200","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401877800,"counter":663,"content":"<p>Deputy Colreavy has covered considerable territory.  I welcome his intention to make a written submission during the public consultation phase.  In regard to empowering citizens on the energy question, the first major step in that regard is our decision to opt for a Green Paper, which allows interested parties, whether citizens, consumer organisations or business organisations, to set out, before 31 July, their considered positions on energy policy in Ireland.  If I had produced a White Paper it would have been an indication that we know best and are not open to input from elsewhere to our settled policy.  The merit of taking the Green Paper route at a time of significant change and dramatic developments that were not foreseen allows an opportunity to hold a debate that can lead to a White Paper.  We may not make our end of year target but we intend to try.  I hope citizens will take advantage of this opportunity.<\/p><p>  We also intend to hold a number of workshops and seminars on various themes in the Green Paper which we will throw open as widely as we can so that they do not involve only the obvious stakeholders.  We hope to arrange one of these sessions prior to the summer recess.  Even after the closure of the public consultation stage at the end of July we will continue to run these sessions until the end of the year.  The Deputy spoke about language and empowerment but we are heading into an era of, for example, smart metering whereby citizens will have more control over how they use energy.  <\/p> <p>They will be able to access energy when they need it instead of using it indiscriminately, as is currently the case.  Technology allows us this capability.<\/p><p> I have dealt with the issue of privatisation.  Deputy Colreavy knows the circumstances under which we were obliged to make some contribution to the bailout.  We are making a much smaller contribution than was envisaged at the time this Government came to office.  The disposal of the energy business of Bord G&aacute;is brings another major player into the marketplace.  Regarding the Deputy's other questions on pricing and so on, we have a more competitive marketplace now than we had only a short few years ago.  This is to be welcomed.<\/p><p> I should not confuse the role of the regulator when replying to Deputy Colreavy's question on whether the regulator should be doing more on pricing.  The regulator carefully scrutinises network costs to ensure they are not being ramped up and to try for some element of control over same by the network companies.  This is the only element of price control exercised by the regulator.  We have a competitive market.  Unfortunately, we continue to import 96% of our gas and 100% of our oil.  In those circumstances, we are price takers.  In addition, market and exchange rate fluctuations and the small size of the Irish market are issues with which we must contend.<\/p><p> I welcome Deputy Colreavy's acknowledgement of the importance of an appropriate interconnection between the Republic and the North.  The all-island energy market was a considerable achievement.  In that context, the absence of the interconnector to mesh the two systems together is costing us a great deal of money.  The regulator puts the figure at close to &euro;30 million per annum.  It is an important infrastructural project.  It is large in Irish terms, although not internationally, at just 40 km of transmission between Meath and Tyrone.  However, it is necessary and, from the point of view of Northern Ireland, urgent.  It is also costing the taxpayer in the South up to &euro;30 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014060400008#J00200","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401878400,"counter":665,"content":"<p>Is that because we are not accruing revenue from the interconnector or because electricity is being wasted?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014060400009#K00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1401878400,"counter":666,"content":"<p>It has to do with the efficient delivery of electricity, which is the first consideration.

The answer is \"Yes\", but I would strip out the North-South requirement as being an exception to that.  We need to get on with that part as soon as may be.<\/p><p>  On fracking, there have been new technologies since man started being inventive.  Some scared the horses at the time but came to be essential to the way we lived as civilisation evolved.  There is nothing unwise or unusual in taking expert advice on a new technology and whether it is safe or threatens the environment.  This is all that we are doing.  Our Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is staffed with experts and can take advices that it believes it might need of a professional and technical nature.  The EPA is to produce an expert report for the Government on this technology.  We have not gone any further.  There is no hydraulic fracturing under way in the Republic.  What the previous Government did amounted to nothing more than desktop surveys.  In any event, as a member country of the EU where this subject inevitably arises from time to time, Ireland needs to have a position.  Therefore, it is important that our position be informed by the best scientific and technical advice available.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Colreavy in that anything that despoils the natural beauty of the more scenic areas of this country is unacceptable, but it takes something like the Ukrainian crisis to bring home to those who sleep easy in their beds at night - in the conviction that when they plug in the kettle in the morning it will boil and when they turn on the light it will work - the fact that we cannot be cavalier about such matters.  Security of supply is an issue in the world in which we live, and if it is an issue for those plugging in kettles in the morning, it is a far greater one for large energy users, especially the kinds of major company investing in Ireland today.  The notion of an outage of five minutes would be unthinkable and would do immense damage to the industrial strategy being pursued by the country.  We have to be careful not to take security of supply for granted.  This means diversifying our sources and exploiting our indigenous resources as best we can.  We have done this effectively in the case of wind, but we must continue to keep up with technology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014060400009#K00300","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1401878400,"counter":667,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for appearing at the committee two weeks in a row.

That we are largely dependent on oil for transport means that many of these projects will play a role.<\/p><p>  My question has largely been answered, as it is similar to the Chairman's.  The first policy focuses on citizens, the participation of whom is necessary to shape the future.  In 2011, there was a decrease of 27% in transport energy and 13% in industry energy.  Energy usage per building and household has also decreased.

I often wonder if we had to undertake a rural electrification process of the type developed more than 90 years ago, how difficult it would be for us to do so in the current climate.  Under the citizenship clause, infrastructural development, citizens' sensitivity to cost and consistent supply can no longer be taken for granted.

Citizens are very price sensitive and this should always be remembered.  <\/p><p>  On the infrastructural section of the Green Paper, in terms of public consultation, we have not done a good job.

I would wager that if initiatives were of community benefit, there would be greater community involvement.  <\/p><p>  Were the views of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland solicited prior to publication of the Green Paper or have they offered their views on a consistent, sustainable and competitive energy supply?  If so, what was their view on the delivery of these cornerstones of energy supply throughout the State rather than on the eastern seaboard only?  The Minister might also say whether, as part of the research and development element of the Green Paper, there will be a greater mix of Government and private sector investment in research and development in the State.  I am not sure there is a good equilibrium.  Perhaps he might offer his view on whether there should be more or less Government intervention in research and development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014060400010#L00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1401879000,"counter":670,"content":"<p>I refer the Minister to the story I told him privately about a farmyard on which previously there was only one light but which now receives a 100 kVA supply.  I thank him for his presentation.  The energy reduction measures are to be encouraged in the home and industry.  The Minister also referred to the changes taking place.  Are we on course to meet our alternative energy targets by 2020?  It is important that there be security of supply to all corners of the country for the next 20 to 30 years, irrespective of whether it is wind, tidal or other forms of energy.  <\/p><p>  This time yesterday I visited a business park in County Meath for which almost 20 years ago I designed the electricity requirements.  I was taken aback by what had happened there.  The original idea was to develop ten sites for small to medium-sized enterprises, with each being provided with water and sewerage facilities and 25 Kw of electricity using a 200 kVA transformer.  I had not been to visit the site for almost 20 years and it had developed beyond recognition.  There is a 38,000 kVA transformer station located in the middle of the development and demand on the business park is now 200 times what was originally anticipated.  It is welcome that the ESB had the infrastructure in place to cater for all of the businesses on the site.  As I said, the original intention was to provide ten development sites, on which 100 people would secure jobs.  There are now almost 40 factories located on the site employing almost 1,000 people.  <\/p><p>  I cannot over-emphasise the importance of ensuring security of supply of electricity countrywide for the next 20 to 30 years.<\/p> <p>Perhaps that is the reason IDA Ireland is hesitant to move away from the east coast in most cases.  Yesterday I was deeply encouraged by the small IDA factories at the development I visited.<\/p><p> I knew this meeting was taking place today so wish to emphasise the importance of interconnectors North and South, east and west.  We help one another at times of peak demand and provide electricity cheaply at times of peak demand in reverse.  I also want to emphasise the necessity to move, as part of the European grid, in the interest of security of supply.  That is of paramount importance.  <\/p><p> We must reduce CO2 emissions but I am not sure who to talk to about it.  However, I am convinced that we can reduce CO2 emissions throughout the country, particularly on our motorways which have, in some instances, excessive lighting and well exceed the demand for electricity.  We should reduce the necessity to have so much lighting.  I am just emphasising the requirement for doing so across the island.  If a similar initiative was implemented in Sligo, Newcastlewest or wherever we could supply the electricity required to run a business park.  Implementing such initiatives is the way forward.  Parts of Ireland do not have an adequate supply of electricity which reduces the chance of attracting an IDA Ireland factory to the area.  A business park comprising small and medium-sized industries is the way forward for many towns that are similar in size to Kells, County Meath which I visited this time yesterday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014060400010#L00300","speaker":"1138","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401879600,"counter":672,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the meeting.  On my way here this morning I saw that he was in the company of Wolfe Tone on the corner of St. Stephen's Green.  I do not know which leadership or whatever he was following but I wish him the best of luck in that regard.<\/p><p> I welcome the Green Paper.  The Minister is open to discussion, as always.  Will someone tell me the number of different ways there are to generate electricity?  As he will know, three of the Minister's party colleagues are vociferous opponents of wind generation.  He knows who they are.<\/p><p>  The different methods to generate energy are wind, tidal, offshore, biomass, solar, turf and LNG.  Scientists present such methods, particularly wind, as being free but they are not.  It would be valuable to the discussion if the Minister included the numbers in his White Paper.<\/p><p>  Electric cars are technically feasible.  One estimate has declared that an electric car requires a subsidy the equivalent of what a normal car contributes to the Exchequer.  I say to the Minister for Finance - to whom I wish a speedy recovery - that one can do everything, technically, yet it may not make economic sense.<\/p><p>  As the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources pointed out on page 17, the energy cost for households has increased by 29% between 2007 and the publication of the Green Paper, and also industrial energy costs have increased by 31%.  That finding should ensure that energy is assessed by price alone and is also used more efficiently, including the incentive programmes that he mentioned.<\/p><p>  CER successfully made the case for the stranded asset theory in the High Court, as the Minister said, but I do not know what the economic implications will be.  Railways left canals as stranded assets and then roads left the railways as stranded assets.  If I opened a new airport in one part of England and two industries compete against each other then one will become a stranded asset.  I do not know if it is a stand I would like to hang my hat on unduly.  Progress and the changes in pricing, mentioned by the Minister, seem to indicate that it would be cheaper to bring gas into Ballylongford.  If that means a pipeline then it should be treated like an old piece of canal, a disused airport or whatever.  There is no need to disrupt resource allocation in the rest of the economy because relative prices have changed.  We might have to add coal to the picture as well.  As I gather, fracking has been deemed a success because it has led to a dramatic fall in coal and gas prices, a fact that may improve the economics of Moneypoint.<\/p><p>  I look forward to the White Paper and thank the Minister for attending.  I hope that a debate can take place after he supplies the numbers that I have asked for.      <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014060400011#M00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1401879600,"counter":673,"content":"<p>Many issues have been raised.

I come down on the side of Senator Brennan regarding the critical issue of having an infrastructure and transmission fit for purpose.  Deputy McEntee mentioned, and it was probably at the back of everyone else's mind, the scale of the stepdown in economic activity and wondered whether we need to continue to invest in building out the grid.  In response, I ask Deputies and Senators to focus on what has happened in the housing sector.  This time last year one could not sell a house here.  At the time nobody could have forecast that we would have an acute housing need in Dublin.  The housing situation changed overnight.  Similarly, the economy will recover and it has started to grow and recover.  N&iacute; h&eacute; l&aacute; na gaoithe l&aacute; na scolb.  That is not the time to start to address this issue.   Deputy McEntee was absolutely right with what she said and it has gone through my own head a lot.  We have had discussions on the matter.  There are a lot of studies on how much additional investment is needed.  There is no doubt in my mind that Senator Terry Brennan is right that one must have a grid that is fit for purpose.  The Kells Business Park is not an isolated example and will be the case increasingly.<\/p><p>  I agree with all of my colleagues who said it that this process will get more difficult.  Deputy Harrington gave examples and wondered where we would be with the 1950s rural electrification programme if we had to deal with the scale of community resistance demonstrated in some parts of the country today.  We practise a very difficult trade because it is very interesting to have the correct approach and the right scientific direction.  If a politician does not get re-elected to the House then there is not much point in having additional knowledge to use in the policy formation stage.  I understand that colleagues have come under a lot of pressure.<\/p><p>  As I said here before, if we had not built the railways when we did then one would not be able to build them now.  I am not sure that I agree, all of the way, with Senator Barrett's viewpoint that railways are a stranded asset.  I was in the west of Ireland at the weekend and witnessed a lot of people pour out of the trains.  However, I accept that the load factor may not be as big in the middle of a normal week as it was on the bank holiday weekend.  Certainly, if we had not built the railways when we did then we could not build them now.  It is a huge issue for us.  <\/p> <p>Reasonable people must be engaged with to explain that economic prosperity depends on having a grid that is fit for purpose.  The comforts of modern day civilisation which &ndash; mostly fortunately &ndash; we enjoy in this country cannot be delivered unless we have a system that is fit for purpose.  It is remarkable that we do not dig deeply into energy policy as we do into other policies.  Senator Sean D. Barrett said he saw me on the corner of St. Stephen's Green where we were launching a report published by UPC on technology, uptake of broadband and the rapid pace of change in Irish society in terms of access to the Internet.  If there is a party in the House that has a comprehensive policy on energy, I do not know it.  Colleagues find it very difficult to confront some of the difficult questions.  They have opposing views on such things as rising prices, as expected, but a comprehensive approach to energy policy has not crossed my desk.  I include my own party in this.  I am sure some colleague will correct me and say there is one.<\/p><p> The 29% price rise, to which Senator Sean D. Barrett properly draws attention, is predominantly a function of what has happened in gas prices in the intervening years.  When making a comparison to housing and assessing how quickly we can be overtaken in public policy, I should have made the point that it was interesting to note that peak demand for gas and electricity was arrived at in January 2010 after the crash and the reason was the snow in that month.  That is a salutary lesson that, unfortunately, we cannot fold our arms, say we have plenty of energy, that the economy is static and that we can relax.  The events of January 2010, outside the economic boom, show why we cannot relax.<\/p><p> The midlands export project will not proceed.  It is not feasible within the time constraints imposed by the European framework.  It was a ring-fenced project which was to adopt a different technology.  Interconnection between member states is encouraged as a central plank of European policy and is a two-way street.  We will be importing energy supplies from Britain and the impact of interconnector between Wales and Ireland has been positive on Irish prices.  The short answer to the question is that the midlands export project will not proceed.<\/p><p> Will we meet our targets?  We think we will.  With regard to renewable energy, we are halfway towards our 2020 targets in terms of wind energy.  Based on the advice we have received and the connection offers being pursued by developers, we think we will reach them.  However, the story is less positive in the areas of heat and transport, which are more problematic.  I must ask my colleagues to prepare a note in response to Senator Sean D. Barrett's point that the subsidy for electric vehicles is equivalent to the extra cost of running a normal car.  The car manufacturing sector has been addressing the issue of price of a car which up to now has been priced with a premium.  The savings in running costs have been dramatic.  Therefore, I am sceptical of the Senator's assertion, but perhaps it needs examination.  The ESB national charging points infrastructure is in place and well advanced and the final touches are being put to it.  According to European experience and the figures we have available, we are likely to see it climb dramatically between now and 2025 and it will make a contribution.<\/p><p> Senator Sean D. Barrett rhymes off the sources of energy.  The energy mix is important.  Nobody in his or her right mind would be reliant on one source of fuel.  The  Senator rightly points out that the price of coal has been falling, largely due to the shale gas phenomenon and the exports of coal from the United States.  One of the linkages policy makers cannot ignore is how to reconcile energy policy with climate change policy.  There are constraints no matter how one tries to arrange the mix.  We have climate change targets to meet and they are hugely onerous.  While I think we got the rough end of the stick in 2007, there is a price to be paid for not meeting them.  No policy maker can ignore this.<\/p><p> IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have been involved and will continue to be involved as we work towards the White Paper.  It is important that they be involved.  Microgeneration has not been an outstanding success.  Only Electric Ireland has participated or offered to help in the initiative under way in this regard.  If the argument is that the State should intervene, perhaps there might be a good argument for it, but we must measure it against the impact on prices.  However, the uptake has not been great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014060400011#M00400","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401880200,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I omitted to ask a question about the future of refining and storage.
