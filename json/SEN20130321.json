I raise two issues.  First, in recent days we saw the result of the civil action regarding the bombing in Omagh, County Tyrone.  It is a different jurisdiction but it might be useful to have a discussion on the outcome of that case to determine the options, if any, that are available to authorities in this jurisdiction.  That bombing was one of the biggest single atrocities in the Troubles, and it would be worthy of this jurisdiction to acknowledge what happened in Northern Ireland in that regard and at least explore the options that may be available to us.<\/p><p>Second, I ask the Leader for an early debate on the insolvency guidelines issued today.  Some of the headlines in today's broadsheets and tabloid newspapers suggest that they balance fairness with mercy but as mentioned in the House yesterday, the chief executive officer of Bank of Ireland, which is effectively an insolvent bank bailed out by the people, earns some \u20ac850,000 per year.  Under these insolvency guidelines, members of rural families who need two cars to go about their daily business may be forced, under these insolvency guidelines, to have only one, give up their health insurance, and have determined their television packages.  Do we have similar terms and conditions for people in receipt of social welfare?  <\/p><p>In all of our deliberations in the context of mortgage arrears and the debt crisis, the institution has always come first and the people have always come last.  I made these points to the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, in a calm fashion yesterday, and we will do what we can to make them again today with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, but at some stage the people must come first.  I am concerned because despite the announcement last week on what the Government intends to do about the mortgage arrears crisis, we see that the banks are still in control.  We now have an insolvency service that will give people already struggling a list of &quot;do's&quot; and &quot;don'ts&quot; when the bailed out banks, and the CEOs on \u20ac850,000 a year, are allowed operate to a different set of rules.<\/p> <p>In anybody's book, that is unfair.  We must do something about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100002#A00500","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363861800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Like Senator MacSharry, I refer to the high salaries earned by banking executives although I point out that there were different rules for people who were close to Fianna F\u00e1il during the last Administration.  We should not forget that.  I thank Senator Conway for yesterday's debate on restorative justice although I was disappointed that there were so few people here.  It was a very worthwhile debate.  One of the issues raised was the high level of alcohol-related problems of the young men who came through the restorative justice programme in Tallaght.  I raised and raise again the issue of alcohol and ask the Leader for a debate.  I spoke about the need for joined-up thinking.  When one sees the statistics on alcohol in a restorative justice programme, one realises yet again that we continue to need to tackle the problem of the below-cost selling of alcohol.  In the recent public consultation committee report put together by the Seanad, Members called for a minimum floor price for alcohol and for the implementation of section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act which would separate the sale of alcohol from groceries.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health to the House for a further debate on alcohol.  It is a problem across a wide range of activities.  A practical measure people involved in restorative justice would ask for is legislation to increase the price of alcohol or impose levies on it.<\/p><p>I thank the Leader and the Cathaoirleach for their assistance and co-operation with my initiative, young Senators day, which will take place in the House on 23 April 2013.  Hundreds of essays were received from transition year students on the future of Ireland or on how they feel the leaving certificate affects their lives.  Senators Jim D'Arcy, van Turnhout, Barrett and I have been judging the entries over the last few days.  It has been great to read the essays and to see teenagers' views of Ireland and the leaving certificate.  I am delighted that 45 young people will be in the House on 23 April 2013 and will have the Seanad for a matter of hours.  They will have an order of business and will make their own presentations to the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I look forward to the day and the support of other Senators for the initiative.  It is the first time it has been run.<\/p><p>I wish Twitter a happy birthday.

We saw it also when we lost control some years ago.  I mention this as once the troika turns a magnifying glass on a country which owes it money, it can identify areas in which it believes savings should be made.  This is where water charges, property taxes and a number of other measures have come from.  It happens once a country loses control.  I mention this in the context of figures published last week on free travel.  There are 3 million adults in Ireland, of whom 1.1 million receive free travel.  There are not 1.1 million people who deserve free travel.  This has happened because of add-ons.  The figures published last week are based on 1973 statistics.  No update is available.<\/p><p>I worry that free travel which is so worthy of support and is identified as a benefit to citizens will come under scrutiny to the extent that we begin to lose it due to overspending.  I do not know how 1.1 million people have acquired permission for free travel.  While I realise that those who are not able to travel on their own are allowed to travel with a partner, it seems to me that the scheme has got out of hand.  When the scheme was introduced it cost very little.  It was based solely on the time of day when buses and trains were travelling anyway.  While I am delighted that the terms were later relaxed, we have gone very far.  It is worthwhile to determine what has caused the cost to become so high that it may well place the whole scheme in jeopardy.<\/p><p>Senator Susan O'Keeffe referred to legislation to curb the abuse of alcohol.  It had not dawned on me before Senator O'Keeffe raised the issue, but I note that a minimum price would be welcomed greatly by the producers of alcohol.  They would love to see the price go up to provide them with more profit.  On that basis, I question if it is the ideal answer.  There must be a very good answer to the difficulties of alcohol abuse but I am not sure it is to give more profit to alcohol producers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100003#B01000","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1363861800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I find myself in agreement to an extent with Senator MacSharry.

It will only be when we see the proof of the pudding that we will be able to tell people that there is a real end in sight.  I also heard Pat Kenny's programme today.

The only people who opposed the motion were Deputies Miche\u00e1l Martin and Michael McGrath and the now Senator Thomas Byrne, members of Fianna F\u00e1il and the Green Party.  Four years on and two years into the life of this Government, the publication of the Mercer report shows that bankers' pay, bonuses, pensions and total remuneration packages have increased over the past two years.  People in negative equity, who are really struggling, have to look on at the lottery-type figures that these guys in banks that were bailed out with taxpayers' money are receiving.  This not just a cause of irritation; it angers people that senior bankers in banks in which we have shares, albeit a minority holding, receive these sums.  It is absolutely wrong.  During the course of that debate, Deputies Kenny and Gilmore accused the Fianna F\u00e1il Government of bottling out of dealing with bankers' pay, yet four years later and two years into the life of their Government, we still see these excessive levels of pay.  When will we see action on this issue?  It is important that we have a debate on this.<\/p><p>I support the calls made by other Senators about other issues affecting people.  When people receive their property tax notices they will look at the excessive salaries of these bankers and former politicians who caused the problems and will not see any real action taken to deal with them, yet they will have to pay property tax and suffer the tough budgets.  It is not on.  It is about time the Government delivered on the commitment its party members made when they voted for that motion in the D\u00e1il four years ago and stood up for the people.

People who come off the train in Charleville and wish to exit from the other platform have no way other than to mount a steep metal stairway onto a bridge and come down an equally steep stairway on the other side.  It is a challenge to anyone from middle age onwards and it is a major challenge to elderly people, especially when we remember that most are carrying luggage.  In the more sophisticated stations, there is a lift apparatus but in many rural stations there is no lift.  I wanted the Minister to come in and talk about it but apparently it is not under his jurisdiction.

It is because of a lack of security in the documentation.  It is far too easy to forge documentation.  There is no photographic identification on the travel pass and no way of proving the person travelling is the person who owns the travel pass.  It throws up the issue of social welfare fraud and I asked the Leader for a debate on social welfare fraud and, particularly, social welfare tourism.  Recently, three people entered the country on a Ryanair flight to Dublin Airport and visited three post offices in three counties.  They left the country with \u20ac7,000 and made arrangements for transport to take them to the same locations in a month's time.  I am told this is quite common and we need a debate with the Minister for Social Protection.  We need to see what processes and procedures are in place to stamp this out.  Whatever identification system we have is not working.

Where are the democratic elements that will stand up and tell the ECB to bugger off with itself?  Where are the people who will stand in solidarity with the brave, decent people of Cyprus who have stood up to it?  What is happening is appalling.  It is appalling to see that the bully boys of the ECB are at it again.  They did it to the unfortunate Brian Lenihan.  He was wrong and I felt sorry for him.  Now Deputy Noonan is our Minister for Finance and I expect we will have Deputy Brian Hayes, the Minister of State, in the House too.  Like Brian Lenihan, Deputy Noonan is a good, decent person with similar skills of advocacy, but he is wrong also.  Austerity does not work, will not work and cannot work.  Even economists are coming around to this view.  Why do we continue to punish our people in the interest of institutions and banks?  This is unspeakable.  Nobody, from the highest levels of the establishment down to the lowest, meanest Minister of State has shown solidarity and identified with the people of Ireland.<\/p><p>I would like to see some of these people visit soup kitchens.

I suggest to the Leader that after Easter, we should suspend the Seanad for one day to allow us, as representatives of the people, visit the soup kitchens in Athlone, Tuam, Galway and anywhere else they spring up.  If there is an eviction that day, we should go on a fleet of buses and stand in solidarity for once with the people of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100006#E00600","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1363863600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I would like to support the congratulations and good wishes to Jimmy Walsh.  He has been a great servant of this House and I look forward to joining others next week in sending him on his way.  We will certainly miss him.<\/p><p>I support Senator Mullins on what he has said here about potential welfare fraud.  What he has outlined is very serious and I strongly encourage anyone associated with or who has knowledge of that fraud to report it, because these people are defrauding the entire country.  There must be some people aware of what is going on, particularly if transport is being organised for it.  I am reliably informed that a secure ID system is being rolled out across the country to resolve this issue, but it would be worthwhile to clarify the situation here with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.<\/p><p>My main reason for contributing today is to support those who have raised the issue of the debt situation that continues to haunt countries.  Cyprus is now in difficulty and I wish it well.  It held the Presidency of Europe immediately before Ireland and did a great job.  I hope an agreement can be found between the ECB, the IMF and Cyprus so that Cypriots can live with some semblance of dignity and get on with their lives.  Everyone needs to know this is possible.<\/p><p>When we look at the personal debt problems haunting at least half of our population, we know action is needed on the ground.  We have the theory.  We have the Personal Insolvency Bill and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, is giving the banks targets.  However, I am concerned there is no action on the ground on debt resolution.  I am aware MABS is carrying out training currently so that it can put some of the strategies and new approaches in place.  However, it is so incredibly understaffed that it cannot possibly meet the needs of the droves of people who, now the banks are putting greater pressure on them need someone to whom they can turn.  We heard Senator Coghlan speak about receivers working out of hours on this.  We must ensure there are staff and appropriately trained counsellors ready to give them assistance.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact the Minister has given the banks targets to achieve.   However, I am concerned about what they are offering to do.  I am concerned that the record of people who have paid their debts and mortgages for 20 years will not necessarily be taken into account.  The banks are only looking at the capacity of these people to pay now and into the future.  People can fall on hard times if they lose their jobs, but if they have had a good record for 20 years, they should not be wiped off the screen in a matter of months.  The banks must show some heart and we must stand with the people until this debt issue is resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100006#E00700","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1363863600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom mo thaca\u00edocht a thabhairt do na g\u00e1rtha molta go Jimmy Walsh agus ba mhaith liom chuile \u00e1dh a ghu\u00ed air agus m\u00edle bu\u00edochas a ghlacadh leis as an seirbh\u00eds iontach a thugann s\u00e9 agus ar thug s\u00e9 le blianta fada anuas.<\/p><p>I find it quite ironic that Government Senators are standing up today and asking for a crackdown on social welfare fraud, when the Minister for Social Protection was in here and told us she was doing a great job cracking down on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100006#E00800","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1363863600,"counter":42,"content":"<p>She is doing a great job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100006#E00900","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1363863600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>It is certainly time that anybody who is defrauding the system is brought to task.

Many health issues are raised here on a daily basis, but we need a specific debate on the structure and management of the HSE.  We need this debate so that we can make significant savings within the system.  We had a wonderful, though harrowing, presentation yesterday in the AV room from a vascular surgeon from Galway, Sherif Sultan.  He indicated that due to cutbacks in HSE west, an ArtAssist technology which could be used to ensure that people do not need to have their legs amputated has been cut back.  That technology would cost a lot less than it would cost to bring people into the acute system and treat them.  The cost of using the ArtAssist technology to treat a person would be \u20ac1,200 over the 90-day period needed to complete the treatment, whereas bringing the person into the acute system costs \u20ac60,000.  The problem appears to be that the community sector management does not talk to the hospital management and they do not sit down together to sort out the issue.<\/p><p>We have a similar situation with regard to alcohol and addiction services in Galway.  Reports have come from consultants that it costs hospitals approximately \u20ac6 million to deal with people who present themselves with problems that are alcohol related.  At the same time, community services are suffering cutbacks in services dealing with alcohol addiction.  This is a systemic problem and we need to examine it and the management of the HSE.  We must consider why certain sections of the HSE do not discuss the issues with each other when they could save the HSE millions of euro within its budget.  I would like the Minister, Deputy Reilly, to come to the House to discuss this.  We can give him the specific details on these issues on that day.  I am sure every Senator could raise management issues within the HSE, where the lack of a manager or where sections do not talk to each other leads to the waste of millions of euro.  More importantly, we do not provide patients with the proper care they need within the services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100006#E01400","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1363863600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I do not know Jimmy Walsh for as long as some Senators know him, but I join them in wishing him a happy retirement and the good health to enjoy it.<\/p> <p>Anybody who reads the <i>Irish Daily Mail<\/i>-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100006#E01500","speaker":"1138","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363864200,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Include me out of that one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100007#F00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1363864200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>-----will find this week that a supplement in the newspaper is worth reading for those with some Irish who are interested in improving it, those who are interested in promoting Irish n\u00f3 \u00e9inne cos\u00fail liom f\u00e9in a dh\u00e9anann iarracht \u00e1r dteanga f\u00e9in a labhairt.

It is vital for this House to be kept fully informed about the deal that has been agreed in Brussels.  The detail of that deal has yet to be unfolded.  The president of the IFA, John Bryan, will be greeted by a protest in my home town of Drumshanbo tonight.  It is unfortunate that the farming lobby seems to be split down the middle on this issue.  Small and medium-sized farmers, of whom there are many in my part of the country, are heavily critical of the IFA because they perceive that it is looking after the interests of the big ranch farmers.  The decision by IFA members from several counties in the north west to hold tonight's protest is an indication of how big the split is.  While I have the greatest respect and admiration for John Bryan, I believe he has serious questions to answer about the perceived direction his IFA colleagues have taken in supporting the retention of higher payments for a small number of farmers whom they deem to be more productive than those they refer to as \"inactive\" farmers.  The definitions of both categories have not been clarified.<\/p><p>I come from a part of the country where farmers live on marginal land.  Some 98% of the land in County Leitrim is marginal.  The same thing applies in parts of west Cavan, north Roscommon and Sligo.  The payments received by the vast majority of small and medium-sized farmers are the lifeblood of the nation.  It is not just a question of giving subsidies to farmers.  Consumers should be aware that the single farm payment system is a subsidy that is keeping farm prices down in the food sector.  That is another issue altogether.  This payment is vitally important in the interests of small and medium-sized farmers across the country.  There are small farmers in County Kilkenny and in the Golden Vale who receive little more than \u20ac10,000 a year and are being put to the pin of their collars to keep their families and their farms viable.<\/p><p>I will conclude by reminding the House that small and medium-sized farmers have comprised the backbone of the Irish economy for generations.  The money they receive from Europe trickles down into local economies and sustains many towns and villages across the country.  It is vitally important for the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to keep the House fully informed of exactly what the Government means when it says this agreement gives it flexibility in deciding how to redistribute these moneys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100007#F01600","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1363864200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Aonta\u00edm leis an Seanad\u00f3ir Brennan go gcaithfimid comhghairdeas a ghabh\u00e1il leis an <i>Irish Daily Mail<\/i> mar gheall ar an leabhr\u00e1n iontach, Gaschaint, at\u00e1 sa nuacht\u00e1n an tseachtain seo.

The use of the Oncotype DX cancer test, in the cases of 300 people, has saved the HSE \u20ac856,000 in one year.  Ireland was the first country in Europe to use this test to elucidate whether cancer patients need chemotherapy.  Approximately 50% of women who were tested avoided the need for chemotherapy.  It has saved lives.  Senators know what people go through when they are subjected to chemotherapy.  Irish patients are more likely to benefit from early chemotherapy and hormonal treatment as a result of the use of this test.  Ireland was the first country in Europe to use it.  The first result was announced yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  He congratulated the doctors who were involved.  He advised that this be used more widely.  Senator Kelly spoke about patients who have been sent three or four letters.  That is a bad waste of money.  A new system, whereby patients can be texted, is coming on stream.

I want to clarify that this has now been rectified and is no longer a requirement.  The requirement to submit the P45 was causing bother to people because their jobs were being kept open for them.  I met Department officials on a number of occasions on this matter, and it has been rectified.<\/p><p>In the Leader's absence some two weeks ago, I asked the Acting Leader to arrange time on the schedule to discuss the abolition of the mobility allowance.  We could have a cross-party discussion in the House.  We do not need a Minister to do this as we can do it ourselves, just as we did with regard to the jobs initiative.  Can we please put time on the schedule to discuss this so we can make a submission and present it to the working group that is addressing the problem at present?  I believe it is imperative that a monetary payment is retained by the people who are currently in receipt of this payment.  Surely to God, with all the advisers and legal advice we have, and with all the big money they are being paid, somebody can come up with a solution.  Many Members would have proposals and we would collate all of their proposals and ideas and present them to the working group.<\/p><p>We are not sitting on the Tuesday after Easter but I am quite willing to come in on that Tuesday afternoon if we cannot find another time in the schedule for it.

Jimmy would be fairly described as a master of the accurate paraphrase.  Despite our best intentions around here, we do not always manage to say exactly what we mean in precise English prose, and it has been Jimmy's task to be relentless in the pursuit of accuracy.  I am sure, like others, I have been occasionally approached with the question: \"Does this accurately convey what you are saying?\"  Jimmy always manages to do this very accurately.  That is a particular skill and one that other journalists could and should emulate - the desire to be exactly right, precise and fair to the speaker and to the subject of comments.  Jimmy Walsh deserves great credit for that.  It is over 40 years since he first reported from this House.<\/p><p>I want to raise an issue I have raised before.  While the Leader gave me a response at the time, I could not locate it when I checked the record this morning.  It concerns the issue of unpaid development levies to local authorities.  We are reminded today of what I said previously in the House, namely, councils throughout the country are owed \u20ac750 million in development levies.  This is a remarkable issue when we think that these unpaid levies were normally required to be paid before construction work began, or at least on a phased basis, yet it so happens there is this vast amount of money unpaid.  This is, of course, a result of the bursting of the property bubble, but where was the stewardship that allowed the situation to develop?<\/p><p>On a previous occasion, I raised the stated intention of Wicklow County Council to pursue homeowners in a number of estates for sums of up to \u20ac5,000 where the developer of the estate had failed to pay the relevant levy.  There may very well be issues here in regard to how solicitors did their business and whether they have exposed their clients to strict legal liability.  However, it seems to me there is a justice issue where local authorities failed to collect levies either on time or at all.  It cannot simply be the case that people could be gone after for unmanageable sums of money.<\/p><p>This should be of interest and concern to the Executive.  I would be grateful if we could arrange for the Minister to address this issue in the House at an early opportunity.

Again, I addressed this matter yesterday.  The Cypriot stability levy on deposits is a once-off measure, is unique to Cyprus and has no impact on deposit holders in any other EU member state.  We need to be very clear that the disproportionate size of the banking sector, which is eight times the size of the Cypriot economy, and the nature of its liabilities make this a unique situation with no parallels elsewhere in the eurozone.  The Eurogroup has made clear to the Cypriot authorities its view that small depositors should be treated differently to large depositors.  To reinforce this point, the Eurogroup reaffirmed the importance of fully guaranteeing deposits below \u20ac100,000.  The structure of the levy on deposits was proposed by the Cypriot authorities and is their responsibility.  There has been no suggestion by the Eurogroup, ECB, Commission or IMF that this tax will apply in any other member state.  That clarifies that matter.  <\/p><p>Senator Kelly and several other Senators spoke about the pending retirement of Jimmy Walsh.  I hope we will have an opportunity to pay tribute to him for the excellent work he has done in reporting the activities of the House for many years.  I compliment him on his professionalism in that regard.  I hope we will have an opportunity next week to do that.  <\/p><p>Senator O'Sullivan spoke about Charleville railway station and the difficulties that station presents for elderly people, an issue he raised previously.  I will certainly bring that matter to the attention of the Minister.  Senator Paul Coghlan spoke about banks allowing families in arrears to stay in their homes.  Ensuring that people will stay in their homes and that banks will address the problem of mortgage arrears is the aim of the Government.  This is what is happening now and will happen before the end of this year.  Hopefully, this matter will be resolved.  He also called for the Credit Review Office to get involved before receivers are put in place.  I urge the Senator to bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.  Perhaps it could be raised when we discuss the Finance Bill for the next six or seven hours.  <\/p><p>Senator Heffernan complimented all involved in Irish racing and the 14 winners at Cheltenham last week.  I pay tribute to the outgoing chairman of Horse Racing Ireland, Denis Brosnan, who did such a wonderful job during his term and wish the new chairman, Joe Keeling, every success in that regard.  The Senator also spoke about John Thomas McNamara, the Irish jockey who was very badly injured at Cheltenham and who celebrated his 600th winner in point-to-point racing at Kilfeacle only a short number of weeks ago.  It would be everyone's hope that he will have a speedy recovery and we should all remember him in our prayers.<\/p><p>Senator Mullins spoke about social welfare fraud.  As another Senator noted, I presume the case to which he referred today has been reported to the authorities to ensure this type of fraud does not continue because it is important that those who deserve social welfare get it and that fraud does not occur in the system as a result of fraudsters outside or inside the country.  I think we would all agree that the vast majority of people receiving social welfare are decent, law-abiding citizens.  <\/p><p>Senator Norris was acting as a political forecaster with regard to where political parties will be in a few years time.  We will have to wait and see.  Senator Healy Eames spoke about debt resolution and the need for more action on mortgages on the ground.  We outlined those measures and, hopefully, we will see more action on the ground.  Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh spoke about the structure and management of the HSE and the lack of joined-up thinking, particularly in Galway.  <\/p> <p>I am sure the Minister would welcome information which exists in this regard but I do not believe it would be necessary for the Seanad to engage in a debate on the matter in order for said information to be furnished to him.  I hope the Senator will forward the information in question to the Minister as a matter of urgency.<\/p><p>Senators Brennan and Keane referred to the promotion of the Irish language.  Efforts in that regard are to be applauded, regardless of the source from which they come.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney referred to the proposals for CAP reform.  I will endeavour to have the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine come before the House to discuss that matter.  He has agreed to appear before us in order to discuss the situation relating to horsemeat and food labelling shortly after Easter.  We might ask him to address the subject of CAP reform at the same time.  The time allocated for the debate on horsemeat and food labelling is 90 minutes but we will probably need to extend this in order that we might address the additional issues that will arise.  I will try to encourage the Minister to come before the House for as long a debate as possible.  The agreement reached by the Minister and his colleagues in Europe in recent days is a major stepping stone in the negotiations on the reform of the CAP.  As everyone is aware, those negotiations have been ongoing for a number of years.  The successful completion of the Council's deliberations means that in the context of its goal of reaching interinstitutional political agreement by the end of June, the Irish Presidency remains very much on target.  Moreover, the strength of the qualified majority given by the Council places the Presidency in a strong position in the negotiations with the European Parliament and the European Commission.  The outcome was good for the Irish Presidency but, more importantly, it was good for Ireland.  The Council endorsed the principle of flexibility in the way in which direct payments are to be distributed within member states.  This is known here as internal convergence and it had been the outstanding issue in the negotiations from an Irish perspective.  The inclusion of the model proposed by Ireland in the range of options for member states holds out the prospect of significantly lower transfers of payments between farmers than would be the case if the Commission\u2019s flat-rate proposal had been agreed.  We will try to get the Minister to come before the House to outline the position on the reform of the CAP in early course.<\/p><p>Senator Keane raised the issue of the Oncotype DX test.  The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, announced that this test, which is used to discover whether cancer patients might benefit from chemotherapy, has been extremely successful.  Ireland is the first country in Europe to make this test available through the public health system.  Israel, Canada and the USA already fund the test.  Within the past month, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the UK has also endorsed its use in that jurisdiction.  Of the 409 women tested by the public health service between October 2011 and December 2012, 309 were deemed not to require chemotherapy and were able to avoid the significant toxicity to which several months of such therapy would give rise.  The indications to date are that the test has been a highly cost-effective intervention and has allowed the health care system to avoid the cost of drugs and their administration.  The expenditure on the test technology to date is over \u20ac1 million.  I am sure everyone will agree that this is money well spent.<\/p><p>Senator Moloney referred to invalidity pension and a matter relating to P45s which has been rectified.  On that matter, there continue to be long delays in the appeals system relating to invalidity pension.  It is not acceptable that sick people submitted their appeals up to a year ago and that these have not yet been attended to.  This matter will have to be addressed by the Government because it is just not acceptable for people to be obliged to wait so long to obtain their invalidity pensions.  I am aware of one specific case involving a man who has cancer and who is obliged to wear a colostomy bag.  He was refused invalidity pension and submitted an appeal over 12 months ago.  Each month he receives the same reply to his requests for information, namely, that his file will be sought and the matter will be dealt with.  The position in this regard is just not satisfactory and the matter will have to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100009#H00500","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363866000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100010#J00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1363866000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I accept that the appeals system is independent.

In that context, I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that we should deal with this matter at 6 p.m. following the debate on the Finance Bill.  Anyone who wishes to contribute to the debate on the matter in question or make a submission in respect of it may do so at 6 p.m.  I also propose that the debate conclude at 7 p.m.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen referred to unpaid development levies to local authorities.  There was certainly a lack of enforcement in the context of the collection of such levies.  As such, there was an element of light touch regulation on the part of local authorities.  The levies should have been collected when they were due but this did not happen.  The Senator raised a particular question with regard to Wicklow County Council and I believe I provided him with a response in that regard.  I will endeavour to encourage the Minister to come before the House in order that we might address the problem to which Senator Mullen refers.  Local authorities should have been more proactive in collecting the relevant levies before developments took place.  However, like others within the system, they rolled along thinking that the property boom was going to continue forever.  Each and every member of society knows the cost of such thinking.<\/p><p>Senator Jim D'Arcy referred to the Criminal Assets Bureau and the raids it carried out on 20 premises where suspected fuel laundering was taking place.  I join others in congratulating all involved in those raids and I compliment them on their success.  I also compliment the Senators who have continually raised this matter in the House.  I understand prosecutions may be pending but I will certainly invite the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to come before the House to provide an update if at all possible.<\/p><p>Senator Wilson inquired about the payment of the household charge through post offices and asked if an additional fee would apply in this regard.

I wish to express my appreciation of what he said on Second Stage yesterday about the research and development issue and the note on the Department's website seeking a cost-benefit analysis of all that area.  This was called for by an bord snip nua and by those who responded to the innovation task force.  The State has been spending a significant amount of money in this area, both in tax breaks and in direct expenditures.  An bord snip nua found academic articles to be the main output.  Those who believe in it are very strong advocates, as I am sure the Minister's Department has found, but there is also the need to establish value for money.  It is an important step by the Minister and his officials to commission this research.  It is time to see the results now because, as the Minister said on Second Stage, the Exchequer has serious financial problems which must be dealt with and every penny has to be accounted for.<\/p><p>  My concerns about the proposal is that the Minister is reducing from 75% to 50% the amount of research and development being undertaken.  This might result in less research and development being undertaken.  He is lowering the threshold so more people might undertake R&amp;D but the key people might do less.  The old section 27 will come under the review.  I was trying to set the review in that it is an area where I think the fiscal advisory council should be involved and the regulatory impact assessment procedure should be used.  There is serious concern and the Minister is quoted in some of the literature.  These tax breaks are not costed properly.  We do not know if the benefits exceed the costs and I welcome the exercise in this regard.  Tax breaks are used by multinational corporations to seriously reduce their tax liabilities.  The EU is looking at this practice.  <i>The Economist<\/i> has written about it and the Starbucks case has surfaced in the UK.  We have to know what these measures cost and this has not been the case heretofore.<\/p><p>  I have seen references in the literature about international tax avoidance lawyers and accountants where they are referred to as fiscal termites, because of the damage they are causing to the tax base in many countries.  International tax avoidance is a serious problem.  I sometimes fear the growth of these tax schemes.  Many of these special tax measures, often worth billions of dollars to some industry or even to a specific company, find their way into these laws and occasionally surface, surprising everyone, even those who had inserted them or lobbied for them.  That is Mr. Tansi's analysis of why lots of exchequers are in financial difficulties.<\/p><p>  While I appreciate the cost-benefit analysis commissioned by the Minister - I wish him well in that exercise - we need to have the fiscal advisory council involved and we need to revitalise the regulatory impact assessment, particularly where the tax base is being eaten by the termites.  I strongly defend and support the Government with regard to the rate of 12.5%.  However, if people are further eating away at the 12.5% rate, it presents problems for the Exchequer.  <\/p><p>  I abide by the ruling of the Chair in that my recommendation No.1 was ruled out of order because it would impose a charge upon the people.  The object was the exact opposite.  I was hoping my proposal would benefit the Exchequer.  I think the Minister's cost-benefit analysis falls into that category also.  It will benefit the Exchequer.  Value for money is a vital consideration which everyone in this House shares.  I share the Minister's aspirations in that regard.  That was my concern about section 5 as it stands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100012#M00300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1363867200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Barrett.  I will read a portion of my speaking note which covers the issues he has raised.<\/p><p>Regulatory impact assessment is a tool used to assess the impact of increased regulation arising from legislative change.  The key employee provision in this section does not apply automatically to companies.  It is available where companies elect to avail of it.  As such, it cannot be construed as imposing additional regulatory burden on companies.  I do not see that the regulatory impact assessment would be an appropriate fit for this particular issue.<\/p><p>As for the suggestion that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council would carry out an assessment of the tax credit, such an assessment would significantly expand the mandate of the fiscal council.  It would require a much larger resource in terms of both staff and budgetary allocation.  It would be likely to impede the fulfilment of its core functions.  I am reluctant to move in that direction also.<\/p><p>Despite this, as I have stated in the various discussions during the passage of the Bill through the Lower House, I am cognisant of the need to ensure that appropriate cost-benefit analysis is undertaken in respect of tax expenditure measures.  This is the reason I announced a comprehensive review of the research and development tax credit regime as a whole, which is taking place over the course of this year.  The terms of reference of the review have been published on the Department's website and interested parties are encouraged to make a submission.  One of the central purposes of this review is to ensure that the research and development tax credit gives value for money to the Irish taxpayer.  It is intended that this report will be published in due course.<\/p><p>I will share with the Senators the background to the change to the key employee regime proposed in section 5 of the Bill.  When the key employee provision was originally introduced in the Finance Act 2012, it was very tightly drawn to ensure that the scope for misuse was minimised.  The definition of key employee was constructed with that objective in mind.  As I pledged when introducing this section, we have been monitoring closely the interest in and uptake of this provision.  As part of this process, my Department has received feedback relating to the operation of the key employee provision.  One particular aspect that has been brought to our attention is that the 75% threshold for time spent on research and development has put the small business sector at a particular disadvantage as it is less likely that small firms would have sufficient resources to allow an individual devote as much of his or her time to research and development.  <\/p><p>When speaking on the issue on Committee Stage in the Lower House, I said it is important that the small business sector is not disadvantaged in this way, especially with regard to its ability to attract and retain employees with key skills in innovation.  It was never intended that the definition of a key employee would discriminate against the small business sector.  It is therefore important that this change is made as soon as possible to rebalance the playing field between the small and large business sectors in the area of research and development. <\/p> <p>To delay the change in the manner suggested in the original recommendations would have this effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100012#M00400","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363867800,"counter":156,"content":"<p>We share the same objectives on this section.  We are trying to get a growth economy back.  We all share that view because we all know the situation that the Minister has had to deal with since he came to office.<\/p><p>I wish to comment on the institutional structure for which the Minister has the expertise because he is a former Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We are quite good after the events but then it is too late, the money has been spent and the cost overruns have taken place.  As everyone knows, economists have dwelt on the question of whether the Comptroller and Auditor General should conduct an audit.  I would have given a wider range of functions to the fiscal council.  After all &quot;fiscal&quot; refers to taxation and the section deals with taxation.  Debates on forecasts are interesting but the section is about resource allocation.  At this time we are imposing house taxes and getting into hot water about special needs assistants, respite care and all of the other things.  Therefore, we must ensure that everything we do in the Finance Bill has a guarantee that the benefits will exceed the costs, otherwise the national debt will increase and will continue to do so.  I am worried about the institutional structure because so much of the institutions that presided over our getting into trouble in this country still exist.  We need to change their corporate culture and develop an emphasis on value for money just like the Minister urged for research and development.  Everything contained in the Finance Bill is of vital necessity.  <\/p><p>The Minister said that this project will be tendered out on the relevant website.  I hope that his Department will develop the role quickly because the Exchequer and taxpayer are under siege and we have a rescue operation by the troika.

It must be restored and re-emphasised because it is more important than ever as we are close to reaching the taxable limits as far as most people are concerned.  In addition, the property tax will take more money out of the economy.  Therefore, we need a value for money focus and that is the purpose of the amendments.<\/p><p>I hope that the Minister will develop the thinking behind research and development evaluation.  Quite an amount of money has been spent on the sector and it is time we saw results.  A euro spent on research and development could yield better returns elsewhere.  All of these initiatives must compete in the Minister's bailiwick to see which ones are worthwhile.  The role played by the Department of Finance is more vital than ever given the amount of borrowing that we are all trying to address.

Our priority in social protection measures is to maintain the level of the base rates of payment.  A lot of things were given when times were better.  When there was a lot of money around Finance Ministers had a certain amount of largesse to distribute, sometimes for worthy causes and other times to simply buy votes in the run-in to elections.  When one examines the provisions to make savings then one must make choices.  The choices that we made were that where there were extras which are difficult to justify, the priority was to maintain basic rates of welfare.<\/p><p>The position with the maternity benefit is that right across the public sector, women who are having a baby get fully paid and the maternity benefit is additional.  The way it works is that the employer adjusts down the salary and the amount of maternity benefit makes up the same gross salary.  As the maternity benefit is not subject to income tax the net position of all public servants who are on maternity leave is that they have more money when they are on maternity than if they were at work.  In the private sector that varies quite a bit.  Some private sector employers do not pay salaries when women are on maternity leave.  If that is the case then probably many of the women do not pay tax either so get the full benefit of their maternity benefit.  It depends on how much of their tax credits they will use up in the year in question.  There are varying impacts.<\/p><p>Overall, in terms of having to make very difficult choices, this is one that we made and I know that some people disagree with it.  That is the situation.  The full yield in a year is about \u20ac40 million.  Do Senators remember how divided they were here when debating the Social Welfare Bill, particularly an issue that amounted to \u20ac26 million?  The vote was very close and all of the Taoiseach's nominees voted against it.  That legislation dealt with about \u20ac26 million.  When one must make a choice like this there is quite a lot of money involved.  We have tried to be fair, not to be hard on any particular sector and to be even-handed.  When choices like this must be made then maintaining the basic rates of welfare is the priority.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100013#N01100","speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363867800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363867800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Section 9 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363867800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>SECTION 10<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363867800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1363867800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I agree with the section.

In terms of making choices to increase the third level student contribution, colleagues such as Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn and others signed pledges that this was a red line issue.  We have these increases now and over a period of four years there will be a significant increase.  It is difficult to reconcile that and issues such as maternity benefit taxation with the decision not to opt for those who are in a better position to sustain a small hit, such as the 3% proposed by the Labour Party as well as Members on this side of the House.  It is difficult to reconcile some of these issues, particularly for students when the cost of keeping a student from, say, Sligo in UCD or another college in Dublin is approximately \u20ac9,000 a year in terms of rent, food and other costs.

That was to ease the financial constraints on the third level sector in that students would make a bigger contribution to funding the universities and the third level colleges.  I believe that is justified.  The measure in this Bill is consequential on that to maintain the same tax position because there is not much point in raising an additional fee charge to help fund the universities if it can be claimed back in tax.

I gather the transfer has happened very recently.  The Minister may have seen the reports that a completely different version of risk equalisation was proposed by both VHI and the Department when they went to see the regulator.  My concern is that the previous system was overturned by a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court.  The theory is that risk equalisation should help older people to acquire health insurance, but even that is disputed as is the extent to which the payments exist.<\/p><p> The key evidence is in the Milliman report which found that VHI was far too concerned with telling everybody how many older members it had and far too little concerned about getting value for money.  The report sets out that a treatment which would require under best practice 3.1 days in hospital was requiring 11.6 days.  Susan Mitchell's recent material published in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>on the price of drugs is also relevant.  Are we financing high-cost producers and inefficiencies in a sector in which staffing doubled between the 1980s and the peak or is there a genuine risk equalisation payment?  Staff numbers increased from 55,000 to 110,000.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, are having great difficulty in reducing staff numbers to 103,000.<\/p><p> I put the marker down that we need to know what constitutes genuine risk equalisation in the field rather than to be told what it will take to keep VHI going.  I have therefore proposed that the section should not take effect until a risk equalisation scheme has been decided by the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank of Ireland.  I gather that Mr. Elderfield is taking an interest in it.  The previous system of risk equalisation was a source of cost inflation and damage to the Exchequer and appeared to be designed to protect a State health insurance company while damaging its competitors.  We must find out what exactly Mr. Elderfield makes of a risk equalisation scheme before we endorse what is going on now given that it has been exposed to so much criticism, in particular in the Milliman report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100014#O01600","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363869000,"counter":193,"content":"<p>The Central Bank of Ireland is the regulator for prudential and solvency purposes.  Typically, insurers, including private health insurers, must satisfy various appropriate prudential requirements.  These requirements apply generally to all insurance and financial services companies and relate to matters such as financial operation and investment policies.  The Health Insurance Authority, or HIA, is the independent regulator for the private health insurance industry.  It is the statutory body charged with the administration of the risk equalisation scheme under section 11 of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012.  It has been proposed in the past to merge the HIA and the Central Bank.  I assume it is in this context that the Senator envisages the risk equalisation scheme coming under Central Bank direction.  Such a proposal requires careful examination, in particular in regard to how it would fit in with the commitment in the programme for Government to move to a system of universal health insurance.<\/p><p>  As outlined in <i>Future Health; a Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Services 2012-2015<\/i>, the universal health insurance market will be subject to regulation.  A new insurance fund will have an important role in directly financing and centrally controlling some health care costs while managing risk equalisation payments.  The future role of the HIA and the delivery of its functions in the universal health insurance system are matters which will be considered by Government as detailed proposals for universal health insurance are developed.<\/p><p>  The permanent risk equalisation scheme introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, has EU approval and the HIA as the appropriate statutory authority has responsibility for the risk equalisation fund and the administration of the scheme.  I presume the Senator's intention is to prevent or postpone the commencement of the permanent risk equalisation scheme but it is already in place by virtue of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012.  The import of the section before the House is to put beyond doubt that the standard-rate income tax credit is based on the premium net of any risk equalisation credit which is a position similar to that which obtained during the interim risk equalisation scheme when the standard-rate income tax credit was net of the former age-related income tax credits.  The section, therefore, has no bearing on the commencement of the risk equalisation scheme and the Senator's recommendation would not have its presumed intended effect.

It proposes the preparation of a report on pre-retirement access to all forms of pensions savings in certain unspecified circumstances.  The proposal is prompted by the inclusion in section 17 of provisions for limited pre-retirement access to additional voluntary contributions, or AVCs.  I made clear in my Budget Statement and during the debate on the issue in the D\u00e1il that the AVC access provisions being introduced in the Bill are restricted and temporary in nature.  My intention is not to incentivise pre-retirement access to pensions savings but rather to enable and facilitate access in a limited way without damaging core pension provision.  For this reason, AVC draw-downs will be liable to tax at the marginal rate and the provisions will apply only to a percentage of those contributions together with any proportionate investment return made by pension scheme members over and above the regular or compulsory pension contributions under scheme rules.  In this way, pre-retirement access does not impact on an individual's core pension savings or entitlements.  To provide otherwise would have damaging implications for the individual and the State down the line.  The protection of core benefits could not be guaranteed by less restrictive arrangements for pre-retirement access to pensions savings.<\/p><p>  As regards the preparation of a report on the matter, I pointed out in the D\u00e1il that at the request of the Government's Economic Management Council, or EMC, an <i>ad hoc<\/i> group was established in 2012 under the chairmanship of the Department of Social Protection to consider the idea of allowing people to access their pensions savings before pension age to assist them to pay down debt.  The <i>ad hoc<\/i> group presented a detailed report to the EMC in September 2011 which concluded that the principle of pensions savings being locked away until pension age should be maintained.  The interdepartmental group on mortgage arrears also examined the issue of early access to pensions and did not recommend such an approach.  A copy of the report to the EMC can be sought by Senator MacSharry from the Minister for Social Protection.<\/p><p>  In addition, the OECD has carried out an independent review of long-term pensions policy in Ireland on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection.  I understand the report on foot of the independent review is being prepared and will cover, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the issue of pre-retirement access to pensions savings.

I am, however, somewhat glad that it is not possible to do so because I cannot help feeling that under the personal insolvency legislation there would be an enormous incentive to put pressure on self-employed people in particular to access pension funds, which would have a negative impact on the security of self-employed people in old age.  Would it be possible to keep this matter under review so that if it continues to be difficult for those in small businesses, particularly self-employed people, to access credit, some access to pre-retirement funds would be considered, with safeguards in the context of the Personal Insolvency Act?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100016#Q00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1363869600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Hayden.

They have to put the money into a defined benefit scheme rather than being able to access it.

The considerations would be on the one hand to protect the contributor so that he or she would have an adequate pension but on the other hand to protect the State because if people in contributory pension schemes were to withdraw their contributions they would not have benefit and the State would have to pick up the tab later in the form of non-contributory pensions.<\/p><p>The best way to approach this is to await the publication of the OECD study which the Minister for Social Protection has sought.

I do not know the amount because that is not how we publish the Finance Bill.  What will this cost?  Should we not be trying to cure Ireland of land speculation and try to get the economy over a very bad property bug?  Is there a moral hazard element here?  People lost money in buying and selling land and they certainly cost this country dearly if we go through the accounts of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide in particular.  They polluted the entire banking system.  We do not pay out on losing lottery tickets or betting slips.  If people lost money buying and selling land in the past decade in Ireland, they are among the least worthy people to give tax breaks to.  This morning, I heard a spokesperson for the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i> talk about the concerns about land prices escalating, when we are trying to promote agriculture rather than the purchasing and selling of land.  It is a concern when we try to increase agricultural output.  Are we giving tax breaks to people who lost money selling land?  If so, why?  Is it not part of what got us into the mess the Minister and everyone in the House is trying to cure Ireland of?  If people lost money on land, the prices paid were ludicrous by any standard and there is a moral hazard in giving an undertaking to such people that they can write off the losses for tax purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100017#R01700","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1363870200,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Referring to the recommendation ruled out of order will give us context.  The recommendation sought to amend section 381(a)(2) inserted into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by section 18 of the Bill.  The new section 381(a) concerned one of two measures contained in section 18, both of which relate to those engaged in the trade of dealing in, or developing, land.  The other measure concerns debt forgiveness and the tax consequences that flow from it and affects all those engaged in dealing in or developing land either actively or passively.  The new section 381(a) relates to the restriction on loss relief for individuals taxed as dealers or developers in land but who are not actively engaged in the trade.  The restrictions apply where the loss arising from the interest on debt incurred to finance the purchase or development of land held as trading stock, which is deducted but not paid, or from a decline in the value of land held as trading stock where the loss in land value, has not actually been realised.<\/p><p>The Senator's recommendation seems to be going a step further in that he appears to propose that the facility to apply for loss relief against other income provided for under section 381 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 should be denied in respect of any loss arising from the write-down in the value of land held as trading stock by the individual concerned, irrespective of whether loss is realised or not.  The reason I have introduced the restriction on section 18 is that I have been made aware by the Revenue Commissioners of instances in which significant loss relief against other income, giving rise to very large repayments of tax, have been claimed where, for example, losses in land had not been realised.  To some extent, the problem arises because of the accruals basis of accounting, which provides that expenses are recognised when they are incurred rather than when they are actually paid.  However, I have no desire to deny taxpayers the long-established facility of setting losses incurred in one business activity against income from other sources so long as the loss has actually been suffered before doing so.  The Senator's recommendation clearly goes beyond what is necessary to deal with the specific problem identified to me by the Revenue Commissioners.

People come to the Acting Chairman's area for certain reasons but there are other areas in the country where there is no facility or reason for people to come.  Potentially, if we set about a greater joined-up version of thinking, some of the tax incentives could be applicable to and spread the benefit to a new facility somewhere else.

The material prepared for us by the most helpful Oireachtas Library & Research Service when the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, was here discussing The Gathering indicated that there has been a serious decline in value for money in Irish tourism.  I am unsure whether that can be made up by giving the sector fiscal concessions.  I would welcome at some stage an Irish private sector that would actually put money into the Exchequer rather than always having the begging bowl out, particularly in the context of so much demoralisation that has taken place down the line with people who are trying to cope with tax bills and so on.  I am beginning to question whether we need a private sector which is always in and out of the Department of Finance looking for tax breaks, grants and so on.  If someone stays in a proprietor's hotel, he gets to keep the money.  That is the incentive.<\/p><p>The product and price have deteriorated.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, said it has come back, but at a great cost.  The sector had to introduce vast reductions and so on.  It is an unusual sector in that it wants the State to do much of its marketing.  At least other companies do not call on the State to sell their products for them.  It has been making undue demands on an Exchequer which, as we saw earlier, had to move in this very Bill to tax maternity benefit and so on.  We could do with a little less begging-bowl conduct from the Irish Hotels Federation, IBEC and the construction industry.  We are trying to cope with an Exchequer which has far more pressing demands from low-income people.  I realise the measures might eventually translate into employment gains but certainly we are encouraging bad habits by the so-called Irish private sector, which always seeks out the Exchequer as a resort for running its businesses.  We need a little more entrepreneurship than that.  I will not press the recommendation but I am surprised to see the measure because tourism is probably going to revive after some self-imposed penalties related to over-charging and bad value for money.  For a hard-pressed taxpayer to be invoked in the recovery of the sector sends out the wrong signal when everyone else is having to make sacrifices.  I will not press the recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100019#T00400","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363871400,"counter":259,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363871400,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Sections 23 to 27, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363871400,"counter":261,"content":"<p>SECTION 28<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1363871400,"counter":262,"content":"<p>Recommendations Nos. 18 and 19 from Senator Barrett are out of order because they involve a potential charge on the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100019#T00900","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363871400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Recommendations Nos. 18 and 19 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363871400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That section 28 stand part of the Bill.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1363871400,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I wish to comment on the cost benefit analysis.

Had we not gone ahead with that, it would have saved money.  Anyway, I appreciate the ruling of the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  The retail sector was discussed here yesterday.  The reason retailing is in difficulty in town centres is largely due to all the factors we have been discussing in the House.  We have had to take an extra \u20ac10 billion out in taxation since the recovery programme began and that is why people do not have money for shops.  Giving people fiscal privilege to build shops near Georgian houses does not seem to me to be a good idea and it would not have cost money had we withdrawn the fiscal privilege.  That is my view but I will not press the recommendation.  It seems to me that what started out as people living in Georgian houses has extended by the second half of the section to more construction subsidies for shops in cities which already have ample empty shops, unfortunately, as we know.  This goes back to the general macro problem that the Minister and his Department have been trying to deal with.  However, one cannot solve that by giving tax breaks to people to build new shops in what were previously Georgian areas because we already have a surplus of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100019#T01900","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1363871400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I welcome this section, which contains the living city initiative.

During the 1980s, for example, tax incentives were used to prevent the destruction of the inner city of Dublin.  I know we could look back at some of the properties built during that period and say that many of them were not the kind of dwellings we would like to live in, particularly some of those built along the quays by some developers.  However, if we cast our minds back to Dublin in the late 1960s and 1970s, there is no doubt that without the measures taken during the 1980s, the city would be in a much worse position.<\/p><p>Philosophically, I disagree with Senator Barrett.  The debate so far has been very one-sided and is very much along the lines that any interference with the market is a distortion and should not happen.  The market is not perfect and it is our duty not to allow it to have free rein.  If the market had free rein, people would be living on the streets because they would not be able to afford housing.  I believe the time has come to take stock of where we are today and to decide that as a result of the imperfections of the market, it behoves us to take certain steps to remedy the exigencies of the market.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider some developments to follow on from the living city initiative.<\/p><p>First is an initiative to try to reverse some of the significant and serious damage that has been caused to some of our towns.  Recently, I had reason to drive through Arklow and some of the towns of Wicklow and Wexford and found it truly shocking that so many businesses have closed down in these towns.  A few green shoots and a few extra bob into the economy will not solve the problem.  There are deeper issues, such as upward-only rent reviews.  It is not just the fact that people do not have money in their pockets; there are other difficulties and problems.  I believe the tax code could be used productively to try to relieve some of these difficulties.<\/p><p>There is an issue coming down the line in regard to housing.  Every time there is any mention of providing help or assistance to the construction sector, Senator Barrett gets up to argue against it.  It is like a red rag to a bull.  However, it is normal in any developed economy for the construction sector to constitute approximately 10% of the economy.  Our construction is way below that level at approximately 3%.  We are in serious danger of having a sector that will not be able to respond to increased demand when the economy recovers.  It is not just a matter of when the economy recovers.  Statistics show, particularly our recent census statistics, a significant rise in population at a time when we have no social housing being produced by local authorities and no private sector housing supply.  As Senator Barrett knows, the difficulty with regard to construction is that it cannot be turned on and off at will.  It is something for which we must plan.<\/p><p>We now have a difficulty with rising rents and people on low incomes who cannot access housing.  I urge the Minister to consider seriously the use of the tax code to alleviate this, bearing in mind that a construction sector that falls below a certain point is a danger for any developed economy.  It would also be useful to use the tax code to stimulate the construction of housing specifically for people on low incomes.  I am not just talking in terms of voluntary housing associations.  I suggest commercial construction using the REITs mechanism be introduced in the legislation to incentivise housing for people on low incomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100020#U00100","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1363872000,"counter":275,"content":"<p>The problem with this scheme is that it is far too narrow.  Yesterday, on the Order of Business, we had a number of calls from Senators in the House for a debate on town and city centres generally that would look at creative interventions that could be made to help regenerate towns, villages and cities across the State.  I am currently doing some work for the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with regard to developing a jobs action strategy for the regions.  In any of the conversations I have had with local authorities, the need to regenerate town and city centres is a major issue.  I agree with Senator Barrett that the main problem is that the macro issues of retail spend and footfall are down.  This obviously has an impact on city centres.  The issue of upward-only rents is also a significant issue, has an impact on the retail sector and must be dealt with.<\/p><p>Some creative pilot schemes have been put in place to deal with some of the issues.  Carlow, for example, has a pop-up policy which is a creative way of encouraging businesses to showcase new ideas, enterprises and opportunities.  It allows them to present themselves for a couple of weeks by giving them the use of a free space or empty building.  I hope that policy is successful.  We must go beyond the limited proposal in this Bill and look at ways of supporting the regeneration of town and city centres across the State.  Any lift in the economy, better budget choices by the Government and putting more money in people's pockets will be a large factor in terms of the regeneration of city centres.<\/p><p>The initiative in this Bill relates to the regeneration of Georgian houses, but we should also consider the regeneration of housing stock in general.  Many regeneration projects in Limerick, Waterford and Dublin, such as in Moyross in Limerick, have been put on hold, but those regeneration projects should go ahead.  These are the kind of initiatives on which the Minister should focus at budget time because they create jobs and provide a social dividend for communities which are suffering.  We should regenerate the housing stock that needs to be regenerated and create jobs in that area.  I would like to see money going into those areas.  This would create opportunities for small entrepreneurs and contractors but would also support social cohesion and community development.  It seems odd to many people that we would include a scheme for the regeneration of Georgian housing, but not continue with regeneration projects in housing estates in many urban areas.<\/p><p>On the broader point of constantly looking at creative, innovative ways in which we can support town and city development, this is something we would all support.  I hope the Leader will facilitate a wider debate on this important issue in the House.  There is more to be discussed in that regard, including retail policy and out of town developments such as shopping malls.  These issues must all be part of the wider issue of planning and retail policy.  I hope the Minister will respond to these points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100020#U00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1363872000,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I agree with much of what has been said, but disagree with some points made.  Senator Barrett makes a valid point that the days of providing tax incentives to do something that is unsustainable, just because we would like nice old houses to be retained, is questionable at a time when we are bringing forward tax increases of the order of \u20ac44 billion for this calendar year, having risen from \u20ac34 billion in 2008.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Hayden with regard to the construction sector.  We must get those previously involved in the sector, mostly men, back working.  Many of these people will not retrain but will rot for the rest of their lives unless we get them back working in the sector.  However, I disagree with Senator Hayden that we need to build more housing, because there are thousands of unoccupied houses in the country.  The last census indicated there were approximately 200,000 homes unoccupied throughout the country.  I made a point earlier in the context of the incentive for hotels and guests.<\/p> <p>I do not know that I am in favour of a town zone.  Prices immediately increase in areas that benefit from tax incentives.  The same thing happens when grant aid goes into many areas.  The construction sector gobbles up the moneys that are made available and there is no actual benefit.  I am in favour of projects that encourage people to go to city centres to do business, to work in jobs, to avail of entertainment facilities or for similar reasons.  It should be up to each town or city to come up with such projects.  Rather than specifying a zone and saying \"there you are lads, off you go\", we should act in a clever and strategic way by making it possible for voluntary groups and local authorities, etc., to get involved in projects that benefit from tax breaks.<\/p><p>I will give a good example.  Wexford County Council was based at a number of sites throughout the town of Wexford before it built its fine new premises.  Business has been affected since they all moved to the new location, which is approximately a mile from the town centre.  That is what happens.  I am using that as an example.  We have a duty to keep premises, facilities and projects in our town centres.  I am not sure whether we need to focus on shops.  We can focus on other things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100020#U00300","speaker":"1160","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363872600,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I thank everybody who has contributed to this interesting debate.  I am not sure anybody has the complete answer.  We have to try.  We can see what is happening.  There is a real problem with cities and towns throughout the country.  The centres of our cities and towns, with exceptions like Dublin, Galway and Cork, are dying.  I am not sure what the answer is.  I am not sure what degree of answer these initiatives will supply.<\/p><p>It is not correct to say the Government is abandoning other regeneration projects.  The regeneration of Moyross, which was mentioned by Senator Cullinane, is moving ahead far more progressively than it was in the past.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, gave the keys of new houses to 30 or 40 residents two weeks ago.  Now that the first phase, which merely involved the demolition of houses, is over, that project is delivering by rehousing families in modern accommodation.<\/p><p>The problem in Limerick was aggravated by the fact that three local authorities - Limerick City Council, Limerick County Council and Clare County Council - were making planning decisions.  As part of the merger of the two main local authorities, the headquarters of the new authority will be located downtown at the new City Hall.  The real problem is the doughnut effect, whereby the city centre is derelict as a result of activity being allowed to move to the outer suburbs, which happen to be administered by a different local authority.  The planning decisions that were made by that authority drove the doughnut effect and aggravated it more.<\/p><p>When we assessed the main towns in Ireland, we found that Limerick and Waterford came at the bottom in terms of all social statistics.  We decided those cities should be prioritised in the event of any intervention.  We have provided documentation in support of this decision.  I do not know whether the approach we are taking will work.  The idea is to create living cities again.   We want to provide incentives not to developers but to people who might be prepared to refurbish houses to live in.  Unlike under section 23, the tax benefit will accrue to the owner-occupier rather than to the developer.  People who live in cities need small shops and retailers.  The owner-occupier is being incentivised under this aspect of the tax break as well.<\/p><p>This scheme is being introduced on a pilot basis.  If it is successful, we will consider extending it to other towns and cities.  It would be difficult to get EU permission for a wider scheme.  That is why we have assembled this scheme in such a limited way.  While the area of Georgian architecture on the south side of Dublin has been well developed, some of the Georgian architecture in the Mountjoy Square area of the north inner city is not in very good condition.  I know that an application to operate a pilot scheme in the capital city would not get through Brussels.  We are more likely to get this pilot scheme though because we have statistics to show that the Georgian areas of Waterford and Limerick are in a pretty bad state.<\/p><p>We intend to enact these provisions now before undertaking a cost benefit analysis in support of our efforts to overcome any state aid problems at European level.  If Europe signs off on the scheme, it will be available from 1 January 2014 - it will be an issue for the next calendar year - and then we will see how it works.  If it works, we will be prepared to extend it to the centres of other towns.  If it does not work, we will have to try something else.<\/p><p>There is no denying that there is a problem in this regard.  It will not be remediated by the market.  If we rely on market forces, the place will fall down.  The market solution would be to allow the place to fall down and move to a low-cost environment on the edges of the city.  Such locations have certain advantages, such as flat fields, low cost bases and free car parking around supermarkets, that are not found in cities.  Intervention is needed because the market will not solve it.  We hope this set of interventions will help.  We will monitor and measure this initiative as we go along.  If it works, we will be prepared to extend it.<\/p><p>One can complain and whinge forever.  If one stands back to look at problems for too long, one will allow them to continue to get worse.  One has to try possible solutions.  I do not think every solution will necessarily work.  We have to try solutions to the problems we see.  We have to give it our best shot.  That is the position.  We are not bringing back a raft of tax incentives like section 23 for developers.  That is not the purpose of this initiative.  Its purpose, as suggested in its name, is to create living cities where families live and to ensure the shops and ancillary services they need are provided within that environment.  I hope it works.  If it does, it does.  If it does not, we will have to try something else.  If it works, we will expand it from the pilot phase to other locations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100021#V00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363872600,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363872600,"counter":280,"content":"<p>SECTION 31<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1363872600,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I move recommendation No. 21:<ul><br \/>In page 69, subsection (1), lines 17 to 27, to delete paragraphs (<i>m<\/i>) and (<i>n<\/i>) and substitute the following:<ul>&quot;(<i>m<\/i>) in section 278(6) delete all words after &quot;Any allowance which under subsections (1) to (4) is to be made otherwise than in taxing a trade shall be available primarily against&#8221; and substitute &quot;all other income.&quot;.&quot;.<\/ul><\/ul>We might call the scheme being introduced in this section the Shannon Airport scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100021#V00500","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1363872600,"counter":282,"content":"<p>It applies to all airports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100021#V00600","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1363872600,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I accept that.  I am arguing that airports should be allowed to offset investment against all income, rather than rental income only.  The Minister acknowledged in his comments in the other House that this amendment is being made to assist Shannon Airport, which is fine.  I want to make it clear that all Senators on this side of the House are supportive of Shannon Airport.  Ireland needs Shannon Airport to be strong.  If it receives the right supports, it can act as a real economic driver for that region and help to ensure the regions contribute to the national effort in a sustainable way.  Some of the measures the Government has announced to help Shannon Airport are to be welcomed in that context.<\/p><p>As the Minister is aware - we have corresponded on it - I have a lodged a complaint with the Directorate General for Competition in Brussels regarding the supports that were announced for Shannon Airport.  I have made the specific argument that the supports, in isolation, will upset the balance of competition that naturally exists between Ireland West Airport Knock and Shannon Airport.  I have suggested that something proportionate should be done to assist Ireland West Airport Knock and allow it to contribute to the national effort and act as an economic driver for the north west.  Nothing near the level of support that is being afforded to Shannon Airport would be required.<\/p><p>Frankly, all Governments have looked at the north west as something of a pain.<\/p> <p>It is seen as a case of \"The north west is crying for supports again\" or \"The north west is lobbying for investment again\", whereas the reality is that, if examined strategically, the north west can make a very significant contribution to the national effort and, not least, begin to cover its own costs.<\/p><p>The performance of Ireland West Airport Knock in recent years has been acknowledged by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and others.  With \u20ac160 million in supports in the last ten to 15 years, we have seen Shannon's business drop 63% whereas, with supports of some \u20ac15 million for Ireland West Airport Knock, we have watched business there increase by close to 350%.  The Minister very kindly corresponded to me that the amendment he made in the D\u00e1il spread this out and opens it up to all airports.  However, given the importance of rental income, it is only an airport like Shannon, considering the gift of all of the rent roll of Shannon Development to that airport, which would have the income to write that investment off.  In many ways, therefore, it is like giving oars to Ireland West Airport Knock and a speedboat to Shannon Airport, and then saying &quot;Look, anybody can win this race&quot;.  The reality is that without the tools to perform to potential, there is no question that one of the two will be a burden on society and on the nation rather than being a net contributor and, indeed, an engine for growth.<\/p><p>I reiterate that I am all for Shannon but I have used the vehicle of a complaint to DG Competition to highlight the need for the Taoiseach to effectively do something for his region in the same way the Minister is so admirably doing something for his region in the context of Shannon Airport.  I believe it is possible to do that, as I have said to the Minister in private, by announcing an investment programme along the lines outlined by the board at Knock.  Indeed, following the complaint, a senior delegation met with the board and there is an agreement to examine a way forward over the coming weeks.  I hope that will culminate in the announcement of an investment programme, not to throw good money after bad into a project that will not produce dividends but to acknowledge the strategic role this can play.  To reiterate, if necessary, more can be given to Shannon but something proportionate must be done for Ireland West Airport Knock so that, together, both can ensure the western seaboard, in particular the south west, can act as a driver and contributor to the national effort in a sustainable way, where historically it has not been in a position to do so.<\/p><p>While I have gone off on a bit of a tangent to provide context, this amendment effectively asks that all income be included by way of write-off on any investment that might be made.  To go further, although it is not encompassed by this amendment, while we are restricting the write-offs that are available to higher earners, if people are prepared to invest in projects such as this and there is a net gain to the taxpayer, the community and the country as a whole, we should try to facilitate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100021#V00700","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363873200,"counter":285,"content":"<p>This section introduces a scheme of accelerated capital allowances for the construction and refurbishment of certain buildings and structures for use in the maintenance, repair, overhaul or dismantling of commercial aircraft.

The relief will apply not only to the hangars which are required but also to the tear-down pads and other facilities that are necessary for this sector to develop.<\/p><p>The effect of the Senator's first amendment would be to remove this section from the high earners' restriction, which seeks to ensure a minimum 30% rate of income tax is paid by high earning individuals.  In the programme for Government, a commitment was made to reduce, cap or abolish property tax reliefs and other tax shelters which benefit very high income earners as well as the implementation of a minimum effective tax rate of 30% for very high earners.  Therefore, this is an amendment I cannot accept.<\/p><p>The Senator's second amendment is not entirely clear.  As currently drafted, this recommendation would impact way beyond the specific capital allowance regime being introduced in this section.  I will assume that he wishes the amendment to apply only in the context of this section, such that there should be no restriction on the use by investors of capital allowances against all income in respect of qualifying investments.  Currently, the allowances can be set against the investor's rental income in the first instance, with sideways set-off against other income restricted to \u20ac31,750.  To remove this restriction would not be in keeping with Government policy on the use of capital allowances applied to passive investors in various incentive schemes over the years.  It would also impact upon the changes made in the Finance Act 2012, which terminated the carry forward of unused capital allowances beyond the tax life of the building.  This recommendation would effectively restore the position in the property market that existed previously and caused such difficulties.  As a result, I cannot accept this recommendation.<\/p><p>I do not know where the Senator is getting his briefing but the incentives for Shannon and other airports have absolutely nothing to do with rental income or the setting off of rental income.  I do not know where his briefing is coming from but it is fiction - there is no basis to it.  The incentives for development of an industry to refurbish aircraft at any of our airports, whether Knock or Shannon, is an incentive for private investors who put their money in to build hangars and ancillary facilities.  It has nothing to do with the Shannon Airport Authority investing any income it might have.  The rental income on rent rolls at Shannon was needed for the running of the airport and it will not be invested.  In any case, it is not yet clear what the corporate structure of the new airport authority will be.  In normal circumstances, as a public agency it would not be in a position to avail of tax incentives.  I do not know where that briefing is coming from.<\/p><p>The advantage that Shannon has is that it has commenced the activity already.  The second biggest Russian airline, Transaero, has just commenced refurbishing there and has taken over an Aer Lingus hangar.  To develop the industry further, incentives to provide hangars and pads are needed.  Whether this will work or not is, again, an open question.  However, the exact same incentives apply to all the other airports.  The only impediment to development in smaller airports is the length of the runway.  Obviously, if one is refurbishing large aircraft, one needs the runways to be sufficiently long to fly in and fly out.  Therefore, while it will not apply to the little regional airports where runways are short, the runways at Knock are quite long.<\/p><p>In the D\u00e1il, Deputies from the west, from Mayo in particular, said there was a possibility of activity at Knock, which would be the dismantling of aircraft and the recycling of parts of aircraft.  Therefore, the word &quot;dismantling&quot; was brought into this section in the D\u00e1il to allow for that activity, which the management in Knock says it is can attract in.  However, if one wants to get engaged in full refurbishment and can attract in the investment, the same rules apply whether it is Cork, Dublin, Knock, Shannon or anywhere that has a runway long enough to land the aircraft.<\/p><p>I hope we can develop an industry here that we did not have before.  We have a huge aircraft leasing industry based in Dublin and a massive proportion of the world's leasing of aircraft is now financed out of Dublin.  Again, we have certain advantages on aircraft refurbishment.  If one has under-used airports with fairly open skies, one can fly in and fly out.  It is like heavy industry - it is that kind of work.  It would be of great benefit if it can be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100022#W00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1363873200,"counter":286,"content":"<p>The Minister mentioned regional airports.

I do not know what market failure it is supposed to be addressing.  We have extremely profitable airlines.  In fact, the world's most profitable airline put in on St. Patrick's Day the world's largest international order for new aircraft this year.  The leasing business is prosperous.  When Guinness Peat Aviation, GPA, was in its hay day, it created many millionaires.  This tax break is for highly profitable airlines to buy hangars in which to keep their aircraft.<\/p><p>  This section of the Bill proposes that extremely rich individuals can reduce their tax liabilities by subsidising hangars, which will presumably be built at high cost by the construction industry, which is in the know in this regard, and rented to highly profitable airlines.  I oppose the section because I do not know why we got involved in this type of enterprise.  However, I will not push the matter.  We cannot subsidise everything out of a bankrupt economy.  It seems that the aviation sector is doing splendidly.<\/p> <p>If it knows there are subsidies available, it will be only delighted to meet the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  What is the point?  Government subsidies are intended to help those on low incomes to survive, but this is a case of high net worth individuals getting tax breaks in respect of the provision of hangars for airlines.  The leading Irish airline is worth about 35% more than the leading American airline.  It is a highly profitable business.  Why at a time when we are introducing a tax on houses in which people live are we giving it subsidies to house aircraft?

The argument is that the proof of the pudding is in the eating in that if as a result of a tax break, we generate more economic activity, it must be in the interests of the State.

The clause that alarms me is that &quot;the tax exemption applies only to the income and chargeable gains of the property rental business.&quot;  We discussed earlier with Senator Hayden the danger that we return to where we were when &quot;the tax exemption applies only to the income and chargeable gains of the property rental business.&quot;  These tax subsidies to property have caused so much trouble in the past and precipitated the problems that the Minister of State, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform must deal with on a daily basis, and which this House must confront.<\/p><p>  Are there early warning systems or safeguards in place?  I appreciate the points made by my good friend, Senator Hayden, that there may be shortages in the property market but this would mean we are going back so soon to a system which did so much harm to the country.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, could brief the Minister of State on that.  My fear is that land and property speculation has been extremely damaging, and we should allow prices to fall even further.  There is a concern that tax exemption for properties is detailed in the explanatory memorandum for this section.  Do we need such a provision again?<\/p><p>  From 2003 onwards we found it difficult to shut off these systems.  Are safeguards built into this so that we will not precipitate another property bubble, as we probably had the world's worst property bubble, apart from South Africa, according to <i>The Economist<\/i>?  That was fuelled by fiscal privilege and I am concerned about the impact of it in this section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100026#AA01400","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1363875000,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome this provision in the Finance Bill, which is a positive development.  I have personally championed REITs for many years.  This is not a property subsidy, and it is important that Senator Barrett understands that.  Effectively, this will be a company structure allowing property to be owned in an effectively collective fashion by shareholders.  This would tax the income of the company in the hands of the shareholders and not in the hands of the company itself.  In other words, capital gains tax would be paid by the shareholders on the transfer of their shares and income tax is paid by the shareholder in the hands of the shareholder.<\/p><p>This allows a more efficient and transparent process, facilitating better property development and corporate governance.  It puts property on an equal footing with other forms of traded commodities through the Stock Exchange.  It is a positive development which will open the Irish property market to international investment in a way that has not been done in the past.  The signs are positive with regard to the interest of international investors in Ireland on foot of a qualified recovery in our fortunes.<\/p><p>Having mentioned all the positives, I will address a point made by Senator Cullinane relating to the various limits mentioned in the recommendations put down by Sinn F\u00e9in that were not accepted.  What is being proposed under Irish REITs is similar to the examples in the UK; I would not seek amendments at the moment and would prefer an attitude of waiting to see the results.  The only area Sinn F\u00e9in did not address with a recommendation was loan-to-value ratios, which in Ireland would be 50% but in the UK is 40%, and I would have argued for a recommendation in that respect.  We can adopt an attitude of waiting to see how the process transpires.<\/p><p>I will put a concern to the Minister of State in the same way I put previous concerns to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  All of the interest so far in REITs comes from the commercial investment sector and relates to retail or industrial property, for example.  I would very much like REITs being developed for residential property, particularly with NAMA holdings.  I mentioned before that NAMA currently owns 10,000 properties in the residential rental sector, and there would be a perfect opportunity to transfer a large body of residential properties to REITs.  That would bring the advantage of much more professionalism into the rental sector, as we have seen a lack of professionalism because of what is termed in Australia the &quot;mom and pop&quot; market.  Most Irish rental properties are owned by people with one or two properties, leaving the market subject to rises and falls, with rents going up and down.  That is unacceptable as one in five families in the country live in rented properties.  We cannot keep taking the rises and falls we have seen with rented properties, and the property portfolio of NAMA presents an ideal opportunity to transfer a significant volume of properties into a REIT structure.<\/p> <p>Promoting REITs in the residential sector would require some form of push from the Government.  That flies in the face of everything Senator Barrett believes but we cannot let the market rip, whether that rip is on the way up or on the way down.  I have noted that when the market is rising out of control or falling out of control, economists say we should let the market find its natural level.  I am not in favour of that because too many ordinary people fall victim to the market finding its natural level.<\/p><p>REITs are most welcome but additional measures will be necessary to encourage investment in residential property.  As I said to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, I am very concerned that we will see a very significant property shortage in urban areas in the not too distant future.  The famous overhang in the Irish market is all very well if we can persuade people to move to Monaghan, Cavan or some other Border counties, but there is no overhang in urban areas such as Dublin, Cork or Galway and it is expiring rapidly in other urban areas.  I very much welcome this measure but it should be taken a step further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100026#AA01500","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363875600,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their observations on this section, which deals with REITs.  It was made plain in the Budget Statement that this would be in the Finance Bill.  This is replicated in approximately 35 other countries that have sustainable investment in rental property.  It is something in which we see potential for sustaining the property market after what has been an extraordinary shock.<\/p><p>On the point raised by Senator Hayden, the truth is that we do not have one property market in Ireland, but hundreds of property markets.  If one lives in Dublin there is a variety of difference in price between west, south and north Dublin, and that is replicated across the country.  Whether we like it or not, our futures are inextricably connected to the market getting back to some kind of sustainable level.  Nobody wants to see the type of unsustainable house price and commercial price inflation that developed in this economy over a decade or so.  The objective is that if we can establish through REITs and other measures a sustainable basis of investment in rental property, that will be in the long-term interest of a property market that has traditionally not treated people in the rental sector or the rental sector itself as an investment in the way it should have.<\/p><p>The REITs are effectively taking out what is a double taxation agreement.  At present, if one is a company one pays from the investor side and one also pays on the corporate side.  By equalising the pitch, as it were, one creates opportunities for businesses, both big and small, to invest in property as a long-term investment.  That must be in the interest of a sustainable Irish property market into the future.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane asked very pertinent questions.  I realise his recommendations cannot be dealt with, but perhaps I can help in this regard.  His party put forward a number of suggestions on Committee Stage in the other House, and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, brought forward two specific amendments to deal with the issues Deputy Doherty raised.  One was on the question of dead equity, which was dealt with by the Minister through additional protections.  The point made by Senator Cullinane is correct.  We must ensure there is protection for people if they go down this route.  As a result of the observations his party made on this and the improvements that were made consequently, we are satisfied we have dealt with that in so far as we can.<\/p><p>I am aware of Senator Barrett's views on this.  They have been well argued and articulated not just in this House but in many other fora over the years.  It is a position of letting the market settle where it settles and we will see what happens.  The dilemma in this case is that so much of our economy is predicated on the construction industry, a sector that went from 20% of GDP down to approximately 5% today.  I was speaking at a conference earlier this morning about trying to encourage public private partnerships, PPPs.  There is extraordinary interest in the Irish PPP market, given the fact that we were not in this space for the last number of years.  However, because the risk to the sovereign is diminished, people now see Ireland as an opportunity for public private partnerships.  We must get the property industry stabilised and moving in some shape or form, because tax and other revenues for the State are predicated on transactions in that sector.<\/p><p>We see the REITs as a logical development for investment in the rental sector for both large and small companies.  I agree with Senator Hayden that it is not an incentive or subsidy.  It removes a lacuna that has been in place for a long time and which has really not helped the sustainability of the rental sector in Ireland.  Our rental sector is out of kilter with the rental sectors in other western European countries.  We appreciate that home ownership in this country is very strong, but we must have a sustainable market for investors who wish to invest in the rental sector.  We very much hope that section 41 and the establishment of REITs is a step in that direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100027#BB00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363875600,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363875600,"counter":334,"content":"<p>Section 42 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363875600,"counter":335,"content":"<p>SECTION 43<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1363875600,"counter":336,"content":"<p>Recommendation No. 27 is out of order as it involves a potential charge on the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100027#BB00600","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363875600,"counter":337,"content":"<p>Recommendation No. 27 not moved.<\/p><p>Question proposed: &quot;That section 43 stand part of the Bill.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1363875600,"counter":338,"content":"<p>The section deals with capital gains.

The Minister often asks us for alternatives when we criticise the Government for cutting various allowance, and we bring forward proposals.  This was a practical one that could have been implemented.  In fact, had the rate been increased to 40% it would have raised \u20ac160 million, a very significant amount of money when one considers some of the cuts that were made in the budget.

Does the Government intend to increase the rate to 40% in next year's budget?

It is a fair and equitable argument that those who make money on the transaction of substantial holdings or on taxes should pay a little more and it is being done in a fair way.  At the time of the budget, we pointed out that this was an example of those with more having to pay more.  If we did not do this, we would be left in a situation where we would have to raise income tax.  The firm view of the Government is that the best way to keep people at work and to create the environment where it pays to work is not to increase tax on work, so we have to look at other means of taxing.  We have proposed these increases in the three areas of the capital taxes.  <\/p><p>We will keep these matters under review.  The net issue is always whether there is a guarantee that one will get more tax in by increasing tax.  That is an ideological question which has been around since the time of Jesus Christ himself.  The whole objective of increasing tax is to get more tax in, in particular in circumstances where there is a deficit.  If one increases a tax to an exorbitant level, human nature being what it is, people will do strange things and will react in different ways.  We will keep these matters under constant review but the basic argument behind the increase in CGT from 30% to 33% is to help us bridge a gap in the fairest and most equitable manner possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100027#BB01000","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363876200,"counter":342,"content":"<p>Does the Minister of State have the figures in respect of the yield from the increases from 2009 to 2013, inclusive?

As always, I was actually trying to save the Minister some money.  A few minutes ago, the Minister of State praised the increase in capital gains tax, so why are we giving away \u20ac3 million tax free?  The explanatory memorandum states that this section ensures relief from capital gains tax to apply to disposals where the consideration is \u20ac3 million or less.  The Minister of State praised capital gains tax a few minutes but we are giving away \u20ac3 million.  It is a general feature of the Bill and I think we will have to remedy it for future years.<\/p><p>What is the case for this?  It cannot just be slipped in towards the end of a very long Bill.

I am not sure that Paul is a deserving person.  He is obviously very rich, because I do not know anybody who has walked off with \u20ac3 million tax free, quite a successful lobbyist - lobbyists have done damage to this country - and well got in lobbying circles.  He could be a large landowner or a high net worth individual.  I do not know anybody who could benefit from this.<\/p><p>The problem with all these tax breaks and grants is that they are capitalised in higher asset prices anyway, so one is making it more difficult for somebody who does not have \u20ac3 million to give away.

I did not know the Exchequer was so full of money that we were giving away \u20ac3 million.  Who is this for?  It stresses the need for the cost benefit analysis and the regulatory impact analysis.

It is not the case that someone must have \u20ac3 million in his back pocket; it is on the value of disposals qualifying for the relief from next year by individuals aged 66 and over.<\/p><p>Section 47 ensures that relief from CGT will apply to disposals of qualifying business or agricultural assets by individuals aged 66 or over on or after 1 January 2014, where the consideration for the disposal is \u20ac3 million or less in terms of the total value.  This section also provides for the aggregation of the consideration of disposals made on or after 1 January 2014 by such individuals in the disposal.  It is a \u20ac3 million lifetime limit.<\/p><p>My understanding is that the section is to encourage farmers to move their farms on to younger farmers.  It is not a question of a subsidy or a tax break but an encouragement in terms of economic activity and viability of agriculture land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100029#DD00100","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1363876800,"counter":364,"content":"<p>The downside of this is that all of these tax breaks are capitalised in higher land prices.  We mentioned earlier that one of the differences between Ireland and New Zealand is that New Zealand pulled all these subsidies and grants out and the price of land fell, leading to new people entering agriculture.  We are making land more expensive and, therefore, people cannot get into it.  That is part of the row the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine must cope with over the level of subsidies attached to agriculture in Ireland that are not related to production.  It refers to more than agriculture but to have \u20ac3 million worth of assets to dispose of is an achievement in itself.  How they managed to get this tax break I do not know.<\/p><p>What this shows is that future finance Bills must have the arguments made in full before they are published and we get them.  While these sessions are useful, it would be beneficial if we could see in a measured way if there were deserving cases given all that is going on in the country.  I will not press the recommendation, but section 48 is along the same lines.  The fact some people get the right to dispose of \u20ac3 million worth of assets free of capital gains tax when we are pursuing people with much small incomes for much heavier burdens indicates that finance Bills must be taken in a wider context in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100029#DD00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1363876800,"counter":365,"content":"<p>The wider context is that we are encouraging those of an age who want to transfer their business to a younger member of the family to do so in a way that encourages additional economic activity.

When the Minister for Finance makes this proposals on budget day I often wonder whether he is doing so for the purpose of raising money or improving the health outcomes for people in the country.  There is a symbiotic relationship between the two.<\/p><p>  Section 49 increases the rates of tobacco product tax, which when VAT is included, amounts to 10 cent on a packet of 20 cigarettes with a<i> pro rata <\/i>increase on other tobacco products and with an additional 50 cent on the 25 gram packet of roll your own tobacco.  As a result of the budget increase the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category has increased to &#8364;9.90.  The excise duty component of this price is &#8364;5.57.  The total tax, inclusive of VAT, is &#8364;7.31.  The excise duty component of this increase is 49 cent.  This measure is expected to raise &#8364;25 million in a year.<\/p><p>  It has been a long-standing policy objective of this and the previous Government to use this measure as a means of collecting more tax as well as trying to discourage people from smoking.

We all want to reduce the number of people who are dying from cancer every year.  The money generated by the excise increase will go straight into the coffers of Government.  The increase in the cost of a packet of cigarettes is a certain deterrent but it is disproportionate in that it will hit those on lower income much more.

Many of us on both sides of the House have been calling for such a scheme for many years.  I am glad some progress is being made in this regard.  Naturally, we do not feel the proposed scheme goes far enough.  We have particular concerns with regard to the licensing requirement that will govern who is permitted to participate in the scheme.  As the Minister of State will be aware, operators in the agrifood sector are exempt from the road transport licensing provisions.  It is extremely unfortunate that those who transport food produce for primary manufacturing will not be eligible to benefit from the proposed rebate scheme because they do not need to hold road haulage licences.  The 80% of produce that is exported is making a substantial contribution to the national recovery.  I think this should be considered seriously.  We should also be prepared to cater for people outside the agrifood sector who look after their own deliveries and have their own trucks.  I cannot imagine that their exclusion is in line with the spirit of this legislative measure.  I hope the Minister of State will look favourably on this proposal.<\/p><p>  In addition, my party would like the rebate of 7.5 cent per litre to be increased to 15 cent per litre.  Some 15,000 trucks are involved in international deliveries from Ireland on a weekly basis.  I estimate that the vast majority of those who drive the trucks source their fuel elsewhere because it is not in their interests to source it here.  If it was worth their while to get their fuel here, that would have a net benefit for the economy.  Given that 80% of agricultural produce is exported, as I have said, we could make significant gains by trying to ensure those who drive the 15,000 vehicles I have mentioned embrace this scheme and get their fuel here rather than abroad.  I think a gain can be made in this regard.  I hope the Minister of State will consider these two issues, which can be dealt with and solved quite easily.

In introducing this rebate of excise duty on auto diesel, the Minister was seeking to reduce the costs of small businesses that are driving export-led growth.  He also wanted to assist the tourism industry in the year of The Gathering.  I am conscious of the costs involved for the Exchequer and the risk that such a scheme could be open to abuse.  One means of facilitating compliance is to restrict access to the scheme to tax compliant and licensed operators.  I do not believe \"own account\" operators are in competition with hire and reward operators, for the most part, because most of them by their nature provide transport services for their own products.  While I appreciate that companies have reduced their overheads as far as possible, \"own account\" operators have a greater facility to incorporate transport costs within the overall cost of their products.  My main concern in this area is to ensure the risk of fraud under the rebate scheme is minimised.  The requirement to hold an operator's licence from the Department of Transport, or an equivalent licence recognised under EU law, is a significant element of the compliance regime in this regard.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the recommendation.<\/p><p>The proposed recommendation No. 30 would add two EU regulations, in the areas of food hygiene and livestock transport, to the provisions referred to in the Bill as it stands.  The two regulations set out requirements for the transportation of animals and food products, but they do not set out any transport licensing requirements.  The transport licensing requirements as they stand are adequate and comprehensive for the purposes of this section.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the recommendation.  Recommendation No. 31, which seeks a doubling of the relief, cannot be accepted on budgetary grounds because it puts all the risk of price increases in auto diesel on the Exchequer and would be unacceptable at this time.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, made the point in the other House that we have gone as far as we can in this section to help people in the haulage area for whom transport is a lifeline.  We want to provide an even playing field with regard to the competition they face abroad.  We also want to get some funds back into the country.  We know that auto diesel tourism is a reality.<\/p><p>The amendments made by the Minister in the licensed operators area have been very significant.  I was struck by the arguments I heard from that group about the significant investments they have to make in their coaches and buses in the interests of the Irish tourism product.  This important product is a key export.  When people come to this country on coach tours, they want to sit in buses and coaches with good specifications.  The point has been made that the exponential increases in the cost of fuel in recent years have made it increasingly difficult for people to purchase new vehicles.<\/p> <p>This has made it increasingly difficult for people to purchase.<\/p><p>We conceded on the question of the haulage industry and in fairness to the Minister he has gone even further.  Having listened to the arguments made by tour operators and coach tour industry, he tabled an amendment in the other House.  That is as far as we can go without raising the possibility of an abusive regime emerging because one cannot attach this to licensed operators.  I ask the Senator to understand the Government's position and accept the degree of flexibility we have shown.  Unfortunately, we have minimal scope for flexibility because we do not have money.  The arguments have been well made in respect of the haulage industry and coach tour operators but that is as far as we can go because we are limited in what we can do. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100031#FF01600","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363878600,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I will respond briefly as I do not wish to intrude on Senator MacSharry's territory.  The Minister of State's comments on coach tour operators are very important.  For a long time, we had in place a Bord F\u00e1ilte certification regime and the side of tour coaches featured a shamrock.  I gather this part of the Irish tourism sector did not contract when many other parts of the sector declined.  People believed that having people travel around the country in buses was a strange form of tourism and asked whether individualism was not about to take over.  The coach tour operators have done well under the legislation.  I note the Minister of State's comments in that regard.<\/p><p>On the freight side, the choice facing a firm is to do this work itself or hire in a haulage company.  In the past, almost all transport was own account, for example, the breweries had their own transport fleet.  Up to 83% of transport was done by companies internally and hired haulage was deliberately restricted in an attempt to shift traffic to the railways which did not work.  The former Minister, Mr. Peter Barry, opened up competition in 1998 and I understand the percentages have changed, with hired haulage companies have a market share of roughly 70%.  The measure will still distort competition, depending on whether a firm undertakes its own transport operations or avails of a concession that is only available to licensed operators.  This may give rise to a competitive element. <\/p><p>I appreciate the Minister of State's comments on the general shortage of money and difficulties of enforcement.  At least licensed hauliers are in the licensing system and there is a strong quality element involved.  Approximately one third of freight movements will not benefit from the measure given that companies providing their own freight transport account for 30% of the transport market.  Those are my thoughts on the matter.  <\/p><p>As Senators have stated, will the dairies have in-house fleets.  They could easily obtain licences because they have high standards of vehicles and should qualify.  The result could be that the hired haulage share of the market will increase to beyond 70% as companies seek to qualify for the scheme.  Firms may continue to reduce in-house transport fleets to qualify for the assistance available under this measure. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100032#GG00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1363878600,"counter":410,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's comments are unfortunate, although I accept that criteria must be followed to give people access to the scheme.  Tax compliance is one issue and the Revenue Commissioners will have the relevant information in that regard.  Vehicles will be taxed.  Surely it is possible to amend the Taxes Consolidation Act to require that for compliance purposes a company must declare the number of vehicles it operates.  Enforcement will then dictate whether someone is entitled to access the scheme.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State correctly noted, we are depending on the export market to help us get out of our economic problems.  Far from saving the State money, this measure will reduce the competitiveness of companies that make their own deliveries.  Some years ago, while visiting Berlin, I saw a Gilbeys truck deliver the company's products, which include Bailey's Irish Cream.  It is unfortunate that the Minister of State does not see the benefit of extending the measure.<\/p><p>Everything has the potential to be abused and all schemes may give rise to fraud.  That is the reason we have law enforcement.  One does not legislate to facilitate criminals or refuse to give the good guys in the transport business a fuel rebate because one fears the bad guys will try to exploit the measure.  There is no doubt the bad guys will try to exploit the law.  The purpose of enforcement is to weed them out.  For this reason, it is not acceptable to refuse to act for the reasons given. <\/p><p>While I fully appreciate that money is not available and I am aware that there is a major issue with tax foregone, 15,000 vehicles top up on fuel as soon as they arrive at their destination abroad and fill up again just before making the return journey to Ireland.  I am sure this practice results in the loss of a large amount of tax, albeit one that is difficult to quantify.  I accept my proposal carries risk but one must at least make a stab at addressing this issues.  One must speculate to accumulate, as it were.  While there are many positive aspects to the scheme, it is unfortunate that it does not cover the kind of ground it needs to cover.  The proposal to extend it would make it more attractive and produce more dividends, specifically from the 15,000 vehicles which are being filled up with fuel elsewhere. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100032#GG00300","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1363878600,"counter":411,"content":"<p>While I broadly support the amendment, I have a number of questions.  Has this measure been costed by the Department?  What would it cost the Exchequer to introduce the proposed scheme?  We heard examples of larger, multinational companies transporting and using their own transport sections for haulage purposes.  A number of smaller Irish companies, notably in the food sector, which use their own transport to deliver goods are struggling.  This scheme will make it more difficult for them to compete.  One could contend that large companies will conclude it is preferable to hire in licensed hauliers to deliver their goods because they will receive a rebate that is not available to businesses that use their own transport.  This may result in a shift towards larger companies using outside firms to do their haulage in order that they can avail of the tax break.  Such a scenario will have a knock-on effect on transport jobs within large companies.  If the saving is not significant, it may transpire that one is robbing Peter to pay Paul.<\/p><p>  I appreciate the Government does not have sufficient resources to extend the scheme.  However, achieving a short-term saving may result in a greater loss down the line as jobs are lost among those employed directly by companies to transport goods.  If company X lets go of its drivers, gets rid of its trucks and hires in a licensed haulier to do its deliveries, the Government will end up paying the rebate to the licensed haulier.  It would make good business decision for a company to use an outside company.  The <i>quid pro quo<\/i> for this scheme may not be delivered.

Although we would all support measures to decrease drinking, the problem with this tax measure is that it is not proportionate.  Those on lower incomes will pay the same extra amount on their alcoholic beverages as those on much higher incomes.  It is more punitive for those on a lower income who have suffered many other cuts.  It defeats the purpose in trying to kick-start the economy because money is being taken from the pockets of those consumers in the lower income brackets who spend what they have in the local economy and, therefore, less will be spent in local communities.  It is a very unimaginative proposal to go back to the old reliables and hit those who have paid enough already.  It will be easier for a person on a higher income to continue drinking as much as he or she wants, whereas it will be a deterrent for those on lower incomes because they will not be able to afford to drink as much.

The more responsible use of alcohol and the price increase will help in that regard.  I support the Minister of State in this instance.  The minimum pricing proposal will enrich the industry.  If we are to increase the price of alcohol, the Minister of State and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, should be the recipients, not the industry.  The industry campaigning with abstainers for a minimum price of alcohol is bizarre.  I think the original pub licensing regime was based on the fact that the Irish Parliamentary Party had persuaded the British Government that as there were fewer pubs in Ireland, the Irish were more sober.

My personal view - Senator John Gilroy agreed with me - is that the money should go towards suicide prevention measures and dealing with mental health issues.  The Minister said there was a European dimension that prevented us from doing this, which is a matter of concern.  This is an area in which, not necessarily to penalise the drinks companies or consumers, harnessing what might be positive consumer sentiment would contribute to the ring-fencing of an amount of money when, effectively, people were making a purchase to enjoy themselves.  A general vox pop I have carried out demonstrates very positive views.  Various figures have been bandied around as to what amounts of money would be raised.  The vintners say it would be up to \u20ac200 million, but I think it would be closer to \u20ac120 million.  That \u20ac120 million would cover the entire \u20ac88 million required for the suicide prevention policy which we submitted in recent weeks and \u20ac22 million would be left over for the accelerated roll-out of A Vision for Change.  I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, would be delighted with that amount of money and I genuinely believe the public at large, if informed, would listen.  This is not a tax forgone issue, rather it would be a levy that would be specifically ring-fenced for this area.  Senator Sean D. Barrett spoke about the success of the National Roads Authority in reducing the number of deaths on the roads.  This could form part of the panacea or solution to this problem.  If there is a European Union angle that prevents it from happening, the issue should be prioritised at the Council of Ministers.  I am sure the proposal would find favour Europe-wide if we were to say this was a measure we could embrace.  If there is an aspect of an EU directive on competition or other law that would prevent it, the Council of Ministers, during the Irish Presidency, could remove it and harness what could be a vehicle to harness public sentiment by ring-fencing a contribution specific to an area, while people enjoyed themselves in the depths of the recession.

However, the trends in drinking alcohol have changed.  What they show is that people are not drinking in bars as much as they used to, but that there has been a huge increase in off-sales and sales through retail outlets.  What has increased dramatically in the past couple of years is the abuse of alcohol and the number of people presenting at alcohol addiction services.  As I mentioned on the Order of Business, it is great when two Department come together, in terms of their thinking, such as the Department of Health and the Department of Finance in dealing with certain issues.  I wish that could happen in dealing with finance issues now and again.  Certainly Departments do not think on the same lines.<\/p> <p>In the HSE west, for example, some \u20ac22 million has been spent on acute services in Galway hospitals because of the increase in people showing up with alcohol related problems and the number of bed nights these people have had to be kept in hospital.  However, the money being spent on the preventative aspects of this problem is being cut back and the services are being curtailed.  As a result, the problems increase.  Senator MacSharry suggested some form of ring-fencing for these funds and I agree the Department needs to consider that.  Perhaps there are initiatives that need to be put in place.

If people are on a lower wage and the tax on their drink is increased, that will hit those people harder than those on a higher wage.  That is the reason we believe it is a disproportionate tax and that to try to cloak this increase as a measure to curb drinking is a fallacy.

Therefore, if one was to go against this, one would need to provide an alternative source of income.  Excise duty on beer has not increased since 1994.  Budget 2010 reduced the excise duty on a pint of beer by 12 cent, so this increase of 10 cent leaves the excise duty on beer below the pre-budget 2010 level.

We have actually called for a debate on poverty in this House on a number of occasions but have yet to have that debate.  People are experiencing levels of poverty in Ireland that have not been seen before.  Poverty is affecting householders who have never previously found themselves unable to pay for the very basics, such as heating.  Certainly, while one might argue that cigarettes and alcohol are optional, heating one's house is not an optional extra.  We have seen instances of people dying in freezing cold houses in recent years in this State.  We know that people are living in very cold conditions and are finding it very difficult to cope.  Adding extra taxation to coal, peat briquettes and other solid fuels is not the way to go and the Government should be ashamed of itself for bringing in this particular measure.  It will particularly affect lower and middle income households.  I attended a meeting in Galway on Friday last about burglaries and the rate of household fuel theft is going through the roof at the moment.  Ruthless villains are actually drilling into people's oil tanks and stealing their fuel.  That is indicative of how difficult the situation is for families out there.<\/p><p>One cannot consider this measure in isolation but in combination with the other costs that have been introduced such as the property tax and so forth.

The Government could have gone after the money that wealthy individuals and companies in this State have but it chose not to do so.

From 1 May 2013, an increase in price of \u20ac1.20 is proposed in the case of a 40kg bag of coal and 26 cent in the case of a bale of peat briquettes, based on current prices.  This represents, in the case of coal, an 8% increase and in the case of briquettes, a 6.7% increase.  The argument we are making for this relatively high increase, in percentage terms, is reflected in two facts.  First, there is currently no excise duty applying to these fuels, prior to the carbon tax.  Second, these are the dirtiest fuels available.  Solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels and there is an environmental argument at play here in terms of why we are pitching this as we have.<\/p><p>In fairness to the Minister for Finance, what he said on budget day and since then is that this will only come in after the winter period, from 1 May this year.  Also, he is phasing it in over a two year period.  The charge will be \u20ac10 per tonne this year, from 1 May and then \u20ac10 per tonne next year, in May 2014.  He is spreading the effect of this over a two year period, in view of the comments made by colleagues about the difficulties being faced by people.  <\/p><p>It is also worth saying that we have a national fuel scheme which provides \u20ac20 per household per week over a 26 week period from August to April.  That money will continue to be paid, obviously.  That is not an insignificant amount and the budget for the fuel allowance scheme for this year alone is estimated to be \u20ac210 million.  The scheme provides help to those who need it and that is the way it should be.  To date, since 2000, more than \u20ac115 million has been paid in grant support towards 270,000 upgrade measures in 110,000 homes under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme.  <\/p><p>Therefore, from an environmental perspective and on the basis that excise duty did not apply up to now, the increase is relatively sharp but we have mitigated that somewhat through the phased increase over a two year period.  Also, the fact that the measure will not take effect until after the winter should make some difference to people.  Having said that, I do appreciate the points Senators have made.  We do not want to do this but in the current circumstances, where we are trying to balance the books and get a fair spread across the various tax headings, we were left with no other option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100035#KK00300","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1363880400,"counter":444,"content":"<p>Regarding paragraph (f) of that section, dealing with diplomats and their coal, presumably the Department was told to insert that by the EU, whereby ambassadors are exempt from the so-called coal tax.

It is anticipated that the proposed increase will raise some \u20ac50 million for the Exchequer over a full year.  The decline in new car sales combined with increased competition in car prices and consumer moves towards buying cheaper and cleaner cars has resulted in a fall in VRT yields from \u20ac1.4 billion in 2007 to less than \u20ac400 million in 2010.  That is a fall of \u20ac1 billion over a three year period.  <\/p> <p>That trend has continued in 2011 and 2012.

The public consultation formed the basis of a wide-ranging discussion with the industry.  The revised structure announced in the budget continues to retain a positive incentive to purchase low CO2 emitting cars.  The point was made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, elsewhere that people who buy substantial high-end cars, albeit with new emissions technology, are paying little if any road tax at while the rest of us are driving cars that are six, seven, eight or nine years old.  There has been an attempt to rebalance this in terms of the proposals we have set out.  The amounts involved, some \u20ac50 million, are not insignificant.

I imagine the increase will not change matters much although there has been a large exodus of customers from this area.  Anyway, I believe we could raise the same revenue by an <i>ad valorem<\/i> tax.<\/p><p>  Let us consider the figure of &#8364;290.  I gathered some quotes from the health insurance business.  For example the VHI one plan plus is &#8364;957 and therefore the tax would be 30% percent of that.  The VHI HealthSteps gold plan comes in at &#8364;320 but the tax is 91% of that.  The VHI first plan plus comes in at &#8364;1,336.99 and the tax is 22% of that.  It is a flat rate of tax regardless of the health insurance expenditure.  I realise there is some moderation and the Minister of State referred to a high-cost provision but broadly it is a flat-rate tax.  This may drive people out of the lower end of the market.  The VHI HealthSteps gold plan costs &#8364;320 and therefore a &#8364;290 tax is a 91% tax on it.<\/p><p>  If people pay more for health insurance and move up to more expensive plans why should the tax rate fall?  For next year could be Minister of State see whether a percentage rate on health insurance transactions to raise the same revenue could at least reward the schemes which achieve the economies which we all want in the health service and which drive down the price?  In this case for lower priced plans the tax rate goes up which seems to me to be contrary to what the Houses seeks in respect of what is a very expensive health service.  The health insurance scheme has been driving away customers although it is part of the Government's plan to bring about a system of universal health insurance.  It is a regressive form of tax to have the same amount charged regardless of the price.  Clearly, this leads to a higher share of the low-cost product and that is the problem I have with it.  It is not so much a matter for today, but will the Minister of State consider in future raising the same revenue by a percentage tax, calculated to bring in the same revenue, and which will charge more to high-cost plans and less to budget plans?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100036#LL00900","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1363881000,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Barrett.  It is widely accepted that community rating, which is the cornerstone of private health insurance in Ireland, cannot survive without risk equalisation.  This was the justification for the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, introducing on a permanent basis the risk equalisation scheme for the Irish market late last year.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act ensures that in the interests of societal and inter-generational solidarity the burden of the cost of health services is shared by insured persons by providing for a cost subsidy between the more healthy and less healthy, including between the young and the old.  The risk equalisation credits are funded through a stamp duty levy payable by open market insurers in respect of each insured life, and thus ensures that the scheme is self-financing.  It is something of a circular flow - the money comes in and it is given back to them for the purpose of equalising the risk.  That is my understanding.<\/p><p>The rates recommended by my colleague Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and approved by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, are set out with the sole aim of providing the necessary funding for risk equalisation credits while not incurring a deficit or surplus in the scheme.  The specified rate for the period 1 January to 30 March, inclusive, is maintained at 2012 rates to allow insurers time to trade in to the new scheme.<\/p><p>The combined effect of Senator Barrett's recommendation would be that no health insurance levy would be payable in 2013.  Presumably, this ties in with some of his earlier recommendations to section 15, whose object was that the permanent risk equalisation scheme would not come into effect until the scheme is under the control of the Central Bank.  However, the scheme is already in place by virtue of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act which was introduced late last year and provides that no levy is payable in 2013.  The recommendation would mean there would be no funds available to pay the risk equalisation credit which was introduced via the Act of last year.  Once the Act was in place there was a corresponding responsibility to collect revenue to fund what is required in this circumstance.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett has put forward a novel and interesting proposal which we may need to consider more closely in the fullness of time, because it is effectively introducing the same rate of tax throughout the whole system.  One would have to do some type of actuarial analysis to determine whether the funds raised from that would help to fill any deficit in any of the insurance companies over a period of years.  We will consider it more closely but for our purposes today we must remain loyal to the section and to the intention of the section, which is to provide the funds necessary for risk equalisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100036#LL01000","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1363881000,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and I will not be pressing the recommendation.

The Department is hiring them to tell it how to get them to pay the tax.  It is ironic that these are same four of five firms who specialise in taxation law.  I have a concern that we are asking the citizens of the country to pay more.  We have said we are at the upper limits on income tax, VAT and excise duties.  The rate of corporation tax is 12.5%.  I asked the Minister if it would be a case of scaring the horses if we were to consider raising the corporation tax rate.  His answer was that it was better to leave it alone.  I am happy to leave it alone if they pay the 12.5%.  However, if they are not paying the 12.5% I think we should send a very clear message that we want to do the right thing.

I have raised this issue several times in the House.  As has been suggested, there is fear in government such that the multinationals, the 12.5% rate and existing system are not to be touched.  Following a parliamentary question that was asked some months ago, it is evident that the effective tax rate paid by multinationals who come under the 12.5% rate, which presumably would include indigenous companies who benefit from the 12.5% rate, is effectively between 5% and 6%.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State is aware that there are very strong moves, initiated by the British, the French and Germans, to address this issue.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer wrote a strident letter to the <i>Financial Times<\/i>  about three weeks ago in which he made it quite clear that they would not tolerate the Starbucks scenario any more.  As the Minister of State will be aware, France has had difficulties with Google and the Germans have also weighed in on that.  I am anxious to establish what is happening here in this respect.  Something must be going on within the Department of Finance on this issue.  The Minister of State is not unaware of what is going on in the outside world.  He is aware of what is happening.  Has he done any investigation as to what will be the impact of this Europe-wide initiative by three of the most powerful economies in Europe which are obviously going to tackle this issue once and for all?  The Osborne letter makes it quite clear that they are not going to allow this to slide.  They are going to go after this.  The Starbucks issue is a scandal.  If that was happening in this country, I wonder whether this or any Government would move on it or would it put forward the argument that Starbucks is providing employment, paying taxes and operating within the law.  Starbucks admitted it has not paid any tax for however many years it has been operating in the UK.  That can be measured up against what was stated by the Department of Finance in response to a parliamentary question, namely, that the effective collection rate is between 5% and 6% and I understand the remainder is being written off through royalties and other tax shelters.  As Senator Barrett has said, a team of tax lawyers comb through every dot and comma and every line of the tax legislation to maximise the return for their clients, and that is their job.<\/p><p>  I want to re-echo what has been said.  This is not an attack on the multinationals.  We embrace the multinational companies that have located here.  They provide much needed jobs in this economy.  It is an extraordinary achievement for a small country of this size on the periphery of Europe to have located within its borders some of the biggest pharmaceutical companies and high-tech companies who have set up their European headquarters here.  Time and again we have been told that while the corporation tax is an element in this respect, it does not represent the totality of it.  I would be curious to get the Minister of State's response to those comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100038#NN00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1363882200,"counter":487,"content":"<p>This debate has raised a number of very interesting issues.  I agree with Senator Michael D'Arcy that on different levels citizens have paid a great deal and it is very unfair to go back to them looking for more of a take when these very sophisticated multinational companies are using whatever mechanism is necessary to try to avoid paying a fair amount of tax.  Fairness is what this budget and Finance Bill should have been about.  If there are legal companies or tax advisers acting as advisers to both poacher and gamekeeper, that is a very serious issue.  Surely there must be some sense of a conflict of interest if they are working on both sides of that divide, and that should be looked into.<\/p><p>I note that part of deal that was imposed on Cyprus by the troika affected its corporate tax regime.  The Government and the Minister for Finance were part the agreement and arrangement in terms of the Council of Ministers who agreed to those recommendations being put forward and that deal being done in Cyprus.  It is very hard in one sense to sit here defending the corporation tax rate in Ireland while we are going out to Europe agreeing to deals where the corporation tax of other member states can be tinkered with, diluted or changed.  Surely the Minister of State must be concerned about that in that the EU poachers might come looking for more of a change to our tax rate system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100038#NN00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1363882200,"counter":488,"content":"<p>This is a very interesting discussion.  On the general issue, taking account of Senator Barrett's point, we must work together with other counties to make sure this practice is stamped out.  No one country on its own can deal with this issue.  We will work with our EU partners, even during our Presidency, on initiatives which are already in the field.  For instance, the base erosion and profit sharing initiative is something we at an EU level want to get over the line and to agree is an important file, but whether its completion occurs during the time of our Presidency is another matter.<\/p><p>It is worth saying that we have a very transparent corporation tax rate.  Our effective rate is within half a point or sightly more of the full 12.5% and that is not the case in other countries.  What one sees is what one gets in Ireland.  One pays the tax, it is straightforward and it is across the board.  Admittedly, there are some write-offs, particularly in areas such as research and development, which has the benefit of making sure that activity is enhanced and supported in the country.  The central point is that this is not a blank sheet of paper in the circumstances that one has to work with other countries, particularly in terms of rooting out avoidance.  This is an issue where companies use different tax codes for the purposes of minimising their tax liability in one country or another.  <\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Noonan, is on record in that respect, particularly regarding the work of the OECD, with which we have worked very closely.  The entire agenda of the OECD in recent years has been based on this very issue, namely, the way countries make it absolutely clear to the international community that through measures such as double taxation and other agreements it can show that a fair and proportionate amount of tax is being taken in the area of corporation tax.  It is worth saying that the corporation tax rate, in terms of the yield, is approximately \u20ac4 billion.  At the height of the boom it was approximately \u20ac7 billion.  That shows the degree to which economic activity has reduced in recent years.<\/p><p>The stated position of the Irish Government and the Department of Finance is to work with other countries and if other countries or groups of countries put forward a proposal to us, we will consider it in due course.  I note that in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's statement to the British Parliament the other day he is now proposing to reduce corporation tax rates in the UK to 20% over a period of years.  The net issue here is that taxation is still the preserve of the 27 member states.  I want to be frank and honest with colleagues.  I have attended some of the ECOFIN meetings and there are divisions in Europe as to how we go forward and that was seen in the FDT debate on financial services transaction tax.  There will always be a competitive advantage from one country to the next.  What we need to do is to minimise the avoidance and I fully agree with the Senator's remarks on this.  This issue is not specific to section 91, I hasten to add, but this was an interesting debate nonetheless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100038#NN00400","speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363882200,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p><p>Sections 98 to 108, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363882200,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Schedule 1 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363882200,"counter":491,"content":"<p>Schedule 2 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363882800,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1363882800,"counter":493,"content":"<p>Bill reported without recommendation.<\/p>"},{"type":"vote","time":1363882800,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the Bill be received for final consideration.\"<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 23; N\u00edl, 8.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Coghlan and Susan O'Keeffe; N\u00edl, Senators Trevor \u00d3 Clochartaigh and Kathryn Reilly..<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100039#OO00300","aye":["1121","1138","1114","1165","1151","1130","1166","1160","1117","1144","1135","1161","1162","1132","1174","1134","1118","1153","1129","1125","1163","1171","1143"],"nay":["1157","1140","1149","1128","1122","1154","1155","1164"]},{"type":"speech","time":1363883100,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Is it agreed that the Bill be returned to the D\u00e1il?

I would have preferred to have it when the Minister was here.  I did call for the debate two weeks ago but unfortunately it was not put on the schedule.  Time is passing while the working group is meeting, so it is important to debate the issue here.  I would have preferred to have a Minister present but I am quite prepared to go ahead with the debate without a Minister.   However, I would ask that the transcripts of today's debate be sent to the working group for its consideration, if that is in order.<\/p><p>The mobility allowance issue has been flagged for the past 12 years and the Ombudsman ruled that it was illegal.  In recent years, it has been brought to the attention of various Departments but nothing was done.  Suddenly, we have now been told that the allowance is finishing in four months.<\/p><p>I appreciate that the working group has been established under the stewardship of Ms Sylda Langford who is a very able person.  I know she will do the best she can.  A lot of disability groups' representatives, including a person with a disability, are working with her.  That is fantastic because at least the needs of people with disabilities will be discussed in full.  <\/p><p>The mobility allowance should be retained as an individualised payment to people with disabilities.  I am speaking specifically about those who are confined to a wheelchair.  The Ombudsman has said that the mobility allowance should be available to people with all types of disability, including psychological, intellectual, mental and physical.  <\/p><p>The working group should consider ideas and proposals concerning the relatively small number of people involved.  We are talking about almost 5,000 people who are in receipt of this allowance.  It is costing approximately \u20ac10 million per year, which is a relatively small amount.  If we were to go down the road suggested by the Ombudsman and open the allowance to everybody with a disability we could be talking about a figure of between \u20ac200 million to \u20ac300 million per year.  Such an outlay would not be sustainable at the moment due to funding restraints.  <\/p><p>There are many experts and legal advisers in the working group so surely with all that expertise it can come up with a method to retain an individualised payment to people who are confined to wheelchairs.  There has been much talk about access to transport for people with disabilities, which is fantastic.  That is the way to go, but right now an undue hardship is being imposed on approximately 5,000 people.  Life is hard enough for people who are wheelchair bound.  They must face challenges every day which we cannot comprehend.  One would have to be confined to a wheelchair to know what life is like for them.  Such people may be able to walk a few steps but they cannot live without their wheelchair.  I am referring to those suffering from muscular dystrophy and other complaints.  In order to live life to the full they do need a wheelchair, so it is incumbent upon us to ensure that they can live independently and without unnecessary challenges.<\/p><p>The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, have assured us that funding will continue for four months for recipients of the mobility allowance while a new scheme is being devised.  I appreciate that all applications received for the motorised transport grant will be processed but I am worried that the introduction of accessible transport will deflect from individualised payments.<\/p><p>I know the problems that people living in rural areas can encounter.  I can cite a few examples where accessible public transport will not work.  I know of a young girl who has a severe disability.  She cannot walk or talk and can only communicate with her eyes.  Her parents bought a bus that has been adapted to suit their daughter's needs.  They paid for that vehicle with the mobility allowance.  That young girl had to go to Limerick from Kerry five times in one month for a fitting for a specialised wheelchair.  Who would be able to transport that girl if that family did not have the specially adapted bus?  Would transport be available, with a driver, to take her and her parents to Limerick when necessary?<\/p><p>Another case concerns a man in his 20s who is intellectually outstanding, but requires a motorised wheelchair.  He goes out at night with his friends to the pictures or for a drink.  With the end of the mobility allowance, who will be there at 1.30 a.m. to take this young man home?  His friends cannot take him out because their cars are not adapted for motorised wheelchairs, so he is dependent on specialised transport.  He will have to pay for a taxi to get home.<\/p><p>I could cite other examples.  I know one woman with a disability who uses the motorised transport grant to drive.  She takes her children to school in the morning, picks them up and takes them to after-school activities.  She needs individual transport and cannot book a van or bus to take the children to football or swimming.<\/p><p>The individual payment must be retained for people with disabilities, especially in rural areas where accessible transport is not available.  I will be making my own submission to the working group because I am unable to say everything I want to here in five minutes.  I hope that other speakers will also have constructive ideas that we can present to the working group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100042#RR00100","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1363883700,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I welcome any opportunity to talk about an important issue and I thank Senator Moloney for raising the matter, but I do feel this is somewhat farcical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100042#RR00200","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1363883700,"counter":507,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100042#RR00300","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1363883700,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I remember on one occasion that it happened when we were on the Government benches, too.  This is basically a slap back to Senator Moloney for speaking against the Government and asking to debate a particular issue.  Here we are with no Minister, principal officer or Secretary General to listen to what is said.  I intend to participate in the debate in the spirit in which Senator Moloney has raised it and I hope the transcripts can be given to the working group.  We had a robust exchange here on the Order of Business the morning it happened.  It was unruly, I participated in that myself and do not apologise for it.  Equally, however, this issue goes back a while and more than one Government could be blamed for not dealing with the issue.<\/p> <p>However, the Government cannot take refuge from the previous one on this matter.  Blocking this allowance unilaterally without having an alternative in place was wrong.  It is my earnest wish that within the four month review period those in receipt of the allowance will continue to receive the same monetary benefit while new applicants are facilitated immediately.  We are talking about people who are on only \u20ac190 per week.  It is a means-tested payment which is made to 4,700 people with disabilities.  This is also the week in which we heard about a bank executive earning \u20ac840,000.<\/p><p>When I was on the other side of the House, I recall sitting all night to put in place new legislation for this and that.  However, when it comes to the most vulnerable in society, we seem to be powerless to produce a principal officer to listen to the genuine solutions being presented on a cross-party basis.  Mr. John Dolan of the Disability Federation was not even consulted about the removal of this grant.  Has he even been asked what he considers is the best way forward?  For me, there is a legislative solution to the problem posed with this allowance.  I agree that it would be difficult to adequately pin down how many disabilities should be eligible to be covered by the allowance, but we must try.  In doing so, we could bring it into line with the Equal Status Act.  I am not saying the drafting of these legislative provisions will be easy, but it should be tried.<\/p><p>Nobody has an issue with the spirit with which the Government is trying to deal with the loaves and the fishes.  The reality is that there are choices, but sometimes bad ones are made.  This was one of them.  Yes, there is a legal anomaly that has to be dealt with, but, surely, it could have been dealt with without taking away the allowance first.  We could have continued to be in breach of European law, as we regularly did in the case of septic tanks and turf-cutting, for another four months while we put together a legislative solution.  If eligibility for the allowance needs to be broadened, perhaps that should be the case and we need to provide more funds.  I doubt if anyone would have an issue with adding a little levy or a duty on alcohol to provide for this allowance which ensures the mobility of the most vulnerable and the less well-off.  Those in receipt of it were on \u20ac190 a week.  When the allowance was removed, it represented an effective 20% cut to their income.  This is at a time when all Members are bemoaning the fact that an additional 13% was given by way of a salary bonus and increases to the chief executive of a bank in which we are meant to be shareholders.<\/p><p>There is something wrong with the system.

As many in receipt of the allowance are concerned, it is important that its future be clarified at an early date.<\/p><p>There seems to be a tendency in some Departments to hope that when certain issues are raised, they will go away.  I have referred on several occasions to the way the Department of Health dealt with the nursing home charges for over 25 years before the issue suddenly came to a head.  The same seems to have happened in the case of this allowance.  We need to have more openness in Departments when such issues are raised to ensure they are reviewed quickly, rather than being put on the backburner.  The Ombudsman stepped in on the issue of payment of this allowance when previously people would have had to go to the courts to establish their entitlements.  Nowadays, they have access to information at an earlier stage.  Departments need to respond to such issues at an earlier date.<\/p><p>We need to examine how other EU member states deal with this type of allowance.

At the highest rate, it comes to \u20ac208.50 per month; at the lowest, it comes to \u20ac104.25.  The allowance is for people with severe physical disabilities who are unable to walk or use public transport and would benefit from a change in surroundings.  It is to meet transport costs which are currently unvouched and the occasional taxi journey.  The Department of Health anticipated that revising the scheme to bring it into compliance, that is, to remove the upper age limit, would translate into an additional cost of \u20ac100 million per annum in the case of the mobility allowance and \u20ac200 million over a three year period in the case of the motorised transport grant.<\/p> <p>To remove the upper age limit would translate into a cost of \u20ac100 million per annum for the mobility allowance and \u20ac200 million over a three year period for the motorised transport grant, not to mention the large administrative costs to, and burden on, the HSE.  These estimations are outlandish.  The eligibility criteria are very strict.  How many disabled people over the age of 66 are unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or any other suitable aids or whose health is such that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous?  That is not to mention the other requirements for qualification.  I did a calculation on the estimation from the Department.  It is based on the expectation that there would be an extra 39,968 applicants if the upper age limit was removed.  Can we just note that in 2012, 43 people over the age of 66 applied and were rejected, which is nothing near the 39,968 figure?  I seriously question the figures provided.  <\/p><p>As I have said already, the eligibility criteria are very strict and I wish to put those criteria on the record.  An applicant must be unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or any other suitable aids; his or her health must be such that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous; the inability to walk must be likely to last for at least a year; he or she must not be medically forbidden to move; he or she must be in a position to benefit from a change in surroundings; he or she must be living at home or in a long-term institution; and he or she must pass a means test.  The decision on whether or not an applicant meets the medical criteria is made by the HSE's senior medical officer in the relevant area.  In that context, one must question the figures from the Department of Health.  <\/p><p>The estimate for the motorised transport grant is \u20ac200 million over three years.  The Department of Health estimates that 19,000 older people over 66 would apply for that grant if the age limit was removed.  This grant is aimed at assisting people in accessing employment, so how did the Department arrive at that figure?  Perhaps the Department knows something I do not know.  <\/p><p>There are many outstanding questions and so much insecurity and uncertainty for those who are in receipt of the allowance or grant, who have been told that their payments will cease on 26 June.  What if the alternative scheme is not ready to be rolled out by then?  In devising the alternative scheme, will the Department consult with the disability sector and the recipients of the allowance or grant to ensure personal choice and autonomy, in terms of the applicable transport service, is preserved?  We talk about personal budgets, money following the patient, maximising independence and so forth but I am concerned that the new scheme will, in effect, remove or diminish personal choice.  What is safe and appropriate for one person is not safe and appropriate for all.  A community transport service is not safe and appropriate for a person with severe autism, for example.  Furthermore, community transport schemes are not always the most cost effective choice.  Two of the providers in Dublin, for example, Vantastic on the northside and ACTS servicing the southside, charge a higher price and mileage rate, equivalent to a private taxi, and only operate between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., with a limited number of choices.   Senator Moloney has already referred to the challenges in rural areas for community transport schemes.  <\/p><p>Will the working group examine the possibility of adding a mobility component to the disability allowance and the supplementary welfare allowance?  Given the means test associated with these benefits, I suggest that such a move would keep the expenditure within budget.  I have serious doubts about the figures given by the Department of Health and seek clarity on them.  I also want to know why the decision to scrap the schemes happened overnight.  Anybody who has attended a management or leadership training course will know that one does not raise a problem if one does not have a solution.  A solution should have been devised because the problem did not arise overnight.  We have known for a long time that the schemes were problematic.  It is unacceptable.  This is a spreadsheet decision when really, it should be about people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100043#SS00300","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363884900,"counter":513,"content":"<p>F\u00e1ilt\u00edm roimh an d\u00edosp\u00f3ireacht seo, ach cuireann s\u00e9 an-d\u00edom\u00e1 orm nach bhfuil Aire n\u00f3 Aire St\u00e1it anseo n\u00e1 aon oifigeach le bheith ag \u00e9isteacht leis an d\u00edosp\u00f3ireacht.<\/p><p>I do not see any reason we would not sit on a Thursday evening for debates like this but we should have the Minister or Ministers of State  in the House to listen to the debate.  Having said that, I must ask whether it would make any difference because myself and Senator O'Keeffe sat on the Joint Committee on Public Oversight and Petitions, where this issue was debated with officials from the Department of Health and the only term to describe the reception we got from those officials is belligerence.  Indeed, that was echoed in statements by the Ombudsman in highlighting this issue.  I totally agree with what Senator Van Turnhout has said regarding the figures.  At the aforementioned committee meeting, we too questioned the figures being put forward by the Department.  They simply do not add up and do not make any sense.  <\/p><p>We must look at the broader agenda here.  While we are dealing with two specific schemes, we are also dealing with a very serious challenge to the role of the Ombudsman, of the elected representatives and the various committees of these Houses, as well as to the role of the legal system itself.  It is common knowledge that a case was pending in the Equality Tribunal and that was the reason for the haste in pulling the schemes.  That haste must be put in the context of 12 or 13 years of inaction, where the Department and various Ministers stuck their heads in the sand.  It is not that they did not know about the issue or about the fact that there might be a contingent liability or that people might take legal action.  I would also contend that pulling the schemes does not, in fact, take away the danger of a contingent liability.  Somebody who was denied his or her rights previously could still take a case on the grounds that he or she was discriminated against when the schemes were in operation.  It is not at all clear that the Government has covered itself, legally, by pulling the schemes.  It is absolutely disgraceful, in fact.<\/p><p>I had a certain amount of interaction with Sylda Langford when I was involved with Galway City and County Childcare Committee and I have great respect for her and believe she is an appropriate person to conduct the review.  However, as others have said, this review should have been carried out before the schemes were pulled.  Having said that, we are here today to look at potential solutions.  We must look at what is at issue here.  If one accepts that the schemes must be extended to those over 66, in order to make them legal, as pointed out by the Ombudsman, then more resources will be needed.  If more resources are required then one must ask the simple question as to what this debate is really about.  This debate must focus on people with disabilities and their rights.  It must focus on their mobility and access rights.  Do we, as citizens, accept that people with disabilities have the same right to mobility as everybody else in this State?  If we do, then we must accept that the money to support that must be put in place.  <\/p><p>We have had hours of debate on the Finance Bill in this House today.  Issues like this are connected to that Bill because the budgets of Departments are limited by the Department of Finance.  We were told at the Joint Committee on Public Oversight and Petitions that the Department simply does not have the money to extend the schemes.  One can certainly question the validity of the figures put forward by the Department on the cost of extending the schemes because it is doubtful that it would cost anywhere near the amount projected.  However, if we do agree that the schemes must be extended, then the only conclusion we can come to is that the Department of Health must be given a bigger budget for this specific area so that those who are eligible, according to the very narrow criteria laid down, will be provided with mobility assistance, regardless of their age.  That will mean taking the money from somewhere else and that is the bottom line.  These are the choices that the Government must consider.  <\/p><p>To return to the issue of the bigger picture, it is ironic that this decision was taken within days of the Secretary General of the Department appearing, for the second time, before the Joint Committee on Public Oversight and Petitions.  The Ombudsman had to fight tooth and nail for 12 years for recognition from the Department that she was right and it was wrong.  The Department only acknowledged that at the last minute.  The situation is akin to a group of children on a football pitch, where one child takes his ball home because the others are not playing by his rules.  That is the image that came to mind when I heard the announcement on the schemes.  Essentially, the Department said &quot;To hell with the lot of you, if you want us to find a solution, we will find one but you will not like it&quot; and they scrapped the schemes totally.  That was totally out of order and represents a huge two-fingers to the Ombudsman for highlighting the issue.  It is also a huge two-fingers to the Joint Committee on Public Oversight and Petitions, which questioned the Department on its decisions and the rationale for them.  It is a two-fingers to all of us, as parliamentarians, is totally unacceptable and must be challenged.  <\/p> <p>While this debate is useful, a Minister or Minister of State with his or her officials should be present to answer our serious questions.<\/p><p>Providing mobility for the people in question will incur a cost.  That money must be found somewhere.  The Department of Health's budgetary scenarios must be examined.  On the Order of Business, I outlined how certain sections in the HSE were not talking to one another, costing a fortune in the process.  Someone in the HSE or the Department would, with a little bit of imagination and political will, find a solution.  The issue is a budgetary one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100044#TT00200","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363885500,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I compliment Senator Moloney on her raising of this issue.  I agree it is a pity that a Minister or at least a civil servant is not present to listen to our points.  Like Senator Burke, I hope that this is the start of the debate and that it will not conclude without further input from the House.  I agree with Senator van Turnhout's questioning of a number of the HSE's figures.  It makes no sense that 19,000 people over 66 years of age have applied for motorised transport grants to return to work.  We cannot even find work for people under 66 years of age.  These schemes are designed for disabled people who are unable to use public transport.  In many cases, public transport is not a viable alternative for them.  In County Roscommon, 60 people avail of these schemes - 45 receive a mobility allowance and 15 receive the motorised transport grant.  <i>Pro rata<\/i>, the figures in County Leitrim might be a little less.  County Roscommon has the highest mileage of rural secondary roads in the country.  While canvassing in my constituency, I drove down a two-mile byroad that only had one house, which was at the very end.  If that person needed a mobility allowance or motorised transport grant, it would be laughable if she was told that the system was being changed and a service was being put in place instead.  It will not work in rural Ireland.  If the Department believes there is a way of getting around this problem, that is fine.  There might be a way to tweak it for urban Ireland to provide a service.  There was a big kerfuffle over rural transport, never mind transport that is intended to reduce rural isolation and get people out of their homes.  We cannot provide enough transport for rural Ireland.  The schemes' ethos is to get people in rural Ireland out of their homes, but the only way to do so is to provide them with the necessary money.  It is a matter of connectivity with the rest of the world.<\/p><p>  As a community welfare officer, I dealt with the two schemes in question.  In the majority of cases, they are used to allow people to return to work.  A friend of mine must travel 43 miles to work every day.  No public transport system could be put in place that would be any cheaper than giving him a motorised transport grant every two or three years to trade in his car.  I have seen the schemes' effectiveness.  No working group, regardless of its cleverness, will devise a better system than the one that is already in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100045#UU00200","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"speech","time":1363885500,"counter":516,"content":"<p>It is unfair of Senators to say that it is regrettable that the Minister and officials are not present for this debate, as they were not invited.

The Ombudsman found that neither scheme was compliant with the Equal Status Acts, but an extension of either scheme as recommended by her would create serious financial pressure on the health budget and would be unsustainable.  The current budget is \u20ac10.6 million, but the cost of an extension of the mobility allowance could be as much as \u20ac100 million per annum, while the extension of the motorised transport grant would cost \u20ac200 million over a three-year period.  The Government has decided that the Department of Health can no longer operate the scheme in circumstances in which the significant increase in funding necessary to broaden the eligibility criteria is unavailable.  Therefore, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has established a project group to review and examine the issues and to recommend an appropriate solution within three months.  The group is independently chaired and met for the first time on Thursday, 21 February.  The Minister and Minister of State attended to outline the complexities of the issues.  The group includes representatives of people with disabilities and others who can assist in designing a solution.  Who better to have on the group?  Broader consultation will be undertaken as part of the project group's work in order to ensure that as wide a range of opinions as possible are taken into account.<\/p><p>In seeking a solution that will address the transport and mobility needs of those who require supports, the Minister of State is concerned about the group of people who are currently benefiting under the schemes.  Importantly, she must give equal consideration to the broader group of needs that the Ombudsman has recommended should be looked after on an equitable basis.  The challenge is to find a solution that will best meet these needs within the available budget.  The Department of Health has also met a number of representative organisations of people with disabilities and asked for their input into a solution that can be delivered on target.  I am glad we have held this debate and I am sure we will debate the matter further at the joint committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100045#UU00600","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1363885500,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute.

It is important that our voices be heard and transcribed.<\/p><p>I echo the sentiments that have been expressed.  The bottom line is that everyone is concerned by the sudden announcement about the removal of the mobility allowance in three months' time.  We must ensure that something is in place before the allowance is pulled.  I have received several communications from constituents who are not affected by the mobility allowance and are confused by what is happening.  Others are petrified for their mental and physical health.  They are genuinely concerned that if the allowance is withdrawn, they will become prisoners in their own homes.  Senators Moloney and Kelly referred to rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>This will pose a problem in rural parts of my constituency.  It will also pose a problem in urban areas.  I have spoken to representatives from the Irish Wheelchair Association about the proposals.  A problem arises where a person takes ill suddenly and requires transport to a hospital, because in such a situation advance transport cannot be booked.  We need to know exactly what will be put in place.  It is envisaged that a person will have to book a van in advance, but people cannot always know what will happen to them two or three weeks in advance.  I recently spoke to an American person who told me that while this system is in place in America, one of its biggest problems is trying to provide wheelchair-accessible vehicles quickly.  <\/p><p>I welcome the working group.  It is vital that it includes people with disabilities, who can be the voice of those directly affected.  I agree with Senator Burke on the need for consultation.  It is important that we have an opportunity to debate the findings of the working group in the House.  Also, it is important, if this service is introduced, that sick people being taken to hospital do not have to travel with people who are well and being taken elsewhere, as they could end up being in a vehicle for a couple of hours, which would not do them any good.  <\/p><p>Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh spoke about the rights of the disabled and what constitutes a disability.  Perhaps the working group could examine this issue and, following publication of its report, we, along with the Minister, could also examine the definition.  Mention was made of people over 66.  Senator van Turnhout asked how many of those people were likely to apply for this service.  If, as suggested by the Ombudsman, this service will be open to any person with a disability, be it mental or physical, then we need clarification on what constitutes a disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100045#UU00700","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363886100,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Rural Ireland is not just two words.

People living in rural Ireland are suffering to a far greater extent as a result of any changes to these grants.

I have every faith in the review group and the work it will do.  However, my concern is that the pressure upon it, in terms of its being asked to devise in four months a system for something which the Department of Health has stated over and again is an extremely complex situation, is too great.  The review group should be given an assurance that it is not under such pressure, that no payment will be ceased after four months and that everything will remain the same until it reports with its suggestions.  The people concerned and the review group will then at least know that they are being treated fairly. <\/p><p>We have spoken many times in the House about community-based transport schemes.  In regard to the new proposals for funding, there is concern among the people who have worked hard to establish really good transport groups that they will come under pressure, under the new funding system for county councils, to withdraw their services.  I urge the independent review group to reiterate the importance of community-based transport schemes and to ensure that funding for them is retained.  I do not know what will ultimately be the new structure but any changes that occur at county council level should not diminish this service at a time when the mobility allowance is being reduced.<\/p><p>I am grateful to have this opportunity to have my voice heard.

The Ombudsman expressed concern about illegal practices by that Department in terms of its having already paid out \u20ac500 million for the illegal charging of medical card holders for long-stay care provided by health boards, which dates back to 2004.  She also pointed out that currently, with regard to the Who Cares? report, a further 300 people are taking cases against the Department of Health, resulting in a potential expenditure of millions in settlement of those cases.  I understand approximately 30 of those cases have already been settled.  The point I am making is that the Department of Health has already paid out millions of euro owing to illegal practises by it.  We had chapter and verse on that issue at the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.<\/p><p>I would welcome a change of heart by the Department of Health such that it would not be paying out money in legal compensation but would be using taxpayers' money to provide the services required by the thousands of people with various disabilities, thus ensuring they do not remain prisoners in their homes.  I am slightly confounded by the figures offered by Senator van Turnhout.  I have received an estimate from the Department of Health, which I would like to put on the record as it does not square with that given by Senator van Turnhout.  The national disability survey states that more than 59,000 people over the age of 65 either had difficulty walking for 15 minutes or could not do so at all.  It further states that although the means test could result in a reduction in the number of people over 65 years of age who are eligible for the allowance, should the definition of disability be expanded to include people with a disability other than a mobility difficulty then the number of eligible people could increase further.  It is therefore estimated that the additional cost could be in excess of \u20ac100 million per annum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100046#VV00600","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1363886100,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I was referring to the current eligibility criteria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032100046#VV00700","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1363886100,"counter":528,"content":"<p>Like Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh, I have concerns about the Department of Health's calculation.
