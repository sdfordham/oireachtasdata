It relates to the case of the deaths of Privates Thomas Barrett and Derek Smallhorne, who were murdered, and the serious injuring of Private John O&rsquo;Mahony while serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, on 18 April 1980.  In July 2014, the alleged perpetrator, Mr. Mahmoud Bazzi, who had been residing in the US, was arrested for administrative immigration violations.  Following an immigration court hearing in August, the judge ruled that Mr. Bazzi be deported to Lebanon, as he had admitted to entering the US in 1994 without proper documentation.  He was finally deported to his native Lebanon on 30 January 2015.  On arrival in Beirut, Mr. Bazzi was arrested and detained by the Lebanese authorities, where he remains in custody.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Government has requested the support of the Lebanese Government in seeking justice for the murdered Irish UNIFIL peacekeepers, should such action be at all feasible.  During my visit to Lebanon last December, I met the Lebanese authorities at the most senior levels of government and highlighted the Irish Government's continued prioritisation of and commitment to progressing this case in the interests of justice.  It is now a matter for the Lebanese authorities to investigate the case and to determine any future action in accordance with their national legislation and judicial procedures.  The Irish ambassador in the region is continuing to monitor developments in the case and is in contact with my Department on a regular basis.<\/p>  <p>  A total of 199 Defence Forces personnel are currently serving with the UNIFIL mission, but I have taken a personal interest in the case and have met the families and Mr. O'Mahony.  We are keeping them up to date with everything we know.  I am somewhat limited in what I can say because I am anxious that nothing I say should prejudice any judicial case that the Lebanese authorities may be taking.  While I do not want to go into the legal challenges involved, it is a question of the murder of two men and the attempted murder of a third.

The Bill provides for a number of important legislative amendments, corrections and updates to a range of policy areas across the environmental field and is important in introducing new streamlined procedures that will help to reduce the administrative burden on enforcing authorities, as well as companies and individuals.  It also provides for a more responsive system to changing environmental pressures and priorities.<\/p><p>This included provision for fixed payment notices - or on-the-spot fines - for certain alleged offences under existing environmental regulations.  Fixed payment notices have proved an effective deterrent against breaches of environmental regulation.  They also provide local authorities with an additional enforcement tool that is less costly and resource-intensive than prosecutions in the Circuit and District courts, especially for relatively small-scale offences.  The Bill also proposes to extend regulation-making powers providing for payments to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, for areas that are generating a large volume of work and providing a significant service to industry while not currently generating any fee income.  These amendments will strengthen the agency's own income strand.<\/p> <p> The Bill makes provision for several items, the first being the transfer of powers and functions under the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park Act to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  In effect this will transfer ownership of the core of Killarney National Park to the Department of the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  Second, it provides for the reinstatement of existing fixed payment notices, FPNs, for certain offences relating to the marketing, sale and distribution of solid fuel by referring to the updated consolidating regulations, namely, SI 326 of 2012.  Third, it provides for the extension of FPNs to a range of other existing offences in the areas of air quality and waste management, in particular with regard to waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE, batteries, waste packaging and end-of-life vehicles.  Fourth, it extends the scope of the EPA to impose licensing fees for new and expanding areas.  Fifth, it extends the deadline for the making of a declaration of non-use in the case of registration of a new vehicle and on change of ownership of a vehicle and sixth, it amends some minor typographical errors in existing primary legislation.<\/p> <p> There are 35 heads in the published Bill and my Department has worked closely with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to advance the Bill for publication.  Legal advice was received from advisory counsel on several heads and in particular on the conditions that allow for the application of fixed payment notices to certain offences.  The Bill is divided into seven parts.  Part 1 deals with preliminary and general matters.  Part 2 covers the amendments to the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park Act 1932.  Part 3 addresses amendments to the Air Pollution Act 1987.  Part 4 deals with amendments to the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  Part 5 covers amendments to the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992.  Part 6 provides for amendments to the Waste Management Act 1996.  Part 7 deals with amendments to the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 and the Control of Dogs Act 1986.<\/p> <p> I will now give Members a more detailed overview of the Bill.  Part 1 is a preliminary and general part and contains two sections.  Section 1 sets out the Short Title of the Bill on enactment and allows the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park Acts 1932 and 2014 to be construed together as one Act.  Section 2 defines the use of key terms and phrases upon enactment.<\/p> <p> Part 2 concerns amendment of the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park Act 1932.  It deals with the transfer of functions under the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park Act 1932 from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  In so doing, it provides specifically for the transfer of ownership of the property forming the park.  Part 2 consists of four chapters.  Chapter 1 consists of one section, section 3, which defines key terms the use of which is specific to Part 2.  Chapter 2 consists of two sections.  Section 4 provides that the functions identified in it will, on the commencement of Part 2 in its entirety, transfer from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The functions that will so transfer include all those functions which, under the 1932 Act, were exercisable by the Commissioners of Public Works.<\/p> <p> The transferred functions will also include most of the functions which, under the 1932 Act, were exercisable by the Minister for Finance.  One function under section 3(2) of the 1932 Act relating to the disposal of moneys received under the Act, which is currently vested in the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, will remain with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Section 5 clarifies that references to any Minister or to the Commissioners of Public Works contained in any other enactment and relating to functions transferred by section 4 will mean the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Chapter 3 consists of four sections which deal with matters consequent on the transfer of functions brought about by chapter 2.  Section 6 provides that all the property currently vested in the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government under the 1932 Act will transfer to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Section 7 provides for the transfer of rights and liabilities arising from the exercise of the transferred functions and for the continuation of leases, licences and permissions granted under the transferred functions.  Section 8 clarifies that following the transfer of functions, a claim for loss or injury arising out of the exercise before that transfer of any of those functions will lie against the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Section 9 contains a number of miscellaneous provisions intended to ensure continuity in the management of the park following the transfer of functions.<\/p> <p> Chapter 4 consists of seven sections that amend the 1932 Act.  For the most part, these amendments are intended to revise the 1932 Act to ensure clarity that there will be one statutory authority managing the park, namely, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The 1932 Act, as enacted, provided for some functions to be exercisable by the Minister for Finance and others to be exercisable by the Commissioners of Public Works.  The management of the park by the commissioners was subject to the general directions of the Minister for Finance and certain other functions required specific ministerial sanction or approval.  It is important to understand that the commissioners have not been involved in the exercise of any of these functions since 1996 and they all have been exercised as ministerial functions since that time.<\/p> <p> Section 10 amends section 3 of the 1932 Act, concerning expenses and receipts, by inserting a requirement that expenses incurred in the administration of the Act be sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This brings the section into line with current standard procedures.  Section 11 amends section 11 of the 1932 Act to remove the redundant requirement that management and control of the park be carried out in accordance with the general directions of the Minister.  It is appropriate to do this, given that the management of the park is now a ministerial function.  Section 12 amends section 12 of the 1932 Act by deleting the reference to ministerial sanction regarding aspects of the management of the park, such management now being a ministerial function.<\/p> <p> Section 13 amends section 13 of the 1932 Act by deleting requirements for ministerial approval and sanction in respect of appointments made under the Act, as the making of such appointments is now a ministerial function.  Section 14 amends section 14 of the 1932 Act by deleting the requirement for bye-laws made in respect of the park to be approved by the Minister, given that the making of such bye-laws is now a ministerial function anyway.  Section 15 amends section 21 of the 1932 Act by deleting requirements for ministerial sanction in respect of aspects of the management of the chattels, that is, personal property, acquired under the 1932 Act.  As with previous amendments, the management of this property is now a ministerial function.  Finally, section 16 repeals section 20 of the 1932 Act.  Section 20 provides that the management of the chattels acquired under the 1932 Act would be carried out in accordance with the general directions of the Minister.  This is no longer necessary as such management is now a ministerial function.<\/p><p>Part 3 deals with amendments to the Air Pollution Act 1987.  Section 17 inserts a new definition for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, established in 1992, some five years after the Air Pollution Act had been given effect.  The agency has an integral role in air quality monitoring, air pollution prevention and control, as well as enforcement.  Definitions are also inserted in the section relating to fuels registers and activities.  The EPA already maintains registers for certain upstream activities in the supply of bituminous coal - smoky coal - for the residential heating market.<br\/><br\/>Section 18 amends the penalties provision in the Act with regard to fixed payment notices, or on-the-spot fines, for alleged breaches of certain designated offences.  This amendment will remove the option for indictable prosecutions against fixed payment notice offences.<br\/><br\/>Section 19 sets out fixed payment notice offences for alleged breaches of the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012, SI No. 326 of 2012.  The regulations provide for the ban on the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of bituminous coal inside certain designated areas - the smoky coal ban as it is more commonly known.  There are 26 areas where the ban applies, including all urban areas with populations greater than 15,000.  The amounts of the fixed payment notices range from &euro;250 to &euro;1,000.  The offences relate to the distribution and-or sale of bituminous coal and other prohibited fuels within ban areas.  These fixed payment notice offences were previously provided for under section 10 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.  However, the regulations have since been consolidated.  This requires references to the fixed payment notice offences to be updated accordingly.  It is important to note that no new fixed payment notice offences relating to solid fuel are being introduced.  However, fixed payment notices have proved to be resource-efficient enforcement tools, as well as effective deterrents.  As such, the EPA has recommended extending fixed payment notices to other areas relating to the wider protection of air quality.<br\/><br\/>Section 20 introduces two new fixed payment notice offences under the European Union (Paints, Varnishes, Vehicle Refinishing Products and Activities) Regulations 2012, SI No. 564 of 2012.  The first offence concerns the sale or supply of prohibited paint products and the amount of the fixed payment notice is &euro;1,000.  The second offence concerns the operation of an uncertified vehicle refinishing installation.  The amount of the fixed payment notice is &euro;500.<br\/><br\/>Section 21 introduces a new fixed payment notice for a designated offence under the European Union (Installations and Activities Using Organic Solvents) Regulations 2012, SI No. 565 of 2012.  The offence concerns the operation of an uncertified solvents installation and the amount of the fixed payment notice is &euro;500.<br\/><br\/>Section 22 amends the powers of authorised persons under the Air Pollution Act.  As certain activities regulated under the Act such as the distribution of solid fuel are carried out from vehicles, the powers of authorised persons are being strengthened to allow for the stopping and searching of such vehicles.<br\/><br\/>Section 23 introduces a new Part 1A to the Act that provides a legal basis for the EPA to establish and maintain a fuels register.  The persons and activities required to register with the agency will be set out separately by way of regulation.  The EPA already maintains registers of coal bagging operators and certain upstream solid fuel suppliers trading in bituminous coal under the Environmental Protection Agency Act (Registration of Coal Bagging Operators and Solid Fuel Suppliers) Regulations 2012, SI No. 454 of 2012.  Persons supplying bituminous coal to the residential market are required to demonstrate that their product contains no more than 0.7% sulphur content and to be registered with the EPA.  The Bill&rsquo;s provisions will strengthen and clarify existing provisions relating to registration, in particular the circumstances in which the agency can refuse or revoke registration, as well as provide for an appeals procedure relating to such decisions.<br\/><br\/>Section 24 will replace An Bord Plean&aacute;la with the EPA as the appeals body for decisions made by local authorities for the licensing of certain small-scale industrial activities under the Act, given the agency's particular expertise in this area.  This will give effect to a recommendation of the independent review of the EPA carried out in 2011.<br\/><br\/>Section 25 amends and clarifies the scope of the regulation making powers of the Minister under section 53 of the Act.  This will allow for the regulation of the storage of fuel alongside the existing powers to regulate for the placing on the market, distribution or sale of fuel.  Further provisions will provide for the designation of persons involved in commercial fuel activities who are required to be registered with the EPA, the conditions that must be satisfied prior to registration and allow for the charging of fees relating to registration.  The activities envisaged all relate to the supply of solid fuel, in particular bituminous coal.<br\/><br\/>Part 4 amends the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 to extend the fees base of the EPA.  On the matter of environmental licensing fees, the EPA provides several licensing services without charge as it does not have the statutory authority to levy an appropriate fee.  In many cases, work to assess and license these activities can be resource and time-consuming, as well as costly.  These costs are often borne by other revenue generating activities carried out by the agency, which is inappropriate.  The proposed amendment of section 99A of the 1992 Act will extend the powers of the Minister to make fee regulations in respect of these EPA services.  Such regulations will also require the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<br\/><br\/>It is also proposed to make required minor technical amendments to the 1992 Act following transposition of the Industrial Emissions Directive 2010\/75\/EU.  Section 26 proposes to extend the definition of an integrated pollution control activity to include the industrial processes involved in certain wood-based production systems.<br\/><br\/>Section 27 proposes to extend the application of section 82A(5)(<i>e<\/i>) of the 1992 Act to independently operated wastewater treatment activities in compliance with the terms of the industrial emissions directive.  The effect of this amendment is to underpin the requirement that, with effect from 7 July 2015, operators of independently operated wastewater treatment plants must hold the appropriate licence from the EPA.<br\/><br\/>Section 28 proposes to amend section 99A of the 1992 Act which empowers the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to make regulations providing for the payment of fees in respect of a range of environmental licensing services.  The proposed amendment will allow the Minister to make regulations to set charges for the licence reviews instigated by the EPA - licence reviews necessitated following publication of a decision by the European Commission on best available techniques, BAT, conclusions under the industrial emissions directive; licence reviews, instigated by the EPA, in response to improved environmental protections, safety concerns, legislative change or substantial changes in the nature or extent of emissions or the local environment; licence reviews, in specified circumstances, of licences issued in respect of air, water or noise pollution; where new environmental standards are prescribed; and to make technical amendments under section 96 of the 1992 Act.<\/p><p>The proposed amendment will require the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to obtain the consent of the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation before making the aforementioned fees regulations.  The proposed amendment within this section will empower the EPA to pursue fees owing as a simple contract debt before an appropriate court.<\/p> <p> Section 29 proposes to amend the First Schedule to the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  The First Schedule defines industrial activities as either \"industrial emissions directive\" activities or \"integrated pollution control activities\" for licensing purposes.  The effect of the proposed amendment will be to refine further certain definitions to ensure full compliance with the terms of the Industrial Emissions Directive.<\/p> <p> Part 5, Sections 30 and 31, contain two amendments to the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992, which provides for the making of a declaration of non-use of a motor vehicle.  Amendments to the 1992 Act were made last year in the Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Act 2013 to introduce a system of prospective declarations if a vehicle is temporarily not being used in a public place.  This was intended to replace procedures which had allowed non-use to be declared after the fact, which was unverifiable, and which were estimated as leading to losses of some &euro;50 million annually.<\/p> <p> The new system has, in general, been working well.  In 2014, revenue, at &euro;1.159 billion, was up &euro;41 million on 2013, despite the fact that there had been no increase in motor tax since the new measures took effect, and where losses of the order of &euro;20 million would otherwise have been expected given the ongoing changeover of the car fleet to the CO2-based system which carries a lower average car tax.  However, under the new system, owners have ten days from change of ownership or from registration to make a declaration of non-use if it is not intended that the vehicle will be in immediate use.  This has proven to be quite a tight deadline, particularly on change of ownership of a vehicle.  Accordingly, it is proposed to extend the ten-day deadline to 21 days.  While delays are not proving problematic on registration of a new vehicle, it is proposed, for consistency of approach, to apply the same 21 day deadline.  These are both minor technical changes intended to provide additional time to allow owners of newly-purchased vehicles to comply with the legislation.<\/p> <p> Part 6 amends the Waste Management Act 1996.  Section 33 inserts a new section 10A in the Waste Management Act to provide for the introduction of a range of fixed payment notices, ranging from &euro;100 to &euro;2,000, in respect of specified offences under regulations concerning producer responsibility initiatives, PRIs.  PRIs are based on the producer pays principle and have been developed over a range of waste streams, including waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE, batteries, packaging, and end-of-life vehicles, ELVs.  There are a range of administrative-type obligations, most of which are required under EU law, in the producer responsibility area, such as registration and reporting requirements.  Non-compliance with these provisions represents breaches of national and EU legislation.  In such instances, the introduction of fixed payment notices will be a less costly and less resource-intensive enforcement route than initiating court proceedings against the offender and will also serve to build on the successful implementation of the PRI system in Ireland, tackling free riders and increasing compliance at local level.<\/p> <p> Under Part 7, section 34 amends the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 by making two minor typographical corrections to existing provisions and clarifying one existing provision.  There are no new or changed policies being introduced as a result of the proposed changes, which are intended to simply clarify what is required under the 2010 Act and minimise any policy confusion if these matters were raised as part of a court action.  Section 35 amends the Control of Dogs Act 1986 to ensure that establishments which are registered as dog breeding establishments, DBEs, but which are exempt from dog breeding registration fees, do not also have an exemption from paying for a general dog licence fee.<\/p> <p> While I appreciate that this Bill proposes to address a wide and diverse range of issues, it is nonetheless an important technical Bill with a number of broad-reaching provisions ranging from the transfer of certain State-owned assets through to measures which will serve to enhance the protection of the environment.  I commend the Bill to the House.  Go raibh maith agaibh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800012#K01000","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424258400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her detailed briefing on the contents of this miscellaneous Bill.  For a miscellaneous Bill, there are quite a lot of miscellaneous provisions within it.  It appears to be a big tidying effort to adhere, one would imagine, to many EU controls that have been brought to bear on the Department.  While one might initially react positively to the thrust of the Bill, when one begins to read into it and analyse exactly what is being proposed, one does so with a note of caution.<\/p>  <p>  The fixed payment notices that deal with air and chemical pollution offences are, of course, a more reasonable and cost-effective means for local authorities to deal with issues that are brought to their attention by the general public for pollution matters and offences, which may be quite obvious, in the areas for which they have jurisdiction.  There is no doubt that the costly manner in which these issues were dealt with in the past - trawling through the courts with great cost and great effort on the part of the local authority, often without achieving the desired result - did have to be analysed and examined.  It was necessary to find a resolution and a solution that would be more beneficial to the localities in which these issues occur, and that would incur the least cost to local authorities in order for them not to be hamstrung in their efforts to address other issues for which their representatives chase them on a daily basis, considering the mandate they have been given by the public they represent.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome those increased functions and powers being given to local authorities in those areas, but there are some issues I would like to query or question.  I hope during the course of Second Stage or on Committee and Report Stages that many of these issues will be expanded upon and more reasoning and explanation will be given.  We must be happy that the relevant and appropriate consultation has taken place with the various stakeholders affected by what is proposed within many of the miscellaneous provisions in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  In the first instance, taking them in the order in which they appeared during the course of the Second Stage speeches, regarding the amendments on the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park Act 1932, which deals with the whole area of Killarney National Park, I seek assurance and guidance from the Department and the Minister in respect of legal issues and overhangs from the abolition of town councils and the transfer of properties to local authorities and the county councils thereafter.  I seek assurance that there are no outstanding issues impinging on the ability of local authorities to provide services pertaining to their localities, whether it be in the area of housing and lands that may have been in the ownership of town councils and so forth.  I need clarification and confirmation that all issues pertaining to the adequate and appropriate transfer of lands formerly in the ownership of town councils have moved swiftly and effectively into the ownership of local authorities and that there are no constraints attached to or conditions within any mechanism of transfer denying local authorities the capacity to use and maximise the use of those lands and buildings for the provision of services and facilities to the electorate in the respective area.  This was brought to my attention by Senator Byrne in respect of issues concerning Navan town council or urban council as a particular example at that time.<\/p><p>I am sure that was replicated throughout the country.  As I said, I would appreciate it if the Minister of State took the opportunity, when replying, to clarify that issue.<\/p> <p> I refer to the amendments to the Air Pollution Act 1987 and the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 designed to enhance enforcement of the ban on smoky coal within restricted boundaries.  The ban on the burning of this coal was recently extended beyond the major cities to the urban centres of Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge, Portlaoise and Wicklow town.  What consultation, negotiation or engagement took place with the sectoral interests?  In the event of this being enshrined in law, what provisions will be available in terms of fines for failure to comply?  If it is not provided for in this legislation, it will be very easy for people to go to areas outside the restricted boundaries to purchase coal.  There is nothing wrong with that.  It is a free market and it is up to consumers to decide what fuel they use, what they pay for it, where they get it and so on.  I see dangers there as there must be uniformity.  What engagement has taken place?  What concerns were raised?  How have these concerns been addressed?  Do the provisions cater for what was raised during that process?<\/p> <p> The Bill aims to enhance enforcement measures by the EPA by introducing a ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of smoky coal within specified areas.  The EPA can introduce a ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of certain forms of coal within specified areas, but not with other areas.  That is what is jumping out at me when I read the provisions in the Bill.  How that can be the case needs to be clarified.  <\/p> <p> The Bill also puts the EPA's existing register of smoky coal bagging suppliers on a statutory footing, with the intention of deterring the sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland where lower environmental solid fuel standards apply.  What research or what information has been supplied to substantiate those claims?  Where is the scientific evidence to substantiate this?  What exactly is the difference in standards in the EPA's guidelines as against the guidelines imposed in the North of Ireland?  That must be clarified so that we understand exactly the provisions relating to this sector and the implications they have on it.  While increased powers for the EPA and the local authorities may be welcome, it is questionable how enforceable this ban is, and will be, in restricted areas.<\/p> <p> Individuals willing to flout the ban can simply go outside the ban zones to buy the fuel.  This should be uniform across areas to support the monitoring of households and businesses within banned zones to ensure compliance.  The onus of responsibility will be placed on local authorities.  What is the extent of their resources, in terms of staff and funds, to deal with the extra responsibilities they have been given in this area to carry out what the Minister of State expects them to do appropriately?  Have there been consultations with the unions and the managers' association?  Have they given a commitment that they can work within the confines of this?  Have they given a commitment that they are prepared to stand over the provisions which seek to restrict certain areas but not others?  I find it incomprehensible and I expect the Minister of State to elaborate on its workings.  Is it a pilot scheme in certain areas?  It is quite extensive when one thinks that Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge, Portlaoise, and Wicklow town will be included.  What are the thoughts of the specific staff in those areas?  <\/p> <p> I refer to the regulation of harmful chemicals in paint products.  The Bill transposes an EU directive into law to charge persons supplying paint products which supposedly have harmful chemicals in them.  How extensive is this among our EU partners?  Has this been piloted in other countries?  Has it worked successfully?  No more than in the area of fuel suppliers, what consultation or engagement has taken place with the paint manufacturing industry and the retail industry which supplies paint throughout the country?  What scientific evidence is available to support the EU directive?  Could we have examples of where this is in place and how effective it has been?  Has this had any harmful effect on that sector, the trade and the stakeholders involved?  Have they been given ample time to change the products to adhere to the directive coming down the tracks?  The Minister of State said many products in paints are a threat to public health.  If that is the case, we welcome this provision but we need to substantiate those claims with proper and adequate expertise in the areas of relevance in order to enforce that point.<\/p> <p> I refer to the regulation of vehicle respraying operations.  The Minister of State, who comes from a partly rural constituency, knows well, no more than myself, that many small car repair garages are located at the back of houses.  They carry out an effective and appropriate service in their localities.  If they were seeking planning permission for such businesses today, they may not meet with the requirements or planning regulations associated with such operations.  However, they have been there for many years and, in some cases, the businesses have been passed from one generation to the next. therefore predating the very laws which govern planning, dating from 1963 and 1964 onwards.  Has an audit of such facilities been carried out by the Department, in conjunction with the local authorities, in order to ascertain the extent of this?  Are they aware of the implications of what is contained in this Bill?  Are they aware that it appears their activities have been harmful to those around them because of the lack of proper facilities in the EU's mind to deal with these issues?  While it appears a sound basis from which to proceed into the future, that is, to monitor and police that whole area, many people are carrying out effective and appropriate businesses from which they achieve their livelihoods.  My party, representatives throughout the country and I need to know if there has been positive and appropriate engagement with this sector also, considering the possible implications of the provisions in this Bill on their livelihoods in the future.<\/p> <p> I refer to the regulation of dry cleaning solvents.  This Bill allows local authorities to issue fixed payment notices to dry cleaners and other operators using a solvent installation without required certification.  I would have expected that in the course of the planning process, any such operation would have been through the rigours of the planning process which would have contained many queries and questions about the various solvents and chemicals being used by such an operation in carrying out its business effectively and in order to assure the public no pollutants or potential danger was entering into wastewater treatment plants which, in time, would be treated and used for other purposes.  This is almost a retrospective provision in this legislation perhaps to penalise people who were not afforded the correct procedure during the planning stages of setting up their businesses in the first place.<\/p><p>Many agents within that business would have been working to certain standards with their advisers and their planning expertise when making an application in the first place.  Now they find that the provisions and deterrents that exist at present must be retrospectively applied.  Is the industry to suffer such a blow that it might affect its ability to move forward without having adequately provided for the changes that are necessary to meet these new directives and the provisions of this Bill?  The Bill transfers the appeals procedures in the granting or refusing of air pollution licences issued by local authorities from An Bord Plean&aacute;la to the EPA.  Could the Minister of State confirm that in the case of applications already in the system, only the laws pertaining to their application as of the date of the application itself will affect that process?  If that is the case, what plans does she have to deal with it, any more than the way in which she is dealing with the dry-cleaning industry retrospectively?  Under the present appeals system, the appeals mechanism for anybody who is in the system seeking a licence is to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and new applications from the date this legislation is enacted will be to the EPA.  If the EPA in its subsequent decisions is found to be more stringent and restrictive, will local authorities be forced to retrospectively apply conditions imposed by the EPA to those who received permission during the course of the existing legislation?  If so, what provision is there to assist that industry rather than expecting it to find funding to deal with it by virtue of the existing legislation?<\/p> <p> On the regulations on non-use of motor vehicles, the Minister of State has said there was a &euro;41 million increase in revenue.  I asked in a parliamentary question about the breakdown of the increase in revenue throughout the country, because I want to see local authorities retain those funds for the provision of facilities and services in their own counties, especially in the area of the upkeep and maintenance of roads, because we have seen a progressive fall-off in funding being made available.  We have seen much of the motor tax revenue, unfortunately and unbelievably, transferred to Irish Water.  We have seen Irish Water gobble up enough of the taxpayers' money from other sectors without motor tax being an annual contributor to that super-quango.  That is for another day's argument.  We have had many of them and we will have many more.  People need to see a correlation between the revenue derived from motor taxation in a particular local authority area and an improvement in their roads.<\/p> <p> I had representations from many people who are associated with and partake in the vintage car industry, the vintage tractor sector and so forth, and were very worried about impending amendments to existing legislation, which will leave them facing huge costs for their hobby in the future.  I hope the Minister of State has met them.  I do not believe there is anything in the provisions of this Bill that seeks to implement what was spoken about towards the end of last year.  Can she confirm that representatives of her Department have met with these people, have listened to their concerns about what was proposed and its effect on their industry and the huge costs associated with them continuing in that sector?  It is not only of benefit to themselves, but generates a great deal of money for the charity sector and also the tourism sector, by virtue of many of the rallies that are held in various locations throughout the country at various times of the year.  During the course of this debate on Committee and Report Stage, she must confirm she has met with that sector, has allayed its fears and will row back on the intentions she had to further increase costs associated with road tax for vehicles in that sector.<\/p> <p> The Bill gives provision to an EU directive based on the \"producer pays\" principle.  We welcome that concept, which specifically deals with the disposal of electrical equipment, batteries, packaging, end-of-life vehicles and so forth.  It is paramount that the House is informed that there has been extensive negotiation, consultation and engagement with the relevant sectors to allow them appropriate time to carry out the sort of research that is necessary for them to meet the provisions of this directive, among many other provisions within the Bill.  There must be active engagement with that sector, whereby we can assure the House that there is agreement between both parties to address the issues in a cost-efficient manner that will not negatively affect the industry or jobs in the industry, while recognising their obligation from an environmental perspective not to harm the environment to such an extent that it costs local authorities a significant amount of money to rectify this.<\/p> <p> That is where we stand on the Bill.  We agree with its thrust.  We agree with the concept and the background to it, but we expect the Department to have engaged with the relevant sectors and stakeholders to such an extent that it has their co-operation to make the provisions contained within the Bill appropriate to the needs in that sector by balancing those against the effect of continual harm that might exist for many of these sectors.  We ask the Minister of State to address many of the concerns during the time allocated for the remainder of this debate and through the various Stages of the passage of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800015#N00200","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424259600,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Before we move to Topical Issue Matters, I can call on Deputy Brian Stanley if he wishes to speak now, but he will be the next speaker anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800017#P00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1424259600,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Given the length of time left, I ask that we leave the debate until the afternoon, after the Order of Business.

On 2 July next, lone parents working more than 19 hours per week will lose the one-parent family payment when their youngest child turns seven years of age.  Up to 32,000 families will be affected by this measure and in many cases their incomes will be slashed by up to &euro;80 per week.  By any yardstick or objective analysis, this is a cruel and brutal cut.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has been persistent and consistent in reducing the age threshold for this payment.  It was reduced from 14 to 12 years in 2012 and to ten years in 2013 and is now being reduced to seven years.  When one takes into consideration that the deprivation rate among lone parents is 230% higher than it is among the general population and 33% higher than it is among those who are unemployed, this measure amounts to a serious attack on the quality of life of lone parents.<\/p>  <p>  The implication from the commentary emanating from the Government and Minister for Social Protection is that lone parents are somehow not doing anything at home when they are looking after children or in part-time employment.  The measure is appalling by any standards.  The Minister promised the various activist groups that she would not introduce it until a Scandinavian model of child care had been put in place.  One newspaper columnist - I believe it was Victoria White - made the telling point that the nearest thing we have to a Scandinavian child care model is the drop-off facility at IKEA stores.<\/p>  <p>  It is insulting to argue that this measure will move people into employment because the proposed cut comes on top of many other cuts introduced in successive budgets.  For example, the income disregard for lone parents who secure employment was reduced from &euro;147 to &euro;90, lone parents were effectively barred from vocational education committee and community employment schemes which act as a gateway back into employment and changes were made in the second payment allowance.  I ask the Taoiseach, in the interests of social justice and equality, to show a degree of solidarity by not proceeding with this measure and reversing the policy on which the Minister for Social Protection has embarked, which targets and treats one-parent families in a most cruel manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800018#Q00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1424260200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I do not accept Deputy Martin's view of what the Government is doing in this area.

That is an insult which reflects a mindset and policy orientation that are as Thatcherite as one could get. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800018#Q01700","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1424260200,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Tories.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800018#Q01800","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1424260200,"counter":163,"content":"<p>It is elitism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800018#Q01900","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1424260200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>This right-wing attitude has seeped into Fine Gael and, regrettably, the Labour Party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800018#Q02000","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1424260200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>It was always there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800018#Q02100","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1424260200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>No one is standing back and saying this will hit one-parent families by up to &euro;80.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800018#Q02200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1424260200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>The Deputy should ask a question as we are over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800018#Q02300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1424260200,"counter":168,"content":"<p>The family dividend is worth up to &euro;80.

An adviser to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government was paid &euro;85,750 to advise him on everything relating to housing and Irish Water, which is &euro;5,000 above the recommended level. The Minister for Finance who wants to impose austerity on the people of Greece sought to have an adviser paid &euro;3,000 more than the Cabinet guidelines.  This was initially rejected because, in the words of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, there was \"no compelling reason to sanction the increase,\" yet five days later, he granted the increase.  What was the compelling reason for this?  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources had an adviser put on a salary of &euro;91,624, &euro;12,000 higher than the salary originally offered.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine secured a &euro;25,000 salary increase last July for an adviser.  I would like an explanation for these increases.  However, this exposes that there is no austerity for the Government.  The Taoiseach has created a culture of privilege and a golden circle that rivals the old Fianna F&aacute;il one.  Meanwhile the Government has imposed pay cuts on front-line staff, destroyed public services and social protections and cut benefits for the most vulnerable.  For example, a special category of lone parents who are also carers will lose &euro;86 per week if the Government goes ahead with its cuts to the one-parent family payment which will push all lone parent families further into poverty.

However, I and others believe men must also be part of the solution.  Therefore, today I want to highlight the gaps in services for men who are violent and the gaps in services to prevent violent behaviour.  I acknowledge the work of MOVE, men overcoming violence, but there is a need for a dedicated helpline, support groups and a campaign of awareness of the help available.  It is vital men are encouraged to acknowledge abusive behaviour and to try to prevent it.  This will benefit the person, his family and the community.<\/p> <p> I call for a commitment in the House on this.  I suggest we start by looking at a pilot programme in this area that will support the work of MOVE, which is not a nationwide programme.  We have Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, but its work is concentrated on the victims, a service which is badly needed.  However, if we want to stop the cycle of violence, men must be involved.

Also, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will report on the hearings it held in February this year following a number of submissions regarding domestic and sexual violence.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will take the committee recommendations seriously when available and will consider them in the context of the proposals that came from Dublin Castle.<\/p>  <p>  Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, is an executive office of the Department of Justice and Equality and it is driving the implementation of the national strategy on dealing with domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in the programme for 2010-2014.  The office has commenced a review of that, with a view to devising a new strategy.  This will mean new legislation.  Cosc's role is to address domestic, sexual and gender-based violence from the perspective of a number of Departments and it endeavours to facilitate co-ordination across the areas of justice, housing, health, education, family support and the community sector.  We are well aware of the issues.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendations from the Oireachtas committee and from the groups that participated at Dublin Castle will play an important part in regard to the Minister being able to set out a programme for action.

Does the Taoiseach have a firm date for publication of the International Protection Bill?

Also, those who are sick, even though they receive only &euro;19.10 per week, have to pay &euro;2.50 for each prescription item.

This is an issue about which I am very concerned.  The question of the hen harrier is one that affects my part of the world in Cork North-West and in particular the areas of Rockchapel, Newmarket, Ballydesmond, east Limerick, and up to Clare and Galway.  The issue has lingered since the previous Administration was in office in 2007 when it was agreed that the hen harrier would become a protected species.  Since then, 80,000 ha of land has been designated for the protection of the hen harrier.  There are 3,854 families affected and the farmers involved can only farm their land to a certain capacity.  They cannot build wind farms and they cannot develop forestry.  Their land is of pretty much no value today.  Of the 3,054 farmers, approximately 400 received compensation while the rest currently receive none.  There is a possibility that this issue will be considered under GLAS, but the farmers believe that is not acceptable.  I agree with them as their land now has no value.  I wonder if it is constitutionally correct for this to happen without payments being made to these families.<\/p>  <p>  One of the issues about which I ask the Minister today is the establishment of a new steering group for the formulation of a threat response plan for hen harriers.  It is the Minister's intention to place a member of the SPA on the group.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to putting a member of the IFDL group on the steering committee to represent farmers whose lands have been designated for the protection of hen harriers.  It is very important to include the IFDL in the threat response plan and to give its members a say at the steering group.  Right now, they feel very let down, not particularly by our Government, but certainly the previous one.  They are asking us to listen to their concerns.  Farmers spend 95% of their money in local communities which has a huge impact on rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The farmers have told me that the hen harrier originated in Waterford yet there are no designated lands in Kilkenny, the Golden Vale, or eastern Cork which are some of the areas with better land.  Farmers with designated lands are taking the burden for all the other farmers in Ireland to deal with the issue in regard to the hen harrier.  They deserve compensation over a 15 year period in lieu of growing forestry.  A constituent approached me recently who has land in Rockchapel.  He wanted to sell 5 acres to help his son buy a house in Cork but found when he went to sell the land that it was hen harrier designated and had no value.  Even though there was forestry on both sides of him owned by two different farmers, he could not grow forestry on his land.  This is a decision he did not want.  He is quite happy for his land to be redesignated if that is possible, but in the alternative he believes farmers need compensation.  In order to at least give them a hearing, I ask the Minister, who is very close to this and has had questions from many other representatives, to appoint to the steering group a representative from the IFDL group so that they feel their voice is being listened to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800023#W00300","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speech","time":1424263200,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The hen harrier is an endangered species protected under EU nature directives.  The objective of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is to ensure that important species are protected while ensuring in parallel that the work of farmers and other landowners in managing the habitats which support these species is recognised.  Hen harrier protection was a major issue in the judgment of the European Court of Justice of the EU in 2007 against Ireland in what is known as the \"birds case\" for failure to provide adequate protection for wild birds.  As a result of the judgment, Ireland designated six special protection areas, or SPAs, for the conservation of this species.  The case remains open with the continuing possibility of reputational damage and substantial fines being imposed on Ireland if we are not seen to be in compliance with the judgment.  Hen harrier SPAs are at risk due to a number of factors, including the reclamation of upland open habitats for agriculture, the development of wind farms and the maturing of large-scale forests planted in upland areas.  These activities have a serious impact on breeding populations of birds.  According to the most recent survey in 2010, there are between 128 to 172 hen harrier breeding pairs.  Agricultural reclamation of heath or bog is restricted in these SPAs as it removes nesting and foraging habitat for the species.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is working hard in the wake of the birds case to develop a threat response plan for hen harriers.  An inter-departmental steering group has been established to draw up the plan and it comprises representatives from my own Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The steering group will examine all of the issues at hand, including forestry consents, planning permissions for wind farms and financial supports for farmers with a view to determining the appropriate course of further action.  The steering group has met on two occasions to date and will continue its important work over the next number of months.<\/p>  <p>  The members of the steering group were asked to nominate relevant stakeholders to form part of a consultative committee to include broader representation from sectors likely to be affected by the plan.  Through the consultative committee, the views of those affected will be sought and incorporated into the work of the steering group.  The composition of the consultative committee is still under consideration and my Department has had a number of further requests in relation to its composition.  It is my intention that the committee will include a farmer or farmers with lands designated as a special protection area for the hen harrier.  It is expected that the first meeting of the consultative committee will be convened soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800023#W00400","speaker":"973"},{"type":"speech","time":1424263200,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her reply in regard to the birds being recognised as an endangered species.

Unfortunately, some of the other farming groups feel this land is of no value because sometimes it is in upland areas, which might be wet.  However, many good families have come from these lands and have farmed them very well to the best of their abilities and survived and grown, and they now want to expand.

Due to budgetary constraints, the scheme was closed to new applicants in 2010 and not all the farmers were able to avail of the scheme at the time.<\/p>  <p>  It was always envisaged that the support would ultimately fall under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's remit as part of its future agri-environment schemes.  Future payment schemes, including that for the hen harrier, will be implemented by that Department, primarily through the GLAS scheme.  The Department is still in the process of finalising the details of GLAS.  The consultative committee will be only one conduit for input into the development of the threat response plan and it is expected that a broader public and stakeholder consultation process will be undertaken with input being sought from all interested parties.  Submissions from the public will also be sought at the time of publication of the first draft of the threat response plan and all these actions combined will help bring the necessary clarity and appropriate supports to farmers operating in these unique landscapes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800024#X00200","speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","time":1424263800,"counter":316,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800024#X00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1424263800,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this item and the Minister for attending to hear my contribution.  I have been a public representative for ten years and since my time on Galway City Council I have been an ardent advocate of the need for an outer bypass in Galway.  The Minister recently visited our city and saw the traffic gridlock we Galwegians experience on a daily basis.  Journeys that should take 15 minutes, such as travelling from the east to the west of the city and on to Connemara, take an hour and a half or two hours.  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Varadkar, carried out an assessment of all the roads infrastructure projects proposed and the Galway city outer bypass was ranked as the top road project in terms of cost-benefit ratio.  The need for a city outer bypass is well established and I support it.<\/p>  <p>  Planning permission was granted for the original part of a route and an appellant brought it to the High Court and the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court referred it to the European Court of Justice, ECJ, because the appellant argued that it compromised the integrity of an SAC.  After receiving the ECJ&rsquo;s response, the Supreme Court refused permission.  Like so many, I awaited the publication of the new proposed route with great hope that it would, finally, address traffic gridlock in our city and lift constraints that are hampering business and economic development in our city and the quality of life of its residents.  However, the routes chosen and put before the public are complete and utter madness.  They are not feasible alternatives to the original plan for an outer bypass, for a number of legitimate reasons.<\/p>  <p>  The first reason is the cost.  The original budget, prepared at the height of the economic boom, was approximately &euro;320 million.  The new proposal will cost up to &euro;750 million.  It will result in the destruction of up to 130 homes in the city, family homes, some of which are among the most valuable properties in the city, hence the increased cost.  It will cause the destruction of a number of businesses in the city and will have a very negative impact on some institutions in the city such as NUI Galway as new buildings recently developed there would have to be demolished.  Most significantly, it will have a very negative impact on the world famous Galway racing festival.  It is an area in which the Minister has an interest, with his tourism hat on.  The Galway Races are the jewel in the crown of the Galway tourism product and digging up the racecourse, as required under these plans, would be akin to draining the canals of Venice or boarding up the Colosseum in Rome for a week during the peak tourism season.  The plans for this project were supposed to enhance Galway's economic growth, not cripple it.  The Galway Races are worth more than &euro;60 million per year to the local economy and these plans would have a detrimental effect on it.<\/p>  <p>  The refusal of permission for the original route was due to the presence of bog cotton and the impact the road would have on a small area of limestone paving.  While we all have great respect and affection for our environmental heritage, I have a problem with the prioritisation of bog cotton or limestone paving over people's lives.  We must put people before plants and paving.  The elephant in the room is that the new routes also go through ecological sites of international importance.  If we pursue this course of action, there is no doubt that it will come before the courts again.  The plan must be halted and I ask the Minister to use his offices to review the proposals before the public for their consideration and come back with something that will deliver the much needed infrastructure sooner and at a fraction of the cost envisaged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800024#X00400","speaker":"1185"},{"type":"speech","time":1424263800,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Walsh for the opportunity to address this issue.  I acknowledge the Deputy's concern and interest in the matter.  Since the latest development of the project, Deputy Walsh has raised the project with me and articulated his concerns about it and I am glad to have the opportunity to publicly respond.  I have responsibility for overall policy on and funding of the national roads programme.  The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual national road projects is a matter for the NRA in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.<\/p><p> I am aware that Galway County Council, on its own behalf and on behalf of Galway City Council, is focused on addressing existing transportation issues in Galway city and surrounding areas.  As part of this process I understand that the council initiated a public consultation to inform the public of the transportation options which have been developed to address the problems identified, the constraints identified to date, the implications of the EU Habitats Directive and the project programme.  These options cover public transport, smarter travel and road elements.<\/p> <p> As indicated in the public consultation documents, the position of Galway city, between Lough Corrib and Galway Bay, together with the presence of designated sites, presents significant constraints for developing new infrastructure and the council has, therefore, focused on considering all alternatives in order to minimise the impact on designated sites.  The stated objective of this phase of the council's work is to identify a suitable study area for the examination of alternative routes and transportation solutions, to identify key constraints within this study area, to develop feasible route options and transportation solutions and to carry out a systematic assessment of these options leading to the selection of a preferred route corridor or transportation solution, which will form the basis for the detailed design.  Road options to connect the R336 on the west of the city to the existing N6 on the east have been identified in respect of the possible road component of the transport solution.  Six such options have been included in the public consultation process and the Council has indicated that these are draft options and subject to change in light of more detailed assessments.  In this context I understand that the purpose of the recent second consultation is threefold: first, to update the public on the work to date, second, to obtain input from the public on any additional significant constraints and third, to offer the public an opportunity to propose further alternative options, which had not previously been considered.<\/p> <p> The design team will examine the feasibility of such options and determine whether they merit inclusion in the final appraisal of options.  I have also been informed that the design team is currently engaged in individual meetings with directly affected landowners and the general public to provide more detail on the various options under consideration.  Submissions in respect of the route options can be submitted to the project office until the end of February 2015.  The information received will be collated by the design team and used in the assessment of the route options.  I understand the assessment process is due to be completed by the end of March 2015 and an emerging preferred route option will be identified.  This emerging route corridor will be subsequently put on public display.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800024#X00500","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":320,"content":"<p>The new routes before the public for consultation also compromise the integrity of ecological sites of international importance.

He indicated that in the event of a takeover of Aer Lingus it would continue as a separate entity in its entirety.<\/p>  <p>  What would be the situation of the board of directors of Aer Lingus in such an event?  It has certain responsibilities in respect of commercial strategy, the operating budget and the present role of Aer Lingus.  To what extent will that all remain in place if it is a separate entity?  There are 12 members on the board, which could have 13 members.  The former CEO, Christoph Mueller, was recently replaced by Stephen Kavanagh and I wish him well.  The chief financial officer is Andrew McFarlane.<\/p><p>They are the new executive directors, whereas I understand all of the others are non-executive directors.  Did the Minister appoint any member of the existing board and, if so, whom?  Will he tell me why, although three appointments can be made by the relevant Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, only two of them have been filled?  Does he have plans to make the third appointment within his remit?  Will he further tell me what is the term of office of each of the members of the board of directors?  On examining the available information, it appears as though most of the appointments were made in 2009 or 2010 and that, therefore, most of the appointees are in their second term of office.  The Minister should confirm whether that will be the end of their tenure and indicate what his intentions might be at the end of that period.<\/p> <p> If a takeover takes place, what will happen to the existing board?  Will it continue as before, with all of the powers it has at present as laid out in statute?  Will there be a change to the board's current powers?  How long will the existing board be allowed to stay in place and how will this operate?  Will it stay in place for a period of three or five years or until its current term expires?  Thereafter, will board members be obliged to seek renewal or otherwise?  Who will appoint the new board if the takeover takes place?  What will be the board's duties and functions?  Will they be as comprehensive as the current set of functions?  How will the new Aer Lingus and its board be integrated into the proposed new entity if a statement has been made to the effect that Aer Lingus will remain a separate entity in its entirety?

As he has pointed out, some additional details have emerged of the proposal by International Consolidated Airlines Group, IAG, to make an offer for Aer Lingus since it was first announced in December 2014.  Some of them emerged during the meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications to which the Deputy has referred.  However, it is important to note that this remains a proposal to make an offer and that no formal offer has yet been made.  There is still only a limited amount of detail of the terms of the potential offer.  While a formal offer has not been made, Aer Lingus is in a takeover period and the strict Irish Takeover Panel rules on public communications still apply.  Clearly, the future of Aer Lingus is an important matter in which there is a great deal of public interest.  I have outlined the Government's policy on the proposed bid many times.  I also addressed a Topical Issue tabled by the Deputy on a related matter on 4 February.  The Joint Committee on Transport and Communications heard the views of a wide range of stakeholders on the matter, most recently from the chairman and chief executive officer-designate of Aer Lingus, as well as from IAG.  The Government has made clear the various issues that will be examined before decisions are made on the future of Aer Lingus.<\/p>  <p>  As for the board of the company, about which the Deputy has asked me specific questions, I can only outline the position as it stands.  The State's combined shareholding of 25.1% of the issued share capital in Aer Lingus entitles the Minister, acting through the Minister for Finance in his capacity as shareholder, to nominate up to three persons as Minister's nominees on the board of the company.  The State has two such nominees on the board.  Mr. William Slattery was appointed on 12 July 2013 and Mr. Frank O'Connor on 14 March 2014, both for three-year terms.  The board has ten other executive and non-executive directors.  The mechanism for the appointment of the Minister's nominees on the board of Aer Lingus is set out in Article 93 of the memorandum and articles of association of the company.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, acting through the Minister for Finance in his capacity as shareholder, writes to the chairman to nominate formally the person concerned.  The board then ratifies the appointment of the Minister's nominee as a director of the company.  Under Article 93, should the State's shareholding fall to between 5% and 25.1%, the number of Minister's nominees on the board would fall to two.  Were the shareholding to fall to between 1% and 5%, the number would be one, which relates to some of the questions put to me by the Deputy.  Were the State's shareholding to fall below 1%, it would not have an automatic right to nominate any director under the current arrangements.  Like all company directors, the duties of the Minister's nominees as directors derive from the Companies Acts and all such directors are obliged to pursue the best interests of the company, not those of individual shareholders.<\/p>  <p>  Article 93(g) of the company's articles provides for the Minister to enter into an agreement and arrangements with the Minister's nominees.  This letter of mandate requests the Minister's nominees to seek to ensure those decisions of the company which have significant implications for wider Government policies are considered at board level.  As I indicated, the State's right to nominate up to three directors is based on its current shareholding.  Should the State dispose of its shareholding in its entirety to IAG or any other entity, it would no longer have such rights.  It is simply not possible for me to state what arrangements would apply for the appointment, role and tenure of any future Aer Lingus board in a scenario in which the State no longer had a shareholding in the company.  I reiterate that no decision has yet been taken on the Government's position on the proposal made by IAG.  As I have reiterated previously, in the event of a decision being taken to dispose of the State's shareholding, it would be necessary for the House to approve the principles of any such disposal in accordance with the provisions of the Aer Lingus Act 2004.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800026#Z00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1424265000,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the clarification.  He has observed that this is only in the form of a proposal as yet and that no firm formal offer is on the table.  Nevertheless, if a deal was done with IAG, it appears that this would mean that it would no longer be possible for the Minister to make appointments, that the three nominees the State is entitled to appoint simply would fall as members.  This raises questions about the guarantees.  If cast-iron guarantees have been given with regard to a number of undertakings up to five years, who would be able to oversee this on the part of the State?  This raises a serious question as to what legal commitments can be made.  If there is nobody on the board of directors to put the State's view of the matter, it will have moved entirely out of the hands of the State, which will have no recourse in ensuring the guarantees given are fulfilled.  A question is raised as to whether there is anybody on the board of directors who has the State's interests at heart.  This is not to say there is no one on the board of directors who does not have the best interests of the company at heart.  My understanding is that six of the current board members are perceived to be independent, but it would mean that there would be no one with a foot under the table to speak for the State.  The State would have conditionally delivered its 25.1% stake on so-called cast-iron guarantees.  There is a serious matter to be addressed by IAG in this respect if it intends to take away the three directors the State has the opportunity and entitlement to appoint at present.<\/p>  <p>  Second, it is my understanding that at present there are only two State directors, whereas there is an entitlement to appoint three.<\/p><p>Does the Minister have any proposals to appoint a third director?

It has put forward a case for this.  The Government will have to consider all these matters.  The core issue for me in any decision will be more than just the price of a share.  We have to look at the impact on access and the ability of our country to grow in the medium to long term.  As for the future of the Aer Lingus board, I cannot forecast what IAG might do were it to acquire the company.  The ability to appoint a director to a board is directly related to how much one owns of the company.  Accordingly, the number of directors the State can appoint to the Aer Lingus board is directly related to the size of the shareholding the State has in the company.  That is why we can appoint up to three directors.  We currently have two appointees on the board of directors.  Mr David Begg resigned from the board several weeks ago.

There have been two external reviews of the service, most recently an external review undertaken by Professors Donnai and Newman which reported in May 2014 - a report that is still unpublished - which made 19 recommendations.  From this the HSE and Crumlin hospital released a plan which had 56 recommendations.  Of these 40 were agreed with clinical staff, 11 actions need to be clarified.<br\/><br\/>Five action points, however, have led to significant disagreement between the clinical staff and the HSE hospital administrators.  It was proposed to change of name of centre which was not recommended by any external report.  The genetics staff been told that the name-change will cost &euro;10,000 and moneys for it will be deducted from the genetics budget.  The other proposals are a review of scope of service, a review of the use of family-based clinical records, no action point for additional full-time locum consultant posts and a proposal to merge genetics labs with the hospital's genetics labs.<br\/><br\/>Staff are supported by patient groups which maintain the staff are being treated unfairly for highlighting shortcomings in genetic services over the years.  There has been a lack of public information on what is happening with no adequate consultation with patient groups and service-users around the current changes and future planning.  A steering group to progress the development of a national genetic and genomic medicine network has been established but patient groups were not consulted about the patient representative appointed to the steering group.  Nor has the Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation seen the May 2014 report, despite being part of the process.<br\/><br\/>Crumlin hospital's chief executive sent a letter to staff in which he stated:<blockquote>It will no longer be appropriate to refer to the service as the National Centre for Medical Genetics.  I appreciate this will represent a difficult change for many but it is necessary if the governance is to be clear and unambiguous.<\/blockquote>Senior staff wrote to the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, last November outlining their concerns, especially the proposal to change the status of the centre.  They pointed out that 60% of patients seen by the centre are adults and almost half are seen outside Crumlin hospital.  There are questions as how these patients will be dealt with when the centre becomes a department of the children's hospital in Crumlin.  The change means other genetic centres could be developed in a fragmented way with no integration of family records nationally.<br\/><br\/>There are also concerns because the genetic service was already a grossly underfunded and understaffed one.  As the senior staff told the Minister:<blockquote>A dismantling of this integrated service runs a huge clinical risk and it incurs unnecessary financial costs as other hospitals will have to resource an independent genetic IT system and genetic charts.  This excess workload on an already understaffed unit will also increase risk of clinical errors.<\/blockquote>I have been told by someone with knowledge of the situation that it appears that genetics staff, instead of being supported through this change, are in fact feeling under extreme pressure as they fear contravention of best clinical guidelines for their patients and clients.  There are also other issues arising as the 2015 HSE service plan did not contain any mention of the national rare disease plan for Ireland 2014-18.  Will the Minister indicate what funding will be provided for this plan in 2015?<br\/><br\/>We are also given to understand that self-referrals will also now not be allowed.  This means they will now have to go through a general practitioner, incurring an extra cost for individuals and their families.  Relative to UK guidelines, Ireland should have 14 genetic consultants and 47 genetic counsellors.  Currently, there are four consultants - one has indicated they may leave as a result of the current situation - and only nine counsellors.  Ireland is quite far down the list when it comes to good practice with regards to staffing levels as outlined in the National Centre for Medical Genetics five-year report 2007-11.

It provides services for patients and families affected by or are at risk of a genetic disorder.  It has three integrated units, namely a genetics service, a cytogenetic laboratory and a molecular genetics laboratory.  The University College Dublin department of medical genetics is based in the centre too.  Approximately half of the work done in the centre relates to children.<\/p>  <p>  There have been two recent reviews of the service.  One was a review commissioned by the HSE, undertaken by Professor Dian Donnai, professor of medical genetics at the University of Manchester, and Professor Bill Newman, professor of translational genomic medicine at the same university.<\/p>  <p>  A separate internal review was also commissioned by Crumlin hospital.  Following this internal review, Crumlin hospital made a decision to discontinue the separate identification of the service as the National Centre for Medical Genetics.  This was done in the interest of clarity on governance arrangements.  It is important we are clear the genetics service is and has always been under the governance of the hospital.  It was never a separate entity in its own right.  Staff are employees of the hospital and the service has always been accountable to the hospital&rsquo;s chief executive officer and under the governance of the hospital's board in the same manner as other clinical departments.  This change does not affect the service itself and the HSE confirms there has been no reduction in the scope of the service.<\/p>  <p>  The Donnai report, submitted to the HSE in May 2014, made 20 recommendations.  The majority of these focused on the internal team working and clinical governance issues.  The HSE advises that staff at the centre have accepted these internal recommendations.  The report also recommended that a steering group should be established to develop a national genetic and genomic medicine network that reflects best international practice.  This group will meet for the first time on 3 March next.  Its first focus is to develop a plan for the national network.

That would be a welcome start and would, in some way, give confidence to clinicians and staff that we are serious about funding a genetic centre and about using the advances in medical science and technologies to ensure people can have a better quality of life in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800028#BB00100","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1424266200,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I am no expert in this area and have not been particularly involved with it in any personal way but there are a few points that I would make.  I think it is inappropriate for any section or department within a hospital to declare itself a national centre.  If there are national centres, they should be designated either by the HSE or the Department of Health, or by some other body.  It is inappropriate in general that any department or subsection of any body should declare itself to be a national centre.  I hope Deputy Kelleher would agree with me on that.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the rare diseases plan, it is not specifically mentioned in the 2015 service plan but it is mentioned in one of the operational plans which flows from the service plan.  I will be very keen to see the office established this year if that is possible.  Of course, that is ultimately a decision for the director general of the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to all matters, frankly, I think GP referral is appropriate.  If people self-refer to specialists we will have huge numbers of people referring themselves inappropriately, thereby creating waiting lists to see people who do not need to be seen.  The whole point of going to a GP first is that the GP operates as a gatekeeper and ensures that only appropriate people are referred to specialist centres.  That is the way it works across the public health service and it is a good system in my view.<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, there is a dispute here between some of the staff in Crumlin on the one hand and the CEO and the board of Crumlin on the other.  I do not think disputes within a workplace or institution should be resolved in Parliament.  That is not our role.  It is important that, if there is a dispute in a workplace or hospital, it is resolved using the appropriate mechanisms within that hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800028#BB00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1424266200,"counter":334,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800028#BB00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1424266200,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1424266200,"counter":336,"content":"<p>The Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 looks like it is doing a certain amount of tidying up.  It is tidying up some loose ends and endeavouring to comply with EU directives.  That seems to be the main purpose of the Bill.  No doubt the legislation is necessary to address certain anomalies in current laws and address the matters outlined.  However, there are other more important pieces of legislation that should be included.<\/p>  <p>  Part of the Bill concerns the role of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and there are clearly issues regarding the EPA's role that might have warranted more attention.  I am thinking in particular of the ongoing problems with waste management and the disposal of waste.  There are unresolved issues that remain regarding the large fire out in south Dublin last year - that plant - and I highlight that as one instance.  There are issues regarding waste management and the storage of waste that we need to deal with.<\/p>  <p>  I also hope the Minister's Department will deal urgently with a number of other proposed pieces of legislation under this brief.  I note there is nobody here from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The Minister of State who is here is not from that Department.  Maybe there is good reason for that, but the Minister brought the Bill before the D&aacute;il and we have little enough opportunity to question Ministers or to highlight the key issues that we see as needing to be resolved.  The Minister of State has been sent in here and it is probably not his fault, but the least the Government could do is send in one of the two Ministers in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I know there is one financial dimension to this, and the Minister of State who is in the Chamber is in the Department of Finance.  I recognise that he does have a role for one part of this Bill but it is mainly an environmental miscellaneous provisions Bill.  That is what the Bill is called.  There is one specific issue with which the Minister of State will be dealing later on.<\/p>  <p>  The change in the electoral law needs to be addressed urgently.  There is proposed legislation there; I brought forward a Bill two weeks ago in respect of lowering the voting age and the Government passed it on Second Stage.  While I welcome that, I do not want the Bill just parked.  We need to be a bit more imaginative.  The Scots have shown the way forward and have given 16 year olds the vote, and the world has not shaken because of it.  It is a positive measure and we need to move ahead with those as well.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of other recommended changes to electoral legislation that came out of the Constitutional Convention, which should be brought forward.  There is also an issue - the officials might take note of this for the absent Minister - regarding the planning Bills in the pipeline, the stated purpose of which is to implement some of the findings of the Mahon report coming out of the Mahon tribunal.  We welcome that, but want to highlight the importance of doing it.  I ask the Minister if it is proposed, as recommended by the Mahon report, to establish a new office of an independent planning regulator?  That is the key point of Mahon and it should be legislated for.  Most people, if not all, in this House want to see the planning system tidied up.  We do not need to rehearse what went before us here and we certainly want to put a stop to that.  Hopefully we can have that independent office, but the Minister responsible might give me an answer regarding the recommendations of the Mahon report.<\/p>  <p>  Part 3, section 17 provides that the agency will now have an integral role in air quality and monitoring air pollution as well as in prevention, control and enforcement.  The main issue here is around bituminous coal or smoky coal.  There are on-the-spot fines and fixed penalty notices.  That is perhaps a more effective and efficient way of doing it.  I wish to highlight one issue, namely reports of smoky or bituminous coal being sold as well as other fuels that do not come into the smokeless category, particularly in larger urban areas.<\/p><p>It is important there is an effective method to deal with that.<\/p> <p> I have a concern in regard to peat or turf.  The smoky coal ban is being rolled out across the State and it now applies to towns with a population of over 15,000.  We do not want to be seen to penalise small-time fuel suppliers in rural areas who cut and save a small amount of turf and sell it to neighbours or people in the immediate locality.  Smoky coal, or bituminous coal, is causing huge problems in terms of pollution and there are reports of it being brought in from other jurisdictions.  However, a small amount of peat or turf being cut and saved and sold on a small-scale is not causing a major problem in regard to pollution.<\/p> <p> I refer to section 20 relating to two new fixed payment notice offensives under the European Union (Paints, Varnishes, Vehicle Refinishing Products and Activities) Regulations 2012.  There is provision for a new fixed payment notice of &euro;1,000.  I am not an expert on paint products, although I used to know a bit more about them at one time when working beside a panel beater.  At this point, the products in this State may not be completely converted over to more environmentally-friendly types.  I am concerned that we give people a bit of space.  Obviously, stocks should be allowed to run out.<\/p> <p> I am also concerned about small-scale operations and panel beating shops.  We live in a country of 6.5 million people but in a State of just under 4.7 million people.  By and large, paint shops, or panel beating shops as they were commonly known until a number of years ago, operate on a small scale.  This is not the middle of Berlin or the middle of London.  When one goes outside the M50, one is talking about small-scale operations.  Even in medium-sized towns, one is typically talking about one, two or three people working in panel beating shop or a paint shop, doing car finishing and repairing crashed cars.  It is important we do not come down too hard on those people.  I can think of a few operating in my area.  They seem to make a real effort to run a good operation, to comply with the planning laws and so on.  We need to be careful the provisions of the Bill do not hammer those people into the ground.<\/p> <p> We hear the normal complaints from small businesses about all the regulations, the VAT requirements, the Revenue requirements, the local authority rates, the planning conditions, the development levies with which they must comply and, therefore, we need to be careful in the case of panel beaters and people repairing the bodies of cars.  That sector is, by its nature, small, and it is very small down the country.  The operations in my area have one, two or three people working in them.  The largest one of which I can think has three people working in it and they are from the one family.<\/p> <p> I refer to section 24 which replaces An Bord Plean&aacute;la with the EPA as the appeals body for decisions made by local authorities on the licensing of certain small-scale activities under the Act.  That may make perfect sense in that the EPA will have expertise available to it which An Bord Plean&aacute;la will not have.  However, whatever procedure is put in place, let us try to make it as straightforward as possible.  Let us not make it an over-bureaucratic and a long drawn-out process.  We must have common sense in this regard.  Along with everything else, when trying to get a project up and running, people must deal with regulations, and rightly so.  However, it is important that with that change-over from An Bord Plean&aacute;la to the EPA as the appeals body, the appeals mechanism is kept as simple and straightforward as possible and as quick as possible so there is no undue delay.  As a result of some of the delays with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, cases go on for months and projects drag on from one year to the next.  We must try to avoid that at all costs.<\/p> <p> In regard to Part 4 extending the fee base of the EPA, the Minister is obviously giving the EPA an opportunity to charge what he describes as an appropriate fee given the work, research, investigations, inspections and so on it must do.  It is important the fee is appropriate, is not excessive and proportionate to whatever matter the EPA is examining.  It is important it does not become a cash cow.  There is a cost which is carried by the taxpayer.  Somebody must pay which is always the case.  We recognise that but we do not want to see this becoming a revenue stream.  The EPA must be funded as it carries out a very important role.  However, fees must be applied in a cautious and measured way.<\/p> <p> Another significant provision in the Bill relates to road tax and the non-use of vehicles.  We certainly welcome what is being done and the extension of the period of notification from ten days to 21 days.  Ten days is too tight and I think the Government has acknowledged that.  That is a very positive move which will be welcomed.  It is a more reasonable and a more workable proposition than ten days.<\/p> <p> I would like to use the opportunity to highlight the issue of road tax.  The Minister will be aware of an issue in regard to the taxation of HGVs.  The road network must be maintained and road taxes must be collected.  The change from ten days to 21 days will help road hauliers if it applies to HGVs.  Hauliers have a problem in regard to vehicles when they are off the road and not in use.  However, there is a big issue in regard to the differential between this country and Britain and the North of Ireland in terms of costs.  We have been lobbied on this over the past number of months, as has the Government.  The concern we have is that some operators have already relocated to England, the North of Ireland or to other countries.  Nobody wants to see those companies relocate, set up depots or set up part of the business in other countries.  County Wexford, in particular, has been badly affected by this.<\/p> <p> There is also a problem in the midlands, including in County Laois where I live.  Hauliers are hauling goods - it is a free market so nobody can stop this - out of County Laois, for example, with trucks based in other countries.<\/p><p>They could be based in Britain or anywhere in continental Europe and they are running loads out to the Continent.  If local hauliers could compete, they would be able to get that work.  I know the Minister of State is taking note of this and I thank him for that.  Not alone are we losing the road tax, but we are also losing the PRSI, VAT and revenue on the fuel.  There is a range of costs, including, of course, the jobs we are losing.  If 20 or 30 jobs are relocated to Newry, it is not too bad as it is up the road and at least it is some benefit to the island of Ireland, but if they go off the island, to Bristol or Liverpool, we are really in trouble.  Will the Government keep this issue in mind and try to do something with it?  We asked in the last budget for something to be done with it.  That did not happen.  The haulage industry is operating on very tight margins.  I know hauliers who are doing the same runs they were doing 20 years ago but they are doing them for lower rates.  That is how cut-throat it has become.  It has become very difficult to operate.  They simply cannot compete with companies that are based in other jurisdictions.  One regularly sees Eddie Stobart, the Scottish firm, on the motorways.  They are able to compete.  They are able to come in, pick up loads and take them out, and run loads in and out of the midlands or the west or anywhere along the eastern seaboard.  They can do it at a price that the hauliers in this State simply cannot.  The rates for the work have been pushed further and further down.  We must take note of that.  I ask the Government to keep it under review.  It constantly says it is for jobs.  That is fair enough.  We are for jobs as well.  We can create jobs at a very quick rate, but if we are haemorrhaging jobs at the same rate, we are in a standstill situation.  We do not want to see jobs lost off the island of Ireland.  We want to keep those haulage jobs here and give the haulage industry a level playing field to operate on.<\/p> <p> In the amendment to the waste management Act, Part 6, section 23, fixed payment notices are being introduced again.  I can see the benefits of that.  I would like to see that expanded to take into account illegal dumping.  Clearly the penalties for that are insufficient.  Extensive illegal dumping is taking place.  There is the small-scale stuff where people just throw stuff out the windows of cars and vehicles.  All was revealed in the last month or two, when the frost kills back the growth on the sides of the road, and they are littered.  The countryside is in a shocking state in places.  Around every town and village there are people driving out.  They are not always driving bad vehicles - some are driving very good 141- and 142- registered vehicles - and dumping rubbish in the countryside.  They are not always people who are on the breadline.  Some people who are on the breadline are more conscientious about these things.  Unfortunately there are people who are unscrupulous and they are destroying the countryside.  We need to deal with it in environmental legislation.  What is there at the moment is not up to the mark.  The Government will have to take action on this.  Tidy Towns committees have been in existence as long as I have.  I remember hearing about them as a child.  There was a Tidy Towns committee in the town I grew up in, doing work and everything else.  There are people in rural areas gathering rubbish, pulling it out of hedgerows and gateways every morning.<\/p> <p> It is destroying the countryside, it is damaging the environment, and it is damaging tourism as well.  People come here from continental Europe and take a spin through the countryside, only to see black bags shoved into every gateway and paper cups from Supermacs, McDonald's and wherever else littered along the sides of motorways.  I regularly see people out along the sides of motorways with litter-pickers, walking along with a big truck behind them, picking up the rubbish that people throw out through the windows.  They are obviously doing it at night when no one can see them.  They just fling out these things when they are finished with them.  There is a role for education in this.  It baffles me that schools are doing green flags and everything like that, and yet people have it in their heads that when they are finished eating and drinking in a car, they just fling the rubbish out through the window and think somebody else has to pick it up after them.  In a carpark recently, I saw four separate piles which, when I looked closer, were in the shape of a parking space, with a white line on either side.  Obviously people in the back and front of the car had been having a takeaway.  They wound down the windows and dropped the rubbish out of each side.  One could see the four containers and the empty snackboxes left in the carpark.  They drove away and left the four piles after them.<\/p> <p> Laois County Council - the taxpayer, the public - must pay a man to go out the next morning to pick up this, day after day.  It is one of the things we need to look at as a society, to get our act together on this and make a serious attempt to change the culture.<\/p> <p> There are some issues that we will be looking to change and we will be putting forward amendments when the Bill moves to Committee Stage.  The Minister of State, wearing his Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government hat, might take on the issue of road tax, particularly in respect of trying to keep jobs here.  We must be cautious how we move forward in relation to some of the matters I raised.  I look forward to Committee Stage, on which we will be tabling amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800028#BB00400","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424267400,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I call Deputies Michael Fitzmaurice, Tom Fleming and Mattie McGrath.

Every single page of it has some reference to EU legislation.  Do we own our own country?  Are we in control of our own destination or is the EU telling us, day in, day out, from when we go to bed to whatever we do in life, where we are going?  Are we gone that bad as a country?  Have we lost our patronage, so that we have to take everything from them and put it in?<\/p>  <p>  I see ownership of Killarney National Park is being transferred to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Look at the Department's behaviour through the years regarding the turf issue and various things that occurred in different parts of the country.  For example, in Limerick the National Parks and Wildlife Service tried to ram it down people's throats that there was a turlough in a place near Limerick even though it was gone for 20 years.  It tried to ram it down people's throats about bogs.  It brought out its own science and now, 18 years later, it has been proved that the science is up to 40% wrong, when independent consultants were brought in.  Is this the way to go forward in getting a national park looked after or getting it under the auspices of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht?  The record of the National Parks and Wildlife Service is despicable and deplorable, if one goes through what has gone on in each part of the country.<\/p>  <p>  I look at this document and all I see is penalties.  The one thing that strikes me is that we all encourage entrepreneurship.  We all encourage youngsters to get out there and do things.  There is a sad reality in this.  If a youngster beside the Minister of State in Cork, or beside any of us in any part of the country, cuts a tree and decides to bag it to be a young entrepreneur, if they get a few bags of turf in their father's, mother's, uncle's or aunt's shed, and go down the road to try to sell it, they need a licence.  That is the reality of what we are doing with this.  If they have not got a licence, we have the on-the-spot fine.<\/p><p>This is a great country in which we will cripple people and discourage them from working or becoming entrepreneurs.<\/p> <p> It will be necessary to make amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  While I fully agree that a licence is needed to sell fuels, youngsters selling bags of timber or turf should not have to look over their shoulders fearing they will be given a fixed charge penalty - this is a lovely new phrase - of &euro;500.<\/p> <p> People have to get all their paperwork from the Environmental Protection Agency.  In 2009 and 2010, the EPA produced reports on Glenamaddy Lake in County Galway.  The State pumps 200 tonnes of raw sewage into the lake every day but does not face fixed charge penalties from the EPA, whereas someone with &euro;100 of timber will receive a fine. <\/p> <p> Every part of the Bill creates costs for people by requiring them to get different types of licences.  What are we doing as a nation?  We are telling people that if they go right, left, up or down, they will be charged more to be in business and survive.  Why are we doing this?  It is because our magic masters in the great European Union have told us to do it.  We can continue down this road or we can consider where we are going as a nation and ask whether these rules and regulations are costing jobs.  Are the do-gooders both here and in Europe who tell us what to do causing more emigration?  Do the 35,000 civil servants in Europe believe they must do something every day to justify their existence and produce bits of papers with more and more regulations?  The Bill features references to EU regulation throughout.<\/p> <p> When will some Minister ask whether this is good or bad?  As a nation, are we able to be patriotic by standing up for ourselves and believing in ourselves or will we take this from our so-called masters in Europe, day in and day out?  I do not class them as our masters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800030#DD00300","speaker":"1198","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424268000,"counter":342,"content":"<p>That is what we are doing today in the national Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800031#EE00200","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1424268000,"counter":343,"content":"<p>We are quoting all this European Union legislation because Ministers love EU law.

These include the functions which, under the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park Act 1932 as it stood immediately after enactment, were exercisable by the Commissioner of Public Works, and most of the functions which were exercisable by the Minister for Finance under the 1932 Act.<\/p>  <p>  I wish the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, well in her stewardship of Killarney National Park.  I am sure she will continue the excellent work carried out by her predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, on behalf of the national park.  I am also sure she will take a personal interest in this matter given that Killarney National Park is the largest national park in the country and the jewel in the crown of the national park network.<\/p>  <p>  The nucleus of Killarney National Park is the 4,300 ha of the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park which was presented to the State in 1932 by Senator Arthur Vincent and his parents-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. William Bowers Bourn, in memory of Senator Vincent's late wife, Maud.  The generosity of the Vincent family ensured that the most beautiful lakeland, parkland and woodland in Killarney could be preserved in the hands of the State and will continue to be accessible to future generations.<\/p>  <p>  The focal point for visitors to Killarney National Park is Muckross House and gardens.  The house, which is a late 19th century mansion with all manner of furnishings and artefacts from that period, is a major visitor attraction.  It is jointly managed by the park authorities and the trustees of the house who have formed a dedicated and proactive committee that provides ancillary facilities to complement all the physical features of the national park.  These include historical, cultural, musical and folklore archives, a model farm and farmhouse.  Each house depicts the various categories of farm family dwellings.  The park also features a traditional schoolhouse and blacksmith's forge.  Live demonstrations are given of all the traditional farm activities in the era of horse driven machinery as well as butter making and bread baking.  Ongoing developments by the trustees greatly enhance the visitor experience and give an insight into 19th century and early 20th century Ireland.  This is highly educational for the younger generation, including young people who visit Muckross House with their families or on educational tours with schools.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, to convey to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht my acknowledgement of the work done by the trustees and request that she maintain the co-operative and friendly relationship that has always existed between the Department and trustees of Muckross House. <\/p>  <p>  Muckross House is one of the prime visitor locations in the country.  In 2013, the visitor book recorded 118,789 visitors and figures for 2014 should be significantly higher.<\/p><p>The restaurant is thriving but there is a huge number of unrecorded visitors to the national park and Muckross complex.  The number of visitors to the complex is much more substantial than 118,000 and it could probably be trebled.<\/p> <p> The newly refurbished Killarney House and Gardens is a major project and its location brings the national park closer to the town.  It borders the centre of the town.  A total of &euro;17 million has been invested over the past few years and this has provided for the reinstatement of 35 acres of gardens to their original pristine state.  This will be an iconic feature at the heart of the prime tourism town in the country.  Will the Minister of State convey to the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht the immediate need for staff to be appointed?  Significant public relations work and advertising needs to be undertaken prior to the opening because this is a major acquisition in the context of the entire tourism product in County Kerry.<\/p> <p> The current staff in the national park are under extreme pressure because of the maintenance and general upkeep that is required throughout.  There is need for more manpower to undertake the physical work involved and to ensure part-time staff are available to work as guides and so on during the summer.  The tourism industry is expanding, and the Wild Atlantic Way will also be a feature of the county's tourism product, as visitors do the Atlantic drive and then travel inland.  Kerry Regional Airport is also flourishing and, therefore, there is good access to the county by air and rail, although there is a need to upgrade the road access through Adare and Macroom, in particular.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is making his own efforts in that regard.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister to co-operate with requests from jarveys regarding the use of the road inside the perimeter walls of Killarney House.  It is parallel to Mission Road, which runs from the Killarney Plaza Hotel to the cathedral.  There is a need for access to the park via Chestnut Drive and that facility should be made available.  Mission road is busy with heavy traffic and it is not easy for the jarveys to travel along it.  This would be a practical measure, which could be undertaken with minimum disruption to the environment by ensuring the access is provided within the perimeter wall.  It would also be desirable to lower the wall, as this would be positive from an aesthetic and visibility point of view.  It would improve the ambience and bring the national park closer to the heart of the town.<\/p> <p> There is a need for an annual maintenance fund for the repair and surface dressing of a network of roads throughout the park, as they have drastically deteriorated in recent years.  Minor works have been carried out but substantial funding is needed to bring the roads up to a good standard.  That probably means a three year plan is necessary with sums expended annually.<\/p> <p> I ask that the work on the walk around the lakes be expedited.  The co-operation of the Department will be important in securing a walkway and a cycleway around the lakes.  I ask that every assistance be given for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800031#EE00600","speaker":"1050","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424268600,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I thank my two colleagues, Deputies Fitzmaurice and Fleming, for sharing time.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will give effect to a waste policy commitment in the programme for Government.  Many proposals in the programme have not been effected and they will not be either before the Government leaves office but, as previous speakers said, the Government parties seem to be trying to stifle small business.  I accept legislation and regulation is required but it should not stymie initiative.  Entrepreneurs such as Bill Cullen, Sean Quinn and many others started off in their own field in their own area as young people trying to make a living.  They used their initiative, their brain and their business acumen.  Most young people have business acumen but everything is tied up with regulation.<\/p>  <p>  I do not blame the Minister of State for all of it or for the implementation of successive directives from Europe.  Deputy Fitzmaurice might not agree but when we transpose EU directives, we have an uncanny habit of adding nine or ten regulations to the diktats from Europe.  This has happened in many sectors.  I am a small businessman and I have witnessed the way regulation has been imposed.  I would have been unable to start my business, which I founded in 1982, today.  It is too costly and prohibitive to do so.  There is too much red tape and regulation after regulation with an enforcement army implementing everything no matter what industry one goes into.<\/p>  <p>  The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, took a court case against a filling station in Durrow, County Laois for employing people under the prescribed legal age.  The judge threw out the case saying it was much better for the young people to be working part time and gaining an understanding of commerce while earning a few euro in pocket money to help their hard pressed parents and learning the ethos of work rather than for them to be sitting at home in front of a computer or on a Wii.  I am delighted he did this.  I do not blame the NERA officials because they must implement the legislation passed in the House but much of it is purely regressive and downright stupid.  I wonder whether the people who draft these regulations ever consult small business people or people living in various parts of the country before they make changes.<\/p>  <p>  The Bills provides for the reinstatement of fixed payment notices for certain offences under solid fuel regulations and their extension to a range of other existing offences.  It is all about having a cash cow and generating money to keep the system going but this is driving people out of business.  It is anti-work, anti-business and, in many cases, it is anti-rural Ireland.  Many business owners started up as ordinary fuel merchants who bought timber from farmers, chopped it up and sold it door to door.  This is hard, dangerous work and I accept it has to be regulated and safety must be ensured at all times.  However, the Government wants to ban this and ensure all fuel must be bought from oil companies.  Deputy Fitmaurice is correct that the Government cannot touch the people who are laundering oil or those who are stretching petrol, which results in unfortunate families having their cars blown out of it, but it can get the little people all the time.  They are easy prey and there is too much of that.<\/p>  <p>  We are trying to recover from the downturn but the EPA, an organisation I admire, will not prosecute local authorities.  I had occasion to pick up the telephone to EPA officials.  I recall former Deputy, Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, who is now an MEP, outlining to the House how he tried to raise an issue in Castlerea with the agency.  He was passed on to the county council with comments that Deputies Flanagan and McGrath were on their case.  We were not on their case but we were seeking fair play.<\/p><p>Fairness should mean fairness for everyone.  Why should they prosecute ordinary customers and small business people when they will not prosecute the county councils?  They will not do that, as I have seen.  They come a couple of times a year to my village.  I met a landowner one day who has an outlet pipe from the local sewerage system belting into his land, approximately 200 m south of the bridge which is the main thoroughfare.  They come and take the sample at the bridge.  He asked them if they would go down 200 yd. and they would get a totally different sample, but they would not do that.  They are selective, but when they come out to a farmer, they go where they like.<\/p> <p> It is an unfair system and is becoming more unfair through the imposition of these kinds of ridiculous charges.  This is wrong.  We have fishing and game clubs that do a power of work for our environment and for the restocking of rivers and game, yet they too are being policed out of business.  I do not know how far this will go.  Take for example the issue of scrap and scrapyards.  I tried, unsuccessfully, to bring in the Scrap and Precious Metal Dealers Bill and was promised by the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, that it would be introduced.  I am aware the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government introduced some regulations, but they are toothless.<\/p> <p> A man in Tipperary who owns three scrap yards, Mr. Michael Bailey, cannot move a battery from an end of life vehicle from one of his yards to another without a licence.  He has come to me about this issue.  One night, a couple of months ago, a gang arrived and fed and neutralised his Alsatian dogs then cut their way into his premises and took the batteries from every vehicle, chopping the cables and leads and doing untold damage.  They then brought the batteries to a scrapyard in Limerick.  There were no prosecutions of that gang for moving batteries without regulation.  This type of activity is going on across the board.  We have highwaymen outside of the law acting in this manner, yet we prosecute ordinary people.  Mr. Bailey went to the garda&iacute; in Tipperary town and fair play to them they traced the gang and recouped the batteries.  Did the EPA prosecute them or the county council for moving batteries without a licence?  They did not, which shows how farcical the situation is.  Yet they prosecute the ordinary man.<\/p> <p> A similar situation occurred in the case of another man, Seamus Clarke who has a tyre business in Tipperary.  His stuff was stolen and found, but nobody was prosecuted.  Similarly, in Tipperary recently we could not continue our coursing meet because all the hares had been killed by roving gangs, marauding gangs with all kinds of dogs, including lurchers and terriers.  These gangs held their own races, outside of the law.  We had a coursing meeting planned which we hoped would be a success, to be attended by thousands with everything regulated properly, but we could not have it because for the first time in 80 years there were no hares.<\/p> <p> Groups of people operate outside the law.  When we pass their houses in the evening, they have bonfires burning, but if you or I burn a few papers outside we are prosecuted.  The law seems to be applied to ordinary, small people, but it ignores the gangs I have mentioned, whether money launderers, diesel launderers or others.  It is about time we copped on and stopped persecuting ordinary people.  We talk about the boom and the Government keeps citing figures suggesting we are in recovery.  That is true for Dublin, as far as the Naas Road, but not outside of that. <\/p> <p> The Bill includes fixed penalties of &euro;2,000, or &euro;5,000 if a case goes to court.  This is a scandalous option to face any small entrepreneur.  What about court costs if a case goes to court?  What about people who cannot afford barristers or solicitors to represent them?  They may lose their case, having tried to defend themselves, and end up with a pile of costs.  The officials who prosecute them are unaware of the costs.  They get paid, get their wages and put in their bill for expenses.  What is going on is outrageous.<\/p> <p> The Minister and his officials should be aware of the situation.  If they are not, those who drafted the legislation should.  If they are not, they should put on their working boots and overalls and go out and see these businesses in rural Ireland.  They should meet the entrepreneurs who are trying to bring about recovery in this country and who are trying to pass on the initiative instilled in them to their children.  They should not tie people up in knots so that nobody can do anything.  Who is going to run businesses, pay taxes and rates and everything else if these people are being persecuted and driven out of business by regulation after regulation and directive after directive?  <\/p> <p> These regulations and directives are being inserted in this Bill by the Government, as happened with the previous Government, and will be added to the statutory instruments already in place.  A person would want to be a solicitor to understand the legislation and small business owners would need to employ a solicitor to explain them.  It is about time the system copped on.  We cannot keep adding regulation after regulation or keep introducing nonsensical, impractical and unworkable laws that turn ordinary people into criminals.  Regulation for the NCT, road safety and you name it has gone over the top - gone bonkers - and people end up facing the judicial system.<\/p> <p> We were promised a judicial council Bill and I asked the Taoiseach about it today.  This would allow people to make complaints if they do not get a hearing.  Ordinary people are trying to run small businesses, to pay their tax, their VAT and their rates, but they have no place to go and have not been enabled to defend themselves.  They cannot afford to pay for legal representatives and often end up in prison as a result.  I know of a man in Tipperary who did.  Batteries and everything else can be stolen from a yard and sold to another scrapyard without an invoice, yet a man can be prosecuted for moving one battery from one of his yards to another.<\/p> <p> I am all for protection against pollution.  The scrapyard owner I know must ensure there is not a drop of oil in the engines of the cars in his yard- not a thimbleful.  At the same time, we see people have bonfires, spill diesel and oil and do enormous damage to the environment, but they are not prosecuted at all.  Somehow or other, the system picks on the easy target, ordinary people in rural and urban Ireland who are trying to make a bob.  If we are going to tie them up in knots with regulations like those in this Bill, nobody will run businesses or be self-employed.  They will all want good jobs in the public or State service.  Where will we end up then?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800032#FF00200","speaker":"1090","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424269200,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Deputy Fergus O'Dowd is sharing his time with Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800033#GG00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1424269200,"counter":351,"content":"<p>The Deputies opposite have missed the point of this legislation.

Why will it benefit small towns and villages more than large cities and towns?  The simple answer is that this legislation will empower the Environmental Protection Agency to issue on-the-spot fines for particular offences, such as polluting the air we breathe.  The sale of bituminous or smoky coal is an offence in areas where it is prohibited.  Its sale is a serious and ongoing problem.  The particles emitted into the atmosphere from this coal are termed PM10 and PM2.5 particulate matter.  The emission of these particles has a significant health impact, which is why we ban the sale of this coal in large towns and cities.  These particles can go deep into our lungs and cause serious, life-threatening illnesses.  In Ireland, the main source of these particles is the domestic use of solid fuels and vehicular traffic.<\/p>  <p>  The results of tests that were conducted on air quality throughout the country for 2013 show there has been a significant decrease in cities and large urban areas of this particulate matter.  In other words, the air is better and purer than it was.  However, this decrease is not evident in smaller towns, where domestic solid fuel emissions are more significant than traffic emissions.  Many towns do not benefit from the health effects resulting from a ban on smoky coal and often do not have access to cleaner fuel alternatives such as natural gas. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has a significant target to reduce the level of these pollutants in our atmosphere.  Achieving the target is a challenge and will require an integrated approach across a number of sectors, including transport and industrial emissions.  The clear message on page 62 of the EPA report is that certain communities have a significant problem with air quality, in the context of WHO emission levels.  This is not to say the air is unhealthy, but the standards or levels the WHO will apply to air quality here are exceeded in some of the smaller towns my colleagues on the opposite side of the House have mentioned.  For once, therefore, Deputy McGrath has been talking through his hat, because air quality in rural Ireland is worse than it should be.<\/p><p>I welcome the Department's intention to consider an extension of the ban on bituminous coal to other parts of the country.  It should be extended not only to some towns and villages but the island as a whole.  The need to extend the ban on smoky coal, North and South, is unanswerable.  The health impacts of a countrywide ban are clear.  It would benefit the health of ordinary people.  I note that the Department has commissioned a survey, North and South, of the impact of a countrywide ban.  The most significant impact would be on people's health.  There are, however, many issues that we will have to address if and when we do it, including fuel poverty.  Non-bituminous coal can be more expensive initially, but we should be able to prevent a significant increase in cost to poorer people in society through the social welfare system.  The imposition of a countrywide ban would result in a clamp-down on the sale, distribution and transport of smoky fuel.  <\/p> <p> I welcome the provision in the Bill which provides for on-the-spot fines for certain offences committed under the legislation.  While a person could challenge a fine in court, doing so, in terms of solicitors' fees and so on, would be very expensive.  In terms of Garda and court time and administration overheads, it is far simpler and much less expensive and makes sense to have an on-the-spot fine system.  A person who believes he or she has been incorrectly issued with a fine can bring a case to the courts, in respect of which he or she will incur costs.  It is important that we keep people out of court.  An on-the-spot fine for an offence committed under the Bill - the offences are significant - makes sense.  <\/p> <p> My colleagues on the other side of the House are, again, wrong in that this legislation will not put legitimate businesspeople out of work; rather, it will ensure those who break the law by selling coal which does not meet the requirements under the Bill and will have a detrimental affect on the health of the persons who use it and the surrounding communities will be put out of business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800033#GG00700","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424269800,"counter":357,"content":"<p>Will people be required to obtain a licence to sell timber?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800034#HH00200","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speech","time":1424269800,"counter":358,"content":"<p>The clamp-down on the illegal sale of smoky coal-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800034#HH00300","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1424269800,"counter":359,"content":"<p>Timber is a clean fuel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800034#HH00400","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speech","time":1424269800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>-----will boost sales for legitimate businesses paying the solid fuel carbon tax.  They are the home truths with which we must grapple and understand and this legislation will help to fight that battle for us.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation introduces many other measures.  I am concerned about the provision on breaches of the waste management Acts.  In terms of departmental policy on waste management, we must ensure we recover as much as we can by way of recycling and the re-use of waste.  Irish people have been recycling waste for many years and we are increasingly exporting more of our domestic and other waste.  That is wrong.  It does not make sense to me that recyclable waste is sitting in the ports of our cities and large towns awaiting export for use elsewhere.  This is an issue we ought to address urgently.<\/p>  <p>  My colleagues opposite made reference to illegal diesel, diesel laundering and so on, which is a huge issue but not necessarily one covered under this legislation.  The Bill provides for mandatory fines for using certain pollutants.  The biggest pollutant in my constituency, as Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick and I know, is toxic chemicals used to launder illegal diesel along the Border.  Despite the protestations and bleats from Sinn F&eacute;in on the issue, it is a significant pollutant that pollutes the water into which it flows, about which there is no doubt.  I challenge Deputy Gerry Adams to drink that water at source where it is being polluted.  Obviously, he will not do so because if he were to do so, he would not be around for very long.<\/p>  <p>  We must address the pollution of our environment and society.  We must, in particular, deal with the serious significant adverse impact of illegal diesel laundering in Border areas.  This legislation is good and positive.  It contains many constructive measures.  I note, however, that there has been no regulatory impact analysis of it.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, might set out in his reply or on Committee Stage the impact of the legislation in the context of some of the issues raised.  This is important and constructive legislation which I support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800034#HH00500","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1424269800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I have written to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, outlining my concerns about waste from diesel laundering that is being dumped in Lough Ross in County Armagh and entering the Fane river which is the source of drinking water for Dundalk and its hinterland.  Approximately 1,200 incidents of such dumping have been dealt with by the local authorities since 2008, 596 cases of which have taken place in County Louth.  It has cost the State approximately &euro;4.8 million to dispose of this waste.  There is no doubt that this is a major problem in County Louth.<\/p>  <p>  We know anecdotally that a large proportion of this waste comes from across the Border, but we cannot prove the link.  Following discussions between the Garda and Customs officials and Monaghan County Council which has also been seriously affected, the Minister has confirmed that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will fund a pilot sampling programme to test the dumped waste and, I hope, link the dump sites with particular laundering processes and identify the origin of the waste diesel.  The pilot programme will be carried out by a specialist contractor who will visit the sites, sample the water, deliver the samples to the State Laboratory and compile a report based on the analysis.  This is great news for County Louth and surrounding areas.<\/p>  <p>  There is already good co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI and other enforcement agencies on both sides of the Border.  However, given that it is likely that the origin of the waste material is Northern Ireland and given the major environmental impact south of the Border and the huge cost to the State in that regard, it is vital that an effort be made to build on these relationships.  The Minister has assured me that he will highlight the problems being faced in Border counties at the next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council.  <\/p>  <p>  Louth County Council carries out regular water sampling.  Drinking water sample results for 2014 are compliant with drinking water regulations.  However, with so much diesel sludge being dumped without thought or concern for local people, there is a grave danger that drinking water could be contaminated.  It is unacceptable that the countryside is being damaged in a way that has become acceptable.  Tackling the problem of diesel laundering is challenging and costly, but I am committed to continuing to work to address the issue.  Diesel launderers are using the countryside of County Louth as a dumping ground and this must stop.<\/p>  <p>  Following the enactment of legislation and the introduction of various environmental protection measures, including the introduction of the ban on smoky coal and a solid fuel carbon tax, there has been a major improvement in Ireland's environmental record.  Many of these measures flow from Ireland's obligations as an EU member state.  This Bill brings together a number of legislative amendments to update-reinstate the fixed payment notice charge provisions for certain offences, including under the 2012 fuel regulations and the Waste Management Act 1996, and extends the period within which a declaration of non-use may be made in respect of a new motor vehicle and on the transfer of ownership of a vehicle.  It also extends the scope of activity for which the Environmental Protection Agency may charge a fee under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 and corrects a number of typographical errors in the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will give effect to a number of waste policy commitments contained in the programme for Government and implement the advice of the Office of the Attorney General on the use of fixed payment notices for environmental offences.<\/p><p>The EPA's national waste report 2011 states that Ireland is meeting most of its EU obligations and targets in respect of wastewater management.  However, some areas need to be improved.  With the exception of targets under the end of life vehicle directive, Ireland is achieving its common EU obligations across a broad range of waste legislation.  This includes packaging, electrical waste and electronic equipment and batteries.  Some targets remain at risk, including end of life vehicles, batteries, and biodegradable municipal waste from landfill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800034#HH00600","speaker":"1068","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424270400,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their contributions.

I will provide a detailed explanation of the provisions of the Bill but first I want to highlight the background and main aims of this legislation.  The Bill has two main aims.  First, it will underpin the central role of the Teaching Council in the forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements for registered teachers.  Second, it will put in place a meaningful fitness to teach process, to be operated by the Teaching Council.  The existing Garda vetting arrangements for the schools sector operate on a non-statutory basis and have been in place for new employees since 2006.  Under these existing vetting arrangements, the Teaching Council is the registered organisation that liaises with the Garda central vetting unit for the vetting of teachers.  It acts as a conduit for about 3,500 individual recognised schools and education and training boards, ETBs, that employ registered teachers.  The Teaching Council plays a vital part in the State&rsquo;s overall child protection infrastructure for schools.  It is the body that has the capacity to ensure that any person that is not suitable to teach will not be registered as a teacher. <\/p>  <p>  The Bill will underpin and strengthen this capacity and, in doing so, will ensure, in tandem with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012, that the vetting of all registered teachers on an ongoing basis will be provided for and carried out on a statutory basis.  The Bill, which is intended to be aligned with the National Vetting Bureau Act, will also make it more efficient for schools to meet the vetting requirements of the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012 when it is commenced.  The provisions in the Bill will help improve the workability of the vetting arrangements for schools and ETBs.  It will enable them to receive vetting disclosures in a streamlined, secure and timely manner through the Teaching Council&rsquo;s electronic register of teachers.<\/p><p>The number of teachers vetted under the non-statutory arrangements continues to steadily increase, with about 54,000 of the 90,000 teachers on the Teaching Council register now vetted.  The remaining 36,000 who have not yet been vetted are typically permanent teachers who have been in the same school since prior to the introduction of vetting in 2006.  I think we can all agree how important it is to ensure that such teachers are vetted under the forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements.  The statutory arrangements will include a check for both criminal offences and also any relevant soft information and, when this Bill is enacted, there will a clear statutory basis for the Teaching Council to require such teachers to undergo vetting and for it to deal with any adverse vetting disclosure that might be received.  The Teaching Council and I are mindful of the need to ensure that all registered teachers are vetted.  I have asked the council to prioritise this work in the year after enactment of the legislation.  Importantly, this Bill provides that renewal of a teacher's registration will be linked to compliance with the Bill's vetting requirements.  It also ensures that there will be a robust statutory basis for the Teaching Council to consider in the case of any teacher who is the subject of an adverse vetting disclosure as to whether the teacher's registration should be renewed.<br\/><br\/>The Bill will prepare the ground for the commencement, for the first time, of fitness to practice procedures for the teaching profession.  This is a key part of any professional regulatory system.  The enhanced measures now being put in place will help to ensure that high quality standards of teaching can be upheld by the council through the operation of fair, robust and effective fitness to teach processes.  The Bill makes provision for a number of changes to the fitness to teach provisions of the Teaching Council Act, before their commencement, so that the Teaching Council can undertake this important regulatory role in an effective manner and to update the fitness to teach provisions to take account of the new statutory vetting arrangements.  The purpose of the council's fitness to teach role is to uphold standards and protect children.  Robust procedures which are transparent and fair will underpin the council's work.  When these provisions are commenced, any person, including members of the public, employers, other teachers or the Teaching Council itself will be able to make a complaint about a registered teacher.  Issues of sufficient gravity will result in an inquiry.  The council will have the capacity to remove a teacher from the register where it deems the person unfit to teach, including where this is for child protection reasons.  The Bill will improve the capacity of the Teaching Council to deal with complaints which indicate a risk of harm to a child or vulnerable adult by empowering it to seek a vetting disclosure in respect of the teacher concerned as part of a fitness to teach inquiry.<br\/><br\/>It is important to bear in mind that the fitness to teach function will also serve to identify areas where teachers can take action to address underperformance or conduct issues.  These processes will not displace the existing disciplinary procedures available to employers at school level.  Such procedures will normally be completed before the Teaching Council conducts an inquiry and in many cases it would be expected that the matter is resolved at school level.  I intend to commence the fitness to teach provisions at the earliest opportunity after the enactment of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>The Bill contains 23 sections which aim to provide a clear statutory basis for the role of the Teaching Council, which I will now outline in more detail.  Section 1 defines the principal Act as meaning the Teaching Council Act 2001.  Section 2 inserts into the principal Act interpretations for a number of terms used in the Bill.  <br\/><br\/>Section 3 amends the functions of the council to provide that, in addition to the functions specified in the principle Act, it will be a function of the Teaching Council to obtain or receive vetting disclosures for the purposes set out in the Bill for the purpose of its role as a relevant organisation as defined in the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012 or for the purpose of its role as a relevant organisation representing another relevant organisation under the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012.  This provision makes clear that the council may seek vetting disclosures for the purposes of the registration and fitness to teach provisions of the Bill and ensures that its role as a conduit for schools and ETBs in the forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements is given statutory underpinning.  Section 3 also amends the functions to provide that the council shall, in the performance of its functions under that Act, have regard to the need to protect children and vulnerable adults.<br\/><br\/>In light of recent institutional changes, section 4 amends section 8 of the principle Act to update the bodies providing primary and post primary initial teacher education which nominate persons for appointment to the council.  Section 5 provides that the information to be entered in the register in respect of a registered teacher as prescribed by the council shall, in addition to existing information, include whether the registration is subject to any conditions set at initial registration or at renewal of registration; and the information disclosed by the most recent vetting disclosure in the possession of the council in respect of the person.  This amendment will enable the Teaching Council to provide a streamlined mechanism to enable a school employer to access the vetting disclosure electronically in respect of a teacher it intends to employ.  This approach facilitates a centralised and accessible mechanism for schools and ETB employers to receive disclosures for teachers via the register and in compliance with the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012.  It is important to note that records held electronically by the Teaching Council will not be accessible other than to an employer for the purposes of obtaining a disclosure under the National Vetting Bureau Act and in such circumstances only with the consent and knowledge of the teacher in question and in compliance with data protection legislation.  Section 5 also clarifies that the existing provisions of the Act which relate to publishing the register, making it available for inspection and providing for a copy of an entry or extract to be made available on request are subject to any enactment or rule of law which would prohibit the disclosure of such information.<br\/><br\/>Section 6 updates section 30 of the 2001 Act.  The existing Section 30 provides that a person employed as a teacher in a recognised school shall not be remunerated out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas where the person is not a registered teacher or where the person is removed or suspended from the register.  Section 6 substitutes the existing section 30 of the Act and updates the existing wording to cross reference an amendment made to the Education Act 1998 under the Education (Amendment) Act 2012 to make provision for the employment, in certain exceptional and limited circumstances, of persons who are not registered teachers; and amendments being made under this Bill to sections 44 and 47 of the principal Act, which I will outline later on. <br\/><br\/>Section 7 amends section 31 of the 2001 Act to make it mandatory for the Teaching Council to obtain and consider a vetting disclosure before initially putting a teacher on the register.This is already the practice of the Teaching Council on an administrative basis since Garda vetting was introduced in September 2006.  The Bill makes statutory provision for vetting disclosures from the bureau to be assessed for all new applicants for registration.  It provides for the council to consider a vetting disclosure in order to determine if a person is a fit and proper person to be admitted to the register and that the council shall refuse registration where the person has not consented to vetting or where the council, in accordance with this section, is not satisfied that the person is a fit and proper person to be registered.  It also provides for a revised text in regard to the powers of the Teaching Council to make regulations in respect of initial registration.  This section also makes some technical amendments to the existing provisions which provide for the council to refuse to register a person where the person stands removed or suspended from the register and for the council to register a person with conditions.<br\/><br\/>Section 8 makes provision for transitional arrangements to deal with applications for registration that were received prior to the coming into operation of section 7.  Section 9 places a requirement on a person to provide his or her consent to vetting at initial registration or where he or she is requested by the council to do so for the purposes of renewal of his or her registration.  Section 10 provides that where a teacher&rsquo;s initial registration is subject to conditions that have been applied by the High Court following an appeal, the teacher shall be removed from the register where he or she fails to comply with any of those conditions. <br\/><br\/>Section 11 amends section 33 of the principal Act to provide for revised text in regard to the powers of the Teaching Council to make regulations for the purpose of renewal of registration which shall, <i>inter alia<\/i>, provide for the form and manner of an application for renewal of registration and the documentary and other evidence that the council may seek to enable it to satisfy itself that a person is a fit and proper person to have his or her registration renewed.  This section also makes provision for retrospective vetting and re-vetting arrangements for registered teachers in the context of renewal of their registration.  It is aimed at ensuring that all registered teachers who have never been vetted are vetted and that provision is made for periodic re-vetting of registered teachers on an ongoing basis.  It is not intended that all 90,000 registered teachers will be vetted on each annual renewal of registration.<br\/><br\/>The section allows the council to plan and undertake such vetting in a structured and phased manner and  sets out what the council will have regard to when considering whether to seek a vetting disclosure  in respect of a teacher for renewal of his or her registration.  In that regard the section will enable the council to prioritise the vetting of those teachers who were never vetted under the non-statutory arrangements, to subsequently address those who have been vetted under the existing non-statutory arrangements but who have not been vetted under the new statutory vetting arrangements and to provide thereafter for periodic re-vetting of all registered teachers to be undertaken on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>It also makes provision for the Teaching Council to notify a teacher in good time where it intends to seek a vetting disclosure as part of renewal.  <br\/><br\/>The section outlines when the Teaching Council shall refuse to renew a person's registration such as where a teacher has failed to comply with a vetting request within the required timeframe and it has not been in a position to determine if he or she is a fit and proper person to have his or her registration renewed.  The section also provides that a teacher may, within 21 days, apply to the High Court for an annulment of a decision by the Teaching Council to refuse to renew his or her registration or renew it subject to conditions.  The amendment will bring the renewal stage of the registration process into line with other stages of registration where such an appeals mechanism is already in place such as initial registration stage or removal from the register following an inquiry under the fitness to teach procedures.<br\/><br\/>Section 12 is a technical amendment to provide that where, prior to section 11 coming into operation, the period for compliance with a condition imposed during initial registration exceeded the period of the initial registration and the person's registration is subsequently renewed, such renewed registration will be subject to the original condition for any remaining outstanding period for compliance.<br\/><br\/>Section 13 amends section 34 of the 2001 Act which prescribes a notice period of one month following the expiry of a teacher's registration to be provided for a teacher who fails to apply for renewal and for that teacher to be removed from the register at the end of that month unless he or she has applied for renewal and paid the relevant renewal fee to the Teaching Council within that one month period.  Section 13 of the Bill amends section 34 of the Act to provide that, in the case of a teacher who is required to comply with a vetting requirement at renewal of registration stage, the notice period provision will apply only where he or she has complied with these vetting requirements.  The existing section 34 also requires that where an application has been made for a fitness to teach inquiry under Part 5 of the Act and the relevant person fails to apply for renewal of registration, he or she shall not be removed from the register until such time as that inquiry is completed.  This provision, with a number of others, is also being amended to be consistent with changes being made to the wording of Part 5.  These include changing the word &quot;application&quot; to &quot;complaint&quot; and &quot;applicant&quot; to &quot;complainant&quot; and making specific reference to the various provisions of Part 5 under which a fitness to teach process can reach conclusion.  Similarly, section 14 simply amends the wording of section 35 to be consistent with other changes being made to wording and to make specific reference to the various provisions of Part 5 under which a fitness to teach process can reach a conclusion.<br\/><br\/>Section 15 of the Bill amends section 42 of the 2001 Act which sets out the procedures for dealing with complaints against teachers and the role and processes to be followed by the director and the investigating committee in respect of such complaints.  Section 15 of the Bill is necessarily detailed so as to set out clearly the powers and procedures applicable at the preliminary stages in the fitness to teach process, including in relation to the treatment of vetting disclosures.  It amends section 42 of the Act to outline a range of matters which may be the subject of a complaint against a teacher such as contravention of education legislation, professional misconduct, poor professional performance, conduct contrary to the code of professional conduct for teachers, erroneous or fraudulent registration, medical unfitness, or convictions for an offence triable on indictment.  Under this section, the Teaching Council may make a complaint in relation to a registered teacher on the grounds that the information disclosed in a vetting disclosure which has been received by the council in its conduit role for schools and ETBs is of such a nature as to reasonably give rise to a <i>bona fide<\/i>concern that the teacher may harm or attempt to harm any child or vulnerable person, cause any child or vulnerable person to be harmed, put any child or vulnerable person at risk of harm or incite another person to harm any child or vulnerable person.<br\/><br\/>Section 15 of the Bill also provides that, where the investigating committee decides to hold an inquiry and the nature of the complaint raises a<i>bona fide<\/i>concern of harm, the committee shall request the Teaching Council to apply to the National Vetting Bureau for a vetting disclosure in respect of the teacher for the purposes of considering the conduct alleged in the complaint.  Where the investigating committee receives a vetting disclosure, the teacher concerned shall be provided with a copy of the disclosure and invited to make submissions.  Provision is also made for the employer, where the employer is known to the Teaching Council, to be informed as soon as possible where, on foot of a complaint, there is a <i>bona fide<\/i>concern that the teacher may harm or attempt to harm any child or vulnerable person, cause any child or vulnerable person to be harmed, put any child or vulnerable person at risk of harm or incite another person to harm any child or vulnerable person.<br\/><br\/>The section also outlines the areas of complaint which can be considered following the coming into operation of this Part of the Bill, notwithstanding that the conduct in question occurred prior to its coming into operation.  It also makes clear what information and documents the investigating committee may require or request from relevant parties, including the complainant, teacher, school or schools where the teacher is or was employed and-or other parties.  The section introduces a threshold to be reached before the investigating committee will refer a case to the next stage of the process.  That threshold is reached before further action can take place and the investigating committee must be of the opinion that there is a <i>prima facie<\/i>case.  This will ensure only those cases which merit a disciplinary inquiry and hearing will be progressed to that stage.  <br\/><br\/>Section 15 also includes a definition of &quot;document&quot; to ensure digital documents or photographs, for example, can be sought by the investigating committee.<br\/><br\/>Section 16 of the Bill amends section 43 of the 2001 Act which deals with inquiries of the disciplinary committee following referral of a complaint by the investigating committee.  Section 16 of the Bill amends section 43 of the Act to outline the steps to be taken by the disciplinary committee and its panels, including the matters to be specified in inquiry reports.  These matters are the nature of the complaint, the evidence laid before the panel, the panel's findings, the relevance of the findings to fitness to teach where the complaint related to a conviction and any other matter the panel considers appropriate.  Where the inquiry is conducted into a complaint made by the Teaching Council on foot of information in a vetting disclosure it received pursuant to its conduit role for a school or ETB employer and the panel, having regard to the protection of children and vulnerable persons, is satisfied that there is a risk that the person may harm or attempt to harm any child or vulnerable person, cause any child or vulnerable person to be harmed, put any child or vulnerable person at risk of harm or incite another person to harm any child or vulnerable person, such panel's report must specify the nature of the information disclosed in the vetting disclosure, the evidence laid before the panel and its assessment of and conclusion in respect of the risk involved.  The Bill also makes provision for the panel to dismiss a complaint where it makes no finding against the teacher.<br\/><br\/>Section 17 of the Bill amends section 44 of the 2001 Act to add a new sanction to the range of sanctions already provided for and which include removal or suspension from the register or retention subject to conditions.  The new sanction is framed in the following terms: to advise, admonish, or censure the registered teacher in writing.  Section 17 outlines that an adverse decision of the disciplinary committee, other than a decision to advise, admonish or censure in writing, may be appealed to the High Court.  It also provides for references to the Supreme Court to be replaced with references to the Court of Appeal and that, where following an appeal to the High Court, a teacher is suspended or removed from the register and leave is granted to appeal to the Court of Appeal, the relevant court, shall, where the teacher is employed as a teacher in a recognised school, make a direction as to whether the teacher shall continue to be paid pursuant to his or her contract of employment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  <br\/><br\/>Section 18 of the Bill amends section 45 of the Act to provide that, where a registered teacher fails to comply with a condition imposed by the High Court on appeal, he or she shall be removed from the register.<br\/><br\/>Section 19 of the Bill amends section 47 of the Act to provide that the High Court, where it is has ordered that a teacher's registration be suspended, shall also, where the teacher is employed in a recognised school, make a direction on whether the teacher shall continue to be paid pursuant to his or her contract of employment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  <br\/><br\/>Section 20 of the Bill amends Schedule 3 to the 2001 Act to ensure consistency with the wording of section 42 and provide for the same definition of &quot;document&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Section 21 of the Bill provides for section 24(7)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Education Act 1998, as amended by section 6 of the Education (Amendment) Act 2012, to be amended to clarify the type of information on the registration status of teachers the Teaching Council is required under section 24 of the 1998 Act to provide for the Minister or an education and training board, including where a teacher has been removed from the register following a fitness to teach process.  <br\/><br\/>Section 22 of the Bill provides for the repeal of section 41 of the Act, reflecting some restructuring of the fitness to teach provisions to bring them more into line with more recent statutes.  <br\/><br\/>Section 23 provides for the Short Title, the collective citation of the Teaching Council Acts and the Education Acts and standard provisions relating to commencement.<br\/><br\/>During the passage of the Bill I intend to introduce an amendment to provide for fitness to teach hearings to be held in public as the default position, while providing for exceptions, where necessary, to protect the rights of individuals.  My officials will consult the Teaching Council on the factors to be considered in such cases.  This will ensure the new fitness to teach framework will mirror best practice in disciplinary hearings for other professional bodies.<\/p><p>The changes being brought forward will make a very significant contribution to safeguarding children in our schools and to upholding the high standards of teaching that students and society expect and deserve.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800035#JJ01200","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424272200,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Broadly, we will support the passage of the Bill and welcome its introduction into the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been calling on the Minister to address the inadequate Garda vetting of new and existing teachers in our schools for a long time and we welcome the mandatory vetting procedures provided for in the legislation.  We also call on the Minister to follow through on the provisions by ensuring Garda vetting for new and existing teachers is treated as a priority, expedited and properly resourced.  The Teaching Council and Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, have certain reservations about the fitness to practice elements of the Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to addressing these concerns where possible through amendments and proper debate of the Bill.  These concerns were addressed when changes were made to the fitness to practice hearings of other professions in the last few years.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill has two main aims.  It underpins the role of the Teaching Council in the forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements for registered teachers and it amends the Teaching Council Act 2001 and Education Act 1998 by strengthening the statutory provisions relating to the Teaching Council's fitness to teach function.  The Teaching Council is made up of two thirds teachers and their union representatives.  Under this legislation, the council will have the capacity to remove a teacher from its register where it deems the person unfit to teach, including where this is for child protection reasons.  The Council will also be charged with investigating underperformance or conduct issues on foot of complaints from students, parents and teachers, among others.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, the Teaching Council's role is to determine whether an individual is deemed suitable to be registered as a teacher.  The Bill provides that Garda vetting will be a mandatory part of the registration process for future candidates.  It also gives the council the power to retrospectively require the vetting of registered teachers and periodic re-vetting of registered teachers.  In deciding upon the vetting of currently registered teachers, the council will consider whether or not to vet the teacher if it has received a vetting disclosure under the non-statutory arrangements and with regard to the time elapsed since any prior Garda vetting.  This means registered teachers who have never been Garda vetted as well as those who have not been vetted in a long time are prone to being vetted by the council.  Figures from the Teaching Council last October showed that approximately 40% of its 90,000 registered teachers had yet to be Garda vetted.  Statutory vetting arrangements will, in addition to the existing check for criminal offences, also include a check for any relevant soft information.  This is referred to as specified information that leads to a bona fide belief that a person poses a threat to children or vulnerable persons.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill makes some amendments which intend to strengthen and clarify the fitness to teach provisions of the Teaching Council Act before their commencement.  It sets out a number of matters about which a complaint may be made and expands the list of parties from which evidence can be required as part of a fitness to teach inquiry.  It clarifies that conduct which raises child protection concerns and which occurred prior to the enactment of this Bill can be examined in a fitness to teach inquiry provided the conduct concerned would have constituted a criminal offence when it occurred.  It improves the capacity of the Teaching Council to deal with complaints which indicate a risk of harm to a child or vulnerable adult by empowering it to seek a vetting disclosure in respect of the teacher concerned as part of a fitness to teach inquiry.  The Bill makes it easier to remove teachers from posts with the requirement for a full finding of unfitness to teach by allowing a new sanction of \"advice, admonishment or censure\" of teachers.  Fitness hearings are scheduled to take place later this year under the auspices of the council.<\/p>  <p>  Any person, including the council, can make a complaint to the investigating committee on the grounds of a teacher's failure to comply with teaching regulations, or professional misconduct and poor professional conduct including engaging in conduct contrary to the code of professional conduct.  A complaint can also be made if a teacher's registration is based on erroneous information or disclosures, if he or she is medically unfit to teach or if he or she is convicted in the State or outside the State for an offence leading to trial on indictment if it occurred in the State.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has been calling for the implementation of mandatory Garda vetting of new teachers and the retrospective vetting of existing teachers for some time.  Therefore, we welcome the fact that the Bill broadens the complaints for professional misconduct which can be brought to the council for investigation.  However, we would like assurances from the Minister that adequate protections, appeals and redress procedures are put in place to ensure complaints that are made against teachers cannot be turned into a witch-hunt against certain teachers.  It is the Minister's intention to seek amendments at a further Stage of the Bill, to include a provision that hearings of the investigation committee into complaints made against teachers will be held in public as the default position.  The announcement has drawn a negative reaction from teacher unions and teaching staff.  The council has advised the Minister that the decision on whether hearings should be made in public or in private should be made on a case-by-case basis, rather than being held in public as the default position.  It justified this advice on the basis that Ireland is a small place and the fact that a teacher is up before a panel will be widely known with the potential for an impact on their reputation even if no finding is made against them.  The TUI has said it would be extremely unfair if teachers were brought before public hearings, except in cases of serious misconduct.  It seems a more reasonable position that the decision over whether hearings should be held in public or private should be taken, with a full knowledge of the facts on the ground, on a case-by-case basis by the council, rather than as a default position.<\/p>  <p>  Some 40% of teaching staff have not been Garda vetted.  Delays in the implementation of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 have created a loophole in the system, which is effectively allowing teachers to work in schools without being fully cleared by the authorities.  While the mandatory Garda vetting provided for in this Bill is to be welcomed as a necessary, basic step to protect students, these measures must be enforced in full and without exception.  It is worrying that the Minister has not set out a timeframe today within which all teachers are to be vetted.  Resources must be allocated to the Garda vetting unit to reduce the backlog and ensure that all teachers are cleared.  It is unacceptable that more than 36,000 teachers have gone unchecked to date.  This is a failure of the Government which must be remedied promptly.<\/p>  <p>  There is a need to highlight the exceptional job that is done by the overwhelming majority of teachers, and I know the Minister would agree.  For example, the chief inspector's report 2013 endorsed the excellent job being done by Irish teachers, with 87% of parents happy with teaching standards in Irish schools.  Against the odds, teaching standards have been upheld in the context of recent cutbacks in primary and second-level schools, including the reduction in teacher numbers and a moratorium on middle management posts.  Many of the weaknesses or slippages in standards that have been identified correspond directly to areas affected by the education cuts, including access to career guidance services and the leadership capacity of schools.  Unfortunately, the Minister has not done enough to support teachers and management in schools in their efforts to keep up the quality teaching standards.  Even yesterday's proposed changes to small school teacher numbers do not go far enough and it is little more than tokenism for the many schools which have already suffered cuts over the past two or three years and whose teacher numbers will not be restored as a result.<\/p>  <p>  While these changes are a small improvement, nothing less than a full reversal of the damaging measures imposed by the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, is required.  While the new policy announced yesterday acknowledges the scale of the cuts to which small schools have been subjected, it is no more than optics in that it does not reflect the reality on the ground.  Population increases have resulted in an increase in enrolment figures and it is incumbent on the Minister to ensure schools are equipped to cater for these growing pupil numbers.  In her statement yesterday she did not reflect this or make any move to address it.<\/p><p>Despite these new retention thresholds, schools which have increased their student numbers from 52 to 55 will not be entitled to a third teacher, while a school where pupil numbers have dropped from 56 to 53 will retain a teacher.  This is unfair and inequitable and should be reviewed.  In this instance both schools should be entitled to a third teacher.  Similarly, a school that has gone from 82 to 85 pupils this year will not be allocated a fourth teacher whereas a school that has seen a drop from 86 to 83 students will retain its fourth teacher.<\/p> <p> While we welcome the Bill, which has many technical aspects, it needs to be reflected in real actions which will improve the lot and situation of teachers on the ground and better equip them to play their role.  Oversight is a key part of the responsibilities of the Minister and the Department.  It is crucial that we have appropriate vetting procedures in place and that we move promptly to a situation where all teachers are vetted.  It is also appropriate and necessary that there is correct oversight of fitness to practise and quality.  It is also important to ensure there are sufficient teachers to provide a quality education service.  The Government has made it very difficult for teachers in the 50% of primary schools that have fewer than five teachers to provide the service they would like to.  That has led to real pinch points and higher class sizes in many of those schools.<\/p> <p> I urge the Minister to go the full way.  She has finally acknowledged that the Government&rsquo;s policy is putting real pressure on the schools in her small row back yesterday.  Nothing less than a full row back is required to provide for the appropriate number of teachers for schools with growing numbers of pupils.  The Minister knows better than anyone that there is a bulge in the population moving through schools.  The number of schools with increasing pupil numbers and in need of additional teachers outweigh those losing pupils and which face losing teachers.  The Minister&rsquo;s move yesterday would help address this situation in the 30 schools due to lose a teacher next September.  That will not in any way affect those who have already lost teachers or those who should have gained teachers if the Minister had not increased the threshold of students. <\/p> <p> I urge the Minister alongside the Bill, considering her announcement yesterday, to go the full hog.  I welcome her announcement that she will publish the value for money report after the Government has sat on it for over two years.  I note that finally the Minister seems to have concluded she will not go ahead with the recommendations contained therein.  That comes after much damage has been done to the school system by measures the Government has introduced in the past three years and which she indicated will not be reversed between now and the next general election.  I look forward to a comprehensive debate on that report when it is published next week.  I also look forward to the debate on the next Stages of this Bill and its passage through the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800038#MM00200","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424272800,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I apologise to the Minister for missing the beginning of her contribution, but I will get a copy of her speech.  We welcome the opportunity to discuss the Bill which we will support.  There is a major amendment to be tabled on Committee Stage, which the Minister has outlined, on public hearings being the default position.  We have not seen the wording of the amendment but we support all the other provisions of the Bill and look forward to the publication of the amendment and to debating its merits.  We have some concerns about it.<br\/><br\/>The Minister and Deputy Charlie McConalogue have outlined the two main purposes of the Bill, to provide a statutory basis for the teaching council in the vetting of registered teachers and to act as a conduit for schools that need to obtain those vetting disclosures, and to strengthen the statutory provisions relating to the Teaching Council&rsquo;s fitness to teach function.  It is a technical Bill.  The research paper provided by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service is excellent.  It goes through each section of the Bill outlining what it proposes in detail and the consequences for the previous legislation.  It is well worth reading for any Member who has an interest in this.  It also outlines issues that might arise from the proposals.<br\/><br\/>We fully support the vetting of teachers.  The latest figures are from November 2014 when there were over 90,000 teachers registered with the Teaching Council and almost 54,000 of them have been vetted.  Approximately 40% remain unvetted.  Many of those are teachers who had been teaching for many years before the vetting laws and procedures came into place.  There would have been no need for vetting procedures.  The provision in the Bill to ensure that teachers who have not been vetted may now be vetted on an ongoing basis is welcome.  We should strive to achieve a position where everyone who teaches in schools is vetted. <br\/><br\/>This Bill deals specifically with teachers and will not cover other members of school staff such as special needs assistants, SNAs.  I know from responses to parliamentary questions we have put down about the number of SNAs who have Garda vetting that the Department does not hold that information.  We should try to rectify this.  I know it cannot be done in the confines of this Bill, but we should have that type of information particularly when dealing with people who have access to children in classrooms.<br\/><br\/>Section 15 of the Bill amends section 42 of the principal Act to provide: <blockquote>&ldquo;(1) A person (including the Council) may make a complaint to the Investigating Committee in relation to a registered teacher, and the Committee may consider the complaint, where that complaint concerns any of the following matters . . . &quot;<\/blockquote>It lists these matters, one of which is: <blockquote>(g) that he or she has been convicted in the State of an offence triable on indictment or convicted outside the State of an offence consisting of acts or omissions that, if done or made in the State, would constitute an offence triable on indictment.<\/blockquote>There are several people with my political ideology and background who were involved in conflict in the past 30 years.  I refer to them as political prisoners.  Under this legislation somebody may make a complaint to the investigating committee if that person is a teacher and has been convicted of a political offence.  We need to ensure people who have served their time, having been involved in political conflict, find themselves open to investigation on the basis of a complaint by a member of the public.  I am not saying they should not be open to investigation but that people cannot make complaints on the basis of somebody&rsquo;s past political affiliations and activities.<\/p><p> On the issue of soft information, Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports its use, particularly in respect of vetting procedures for those who are dealing with children and vulnerable adults.  The briefing material provided by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service notes that section 5 of the Bill deals with the register and the information that will be contained therein.  The briefing note provides a list of all the information to be included such as the name and address of the correspondence, the date of birth, qualifications and so forth.  The last item will be the information disclosed by the most recent vetting disclosure in the council's possession in respect of that person.  I imagine this item would include any soft information that had been provided as part of the vetting disclosure.  However, on publication of the register, it states the Teaching Council may withhold some information to ensure and protect the privacy of persons entered on the register.  I ask the Minister to confirm, when she wraps up this debate or perhaps even on Committee Stage, that such soft information would be the type of information the Teaching Council could withhold when it publishes the register.  I believe it also is important to protect the privacy of teachers and to ensure that any information that is brought forward but which does not constitute a criminal offence is not included in the register.<\/p> <p> While I have covered most issues, the final point I wish to raise concerns the amendment the Minister intends to bring forward.  There has been much media speculation on whether there should be public or private hearings.  I acknowledge that public hearings are held in Scotland and Wales and that one reason the Minister has cited is to bring it into line with best practices in other areas, such as in the Medical Council, for instance, which has public hearings.  Reservations have been expressed by some teaching unions with a view to ensuring that due process is given to teachers who are being investigated and this must be taken on board.  I acknowledge, having touched base with the Sinn F&eacute;in Minister for Education in the Six Counties, that they currently are considering legislation that would make public hearings the default position there as well.  While I am not fundamentally opposed to it, one must be careful that where it is being used - if it is being used - it should be in exceptional circumstances.  I understand the Teaching Council has proposed the establishment of a sub-committee to examine which cases could or should be made public.  I do not know whether this will be incorporated into the Minister's amendment, which is why I stated at the outset that while Sinn F&eacute;in broadly supports the Bill, it must await publication of this amendment to ascertain whether there will be public hearings on a wide scale or whether it will be done on a case-by-case basis.  I would prefer the latter because it is important that due process be given to teachers.  While it may be something of a clich&eacute;, this is a small State and if it enters the public domain that a teacher has been investigated, even if such a teacher is vindicated, he or she unfortunately sometimes still will be victimised because he or she was under investigation in the first place.  This may be the case even though the allegations have been found to have been unfounded and the teacher has been deemed fit and proper to teach.  A balancing act must be performed in that regard and I look forward to the publication of the aforementioned amendment.<\/p> <p> I reiterate that Sinn F&eacute;in broadly will be supporting the legislation and looks forward to it being debated on Committee Stage, where Members can delve into each individual section in greater detail.  Sinn F&eacute;in may table one or two amendments, particularly in respect of the issue to which I referred in section 15 regarding ex-political prisoners.  While what is proposed in theory is good, the purpose will be to ensure that in practice, it does not discriminate against some members of the teaching profession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800039#NN00200","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424273400,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Finian McGrath is sharing time with Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan, Ruth Coppinger and Michael Fitzmaurice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800040#OO00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1424273400,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak about the Teaching Council (Amendment) Bill 2015.  I welcome both the Bill and this particular debate, as it is an opportunity to plan ahead, reform the education system and ensure that Ireland has educational standards of top quality and, through this Bill, top-class professional quality teachers.  One should never forget this point in respect of the broader issue of education.  There are many high quality and top-class professional teachers in the Irish National Teachers Organisation, the Teachers Union of Ireland and the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland.  They are valuable people to the State and, in particular, they also are a valuable asset to broader society.  Many make huge contributions in education, as well as in the arts, sports and broader community matters.  It is important to acknowledge this point, particularly in respect of this Teaching Council (Amendment) Bill.  One must also focus on quality standards and the true professionalism of teachers.  I will use this opportunity to commend many of those teachers, particularly those class teachers who work in disadvantaged schools.  Many of them face huge problems in respect of education and social and economic disadvantage yet are doing a magnificent job, many times against the odds.  It is up to all Members of the House, not simply the Government, to support these teachers because they can make an impact on the development of children, particularly from the age of four to the age of 13 when they leave the primary cycle.  This also is a matter on which Members must focus.  In addition, they should not be afraid to look at the faults and weaknesses of some of the practices that go on in the schools and the educational service.  It also is important to commend and thank the many principals who work in such disadvantaged schools because on top of being principals and prime educators, they also operate as social workers and work in many other administrative areas.  Their job is extremely difficult, particularly in modern society, and many pressures are placed on them by both the Department and wider society.  They are and wish to be accountable to people but one must also ensure they are supported.  I raise these two issues in respect of the aforementioned Bill and will develop the link further later.<\/p>  <p>  I also commend and thank all those teachers who work with children with special needs in both primary and second level education.  That is why I was particularly disappointed a few days ago when I learned that the Minister's plans to reform the allocation of resources for special educational needs had been shelved for this year, despite concerns about the unfairness associated with the current system.  In recent days, the Minister has stated she did not plan to change the system next September as originally had been proposed.  Many people were looking forward to the implementation of those changes for the new children coming into the system next September.  I believe the reason given was that the National Council for Special Education advised that sufficient time should be allowed for further consultation with the educational stakeholders.  While I am disappointed by this, I also suggest that if further involvement with stakeholders is envisaged, the Minister should include parents, as well as parents of children with special needs, who are feeling very excluded.  I do not wish to see more families going down to the law courts to secure their rights, services and resources.<\/p>  <p>  The position at present is that the Minister's own Department has specifically pointed out that children in wealthier areas get more special education teaching resources than do children in disadvantaged areas.  The Department of Education and Skills itself drew up a report that found that children in more affluent parts of the city were receiving more special education teaching resource hours than were children in poor disadvantaged areas.  The reason for this discrepancy in provision in respect of middle income or middle-class schools is that psychological assessments were paid for privately by parents and then those assessments were fed into the public education system.  These assessments are used to determine the resource hours and staffing allocated to a school.  My point is that parents who can afford between &euro;400 and &euro;600 to have an education assessment carried out in private are at a major advantage over those parents who cannot.  In the case of any Government, country or society, all children should have equal access to educational resources irrespective of their parents' wealth.<\/p><p> The Bill caters for two main overarching aims, namely, to underpin the central role of the Teaching Council in the statutory Garda vetting arrangements for teachers, as set out in the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, as well as to amend and strengthen the statutory provisions of the Teaching Council Act 2001 relating to the Teaching Council&rsquo;s fitness to teach function.  It is important that teachers are vetted under the forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements which will include a check for criminal offences, as well as any relevant soft information, an important new element of the vetting procedures.  I support these sensible provisions.  Historically, people with major dysfunctional issues with children emerged in the education system and were an abuse threat to children.  We must be focused in ensuring children in primary schools are protected from abuse.  It is also important to ensure those teachers working with children with special needs are strongly vetted, as such children might not have the ability to report sexual or other types of abuse.  When the Bill is enacted, there will be a clear statutory basis for the Teaching Council to require such teachers to undergo vetting and to deal with any adverse vetting information that might be received.  Removing a teacher from the Teaching Council register is the best way of achieving child protection across all recognised schools.  I welcome this aspect of the legislation.  As well as underpinning the role of the Teaching Council, the Bill also provides the statutory basis for retrospective or periodic revetting of all registered teachers during the renewal of a registration.  It also sets out several grounds on which a complaint may be made such as professional misconduct, poor professional performance and medical unfitness.<\/p> <p> The majority of teachers are highly committed.  It is important to encourage young people to enter teaching because it is a wonderful career.  Speaking from experience, I know that there are many quality teachers who develop, evolve and nurture children in their schooling, creating great citizens for the future.  The Minister must listen to the teachers on the front line if they have a quibble or an issue; it is not about just attending the Easter conferences.  I welcome the positive aspects of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800040#OO00300","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424274000,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I had some exchanges with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, on the issue of the Teaching Council.  With many of my teaching colleagues, I have been very critical of the idea of a Teaching Council, particularly the way in which it was set up.  The first engagement we had with the Teaching Council in June 2009 was when we receiving letters threatening us that if we did not join, we would not be paid our salary for teaching.  This was long before the council had any legal right to do this.  The bullying approach in the early days certainly did not get it off to a good start with teachers.<\/p>  <p>  There were other issues of concern which certainly had teachers very sceptical.  They were issues on which the Teaching Council showed itself as being far from efficient.  A point I brought up with the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, concerned the loan of &euro;6 million the council had received to set itself up in the first place and if it would be repaid, as it had a healthy income from the yearly subscriptions teachers had to pay to it.<\/p>  <p>  As a profession, teachers are very much maligned by various sections of society which only see the long holidays and shorter hours.  Teachers are now even more maligned because of the stance they took on the junior certificate reforms.  That comes from their loyalty to their students, what they think is best for them and their belief that the current fair, transparent and open correction of junior certificate examination papers is good for their students.  Very often we do not hear about the commitment, dedication and sheer hard work of teachers at both primary and second level inside and outside the classroom.  My experience in my own school and of the many teachers I know is of the time and energy given inside and outside the school in extracurricular activities such as sports, drama, concerts, debating, competitions such as the Young Scientist, the many field trips taken and history tours.  Many of us found the clause in the Croke Park agreement on additional hours per week quite offensive, especially for those who were doing it on a voluntary basis.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge teachers' flexibility and adaptability in embracing the many changes and new initiatives introduced during the years.  There is still a demand for careers in teaching, as seen in the numbers of applications to the Central Applications Office every year.  There is also a high level of career satisfaction among teachers, unlike in other countries which are having difficulties in maintaining the status of the profession.  This is notwithstanding the much lower salary on which incoming teachers start as opposed to in other times.<\/p>  <p>  There was a major battle with the Teaching Council over the original registration fee of &euro;90.  It had to be paid, regardless of whether one was a full-time or a part-time teacher or even just going for an interview.  This figure has come down to &euro;65.  <\/p>  <p>  I have also been critical of the Teaching Council's inability to collate accurate information on teachers, its lack of accessibility to teachers and the way it interacts with teachers at times.  There have been negative engagements between the council and teachers.  A particular case I am pursuing involves a teacher taken off the register by the council which claims it had made efforts to contact him in this regard.  However, he can prove otherwise, apart from one occasion.  The first he knew he had been taken off the register was when he discovered he had been deprived of eight days' salary.  The council originally claimed that it had made efforts to contact him by e-mail and text message, but it now acknowledges it had the wrong telephone number.  Surely, with a major staff complement, it could have made a personal telephone call to identify why there was a problem with his registration.  There could have been any reason such as an illness or a bereavement.<\/p>  <p>  I am also sceptical about the Bill&rsquo;s proposal that the Teaching Council be able to determine fitness to teach.  Notwithstanding the work of the current director whom I have met and whose hard work and dynamism I recognise, the council still has to prove to teachers that the sum of &euro;65 is worth paying.  I have been struck by some quotes from teachers about the council - &ldquo;useless regulatory body&rdquo;, &ldquo;jobs for the boys and jobs for the unions&rdquo;, &ldquo;absolutely no impact on the teaching profession&rdquo; and &ldquo;expensive, pointless, self-serving bureaucracy&rdquo;.  <\/p>  <p>  There are 37 people on the Teaching Council, of whom 22 are registered teachers, six from the unions and 16 are elected.  In the 2012 council elections, in one area 7,497 ballot papers were issued but only 613 returned.  In another over 10,000 papers were issued but only 800 returned, while in another 9,939 papers were issued but only 751 returned.  This shows that the council has an awful lot more work to do to prove its worth and the benefits to teachers and before teachers will take it seriously.  The majority are not taking it seriously.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the Bill&rsquo;s intentions.  Everyone wants to protect students and ensure they have the best teachers with no issues regarding teachers&rsquo; standards, personalities or work.  I was struck, however, by the Bill&rsquo;s vagueness in certain provisions that were almost like the Salem witch trials.  For example, the council shall not register a person who applies for registration unless it has sought and received a vetting disclosure.  It also states, &ldquo;the Council shall refuse to register a person where it is not satisfied that he or she is a fit and proper person to be admitted&rdquo; and &ldquo;any other requirements to be met for renewal of registration which may include requirements relating to completion of programmes of continuing education and training\".  Teachers are consistently and continually involved in training programmes, many at their own expense and in their own time.  I do not believe this is acknowledged in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  In spite of all my reservations about the entity that is the Teaching Council, I do hope what is being proposed in the legislation is in the best interests of students and their teachers.<\/p><p>I do not think the Bill is going to add to a person being a good teacher.  There are also questions around whether there are enough resources for Garda vetting to be carried out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800041#PP00200","speaker":"1005","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424274600,"counter":386,"content":"<p>As a former secondary teacher, I, too, share a huge amount of the reservations about the Teaching Council.  It was set up in 2001 as a professional standards body for teaching and to promote and regulate the profession.  What has it actually done to defend teachers?  What has it actually done to take on some of the key questions facing teachers?  I argue it has done very little.<br\/><br\/>The view of teachers on the ground, as the previous speaker said, is that it is a quango.  Teachers do not understand why they had to pay &euro;90 up until last year to click a button on a computer to renew their teaching certificates.  Certainly, the first time a teacher registers, anyone can understand that she or he must pay a fee for the processing and checking of all of the requirements, but to pay &euro;90 to the Teaching Council every year was completely wrong.  Suddenly, after many complaints, the council was able to reduce the fee to &euro;60 last year, so why were they not able to do that in previous years?<br\/><br\/>The biggest crisis in teaching right now - I ask if the Minister agrees - is not poorly performing teachers.  It is that one in four secondary teachers in this country does not have a permanent job or full teaching hours, and half of them have to work in Lidl and McDonald's at the weekend.  This has been told to the Minister and the Teaching Council for several years.  Compare the figures for Ireland where, in second level schools, only 73% of teachers have a permanent position, with those for Norway, where it is 90%.  For under-30s it is much worse, as 52% have a contract of a year or less, which is more than half of secondary teachers under 30.  When Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn was Minister, it was reported in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>at the teachers' conferences, that a number of teachers were going to Lidl, filling stations and McDonald's to supplement their incomes to survive.  What is being done about this?  Certainly nothing by the Teaching Council.  There is not a mention of it to be seen on its website.  Now here it is, seemingly more concerned with sacking teachers than actually defending teaching.<br\/><br\/>The Bill is not known about.  I rang a number of teachers today and checked the union websites.  There is no discussion or mention of it.  People do not know about it.  I would like to deal with some of the issues that it raises.  Fitness to practice hearings are to be made public and there is to be an expansion of the grounds for a teacher to be hauled in front of one of these investigating committees.  Will the Minister justify and explain why something like that has to be done in public?  Is it to feed the tabloid media and an anti-teacher sentiment that is clearly evident?  Is it to distract attention from the serious cuts that have taken place in education and the pressures teachers are under?  I think it is.<br\/><br\/>Why is it beneficial that somebody who is medically unfit to teach would be hauled up in front of a public investigation?  I do not think something like that is beneficial to somebody in that position.  If somebody is clearly medically unfit to teach, that can be dealt with by a body.  I do not think the media have to be there outside to cover it.  In the United Kingdom, for example, there was a doctor suffering from depression and it was deemed he would be a suicide risk if he was called in front of one of these public hearings.  He asked voluntarily to withdraw his own name from the medical register, and the medical council refused.  They said, &quot;no, we must carry things out in public.&quot;  Why is that beneficial?  Are there any public hearings of bankers?  For most employees in this country, there are internal investigative procedures, for example in the banking sector, the insurance sector and so on.  It only seems really to apply to doctors, nurses and now teachers, who are already under a lot of stress and strain.<br\/><br\/>This has nothing to do with child welfare.  Nobody is saying anyone who is a danger to children should be teaching or should not be in front of an investigative committee.  I ask, though, how effective is vetting?  Is it likely that we are going to find a whole load of paedophiles or people who are a danger to children through the vetting procedures we currently have?  No, it is not.  It is not a key problem in teaching.  There is no evidence that it is a major problem.<br\/><br\/>What this seems to be about is making public show trials of teachers.  The tabloid media and many in the Government would like to convince the public that there is a serious crisis of under-performing teachers, but in fact, looking at the literacy and numeracy qualifications that have been attained in recent years despite the gutting of education and all of the cuts, the loss of SNAs, teachers, resource teaching and English back-up teachers the standards have actually increased.  That is because teachers have taken on board a whole lot of evidence from other countries.  There has been a lot more team teaching and more focus on key things that I saw when I was teaching in a disadvantaged, DEIS area.  Huge strides were made and there was constant updating of teaching methods.<br\/><br\/>There are enough things, including drive-by inspections in force.  What other profession has drive-by inspections?  At any moment, an inspector can come in.  The teacher might be having a bad day, might have a cold, might be dealing with discipline issues in the school etc.  An inspector comes in on top of that.  Now the Minister wants to have show trials and public hearings and the grounds for this, I challenge, have nothing to do with child welfare.  The grounds which the Minister is adding with this legislation are poor professional performance, which is not a child welfare issue, and conduct contrary to the code of professional conduct.  Obviously, the issue is not if someone has a conviction in the State or has committed an indictable offence as that person is going to be disciplined and may lose his or her job.<br\/><br\/>This seems to feeding into an anti-teacher sentiment which the Government wishes to increase right now, as it is taking on the ASTI and the TUI, which through major strikes are defending their right not to give State accreditation to their own students.  It seems to be quite convenient that the Minister is bringing this legislation forward at this time.  What is she doing about the more than one in four secondary teachers who have to work in other jobs to try to keep a roof over their heads?  She is doing absolutely nothing.  She is not increasing their wages.  As for the newly qualified teachers, NQTs, I would love to see what the Teaching Council has done to keep casualisation out of teaching and to defend the profession.  I am very disappointed and hope the unions involved with the Teaching Council rear up about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800042#QQ00200","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1424274600,"counter":387,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice who is not in the Chamber.

We know that there is wonderful work being done in smaller schools and I am glad that the Minister has responded on that issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Teaching Council director Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Ruairc said the council was responsible for the story book of teaching.  It is responsible for setting up the framework for the profession.  They do not do the doing: the teachers do the teaching and therefore it is up to teachers to fill out the details of the book in each of the chapters.<\/p>  <p>  The Teaching Council was established in March 2006 to promote teaching as a profession at primary and post-primary levels, to promote the professional development of teachers and to regulate standards in our profession.  Its major achievements to date include setting up the register, the ongoing review of teacher training programmes and piloting \"droichead\", a new model for formal induction of new teachers conducted by more experienced colleagues.  Last October, the council also launched its consultation on continuing professional development, CPD.<\/p><p>Draft guidelines are due to be published in March 2016 with the aim of supporting and developing an embedded culture of research in the profession.  I commend the Teaching Council for its work and welcome the changes the Bill will bring.  <br\/><br\/>Good teachers must have excellent communication skills, a great classroom presence, a love for children and a love for teaching and learning.  Learning is not just a passive activity on the part of children but it is about engaging children, motivating children and awakening in children a love of learning.  I know from my experience as the principal of a primary school that a mediocre teacher just tells, a good teacher explains, a superior teacher demonstrates and a really great teacher inspires.  W. B. Yeats, speaking in the Seanad, said that education was not the filling of a pail but the lighting of a fire.  Children must learn how to think and not what to think.<br\/><br\/>In the past, talk and chalk was an acceptable form of teaching - children in their seats, silence prevailing.  I quote the poem, &quot;The Village Schoolmaster&quot;:<blockquote>And still they gaz'd and still the wonder grew,<br \/><br \/>That one small head could carry all he knew. <\/blockquote>That was the school principal, or the school headmaster.<br\/><br\/>Teacher learning is vitally important and continuous career development is a prerequisite for the inspiring teacher.  We must ensure the right people qualify and, ultimately, have a long and fulfilling career in the education sector and that students receive a quality education.  Teachers must be learned, creative, motivators and counsellors and the Bill helps to ensure the right teacher qualifies, remains qualified and is passionate about his or her job.<br\/><br\/>This Bill sets out a number of ways in which a complaint can be made about professional misconduct, poor professional performance or medical unfitness.  Weak teachers need to be weeded out, just as in every other profession.  It is of the utmost importance that our children are taught in a safe, professional and nurturing environment.<br\/><br\/>To quote Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Ruairc, &quot;The greatest critic of an underperforming teacher is the teacher next door, because they&rsquo;re the one picking up the pieces.&quot;  This has been my experience as a principal.  Teaching is a very demanding job and children deserve the very best.  Children get one chance of a quality education and the performance of the adult in that pupil-teacher relationship is so important.  It is important the children before that teacher receive the very best education and that the child reaches his or her potential, whatever that might be.<br\/><br\/>This Bill also introduces the statutory vetting of registered teachers, which I welcome.  Previously, a teacher had to be vetted every time he or she moved school, which was daft and created chaos in the vetting system for the Garda and boards of management employing teachers.  The Bill takes welcomes steps and I look forward to seeing them being enacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800042#QQ00500","speaker":"1004","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424275200,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.  I will take up some of the points made by the previous contributor, Deputy Mary Mary Mitchell O'Connor.  It is important to highlight the importance of teaching and learning.  There is a huge relationship between the two.  All of us will our children to learn to the very best of their ability.  However, there are good teachers and underperforming teachers.  Make no mistake about it - learning will be affected by the quality of the teaching.<\/p>  <p>  I was a teacher for a number of years.  I have been a full-time politician for ten years so I am longer in politics than I was teaching.  Before that, I was a publican.  The greatest satisfaction I got from being a publican was that there is a way to measure one's input and output and getting a return on it.  One can check the till in one's pub to see how one has done.  If one puts on music, one might do a little better.  The same applies to politics in that I can work that bit harder to get those few extra votes.  Every five years, or sometimes more often, one gets the opportunity to put oneself to the test.<\/p>  <p>  In teaching, there is a very monotone existence.  I found it very frustrating - perhaps it is my genetic make-up - because it was very hard to quantify one's efforts.  If I worked very hard one year but did nothing the following one, the cheque - it is not about money - was exactly the same as were the rewards on every level.  I found that quenched the desire in me to perform as best I could.  I am a very competitive person by nature - I am sure some of my colleagues might attest to this - but in teaching, it is difficult to give it one's all because it is very hard to measure the inputs and the outputs and, by extension, measuring how much satisfaction one gets from the job is always difficult.<\/p>  <p>  There is a reality which must be faced.  This Bill goes some way towards doing that, although it does not go as far as I would like.  However, it begins an interesting debate on the whole area of education and teacher dismissal.  In any walk of life, there must be an active dismissal process.  However, it is not only about dismissal; it is equally important there is a reward structure.  In my experience as a primary school teacher, regrettably, neither are in existence.  It might be slightly different at other levels but certainly at primary school level, it is very unusual to see anybody being dismissed or being rewarded for the extra input they put in.  We are all human so over time, the natural reaction is to ask oneself is why should I bother because the person alongside me is not making an effort?  We all start to down-skill a little.  I am not saying that is universal, but it would certainly be human nature.<\/p>  <p>  The current disciplinary procedure is abysmal.  One relies on the boards of management, and they have long been a hobbyhorse of mine.  Boards of management do not have the wherewithal to deal with disciplinary issues.  It is a very difficult area and it is beset with challenges if one wishes to challenge a teacher and, ultimately, if one was to try to dismiss the teacher.  The figures back up what I am saying because they are dismal.  It is a very complex area.  We must embrace that sort of change and acknowledge the failings in the system.  Again, I stress the need for the ability to dismiss teachers but also to reward good teachers, who are a wonderful feature of our education system and who we need to encourage.<\/p>  <p>  I make no bones about it but there is a very hesitant attitude towards reform of any kind in education.  It is very difficult to get people to change.  Recently, I spoke at the launch of a Teagasc advisory course.  I was reared on a farm in Drinagh in west Cork and farming today is utterly unrecognisable from the farming I remember as a young fellow.  However, when I quiz my young children in the evening about what they did at school that day, what they tell me is recognisable from the time I was at school 30 years ago.  There is a reluctance to engage and we see it across the board, whether in terms of junior certificate reform or the National Council for Special Education proposals for a new model of allocating resources for special needs education.  Straightaway, a minority of people, with vested interests and a little mix of an agenda and ignorance, start to stir the pot and put it out that it is a cut or a reduction.  I regret that is the case but as long as it is and as long we do not face up to it, unfortunately, the education system we have will be the poorer for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800043#RR00200","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speech","time":1424275200,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I join Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor in welcoming yesterday's announcement by the Minister in regard to smaller schools and changes to the pupil-teacher ratio for smaller schools which hope to keep teachers on staff.<\/p><p>It is a welcome announcement which I want to acknowledge.<\/p> <p> I welcome most of the provisions in the Teaching Council (Amendment) Bill and the underpinning of the statutory vetting arrangements, the subject of a large part of the Bill.  I was undertaking some research about the Teaching Council before I came into the Chamber and was surprised to learn that there were still so many people involved in teaching who had not yet been fully vetted, despite, in some cases, having taught for many years.  <\/p> <p> As previous speakers said, the role of teachers in society is very important.  I would not say I have a vested interest, but I was briefly an unqualified maths teacher, for the most horrific six months of my life, and I hope I will not have to return to it anytime soon.  It did, however, give me an insight into the challenges facing teachers in their day-to-day work.  Previous speakers mentioned the invaluable contribution teachers made to the lives of young people.  Outside the immediate family, they have the capacity and are in a position to influence young people more than any other category of individuals.  We can all remember from our own school days teachers who had a positive and lasting impression on our lives.  I was thinking that when I entered third level education, I mostly studied economics, having only taken up the subject in fifth year purely down to the fact that I had had an inspirational teacher who, although a socialist and holding a slightly different political outlook, had had an impact on me and my interest in that subject.  The sad reality is that for many young people today, in certain family situations, teachers have an even bigger role to play in providing stability in their lives.  That is why teaching is such an important profession.<\/p> <p> It is welcome that the Bill sets out a number of grounds on which complaints may be made such as poor professional performance, an issue mentioned by previous speakers.  Most of those involved in the teaching profession, as in most other professions, are eminently suited to the job but some are not.  The Bill, with its fitness to teach provisions, is a step in the right direction.<\/p> <p> I understand that, like any such organisation, the Teaching Council costs money, but the most common issue about the council on which I interface with teachers concerns the level of fees charged.  Teachers who qualified outside the State, in particular, can face fees of up to &euro;200, with perhaps an additional fee of &euro;100 for each post-primary subject taught.  They could, therefore, face fees of &euro;400 or &euro;500, as well as an annual charge.  That is a significant amount of money, particularly for newly qualified teachers and especially for those who had to obtain their qualifications outside the jurisdiction, thereby incurring associated costs.  Such fees are, effectively, a barrier to entry in some instances.  One can make the argument that those who work full time as teachers can earn a living from it and that such fees, in the overall scheme of things, are not significant.  However, for newly qualified teachers, particularly those who qualified outside the jurisdiction, who may be trying to pay off educational loans, it can be an unwelcome extra burden.  <\/p> <p> I also raise the issue of the change from the one-year H.Dip. course to a two-year masters qualification.  It has merit, but it must be noted that this is another significant extra cost for those who wish to qualify as teachers.  In one sense, it could be looked on as a further barrier to entry into the teaching profession.  <\/p> <p> I welcome the principal provisions of the Bill.  I welcome the fitness to teach provisions and the increased capacity of the Teaching Council to vet, such that Garda vetting can become an integral part of the teacher registration process and that all teachers will be fully vetted in the performance of their functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800043#RR00300","speaker":"966","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424275800,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for giving me the opportunity so late to contribute to the debate.  I had to attend a number of other meetings today and was not sure whether I would get an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  <\/p>  <p>  The legislation is both fundamental and very important, but there are a number of issues about which I want to raise genuine concerns, including the holding of fitness to practise hearings in public.  We must be very careful in this regard.  I know many people involved in the teaching profession which has served the country very well.  If one looks at any assessment made from the 1950s onwards, there have been issues, but there is no point in throwing the baby out with the bath water.  We must be very careful in having public floggings.  While there are grievances which must be dealt with appropriately, we should be mindful that not every complaint is authentic or one that must be discussed in public.  In other professions in which such hearings are held in public, when an allegation is made, it sticks, regardless of whether people are found innocent or guilty.  We, therefore, need to proceed with caution because teachers across the country are very concerned about the way things are going.<\/p>  <p>  Junior certificate reform is a major issue which must be dealt with in a serious way.  We must be mindful of the vast economic well-being to which the education system has led in the last while.<\/p>  <p>  I raise the issue of further education.  I am aware of the great services being provided, particularly in Mallow, which serve much of my constituency.  They provide a second chance for persons who had to leave education because of family circumstances, finances or whatever else and who benefit enormously from them.  The thinking is that this function should be offloaded from the Department of Education and Skills, the old vocational education committees and the education boards and given to SOLAS.  It is vitally important that we maintain educational links in the reforms proposed.  There are many colleges that are doing massive work in communities in encouraging people back to take courses.  I am aware of people who have been greatly empowered in taking these courses, particularly women from a difficult socioeconomic background.  That is one of the great strengths in terms of the money spent on courses across the spectrum.  We must be very careful that we do not end up in a situation where, for the sake of reform or streamlining, the educational element will be removed.  We must, therefore, proceed with caution.<\/p>  <p>  Like previous speakers, I welcome the common-sense approach adopted by the Minister yesterday to the issue of small rural schools.<\/p><p>It was a disgrace that the initial idea made it through the Cabinet in the first instance.  It was a deplorable proposal which showed a degree of blindness and was clearly driven by a Dublin-centred agenda.  The Minister has taken the correct decision, which will be good for rural communities, but more action is needed in this area. <\/p> <p>  To return to my main point, for far too long a tiny percentage of teachers have not been pulling their weight.  However, teachers have described the proposal to deal with teachers about whom issues are raised as akin to a public flogging.  The Minister must be very careful in this regard.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, referred to paralysis in the Civil Service and the tendency among civil servants to take the safe option.  This will become an issue in the teaching profession.  Previous speakers referred to innovative teachers.  I had many teachers who pushed the boundaries in what pupils could achieve.  It is vital that we empower such teachers and avoid a scenario where they will have to look over their shoulders as they wonder whether they will be hauled before the Teaching Council for failing to dot an \"i\" or cross a \"t\".  I ask the Minister to reconsider her proposal in this regard because I have serious concerns about it. <\/p> <p> I also have an issue with reform for reform's sake in the adult education sector.  It is vital that the educational aspect of the sector be maintained and not be lumped in with training.  Adult education should continue to be the responsibility of the education and training boards.  I ask the Minister to address this issue. <\/p> <p> It is wrong that the Minister has established a system for carrying out what one could describe as public floggings.  It is difficult enough to attract people to the teaching profession and teachers view her proposal with scepticism.  Many fine teachers in primary and secondary schools show great commitment to education.  Last night pre-school teachers protested outside the gates.  They also do great work in educating the next generation and empowering young people to develop their talents and use them to serve society.  We do not need another sector of society looking over its shoulder.  We have become too politically correct in establishing systems to ensure every \"i\" is dotted and every \"t\" crossed.  This approach lends itself to paralysis in the system.  We need to have people who are willing to be innovative in their sphere.  <\/p> <p> I am grateful to have had the opportunity to speak about the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800044#SS00200","speaker":"987","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424276400,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I thank all of the Deputies who contributed to the debate, in particular, the Opposition spokespersons for their support for the legislation.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien thanked the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for the very good summary of the Bill it had provided.  I, too, thank the service for its work on the Bill.  We do not always acknowledge its work in assisting our discussions on legislation.<br\/><br\/>I agree with speakers on all sides who pointed out that the vast majority of teachers did a very good job.  For a long time, however, there has been a general view inside and outside the teaching profession that a process that enjoys public confidence should be in place to deal with cases in which questions arise about whether a teacher is providing an adequate education for young people.  For this reason I introduced a section on fitness to teach.  Deputy Jim Daly summed up the issue well when he pointed out that children only got one chance at education.  While Deputy Michael Moynihan noted that some adults returned to education, it is extremely important that children have the best possible teachers.  Deputy John Paul Phelan also referred to the influence of very good teachers.<br\/><br\/>No one questions the need to have a system in place to allow for the removal of teachers who are not performing.  The holding in public of fitness to teach hearings will be the default position.  This issue generated considerable discussion, although it is not addressed in the Bill, as published.  I will table an amendment to provide for public hearings.  This will give Deputies an opportunity to tease out the issue on Committee Stage.  As Deputy Jonathan O'Brien noted, such hearings are held in public in other jurisdictions, including Scotland and Wales, and in other professions.  Public hearings are held, by and large, to ensure there is public confidence in the hearings system.  This will be the default position, which means that the Teaching Council may decide that it would not be appropriate for a hearing to be held in public for reasons of confidentiality or to protect a person's reputation.  I intend to table an amendment to provide that public hearings will be the default position.  I will do so because public hearings will instil public confidence in the system and protect professionals in giving people access to information.  <br\/><br\/>As I stated in my previous contribution, a threshold must be reached before an investigation committee refers a case to the next stage in the process.  The committee must be of the opinion that there is a <i>prima facie <\/i>case to warrant further action.  This will ensure only cases that merit a disciplinary inquiry and hearing will be progressed to that stage.  The committee will establish whether a complaint is frivolous or justifies a hearing and if it considers that a complaint is without substance, it may decide not to refer it for a disciplinary inquiry or hearing.  This will provide protection in cases in which a hearing is not appropriate.We will tease out on Committee Stage the concerns expressed about public hearings.<br\/><br\/>Concerns were expressed about the number of vetting applications that had been completed.  To clarify the issue, the number of teachers on the register is steadily increasing.  Approximately 54,000 of 90,000 teachers are on the register, which amounts to almost 60%, rather than 40%, of the total.  The Bill has been designed to place the vetting process on a statutory footing and will result in teachers being vetted.  As Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor stated, one of the advantages of the process is that a teacher will not have to be vetted every time he or she moves school because the Teaching Council will hold the vetting documentation.  This is a positive development. <br\/><br\/>Deputy Ruth Coppinger who is no longer present referred to security of tenure for teachers.  I received a report from an expert group led by Mr. Peter Ward, SC, which specifically examined the issue of improving tenure for teachers and giving them tenure at an earlier stage than was the case.  The report also addressed the need for teachers to have certainty that they would have a minimum number of teaching hours.  I received Mr. Ward's report a couple of months ago and I am working on the implementation of its recommendations.  It specifically addresses the issue raised by the Deputy. <br\/><br\/>Deputy Jonathan O'Brien referred to cases involving teachers who had been convicted of offences, etc.<\/p><p>It is only where the complaints relate to fitness to teach that they will be considered under this legislation.  In other words, unless there is a fitness to teach issue in terms of their conviction, it will not be relevant to the Bill.<\/p> <p> The Deputy also raised the issue of the vetting of SNAs but the vetting of people other than teachers is covered by the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012 and will not be dealt with under this legislation.  However, it is intended that this issue will be addressed.<\/p> <p> I have covered the issues that were raised relating to the Bill.  I acknowledge Members have raised other education issues, as always happens whenever an education Bill is taken, but I will only respond to the issues relating to this Bill.<\/p> <p> We will tease out on Committee Stage the issue around public hearings.  The Bill will make a significant contribution to safeguarding children in schools and upholding the high standards of teaching that students and society expect and deserve.  I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800045#TT00200","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1424277000,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Teaching Council (Amendment) Bill 2015: Referral to Select Committee","time":1424277000,"counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800046#UU00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1424277000,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select sub-Committee on Education and Skills pursuant to Standing Order 82A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and (6)(<i>a<\/i>) and 126(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021800046#UU00400","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1424277000,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1424277000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.45 p.m. and resumed at 7.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
